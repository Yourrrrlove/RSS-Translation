At the top of the mountain, there is a flat area. On the flat side, I saw that long-known plant. It is not eye-catching, slightly similar to the common broom grass in Sichuan, but shorter; it is also a bit like orchid grass, but with thinner leaves. It has not yet reached the flowering period, and there is no purple-red color like the clouds in the picture. If you look closely, it does look like a toothbrush. No wonder it is called toothbrush grass among the people. In fact, its scientific name is Haizhou Xiangnuo, and its other name is more widely known: Copper Grass Flower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine how excited the ancestors who were looking for it were when they saw the coppergrass flowers all over the mountains and plains on this gentle hillside three thousand years ago. They were even ecstatic with excitement. Because the copper grass flower is a symbol of an important metal - wherever it grows, deep in the earth, there must be copper mines...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/5ofLItqyHH0Tl7WRalCsMJW6VkUfNdzcaSj4GY5C.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/10/28/5ofLItqyHH0Tl7WRalCsMJW6VkUfNdzcaSj4GY5C.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213168&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonglushan ancient copper mine site is located in Three kilometers west of Daye City, Hubei Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Gifts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The banquet was over, and King Chu Cheng gave it to those who came to see him Zheng Wengong gave a generous gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This generous gift is estimated to be worth about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan based on today&#39;s market price. However, in the distant Spring and Autumn Period, its value could not be measured in terms of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is copper. When Zheng Wengong returned to Zheng State with a thousand kilograms of copper, King Chu Cheng regretted it more and more. He sent an envoy to catch up with Zheng Wengong - he must have wanted to take back the copper, but doing so would not only offend Zheng State, but also make people in the world joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Chu Cheng’s regret had very clear practical considerations. In the pre-Qin period, the ancients classified the major affairs of the country into two things, namely &quot;the major affairs of the country are sacrifice and military affairs&quot; as stated in &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. Although the original meaning of &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; refers to sacrificial rituals and military rituals, later generations further extended it and believed that the most important things in the country were sacrifices and wars. Both sacrifices and wars are inseparable from copper - sacrifices require a large number of bronze vessels to be cast; as for wars, copper is a necessity for making weapons. Compared with the stone, bone and wooden weapons of the Stone Age, copper weapons are invincible and have unparalleled superiority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bronze originated in the Longshan Culture period. The Xia Dynasty began to enter the Bronze Age, while the Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty reached the peak of bronze civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called bronze is an alloy of copper and tin or lead. It was called gold and lucky gold in ancient China. Among the chemical elements that make up bronze, the most important is copper, which accounts for more than 80%. Without copper, there would be no bronze; without bronze, there would be no bronze civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For King Chu Cheng, his regret was not about the thousand catties of copper. Copper, he had plenty of it. He was worried that Zheng Guo would take the copper back to make weapons. Therefore, he asked Zheng Wengong to promise that the copper donated by the Chu State could only be used for ritual vessels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the origins of Chu State, it was once so humble that it could be ignored. In terms of level, among male princes, Bozi belongs to the fourth level: Zi. Regarding the initial land enfeoffment, it was only fifty miles away. There is a story that illustrates the weakness of the Chu people when they founded the country: After Xiong Yi was named the son of Chu, he built a temple. After the temple was completed and the first sacrifice was about to be held, it was discovered that they were so poor that they didn&#39;t even have a sacrificial cow. This &quot;country&quot; is so big, but it can&#39;t even produce a single cow, which shows how small and shabby this &quot;country&quot; is. Out of poverty, Xiong Yi took people to the neighboring country of Bo to steal a calf. After the calf was stolen back, Xiong Yi was afraid that the owner would come to visit him, so he had to kill the calf overnight to sacrifice it - and the rules at that time were that sacrifices were held during the day. Since then, the Chu people have formed a unique custom: all sacrifices are held at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like a trickle of water can gather into a mighty river, as long as enough time is given, a miracle may be born. For the Chu State, if it was like an unobtrusive flame in the wind when it was founded, then, after hundreds of years of continuous development, by the time of Xiong Tong, the son of Chu in the early Spring and Autumn Period, the Chu State had risen. Become an important presence among the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 704 BC, which was the thirty-seventh year of Xiong Tong&#39;s reign, he sent his followers to ask the Emperor of Zhou to promote him to a noble title. However, Emperor Zhou flatly refused. Xiong Tong was furious and proclaimed himself king, calling him King Wu of Chu. Although the Emperor of Zhou has lost his former authority since King Ping of Zhou moved eastward, the princes who dared to brag against the disapproval of the world and claim the title of king began with Xiong Tong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiong Tong dared to fight against the Emperor Zhou. On the one hand, due to the hard work of more than ten generations, the Chu State was no longer the small country with a lot of obstacles; on the other hand, after many years of hard work, the Chu people gradually controlled One of the most important strategic materials has the material basis to challenge Emperor Zhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is copper, copper from the Coppergreen Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/HnrOGxJiZOSdrgXR10zG7Zpr8MN4jXcLRwGTIToa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/HnrOGxJiZOSdrgXR10zG7Zpr8MN4jXcLRwGTIToa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Azurite mine in Tonglu Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the northeast To the southwest, after crossing the Yangtze River via the Qijia Expressway, it enters Huangshi City, Hubei Province. To the north of the highway, there is a lake of tens of square kilometers, which is Daye Lake connected to the Yangtze River. The westernmost end of Daye Lake is Daye under the jurisdiction of Huangshi. Heading west out of Daye, the road twists and turns, passing through undulating low mountainous areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonglu Mountain is hidden deep in this low mountainous area. The &quot;Daye County Chronicle&quot; published by Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty explained the origin of the name Tonglu Mountain: &quot;The top of the mountain is high and flat, with huge rocks facing each other. Every time it rains, there are bronze greens like snowflakes and adzuki beans dotted on the earth and rocks. Hence the name. It stretches for several years. Zhang, the soil color is purple and red, and they are all Guanshan. It may be the place where copper was produced in ancient times.&quot; This green snowflake adzuki bean is actually malachite, which is a copper-containing carbonate mineral that is often associated with copper. The large amount of malachite washed out of the surface after a shower shows that the copper mine in Tonglushan is shallowly buried and of high grade, making it a rare rich mine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as China is concerned, copper resources are widely distributed and relatively concentrated. In general, the main copper mines are in the south. There is a rich copper ore belt in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River - from Tonglu Mountain to Ruichang, more than 100 kilometers away, and to Tongling, more than 300 kilometers away, there are dots of large copper mines, with reserves accounting for one-third of the country. Two or more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of Chu State was also invincible due to the blessing of Tonglu Mountain. As the first metal mastered by human beings, a steady stream of high-grade copper ore is put into burning furnaces to smelt out massive amounts of copper, which is then combined with tin or lead to be upgraded to bronze - ritual vessels cast in bronze, lingering in the smoke. The temples made of bronze became a bridge between the Chu people and their ancestors and gods; the agricultural tools made of bronze allowed the vast land in the south to be reclaimed, and more food was enough to feed a larger population; the weapons made of bronze accompanied the Chu people who were brave and good at fighting. Charge into battle, expand territory...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conquest&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from Tonglu Mountain, a three-hour drive, nearly 300 kilometers away to the northwest is Suizhou City, Hubei Province. In Suizhou, the sensational tomb of Zeng Houyi was discovered. The most important cultural relic unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Houyi is now stored in the Hubei Provincial Museum, which is the bronze chime that can still play beautiful music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Hou is the king of Zeng State; and Zeng State is another name for Sui State, which was enfeoffed by Zhou Dynasty. Thousands of cultural relics were unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, among which the total weight of bronze products exceeds ten tons - the bronze chime alone weighs four tons. So much copper, where does it come from? In the past few years, professionals used chemical and spectral analysis on Zeng Houyi&#39;s chime bell, and compared it with the copper mine data unearthed from the Tonglushan archeology, and concluded that the copper material of Zenghou Yi&#39;s chime bell came from Tonglushan. ——Using the same method, it was also proved that the raw materials of the bronzes unearthed from Fuhao&#39;s tomb in Yinxu, Anyang, also came from Tonglu Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/BUDkuuqJntNhn6I4gZ4OhMcUTYdeKFDanhoC1Wnb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/BUDkuuqJntNhn6I4gZ4OhMcUTYdeKFDanhoC1Wnb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zeng Houyi Bronze Chime Bell&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These conclusions are actually Within reason. Not only did the large amount of copper material in the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi come from the Tonglu Mountain, but even when the Emperor of Zhou was enfeoffed to follow the country, a very important reason was for copper. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, there was a busy and important copper-tin road in the hinterland of China. That is what the bronze inscriptions call &quot;the path of gold and tin&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the National Museum of China, there is a bronze vessel named Zeng Boyun. The 簠 is a utensil used to serve rice during sacrifices or banquets. It is also called the 簋, the square one is called 簠 and the round one is called 簋. Zeng Boyun was used by the king of Zeng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sui&lt;/span>;). The inscription on it contains the following sentences: &quot;...Kedi Huaiyi, suppress the Xiefan Tang, move the golden road and tin, and use all the tools to prepare the way.&quot; It means: (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeng Bo&lt;/span>;) punish the Huaiyi , the transportation hub Fantang and the copper and tin channels have been stabilized and have returned to normal. This is the origin of Jindaoxixing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shang Dynasty moved its capital many times, but generally speaking, they were all in today&#39;s Central Plains region; the Western Zhou Dynasty made its capital Haojing, now Xi&#39;an; the Eastern Zhou Dynasty moved its capital to Luoyi, now Luoyang. During the heyday of the Bronze Age, the demand for copper and supporting tin for thousands of years during the Shang and Zhou dynasties was undoubtedly astronomical. In the vast north or the Yellow River Basin, only Zhongtiao Mountain and other places had copper mines, but the output was small. . The copper and tin needed by the Shang and Zhou Dynasties could only be transported thousands of miles from the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general route of the Jindao Tin Line, which mainly transports copper and tin, is as follows: Hunan&#39;s tin and Tonglu Mountains and northern Jiangxi&#39;s copper, after being collected in the present-day Wuhan area, arrive in Suizhou via Xiaogan, along the Suizao Corridor. It entered the Nanyang Basin, then passed through present-day Fangcheng and Ye County to Luoyang, or continued westward to Guanzhong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an extremely difficult transportation line. Two or three thousand years ago, when roads and railways were scarce and there were only rugged trails, the ancients could only rely on animals and manpower in addition to ships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long transportation lines mean more risks and more uncertainties. Especially when the transported items are copper that determines the fate of the country, the risks increase sharply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ensure the smooth transportation of copper and tin from Tonglu Mountain and other places to the capital, Emperor Zhou enfeoffed more than a dozen small countries in important areas north of the Han River and south of the upper reaches of the Huai River. Most of these small countries have the surname Ji, or are related to the surname Ji, so they are called the Ji of Hanyang. The concubines of Hanyang had two tasks. One was to guard against Huaiyi in the south; the other was to ensure the smooth flow of the copper and tin road. After the decline of Huaiyi and the rise of Chu, the first task of Zhu Ji changed from guarding against Huaiyi to guarding against Chu. However, things are unpredictable. Not only did the concubines of Hanyang fail to curb Chu&#39;s northward and eastward advance, but even the copper-tin road they guaranteed and even the Tonglu Mountain that produced copper mines fell into the hands of the Chu people. In the end, &quot;Hanyang&quot; All concubines, the state of Chu is complete.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The countries established by the concubines of Hanyang are dotted in the intersection of north and south China, including Tang, Cai, Ying, Xi, Shen, Sui, etc. Among the concubines, Sui Guo is the most powerful and is the leader of them all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanyang Basin and Jianghan Plain are separated by a series of low and gentle mountains. Among them, there is a long and narrow plain between Dahong Mountain and Tongbai Mountain, both running northwest to southeast, which becomes the link between Nanyang Basin and Jianghan Plain. traffic channels between. This tunnel is bounded by Suizhou in the south and Zaoyang in the north, so it is called the Suizao Corridor. As the eldest among the concubines in Hanyang, Sui Guo follows the gateway of the Zao Corridor and connects to the Yangtze River through the Jianshui River. Copper from Tonglu Mountain and more distant places such as Ruichang and Tongling can be traced up the river, passing through the Sui Zao Corridor and then north. Transport to the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/27/0db5OdAetgUKAOX0yDkVnWKje30RWBDgAHTMIkrd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1331&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/27/0db5OdAetgUKAOX0yDkVnWKje30RWBDgAHTMIkrd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war between the Chu State and the Chu State for the Tonglu Mountain was The era of King Wu kicked off; the main target of the war was Sui Guo - before this, King Wu of Chu annexed Quan State and established counties on Quan State&#39;s territory, which was the beginning of China&#39;s county system. At this time, the power of the Chu State penetrated deep into the Jianghan Plain, and the fertile Jianghan Plain was being eroded bit by bit by the Chu people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the set goal, King Chu Wu showed great patience - he has been waiting, looking for opportunities while waiting - King Chu Wu waited from his middle age until his twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 706 BC, Sui suffered from a drought, resulting in a massive reduction in grain production and a lack of food for the soldiers and civilians. King Wu of Chu took the opportunity to attack Sui. The Chu army came to the city, and the princes knew that they were no match, so they had to send people to King Wu of Chu to ask for peace. King Wu of Chu accepted the peace talks, and one of the conditions was that he would ask the Emperor of Zhou to be promoted to the title of Chu Kingdom. The first expedition against Sui and the establishment of an alliance under the city with the country meant that the Chu people had already gotten involved in the road of copper and tin, and from then on they could obtain a steady stream of high-quality copper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, Sui, who had an alliance with Chu, refused to attend the alliance led by Chu. King Chu Wu used this as an excuse to attack Sui for the second time. This time, the Chu army was defeated and the Sui army fled. Even the chariot was captured by the Chu army. Also in this year, Suihou informed King Wu of Chu that the Emperor of Zhou refused to promote him to the title. Therefore, King Wu of Chu became angry and proclaimed himself king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next three years, Chu defeated a series of countries including Yun, Jiu, Zhou, Deng and Liao. These countries either became vassals of Chu or had to fight with Chu. Make an alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 699 BC, when attacking Luo State, Chu State general Qu Xia was conceited and underestimated the enemy. He was defeated by the coalition forces of Luo State and Lu State. Qu Xia committed suicide. ——Since then, the Chu State has formed an unwritten rule: any commander who leads troops to fight must commit suicide to apologize once he is defeated. This determination, soaked in the bones and blood of Chu people, was passed down to the last commander-in-chief, Xiang Yu, the overlord of Western Chu who would rather commit suicide than return to Jiangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Wu of Chu had to slow down the pace of his campaign. For the next eight years, King Wu of Chu did not raise any more troops to attack his followers. He concentrated his efforts and swept away Luo, Lu, Yan, Zhou and Liao, and firmly controlled the Jianghan Plain. It should be during this period that the Tonglu Mountain also belonged to the Chu State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When everything came to pass, King Wu of Chu attacked him for the third time. Because Suiguo is not only an important stronghold on the copper-tin road, but also a springboard for Chu to fight for hegemony northward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the eve of the expedition, he felt heart discomfort during the sacrifice and knew that his days were numbered. Sure enough, when the Chu army crossed the Han River and King Wu of Chu was sitting under a sycamore tree by the roadside to rest, he could never stand up again - this king who advocated force and was determined to expand his territory died like this. On the journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of King Chu Wu, the Chu army continued to advance towards the capital of Sui without announcing the funeral. When Suihou saw the army approaching the border, he was frightened and sent people to sue for peace. From then on, Suiguo, who was originally loyal to the Emperor of Zhou and monitored the south for the Emperor of Zhou and guarded the copper and tin road, became a vassal of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of King Chu Wu, King Chu Wen came to the throne. The first thing King Wen of Chu did when he came to power was to move the capital from the remote Danyang to Ying. The Chu State had moved its capital many times. After the first move to Ying, the subsequent capitals were all called Ying or Yingdu. The place where King Wen of Chu moved to Ying is said to be Jingzhou or Yicheng. No matter who is right, the indisputable fact is that the power of Chu State has crossed the Han River from west to east. During the reign of King Chu Wen, he successively destroyed the State of Shen, Xi and Deng, repeatedly defeated the State of Cai, and made a northern expedition to the State of Zheng - this was also the beginning of the Chu State&#39;s quest to dominate the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After King Chu Wen, King Chu Cheng went to a higher level and successively annexed more than ten small countries such as Er, Gu, Huang, Ying, Jiang, and Fang. The State of Zheng, which borders the State of Chu, was on the fence between Jin and Chu. This is how Zheng Wengong went to see King Chu Cheng, and King Chu Cheng gave him a thousand catties of copper. However, King Chu Cheng was born at the wrong time - he met Duke Huan of Qi, the most powerful of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. In order to teach the Chu State a lesson, Qi Huangong led the coalition forces deep into the Chu territory. Although the two sides did not decide the winner, the Chu State had to admit its mistake to the coalition forces and recognize Qi State&#39;s dominance. By the time of King Chuzhuang, the grandson of King Chu Cheng, this soaring and blockbuster King of Chu defeated the northern superpower Jin, thus becoming one of the five hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The history of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period is a history of princes fighting against each other. In the merger of big fish eating small fish and small fish eating shrimps, small countries continued to disappear and big countries grew bigger like a snowball. Among the princes, the Chu State destroyed the most, with more than fifty people. At its peak, Chu State ranked first in territory, equivalent to the sum of other princes. It can be said that if it were not for the incompetence of several generations of Chu kings in the late Warring States Period, it would have been more likely to be the Chu State that wiped out the heroes, rather than the Qin State located in the northwest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the Chu people’s illustrious military exploits, Tonglu Mountain was the silent and lasting first driving force, creating the miracles of the Bronze Age. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ruins&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Tonglushan Ancient Copper Mine Ruins Museum is located on the hill where coppergrass flowers sway. There are few tourists, and the copper grass flowers are looking at themselves in the wind. On the other side of the hill, I saw a huge pit like a funnel embedded between the peaks. The pit sank hundreds of meters below the surface and was hundreds of meters in diameter. A road winding like a snake passed by a factory with thick smoke. Reaching into the pit, trucks crawled like beetles. This is the open-pit copper mine that is still being mined today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/9uJBUw2mJkQOkjCfGS5hm1oryhTPWo0UgpL6g2iZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1441&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/9uJBUw2mJkQOkjCfGS5hm1oryhTPWo0UgpL6g2iZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213166&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonglushan Open-pit Copper Mine&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1973, the It was while working in this open-pit mine that the miners of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Company dug out thirteen rusty copper axes from the ground. Later, using thirteen copper axes that had been dormant for thousands of years as clues, archaeologists followed the clues and unearthed seven open-pit mines, 18 underground mining areas, more than 50 ancient smelting sites and More than ten smelting shaft furnaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reappearance of ancient copper mines under the earth not only reveals the secret of the rise of Chu State, but also proves that Chinese bronze culture is not foreign, but originated from the mainland. Archaeological evidence shows that the mining of Tonglushan copper mines began in the late Shang Dynasty, and continued through the Western Zhou Dynasty, the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period to the Han Dynasty, which lasted for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the museum, large and small copper slags are displayed in glass cabinets - things that look either slightly yellow or slightly green. Archaeologists estimate that there are as many as 400,000 tons of copper slag in the entire Tonglushan site. Based on rough calculations based on copper slag, Tonglushan produces about 120,000 tons of copper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The figure of 120,000 tons is a bit empty. If you convert it, you will know how huge it is: the Shang Dynasty Stepmother Wu Ding unearthed in Anyang (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Simuwu Dafang Ding&lt;/span>;) is the heaviest bronze in China so far, weighing more than 800 kilograms. 120,000 tons can be used to cast 140,000 statues. Some people have made another calculation: the main equipment of soldiers in the Spring and Autumn Period was copper ge, each weighing about half a kilogram and 120,000 tons, enough to make 240 million pieces. Of course, not all of the 120,000 tons of copper from Tonglu Mountain is exclusively owned by the Chu State. However, in the mining history of more than a thousand years from the late Shang Dynasty to the Western Han Dynasty, Chu State accounted for about half of the mining time. This was the golden age of Tonglu Mountain. The Chu people obtained at least tens of thousands of tons of high-quality copper from the depths of Tonglu Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Zhuang of Chu aspired to conquer the Central Plains, he proudly said to Wang Sunman, a minister of Emperor Zhou, &quot;The beak of Chu&#39;s broken hook is enough to make nine tripods.&quot; This means that as long as the sharp edges of Chu&#39;s weapons are taken off, it will be enough to be melted into Jiuding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The massive amount of copper in Tonglu Mountain proves that King Chuzhuang was not exaggerating at all. His Chu country, whether it is the civil governance of the alliance princes or the martial arts of conquering cities and territories; whether it is the stubborn and domineering character of the Chu people or the Chu music of Hong Zhongda Lu; whether it is the gloomy Chu Feng that respects ghosts or the soul-stirring Chu Ci—— They are all based on copper, with copper as their bones, and with copper as their foundation...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10 /28/TngRunAON2E2ufuol8qlegxPuW9w8r9SziHNBJWV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/TngRunAON2E2ufuol8qlegxPuW9w8r9SziHNBJWV. jpeg &quot; data-key=&quot;213164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Viewers look at the early Spring and Autumn shaft furnace model unearthed from Tonglu Mountain in the National Museum of China. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tonglu Mountain, those long-standing mines go deep underground and extend in all directions like a maze. Some of the wood that was laid down two to three thousand years ago to support the tunnels has not yet rotted. Walking cautiously in the restored mine, the tunnel is narrow and damp. I can&#39;t help but think of the Chu miners who worked all day long with a torch in the belly of the earth in Tonglu Mountain more than two thousand years ago. Whether they are swinging a heavy copper ax to hit the hard rock formation, or dragging a bamboo basket full of copper ore along the tunnel, the labor day after day and year after year makes them like worker bees dying. The power and glory of the Chu State, the hegemony of King Wu and King Wen, and the grand plans of King Cheng and Zhuang, they have contributed a lot, but history will not leave their names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Main reference books: &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Chu History&quot;, &quot;A Brief History of Chu State&quot;, &quot;Spring and Autumn History&quot; China&#39;s Pre-Qin Copper Mines&quot; &quot;Metallurgical Archeology&quot; &quot;Chinese Bronze&quot; &quot;Loess and Bronze&quot; &quot;Daye County Chronicles&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访陈冲：我没有强大的自信，只有强大的欲望]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257475]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 09/22/wZhQcinkVpws8y7jI3ZKp7XYc6l6VWrqUGmQWVtU.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1439&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/22/wZhQcinkVpws8y7jI3ZKp7XYc 6l6VWrqUGmQWVtU. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;209385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1981, Chen Chong studied film production in the United States and directed his first film in 1998 &quot;Heavenly Bath&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an actor, Chen Chong is well known, and as a director, Chen Chong is well known. few. Chen Chong is one of the three directors of the movie &quot;Her in the World&quot; to be released on September 9, 2022, the other two are Sylvia Chang and Li Shaohong. The film tells an emotional story under difficult circumstances, involving mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, couples and lovers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, Chen Chong received a call from producer Dong Wenjie, hoping to invite several well-known female directors to jointly shoot a movie. She finally decided to tell the story of a pair of lovers separated in two places, &quot;to explore the closest expression of the oldest theme of love.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like all previous works she directed, Chen Chong wrote the script herself. She repeatedly looked at the real photos taken by her colleagues. There was a supermarket scene in the movie, so she found many supermarket CCTVs and watched them, wanting to know details such as the denseness of the crowds. The script was originally written to rain, and the rendering of rain was used to increase the atmosphere, but later she learned that there was no rain in reality on the day set in the movie, so she removed this setting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Without the rain, wouldn&#39;t the story have happened? Wouldn&#39;t the feelings be conveyed? So, whether there is rain or not is not important, but whether there is the conveyance of emotions is important.&quot; She said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her in the World&quot; was originally scheduled to be released on the May Day holiday in 2021, but was later postponed to the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2022. During the editing of the film, a Southern Weekend staff writer interviewed Chen Chong in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Love and loss are eternal&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;The setting of this movie sounds a bit like Love in the Time of Cholera. When you were approaching this story, did you have a clear setting from the beginning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After receiving the invitation from the producer, I searched online for a week and finally found this story about lovers who were exiled in two places. Touched me. The girl returned to Beijing to visit her parents during the Spring Festival, but she has not been able to see her boyfriend who was locked down in Wuhan since then. This melody of love, loss, and exile resonated with me—I too am unable to travel home to visit my elderly parents due to the pandemic. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For lovers who are blocked in two cities, the mobile phone screen is something that arouses their infinite desire and is warmer than real life. In fact, this is also the relationship between most people and their mobile phones. Especially during the epidemic, people’s interactions with others and their understanding of the world come from mobile phones. The contradictions and conflicts in human nature also come from people&#39;s different interpretations of online messages. We all seem to be living on isolated islands in our mobile phones. The more attractive &quot;reality&quot; on the screen seems more &quot;real&quot; than life itself. The themes of love and loss, life and death are ancient and timeless, and my challenge was to give it a new screen narrative for today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever considered adding a paragraph about their love history? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Absolutely no flashbacks. This story is that these two people are always in different frames, and they want you to be deeply moved by them. These are the rules I set for myself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the era of the epidemic, two people can only use mobile phones What love words can a lover say during a video call? What excites you about the process of writing a screenplay? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Their conversations are actually very simple conversations, the most daily and common conversations. My husband and I often do this too. Video communication. These two people are in love. They video chat when they wake up in the morning, before going to bed at night, and while cooking and brushing teeth. They chat casually in separate places, but it makes people feel the joy and love of two people together. , this is my excitement point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the emotional tone expressed in this story? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a story about true love. If a person can love like this once, he is very lucky. Not everyone can love like this. Because he has had real happiness, and the sadness of loss is sublimated into the beauty in the black mirror. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people in the world are actually not satisfied with love in their hearts. So I believe it, but the desire and demand for love still seems very strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After we finished filming, several of the main creators climbed Xiangshan Mountain. After climbing to the top, they saw many people writing blessing signs. . I said let’s hang one too, and we wrote our blessings for the movie and hung it there. I looked through it carefully, and there were hundreds of tags, and there were countless love words in them. They were all &quot;So-and-so loves so-and-so&quot; and &quot;So-and-so will be with so-and-so forever.&quot; More than half of them, you can Did you say that love is gone? impossible. When you fall in love, can you stop yourself? Even this bit of vitality is gone, and your life has been in vain. This thing is different from desire. It is really a gift from God to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Princess Sissi is the Empress of Austria.

I don’t know how the paradox in life is formed. Is love the greatest value of happiness in life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, this is a gift. You don’t need to be good enough or work hard. You don’t need to do your homework. You don’t need to move bricks. You don&#39;t need anything, it will come to you. Maybe love won&#39;t be important in the future, I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t imagine it. Why refuse such a gift?

We met in college, have been in love for four years, and are about to get married. He is the happiest young man after graduating from college. period. The simplest dream of having this simple college sweetheart is to get married, the girl can wear a wedding dress, and the boy can put a ring on her.

There is no need to make sense, and there is no reason to make love. It’s not that you think this person is a good match for this person, that has nothing to do with it.

In fact, film is an apprenticeship, and film school comes later. When the movie first started, everyone was learning on the spot, apprentice-style. The kind of learning from a master should be more useful. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You directed the first film &quot;Tianba&quot; When you were young, you cut it yourself.

I&#39;ve seen it, but it&#39;s quite unbearable. I actually have a very sensitive radar. I can see the clues of my own dishonesty. Maybe others can’t see it, but I can definitely see it. So watching your own movies is not an easy task. Movies are not an actor&#39;s tool, but a director&#39;s tool, so you are a pawn in it. If you see your own problems, it does not affect your feeling that the movie is pretty good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The films you directed are all because of yourself Do you have the desire to create, or do you have to find funds or outside sources? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Both. If funds come to me and I don’t have the desire, I will definitely not go.

She was once ranked second in the world&#39;s women&#39;s tennis singles rankings, with a total career record of 503 wins and 188 losses. When she retired, she was ranked sixth in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Na&#39;s retirement has left an insurmountable peak and a huge vacuum for Chinese women&#39;s tennis. She has retired for more than nine years. At least so far, there has not been a player in Chinese women&#39;s tennis who can surpass her or even be on par with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, when Li Na lifted her first Suzanne Langland Cup at Roland Garros in Paris, 9-year-old Zheng Qinwen was receiving tennis training in Wuhan under Li Na’s former coach Teacher Yu Liqiao. In her memory, it seemed that people all over the country were paying attention to Li Na&#39;s game that day. &quot;Li Na&#39;s victory planted a dream in me. One day I will also win a Grand Slam.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was the third year that Zheng Qinwen officially started tennis training. In 2008, Zheng Qinwen&#39;s father took her to Beijing to watch the tennis match at the Olympic Games. Zheng Qinwen thought quietly. After the game, she and her father repeatedly discussed the details on the court and told her father that she was very interested in tennis. His father was once an athlete. He took Zheng Qinwen to play table tennis, badminton, basketball, and volleyball... His daughter was able to get started, but she was not outstanding. This time, he decided to let Zheng Qin play tennis.

Before the start of Wimbledon, Zheng Qinwen changed coaches, replacing Spanish coach Riba with famous Belgian coach Wim Fiset, who has coached Naomi Osaka, Azarenka and other famous players. However, the grass court season was still hard for her to win, and Wimbledon ended with a first-round trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;Although I didn&#39;t play well in the grass-court season, I don&#39;t think my (strength) will decline.

This is Alibaba The first spin-off and listed business after launching the &quot;1+6+n&quot; organizational reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prospectus disclosed that Cainiao achieved 20% revenue in the fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023, as well as in the three months from March 30 to June 30, 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the most recent quarter). Revenue was 52.733 billion yuan, 66.867 billion yuan, 77.8 billion yuan and 23.164 billion yuan, and net profits were -1.688 billion yuan, -2.004 billion yuan, -2.325 billion yuan and 391 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, its cumulative losses in the three full fiscal years before listing exceeded 6 billion yuan, and it only turned a profit in the most recent quarter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cainiao’s current business mainly includes three major sectors: international logistics, domestic logistics, technology and other services. From fiscal year 2021 to 2023 (ending March 30) and the most recent quarter, its international logistics revenue accounted for 55.1%, 52.3%, 47.4%, and 48.1% respectively, which are all higher than domestic logistics revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Alibaba Group, Yintai Group, Fosun Group, Fuchun Group and other Zhejiang capital circle tycoons, together with domestic express logistics companies SF Express and &quot;Three Communications and One Express&quot; jointly established Cainiao . At that time, Shen Guojun, the founder of Yintai Group, was the CEO of Cainiao Network. However, just one year later, Shen stepped down as CEO and became vice chairman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Current CEO Wan Lin joined Cainiao in 2014. Previously, he served as a senior manager of Amazon’s global logistics department. In 2017, Wan Lin officially took charge of Cainiao and made Cainiao one of Alibaba&#39;s fastest-growing business segments. Thanks to this, Wan Lin appears on Alibaba’s latest list of partners disclosed in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Betting on the international market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Also in 2017, Cainiao’s overseas logistics ambitions began to emerge. This year, Cainiao launched its first e-Hub plan (comprehensive e-commerce logistics hub) in Kuala Lumpur, which became the gateway to the Southeast Asian e-commerce market. It mainly provides express delivery services for cross-border merchants on AliExpress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of June 30, 2023, Cainiao has established two logistics hubs with an area of ​​over 15,000 square meters around the world, located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Liège, Belgium. It is expected to build a third logistics hub in Hong Kong hub. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cainiao’s performance in cross-border logistics services is inseparable from Alibaba’s cross-border e-commerce AliExpress. AliExpress was established in 2010 and is known as the international version of &quot;Taobao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cross-border e-commerce practitioner in the women&#39;s clothing industry told Southern Weekend reporters that the platforms available on the market include Amazon, AliExpress, Shopee, Dunhuang, and E-bay. Due to their low cost, , early cross-border e-commerce entrepreneurs tend to choose AliExpress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amazon has the fastest transportation speed due to its large number of overseas warehouses. The goods can arrive in major European and American countries in about a week, while in remote areas it takes half a month to a month. &quot;After the express arrives at the local area, it still chooses to cooperate with the local post office, and the delivery time is determined by the local post office.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cainiao provides express services to AliExpress merchants in the form of third-party services. &quot;For example, Di Sifang is owned by Cainiao express delivery company,&quot; she said. Tianyancha shows that Cainiao Network holds 45% of the shares in Shenzhen Di Sifang Information Technology Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the prospectus, in 2022, Cainiao’s international logistics service revenue will increase by 20% compared with the previous year, and the most recent quarter increased by 41% compared with the same period last year. The main reason is AliExpress’s cross-border express service Significant growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to serving the e-commerce platform within the Alibaba ecosystem, Cainiao has also established local logistics services in Hong Kong and some overseas markets such as Spain, France, Poland and other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chishi Consulting data cited in the prospectus mentioned that the compound annual growth rate of cross-border e-commerce logistics from 2018 to 2022 will exceed that of China. In particular, China’s cross-border e-commerce far exceeds cross-border e-commerce in other regions. business. Europe and the United States are expected to become the main destinations for cross-border e-commerce products from China. In addition, Southeast Asia and Latin America are also expected to grow rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhuoshi Consulting, in 2022, Cainiao will become the world&#39;s largest cross-border e-commerce logistics company by package volume. Among the top five, there are two Chinese companies, Cainiao and EMS (China Postal Express Logistics), and the remaining three companies are from Germany, France and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the international market, Cainiao will also face challenges from SF Express and Jitu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jitu, which was just listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on September 15, has also set its sights on the global market. Jitu is a logistics company born in Indonesia. As of 2022, its express delivery services cover 13 countries, with the highest market share in Southeast Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, SF Express announced that it would go public in Hong Kong for a secondary listing. Before the news was released, SF Express made a large-scale acquisition of 10 subsidiaries of Kerry Logistics that engage in express delivery services in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to previous media reports, since 2019, SF Express has been making continuous progress in overseas expansion, and has successively invested in Flexport, a US freight logistics service provider, and 100% equity interests in two companies, DHL Hong Kong and DHL Beijing, owned by the German DHL company. Myanmar logistics company KOSPA Limited has also established a joint venture with Indonesian Triputra Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Build the world&#39;s largest logistics network&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; According to the Cainiao prospectus, the gross profit margin in the latest quarter has increased compared with the same period in 2022, rising from 10.6%. to 13.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Its operating costs mainly include contract fulfillment costs (transportation routes, distribution, warehousing processing and other procurement and management services, that is, third-party services) and labor costs. Labor costs include employee welfare expenses and outsourced labor services, which basically account for about 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its prospectus, Cainiao used &quot;the price of a cup of coffee to be sent around the world&quot; to evaluate the solutions it provides in cross-border logistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cross-border e-commerce practitioner told Southern Weekend reporters that the price of sending a T-shirt is 20 to 30 yuan, which is almost the same as China Post, but compared with foreign logistics companies Lower cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being cheap, the logistics solution provided by Cainiao for AliExpress merchants has also shortened the delivery time from one or two months to ten days, and some international express products only take five days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day that Cainiao submitted its IPO report, AliExpress and Cainiao launched the &quot;Global Five-Day Delivery&quot; international express product, with the first batch landing in the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. In other words, consumers in these five countries can receive packages from China in just five days as long as they order products with the &quot;five-day delivery&quot; logo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned practitioners said that five-day delivery of goods requires merchants to provide package online information within 48 hours of the customer placing an order. If your Internet access rate reaches the standard, you can apply to join Five-Day Delivery, and the platform will automatically allow merchants to join. It is not difficult for merchants to achieve Internet access rates. Usually after a link is created, they will stock up on some goods. Buyers can send out orders as soon as they place an order, and rookies will come to collect goods every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to reduce costs and increase transportation speed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prospectus quoted information from Chishi Consulting. Cainiao has established the largest logistics network in the world, including two logistics hub centers of over 15,000 square meters, more than 1,100 warehouses and more than 380 warehouses. Sorting center. In June 2023, there will be an average of about 170 charter flights and board flights per week, more than 2,700 transportation routes, more than 4,400 outlets and more than 17,000 stations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology also plays a role. For example, artificial intelligence AI algorithms can improve sorting accuracy, improve inventory management, optimize route planning and vehicle scheduling, etc. In terms of smart hardware, there are RFID, smart IoT devices, automation and self-driving technologies, including AVG (automated warehousing technology) and the electric unmanned delivery vehicle &quot;Little Man Donkey&quot;. At the same time, it also provides a digital supply chain to facilitate monitoring, identifying problems, and improving efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, the autonomous driving business of Alibaba Damo Academy was merged into Cainiao Group, and some personnel were transferred to Cainiao. That is to say, both &quot;Damanlu&quot; (self-driving truck) and &quot;Xiaomanlu&quot; Return to rookie. According to the prospectus, as of March 30, 2023, more than 800 Xiaoman Donkeys have been put into use, delivering more than 10 million packages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/NzgzSpXJJwKMnxPPEpFsrvXwbWv21GI7T4uovkjt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/NzgzSpXJJwKMnxPPEpFsrvXwbWv21GI7T4uovkjt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252756&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cainiao Global Headquarters. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cannot live without Alibaba&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before IPO , Cainiao has gone through three rounds of equity financing. Alibaba Group holds a total of 69.54% of Cainiao&#39;s shares through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Ali CN Investment, Ali KB&amp;nbsp;Investment, and Alibaba International. Currently, Cainiao is still a subsidiary of Alibaba Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cainiao disclosed in detail its inextricable ties with Alibaba in its prospectus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba is Cainiao’s largest customer. From fiscal year 2021 to 2023 and the most recent quarter, revenue from Alibaba accounted for 29.2%, 30.8%, 28.2%, and 29.7% of total revenue respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cainiao provides logistics services for multiple e-commerce platforms such as Tmall, Taobao, and AliExpress under the Alibaba ecosystem. After 2021, Cainiao will also serve merchants on well-known international e-commerce platforms and online channels (such as Kuaishou, etc.) outside the Alibaba system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prospectus also states that due to the strategic synergy between Cainiao and Alibaba, Cainiao’s ability to maintain its ecosystem with Alibaba, or the development of Alibaba’s ecosystem itself, will have an impact on Cainiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The existing resource cooperation between Cainiao and Alibaba Group was fixed in the form of signing a business cooperation framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Includes certain intellectual property rights related to certain software and technologies used by Alibaba and Cainiao in their respective business operations.

NASA has kept a low profile on this extremely complex and high-tech deep space exploration project and has not made any big publicity. But its mission originated nearly a quarter of a century ago, and the entire project is as weird, brain-burning, fantastic, and romantic as the science fiction film &quot;Star Trek.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1999, the NASA-funded Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research Group discovered the asteroid Bennu (Bennu, the sun god in ancient Egyptian mythology). Its equatorial diameter is about 500 meters, its orbit is between Venus and Mars, intersecting with the Earth&#39;s orbit, and its perigee is about 7.5 million kilometers. This quickly attracted the attention of the U.S. Planetary Defense Coordination Office, which classified it as a &quot;potentially hazardous object.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After continuous observation and research, scientists believe that &quot;Bennu&quot; is composed of carbon and other minerals. It existed at the beginning of the birth of the solar system and is likely to contain the original molecules that existed when life on earth first formed. Matter is indeed the precious “first-hand material” of the solar system. More importantly, after repeated and precise calculations, &quot;Bennu&quot; has a 1/2700 probability of hitting the earth between 2175 and 2199, making it a high-risk space target. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, NASA has formulated an exploration mission for this high-risk, high-value asteroid, which is called &quot;Origins, Spectral Interpretation (Solar System), Spectral Analysis, Resource Identification, Safety, and Regolith Exploration&quot; , Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer)&quot;, meaning:. This lengthy professional name is abbreviated as &quot;OSIRIS-Rex&quot;, borrowing from &quot;Osiris&quot;, the god of the underworld in ancient Egyptian mythology, and is abbreviated as &quot;Pluto&quot; in Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 8, 2016, the rocket carrying the &quot;Pluto&quot; probe took off. On December 31, 2018, the probe entered the orbit around Bennu, which is only 1.6-2.1 kilometers away. This is the first time that a human probe has successfully orbited a small celestial body with such a small size, mass, and gravity for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following more than a year, the &quot;Pluto&quot; made many fine orbit changes and conducted very detailed detection of asteroids at various altitudes. In key areas of investigation, the detector flyby height Even lowering it to only 250 meters from the surface of the asteroid requires extremely high flight control technology. The detector&#39;s PolyCam camera used 2155 photos to piece together its ultra-high-definition global image with a resolution of up to 5 cm/pixel. It is the highest-definition global image of an extraterrestrial object ever obtained by humans. Therefore, &quot;Bennu&quot; It has become one of the most well-understood asteroids in the solar system so far. In late 2018, detectors found traces of water on its surface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the orbiting survey is very detailed and precise, landing on the asteroid surface to sample is more difficult. NASA scientists found that the originally expected flat landing area with a diameter of about 50 meters turned out to be rocky. The possible landing area was only about 6 meters in diameter at most. Unexpected difficulty would damage the Pluto lander. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists responded urgently: they changed the original plan and developed an alternative navigation and positioning solution based on optical images - natural feature tracking technology, which can fly away with the gentle gesture of &quot;a dragonfly touching the water&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, 2020, the &quot;Pluto&quot; probe landed in the &quot;Nightingale&quot; sampling area. The sampling head with a diameter of 0.3 meters was in contact with the surface of the star for about 6 seconds, collecting the gravel and dust particles on the surface of the asteroid, and then ignited and left. The revised contingency plan was unusually successful: the detector collected about 250 grams of samples, far exceeding the originally planned 60-gram sample mission requirement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 28, 2020, the &quot;Pluto&quot; packaged the collected samples into the return capsule. On May 10, 2021, the probe set off to return to Earth orbit with precious asteroid samples, and on September 24, 2023, it accurately and successfully landed the return capsule at the Utah Desert Experiment Base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan announced by NASA: In the next two years, 25% of the samples will be sent to about 200 scientists from many countries for research. The remaining 75% of the samples will be sealed for decades, waiting for future scientific and technological progress and the emergence of more advanced new technologies and equipment, before the samples can be taken out in batches for research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wonderful thing is that the &quot;Pluto&quot; detection mission is not over. After ejecting the sample return capsule back to the earth, it will use the earth&#39;s &quot;gravitational slingshot effect&quot; to fly to another asteroid Apophis ( Apophis, the Egyptian god of destruction and chaos). Thereafter, the mission code name of &quot;Pluto&quot; will be changed to &quot;Apophis Explorer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Apophis&quot; is a smaller but more dangerous asteroid than &quot;Bennu&quot;, with a diameter of about 370 meters. In 2029, it will pass by the earth at a high speed about 32,000 kilometers away, which is closer than the geostationary satellite at a distance of 36,000 kilometers from the ground. There is a 2.7% probability of hitting the earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Asteroids with a diameter greater than 140 meters are called &quot;nation destroyers&quot;. If they hit a medium-sized country, they will be directly destroyed; even the largest countries in terms of territory will be destroyed if they are hit. Thus it declined. Asteroids with a diameter of more than 10 kilometers are &quot;planet destroyers&quot; and can smash the earth into pieces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists from the &quot;Pluto/Apophis Explorer&quot; mission team will control the probe into its orbit when the asteroid passes by the Earth on April 13, 2029, for a period of 18 months. The moon&#39;s &quot;Apophis&quot; close-up exploration will conduct a comprehensive survey in order to study the motion characteristics of near-Earth asteroids. Finally, the probe will turn on its propulsion system and stir up the asteroid&#39;s surface to study the materials and structures beneath its surface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the scientist team of the &quot;OSIRIS-Rex&quot; project does not care much about the 2.7% asteroid impact rate, and planetary defense is not a research task within its project. The next step depends on whether NASA will take advantage of the opportunity of &quot;Apophis&quot; being delivered to our doorstep in 2029 to try the &quot;planetary defense&quot; project experiment again, using rocket thrust to change the orbit of the asteroid and push it farther away from the earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The complexity and fantasy of the &quot;Pluto/Apophis Explorer&quot; mission are somewhat similar to a &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like journey of exploration: a vision of the future, curiosity about unknown areas, and a desire for science. Perseverance in exploration, persistence in dreams, unbridled imagination, and technical excellence...are all intertwined into a legend that is far from over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“消失”的婴儿牵出代孕贩婴暗网：涉多名儿童与东南亚代孕妈妈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257764]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/e9bfb77e42.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 27/e9bfb77e42.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 13, 2023, in Huzhou, Zhejiang, Qiu Jiahong came again Chen Meifeng&#39;s residence. (Southern Weekend reporter Zheng Dan/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The gestational age is more than 8 months, premature birth, black hair, a baby boy. This is all 37-year-old Qiu Jiahong knows about the children she has never met. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At 23:35 on September 16, 2022, Qiu Jiahong, who had just undergone caesarean section and induced labor, woke up from general anesthesia. The child’s father, Zheng Xiaobing, told her that after The baby came out dead and was taken away by the doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Qiu Jiahong&#39;s account, when her originally healthy fetus was in labor, she was told by the hospital that &quot;the baby was hypoxic and had abnormal brain nerves, so it would be aborted.&quot; Half a year later, she suddenly realized something was wrong. On the afternoon of the first day of the caesarean section to induce labor, she received a phone call from a number in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province. She called twice in a row. The old lady on the other end of the phone asked her if she wanted to give her child away? &quot;It was inexplicable. I said how could I give it away, and then I died.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As many doubts emerged little by little, Qiu Jiahong suspected that she had fallen into a trap of human traffickers. It was not for nothing that she became &quot;prey&quot;. It was a reason that made it difficult for her to talk about it - the child she gave birth to out of wedlock was Zheng Xiaobing&#39;s illegitimate son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jiahong believes that the child is still alive. She decided to follow the strange number to find her son. Unexpectedly, a combination of circumstances led to a major underground surrogacy and child trafficking case. As of September 13, 2023, the police investigating the case found that multiple children were involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hiring a private detective to find a son&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It has been raining all morning. There are few people in the gray grain and oil wholesale market and it is quiet. Most of the rows of rolling shutter doors have been pulled down. Occasionally, there are a few takeaways. Members shuttle back and forth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slim Qiu Jiahong led Southern Weekend reporters through the market, skillfully entered a nearby residential building, and followed the corridor covered with psoriasis advertisements to the door of Room 203. . This resident is the old lady who called her originally, and is now in a detention center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old lady’s name is Chen Meifeng, 58 years old, from Putian, Fujian. Qiu Jiahong remembered that face clearly, with two arched eyebrows, deep bags under the eyes, a round face, high cheekbones, and a head of gray hair that exploded at the shoulders and was held up with a hairband. She is on the plump side, and in winter she often wears a black mink coat and wears black boots with strong soles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Six months ago, in February 2023, Qiu Jiahong hired two private detectives. The three drove from Shanghai to Huzhou, Zhejiang to find Chen Meifeng’s residence, trying to find her son who disappeared from the hospital here. She recalled that she had been squatting downstairs for a week in the cold weather, but she had never seen Chen Meifeng carrying her five or six-month-old baby boy out and about once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The confrontation with Chen Meifeng occurred on the 8th day of their stay. On February 23, Qiu Jiahong blocked Chen Meifeng at the door of Room 203 early in the morning, who was returning from a walk: &quot;Aunt Chen, do you recognize me?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No,&quot; Chen Meifeng&#39;s Mandarin was mixed with a strong Putian accent. Accent, she politely invited the visitor to sit in the house. The old man was cooking for his granddaughter, and the house was a little messy. Qiu Jiahong glanced around the room, but there was no baby boy. She asked again, &quot;Then where did you get my number?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Meifeng finally understood Qiu Jiahong&#39;s purpose. &quot;I haven&#39;t called her before,&quot; she said, and then muttered, &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot; At Qiu Jiahong&#39;s insistent request, Chen Meifeng was accompanied to a nearby mobile business hall to retrieve communication records within six months. Qiu Jiahong&#39;s phone number indeed appeared in it, and the call time was 16:29 on September 15, 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ed9bdd81dc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ed9bdd81dc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252368&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;One ​​early morning in February 2023, Chen Meifeng took her granddaughter back to the house. (Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jiahong did not pay attention at the time. Before and after Chen Meifeng called her, she made three phone calls to the same person. , and later found to be the number of Chen Yongjin, director of Zhejiang Meifubao Women&#39;s and Children&#39;s Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Meifubao Hospital). On September 16, 2022, Qiu Jiahong gave birth at Meifubao Hospital in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, Qiu Jiahong learned from the police that the two were fellow Putian residents. Chen Yongjin’s response to this matter was, “Maybe I told Chen Meifeng (Qiu Jiahong’s contact information), but I’m not sure.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jiahong remembered that after the caesarean section, Three days later, Yu Yanfen, the surgeon who performed the surgery, walked into her ward to do some daily routine. &quot;I was in a bit of a daze because of the pain. She chatted with me for two hours, asking me what my brothers and sisters did and what my husband did. How did we meet? We talked like one of our own people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;After a series of reflections, I felt something was wrong. She must have come to my ward to inquire about information. &quot;Qiu Jiahong determined that the child was alive, but was sold by Chen Meifeng and Mei Fubao Hospital; her boyfriend Zheng Xiaobing was also suspected of &quot;giving away&quot; the child, so the two had a dispute and parted ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Faced with Qiu Jiahong and the private detective questioning her child&#39;s whereabouts, Chen Meifeng cried, &quot;I really don&#39;t remember (calling Qiu Jiahong), I never did it ( Abduction and trafficking of Qiu Jiahong’s son).” In a live video on February 23, Chen Meifeng offered, “How about we go to the police station.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That night, Qiu Jiahong Reported the crime and Chen Meifeng was arrested. The next day, the Huzhou South Taihu New District Branch of the Huzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhejiang Province issued a decision on filing the case: According to the provisions of Article 109 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, it was decided to file the case of abduction and trafficking of women and children in the South Taihu New District. reconnaissance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Six months later, the police investigating the case told Qiu Jiahong that Chen Meifeng mainly made money from selling babies and surrogacy business. As for the sale of children, investigation has revealed that many children were sold, and the case has been taken seriously by the Ministry of Public Security. Although the surrogacy business is illegal, it is not a criminal act and is therefore not within the scope of this police investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Southeast Asian surrogate girl behind the door&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was an accident to expose Chen Meifeng’s surrogacy nest . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jiahong and his party did not get much information during the time they were stationed at the grain and oil wholesale market: they were probably Chen Meifeng and his wife, his son and daughter-in-law, and his two granddaughters. A family of six lives here. They rarely go out and don&#39;t like to greet their neighbors. Occasionally, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law would take turns driving a black BMW to go out. The most frequent place they went to was the nearby Huzhou Maria Maternity Hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jiahong discovered that every evening, Chen Meifeng would carry her little granddaughter around to the back row and disappear into Room 407 of another residential building. At one o&#39;clock, we returned to room 203. During the day, Chen Meifeng’s daughter-in-law would ride an electric bike to and from the front and back houses twice, carrying her lunch box. When the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law leave room 407, they will insert the key into the door hole and twist it several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the first few days, Qiu Jiahong heard the cry of a baby in Room 203, where Chen Meifeng was humming to comfort the child. The small milk box hanging at the door will receive a box of fresh goat milk for babies every morning. After a few days, the crying completely disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jiahong guessed that the crying sound belonged to her son. It was probably because of the commotion that Chen Meifeng placed the child in Room 407 in the back row. &quot;One night, I followed and listened secretly. There were many people&#39;s voices inside, and I felt something was wrong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If she hadn&#39;t seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn&#39;t have thought anything of it. You would believe that behind the door of Room 407, there are actually three surrogate girls from Southeast Asian countries, all about 20 years old, and two of them have big bellies. When Qiu Jiahong saw them, they were lying on the bed, using their smartphones without phone cards installed. The furnishings in the house are messy. When you open the refrigerator, you will find a lot of miscarriage and blood-replenishing medicines. There are discarded medical materials in the trash can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a video recorded by Qiu Jiahong and a fellow private detective after entering the house on February 23, a woman who calls herself Lili is silent at first, and then Expressing in unskilled Chinese, I am from Vietnam and am 6 months pregnant, while the girl on the bed next to me is 3 months pregnant. On the bedside table between the two of them was a box of capsules for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked how much money she could earn by giving birth to a child, Lili replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t given birth yet. I won&#39;t know how much money I will pay until I give birth.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She She said that she found Chen Meifeng through her sister&#39;s introduction, &quot;My sister gave birth here and she has gone back after giving birth. She gave birth to a girl and she said she had more than 20,000 (RMB).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another woman living in the attic of 407 said she was introduced to her by netizens on short video software. In a video, the woman said she had just arrived and was not pregnant yet. &quot;Someone introduced me here and asked Aunt Chen to help me find a job, so I came here.&quot; The contact information of the person who introduced her here has been lost because &quot;the phone has no card and the phone number has been deleted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, Huzhou police found out that two of the surrogate women were from Cambodia. &quot;Both girls came here with visas and got married here. For surrogacy, both parents (buyers) provide sperm and eggs, and they just borrow the mother&#39;s body.&quot; On September 13, a Southern Weekend reporter accompanied Qiu Jiahong there When the Huzhou Kangshan Police Station inquired about the case, a police officer from the police station said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/8bab885593.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/8bab885593.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huzhou, Zhejiang, Room 407, where a Southeast Asian surrogate woman once lived. (Southern Weekend reporter Zheng Dan/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Surrogacy in some Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand is cheaper than in China, and the price of domestic pregnant mothers has been skyrocketed. It’s very high.” Lao Cheng (pseudonym), the person in charge of an underground surrogacy agency, told Southern Weekend reporters that domestic pregnant mothers generally come from relatively poor areas. “We are looking for those between the ages of 25 and 32 who have given birth to one child. Lord”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the process, every time Lao Cheng receives pregnant mothers, he will arrange for them to undergo a full physical examination first. &quot;Those who are qualified will stay with us, and as soon as they get their period, we will let them take fertility drugs at an early stage, establish an artificial cycle, monitor the endometrium, and find a suitable opportunity to arrange embryo transfer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a complete surrogacy industry chain, it includes buyers, pregnant mothers, surrogacy agencies, private laboratories used for test tubes, and maternity hospitals that can issue false birth certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Specifications&quot; revised by the former Ministry of Health in 2003 clearly stipulates that any form of buying and selling of gametes, zygotes, embryos, medical institutions and medical personnel is prohibited No form of surrogacy technology is allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, this regulation is only binding on medical institutions and medical personnel, and cannot prevent organizations and individuals outside medical institutions from implementing surrogacy. The Civil Code does not explicitly regulate surrogacy, and surrogacy has become an underground business that wanders in a gray area all year round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;To put it bluntly, when we do this, you (the buyer) and I (the seller) have no risk, because we are in a blank area of ​​​​the law. All risks are concentrated Among doctors and medical institutions, firstly, during the in vitro fertilization process, the sperm and egg must be transplanted to the pregnant mother, which is very risky; secondly, during the subsequent production process, the hospital needs to write down the child’s birth certificate as written by both of you and your husband (buyer). ) name is also risky.&quot; Lao Cheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For customers who want to find a surrogate mother in Shanghai, Lao Cheng offers a surrogate price of 680,000 yuan, and the customer can specify the gender of the child for an additional 80,000 yuan. &quot;Public hospitals are more strictly monitored and it is not easy to operate test tubes. Basically, they are done in smart laboratories outside. If you require that the test tubes must be done in a public tertiary hospital, we can also arrange it and add 80,000.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Chen Meifeng&#39;s husband Wu Yuzhang, Chen Meifeng once wanted to open a surrogacy store in Putian. In November 2020, she registered Putian Tianding Health Management Co., Ltd. in her hometown. “There is no (surrogacy) here in Putian, let’s see how to open one. After registering, if it doesn’t work, it won’t be open.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter visited It was discovered that this was a small and micro enterprise located in a residential area with no signboard or facade. Because it failed to publish its annual report in compliance with regulations twice, the company has been included in the list of operating abnormalities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A midwifery hospital&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 10, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter met in Putian on the pretext of looking for a surrogate mother. We arrived at Wu Yuzhang, who is currently on bail awaiting trial. The 60-year-old man lives in his hometown with his son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We haven&#39;t done it (surrogacy) for a long time. We only did it for a year and stopped doing it.&quot; When he learned that the visitor was looking for Chen Meifeng, Wu Yuzhang He became more vigilant and said, &quot;I haven&#39;t been out at home in the past few years. She works in Shanghai. I can&#39;t figure out where she is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The living room in front of him It was empty, with a handbag from Huzhou Maria Maternity Hospital hanging on the toy pony on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Wu Yuzhang’s account, Chen Meifeng and him made shoe molds at home more than ten years ago. “We set up a factory ourselves and hired more than 30 workers. She is in charge of all the money.&quot; After her son went to study, Chen Meifeng proposed to earn money outside, saying that a friend in Putian introduced her to the hospital business. It was a job of driving patients from place to place to see a doctor. Sometimes I would also introduce patients from one hospital to another, earning a small referral fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huzhou Maria Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital is Chen Meifeng’s relatively regular place of work. The staff of the hospital also confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters, “Chen Meifeng used to bring people here for medical treatment. , I haven’t seen her in the past six months.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;She knows how to see a doctor. She went to the hospital for training for several years. The doctors there gave her training, especially what kind of diseases girls have. She knows what kind of medicine to take and how much it costs.&quot; Wu Yuzhang said that Chen Meifeng went to high school and knew a lot, and even applied for a passport. &quot;She specializes in dealing with obstetrics and gynecology hospitals. She is familiar with many hospitals in Zhejiang and Shanghai, as well as tertiary hospitals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The other side of this job , is to find suitable babies for sale in the hospital. According to police insiders, in the baby trafficking chain, Chen Meifeng plays the role of &quot;sales introduction&quot;. She runs around several hospitals all year round, and the doctors involved in the case privately provide her with information about parents who induce labor or plan to abandon their babies after delivery. She then persuaded and coaxed these parents to give birth to children and leave them to her disposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Chen Meifeng was arrested and implicated me. I was arrested on the spot by the police for investigation. The police thought I was colluding with Chen Meifeng to sell babies, but in fact I only accepted surrogates.&quot; On September 22, Chen Yongjin told Southern Weekend reporters that after Chen Meifeng was arrested, many doctors in Mei Fubao Hospital were taken away by the police to take notes. The doctor who performed Qiu Jiahong&#39;s caesarean section was Yanfen has resigned. &quot;She was also punished at that time.

Also changing the legal representative to Chen Yongjin was Chen Chunlai’s Zhejiang Meifubao Health Management Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Chunlai is one of the 10 largest shareholders of Shanghai Medicilon Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a well-known listed pharmaceutical company.

Every time a surrogacy business is accepted, it means that the hospital has to forge a birth certificate and fill in the name of the buyer in the column of the baby&#39;s parents. &quot;Of the dozen or so children she sold, about four or five were born here. She told me that these children were all surrogates, and after they were born, they sold them privately.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Surrogacy and child abduction are two different things. As far as our hospital is concerned, I dare to do (play) borderline things. If I am found out, I will be fined at most, but I absolutely dare not We have done something completely illegal. Our daily turnover is 300,000 yuan, and our annual turnover is 10 billion. Such a large hospital cannot take this risk.&quot; Chen Yongjin emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that Mei Fubao Hospital has never participated in Chen Meifeng&#39;s trafficking Children&#39;s illegal behavior was not previously known to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 15, 2023, the Hangzhou Gongshu District Health Bureau fined Mei Fubao Hospital for failing to fill in and keep medical records as required. 140,000 yuan.

There are few pedestrians in the deep part of the alley. On both sides of the bluestone brick road are small cement buildings of certain age. Some living rooms with open doors worship Mazu or the God of Wealth, and the air is filled with the smell of incense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“The original village was demolished and everyone moved out.” An elderly villager told Southern Weekend reporter, “She hasn’t been back for many years. I heard that they are doing medicine outside.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After Chen Meifeng left, Wu Yuzhang said that because of the bulk sales of shoe molds, customers had too much credit and could not get back hundreds of thousands. , and I won’t do it anymore. He rented out his three-story building and two warehouses, collecting rent of more than 100,000 yuan a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, Wu Yuzhang went to Huzhou, Zhejiang, to work as a logistics supporter for Chen Meifeng. He was responsible for buying vegetables, cooking and cleaning the house every day. &quot;I asked her once or twice (about business), and she said why are you asking so many questions? You can just spend it if you have money, and you still care about so much.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Yuzhang doesn’t know everything. “(Surrogacy) women are too hard to find. We also found them from Kunming, Yunnan. It’s not easy. They (Chen Meifeng, etc.) also went to Thailand to do (surrogacy business) before. , Thailand may be more expensive.&quot; Wu Yuzhang said vaguely that buyers can choose the gender of the baby in advance, and the price is between 550,000 and 600,000 yuan; the surrogate buyer watches the surrogate girl from pregnancy to delivery, with a total quotation of 650,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, this is a price slightly lower than the market price. Southern Weekend reporters asked a number of underground surrogacy agencies. The starting prices are all around 700,000 yuan, but these agencies all said that all pregnant mothers come from China and there are no channels for foreign pregnant mothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How much money can Chen Meifeng get from a surrogacy business? Will she buy and sell ready-made babies through hospital channels? Wu Yuzhang expressed that he “can’t figure it out”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The aforementioned police insider said that in the child trafficking transaction, Chen Meifeng would price a child from hundreds of thousands to 20 to 30 yuan based on the child&#39;s health. It ranges from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan, and she gets a commission from a few thousand to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of September 13, the police found multiple children who were bought and sold by Chen Meifeng and had traceable traces. All of them had obtained the biological parents of the children before selling them. agree. &quot;She believes that doing this is not kidnapping, but doing good deeds. Because while she doesn&#39;t want children, she also needs children. She gives the unwanted children to those who need them, and she connects people along the way and collects hard work.&quot; Therefore, Chen Meifeng transferred all her children to those who needed them. Transaction records and chat records are preserved. To her, these are proof of &quot;good deeds&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ten years ago, after being arrested, Tan Yongzhi, the main criminal in the huge case of abduction and trafficking of women and children supervised by the Ministry of Public Security, also claimed that he was doing good deeds. &quot;I help people. When people want children, I help them. I don&#39;t directly find people to sell children.&quot; According to CCTV News, from 2008 to 2013, Tan Yongzhi organized or participated in the sale of 22 children, each of whom The selling price of the children ranges from 15,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Tan Yongzhi earns referral fees ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 yuan per order, making a total profit of more than 100,000 yuan. In the end, the Henan Higher People&#39;s Court sentenced Tan Yongzhi to death, and the Supreme People&#39;s Court approved it in 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The aforementioned people familiar with the matter said that unlike abduction in the traditional sense, Chen Meifeng’s child abduction and trafficking case was of an adoption nature. In Chen Meifeng&#39;s past transactions, a pair of parents sold their children for 170,000 yuan, and Chen received several thousand yuan in &quot;milk powder money.&quot; Later, the parents thought that 170,000 yuan was too little, so they went to Chen Meifeng to beg for more money. If they didn&#39;t pay more, they called the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 26, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter called Huzhou Kangshan Police Station to inquire about the progress of the case.

According to her wishes, the child was aborted and sent to the crematorium.&quot; Regarding Qiu Jiahong&#39;s son, Chen Yongjin told Southern Weekend The reporter&#39;s version is another version: Qiu Jiahong initially asked customer service whether she could abort the child, saying that the child had &quot;some problems&quot;; on August 22, 2022, she hesitated when she came to the hospital for an examination, and about a month later said she was sure to abort. Drop the child. &quot;There was a man (Zheng Xiaobing) who came with him, and his attitude was to abort the child.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We only have one problem, the law stipulates 28 Fetuses over 10 weeks old cannot be induced, so we changed Qiu Jiahong&#39;s gestational age in the medical records to be smaller, and everything else is true.&quot; When Southern Weekend reporters asked about the whereabouts of Qiu Jiahong&#39;s son, Chen Yongjin asked: &quot;If the child is alive, we She needs a birth certificate.

The specific induced labor data is not registered and it is difficult to collect statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The penalty decision made public by the Gongshu District Health Bureau also mentioned that from September 15 to 16, 2022, Mei Fubao Hospital was the actual gestational age. At 37 weeks and 2 days, Qiu Jiahong underwent amniocentesis to induce labor with mifepristone combined with ethacridine injection and cesarean section to remove the fetus. In this regard, Qiu Jiahong said, &quot;I only took two mifepristone tablets, which did not work at all, and I did not take an induction injection (ethacridine injection).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text -align: left;&quot;>;After Qiu Jiahong repeatedly asked about the case, the police told Qiu Jiahong that the investigation of Chen Meifeng&#39;s case was now nearing completion, but in the existing evidence, there was no clue that her baby was a live fetus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have all asked Zheng Xiaobing, Chen Meifeng and Xiao Mazai, who helped Chen Meifeng, and there is no clue about the child.&quot; September 13, 2023, When mentioning the child&#39;s father, Zheng Xiaobing, the policeman at the police station said: &quot;The person who knows (the child&#39;s condition) best is that person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After that, a Southern Weekend reporter called Zheng Xiaobing asked if he knew the whereabouts of the child.

Qiu Jiahong drove alone to a village on the outskirts of Shanghai to find a fortune teller.

Recently, it has encountered a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of August 30, Zhejiang Aokang Shoes Co., Ltd. (abbreviation: ST Aokang, 603001.SH) released its 2023 semi-annual report. In the first half of the year, ST Aokang’s revenue was 1,644.4523 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12.22 %, and the net profit attributable to the parent company was 8.9976 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 177.59%. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, behind the overall red financial report is the &quot;great damage to vitality&quot; caused by the sharp decline in revenue that has lasted for many years and negative growth in 2022. In 2018, Aokang&#39;s total revenue was 3.043 billion. In 2022, the total revenue will be only 2.754 billion, and the net profit margin is even negative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to stabilize its market share, Aokang launched sports leather shoes in the first half of this year, inviting top celebrities to endorse and Dior designers to perfect the design. However, sports leather shoes that combine traditional leather shoes with sports shoes are difficult to sell. Make Aokang &quot;change his destiny against heaven&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taobao data shows that the price of Aokang sports leather shoes is on the high side, and the number of payers is relatively small. The best-selling celebrity sports leather shoes have more than a hundred people paying for them, while the other products have only a few people paying. ten people. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Aokang, the domestic men’s leather shoe market is facing a collective winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2016, China&#39;s leather shoe production has declined and overall development has been weak. The market share of men&#39;s leather shoe brands has continued to decrease. The market share of the top ten companies in terms of business scale has decreased from 10.1% in 2011. to 6.9% in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the market for sports and leisure shoes continues to expand, almost doubling from 269.1 billion in 2018 to 425.1 billion in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the impact of sports and leisure shoes, domestic men&#39;s leather shoes also lack the competitiveness to compete with international brands. Among the top ten best-selling men&#39;s leather shoe brands in 2020, only two are from mainland China, while the other brands come from Hong Kong, the United States, Italy and other countries or regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestic brands are mostly sold for less than 500 yuan, and national brands such as Aokang and Red Dragonfly are priced at 300 to 400 yuan.

An unusual sense of closeness. Astronomers believe that the moon and the earth had a super close contact in the beginning of time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was an ancient dwarf planet in the early solar system, located at the Lagrange point of the earth-solar system, which was almost the same as As big as Mars. According to the giant collision hypothesis, about 4.533 billion years ago, the dwarf planet was perturbed by the gravity of Jupiter or Venus and deviated from its original position and collided with the early Earth. The debris produced by the collision eventually formed the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ancient dwarf planet is often nicknamed &quot;Theia&quot; by Western astronomers. This is the name of a Titan goddess in Greek mythology who was the mother of Selene, the moon goddess. If we compare it to Chinese mythology, we may call this dwarf planet &quot;Chang Xi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the birth of the moon in Chinese mythology, many people will think of &quot;Pangu opened the sky and used his eye as the moon.&quot; However, this setting actually appeared quite late. It was first seen in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties: &quot;In the past, when Pangu died, his head was the four mountains, his eyes were the sun and the moon, his fat was the rivers and seas, and his hair was the vegetation.&quot; In older myths, , Chang Xi is the goddess who gave birth to the moon. She combined with the god Di Jun and gave birth to twelve moons. The earth&#39;s revolution period around the sun is exactly twelve times the moon&#39;s revolution period around the earth. Therefore, most peoples in the world divide the year into twelve months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the coincidence of the revolution period, the changes of lunar eclipses and lunar phases provide more inspiration for earth mythology: the legend of &quot;Tengu Eclipses the Moon&quot; has long been familiar to the Chinese people; coincidentally, in In Nordic mythology, there is a similar story of &quot;Sirius swallowing the moon&quot;: The wolves hated the light created by God, so a wolf named Skull chased the sun. When a solar eclipse occurred, Skull swallowed it. sun. Another wolf named Hati was responsible for chasing the moon, and when he caught up, a lunar eclipse occurred. At this time, people on the ground will beat gongs and drums to scare away the wolf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Australian Aboriginal mythology, the moon god is often described as a beautiful man who gradually becomes fat due to laziness (full moon). At this time, his wife, the Sun Goddess, would chop him with an ax. Although the Moon God will hide in a big tree, he will eventually die and will be resurrected 3 days after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, the moon god Chandra in Indian mythology is also a suave and beautiful man. Legend has it that he had twenty-seven wives and promised to love each of them equally. However, after marriage, Luna broke her promise and only loved one of her wives, and refused to listen to her repeated advice. This resulted in complaints from the other twenty-six wives. The life of the Moon God disappeared due to the curse. When he was about to disappear, the Moon God sadly prayed to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva restored the life energy of the Moon God through blessing; however, since the power of the curse cannot be taken back, the Moon God must go through the process of gain, fullness, food and loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from a global perspective, handsome men on the moon are considered non-mainstream. Most of the moon gods in various countries are beauties. For example, in ancient Chinese mythology, the moon goddess is named &quot;Wangshu&quot;, and she drives a moon carriage across the sky every night. &quot;Huainanzi&quot; also adds, &quot;Yueyu is called Wangshu, and it is also called Xian&#39;a&quot;. Literally explained, &quot;Wangshu&quot; means &quot;good-looking&quot; and &quot;Xian&#39;a&quot; means &quot;beautiful and good-looking&quot;. It can be seen from these two names that the ancients obviously believed that the Moon God was a beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting is not surprising. Compared with the sun, the moonlight appears white and cold. In addition, the moon&#39;s revolution cycle is similar to the female menstrual cycle, so it is reasonable for people to imagine the moon goddess as a beautiful woman. Selene in ancient Greek mythology was not only a beauty, but also drove a moon carriage. Among the Romans, the name of this moon god was Luna - the word &quot;luna&quot; representing the moon and the lunar calendar originated from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the beauty of the moon goddess, most Chinese people will immediately think of Chang&#39;e. But Chang&#39;e is not actually called this name, and she is not the Moon God at all: Chang&#39;e is just a general name for the Fairy of the Moon Palace. She is the maid of the Moon God rather than the Moon God herself. Chang&#39;e&#39;s name was originally written as Chang&#39;e. Later, in order to avoid the taboo of Emperor Liu Heng of Han Dynasty, it was temporarily changed to &quot;Chang&#39;e&quot; simply because the two words &quot;hengchang&quot; have similar meanings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taboo avoidance in the Han Dynasty was not strict, and taboo avoidance was only a temporary expediency and should be changed back later. But I don’t know whether it was because Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty was too beloved by the people, or because of the strong cultural influence of the Han Dynasty, a series of &quot;constant changes to the ordinary&quot; are still used today:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first sentence of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; &quot;The Tao can be Tao&quot; , non-constant Tao&quot; is still written as &quot;Very Tao&quot;; the &quot;Snake of Hengshan&quot; in &quot;The Art of War&quot; has always been written as &quot;Snake of Changshan&quot;, and Changshan Zhao Zilong has become an allusion; and Chang&#39;e&#39;s name is also called Today, Chang&#39;e has become a rare word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also the Han Dynasty when Chang&#39;e was forced to change her name, and Queen Mother Xi replaced Wangshu and became the new Moon Goddess. Then Taoism rose, and Taiyin Xingjun became the new moon god. This Taiyin Star King is said to be the Moon Mother Chang Xi. But whether it is the Queen Mother of the West or the Lord of Taiyin, they are all images of old women. The public obviously doesn&#39;t buy this, and still retains the impression that Luna is a beautiful woman. Therefore, it is not surprising that the &quot;Fairy Chang&#39;e&quot;, as a young maid, has replaced her boss and is regarded by everyone as the real moon goddess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In folk classics, Chang&#39;e always holds the Jade Rabbit in her arms. However, when it comes to seniority, it may be more reasonable to have the Jade Rabbit holding Chang&#39;e - the legend of the rabbit inside the moon is widely spread in East and Southeast Asia. The ancient Chinese books are among the earliest to record the legend of the Moon Rabbit. &quot;Chu Ci·Tian Wen&quot; says: &quot;What virtue is there in the moonlight, when death brings fertility? What is the benefit of the moon, but the tutu is in the belly?&quot; Therefore, the legends of various countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia The legend of the Moon Rabbit probably originated from China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Native Americans on the other side of the Pacific also spread the legend of the Moon Rabbit, which is even more magical: In Aztec mythology, Quetzalcoatl once descended to earth for training and almost died of hunger and thirst. At this time, a rabbit offered himself as food to save his life. Quetzalcoatl was moved by the rabbit&#39;s noble dedication, and after restoring his divine power, he promoted the rabbit to the moon god. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many versions of the Moon God in Mayan mythology, but almost all the images of the Moon God are holding a rabbit. After the arrival of Western colonists, the Mayans were unwilling to change their beliefs, and even stitched together Christianity and Mayan mythology: the sun god became Jehovah, the moon god became the Virgin Mary, and the corn god became Jesus Christ—I don’t know. How should they explain why Maria always held the rabbit? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many scholars believe that the legend of rabbits in the moon comes from the imagination of the shadow on the moon. However, so many ethnic groups around the world have various imaginations about shadows. For example, Europeans think that shadows look like a human face. Only the groups on the east and west sides of the Pacific believe that shadows resemble rabbits, which is too much of a coincidence. Therefore, some people also suspect that the legend of the Moon Rabbit may have been widely circulated among the ancestors as early as when the Native Americans left East Asia. Native Americans arrived in North America about 12,000 to 23,000 years ago. Based on this calculation, the legend of the Moon Rabbit may have been circulated for tens of thousands of years, and even now it has actually landed on the moon:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1969 Before Apollo 11 landed on the moon, the astronauts in the cabin mentioned Chang&#39;e and the Moon Rabbit in their conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lynton Johnson Space Center: There is a lot of important news about the Apollo this morning, and one of them calls your attention to a cute girl with a big rabbit. According to an ancient legend, a beautiful Chinese girl named Chang&#39;e has lived there for 4,000 years. It is said that she was exiled to the moon for stealing her husband&#39;s elixir of life. Perhaps her companion could be found - a huge Chinese rabbit, which always stood in the shade of the laurel tree and was easily spotted. The rabbit&#39;s name was not reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Astronaut Buzz Aldrin: OK, we&#39;ll keep an eye on that bunny girl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country&#39;s lunar rover was also named &quot;Jade Rabbit&quot; to pay tribute to this beautiful and ancient myth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, our fate with the moon goes beyond that. According to the latest large collision theory, the ancient dwarf planet did not collide with the ancient Earth, but a head-on collision. The two planets were completely destroyed, forming the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Venus, and then combined to form the Earth and the Moon. This also explains why the core accounts for such a large proportion of the Earth, because the core of the dwarf planet and the core of the Earth later merged into one, and the Earth&#39;s water may also come from the dwarf planet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, each of us is actually half a lunar person - or half Theian/half Changxi person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[济南城投公司一次性售1341套现房，房从哪来？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257906]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/RCBkXjPTUSHgAgP7TQ7gS7NWtD7htfWp74i5jRj6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/RCBkXjPTUSHgAgP7TQ7gS7NWtD 7htfWp74i5jRj6. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252757&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinan is full of high-rise buildings. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 22, 2023, at Qilu International Building, Jinan City, Shandong Province, Jinan Urban Development Group Assets Operation Management Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Chengfa) has opened bids for a project - recruiting housing marketing agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The project is selling 1,341 units of commercial housing, with a total area of ​​about 166,000 square meters, involving 4 properties, and developers include Greenland, Longfor, Poly, etc. Based on the average listing price in September, the total value of these properties exceeds 2.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that these houses are all existing houses and are first-hand residences. The project tenderer, Jinan Chengfa, is not a developer, but an urban investment company engaged in real estate development and operation, and is 100% owned by the Jinan Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only in Jinan, on September 21, 2023, the Beijing Equity Exchange auctioned and transferred 154 properties. The transferor was the Beijing Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee, and the source of the assets was &quot;physical assets of administrative institutions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where do local urban investment companies and government departments get their housing from? Why are they for sale? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The product of &quot;competitive construction&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang has worked in the Shandong branch of a national real estate company for seven or eight years. This time Jinan City Among the four properties for sale are projects of his company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters that the hundreds of units for sale in the project were resettlement houses built by real estate companies during land auctions, and were transferred to Jinan City Development after completion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the real estate market was booming in the past few years, real estate companies were vying for land across the country. In order to control land prices, local governments often limited the maximum price for land auctions. After the local auction reaches the maximum price, if the winner has not yet been determined, there will be a &quot;competition for self-sustaining&quot; and a &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;competition for construction&quot; means that after the developer&#39;s land quotation triggers the maximum price, it turns to competition for the construction area of ​​affordable housing. The one with the largest construction area is the winner. The housing provided is owned by the local government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang recalled that the above-mentioned land was purchased around 2018. In order to successfully bid, the company built two buildings as resettlement houses in a community of two to three thousand households, which increased the cost by more than 60 million yuan. But after the house was put on the market, the market price dropped and the entire project lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Jinan had just begun to implement &quot;competitive construction&quot;, which was still a minority in the country. Many cities usually use a lottery method to determine the winner after the land price triggers the maximum price limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that Jinan’s “competition for construction” has continued until now. In addition to the projects developed by his company, other properties sold in Jinan City Development this time are also the product of &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;competition-to-build&quot; housing was originally used as local affordable housing. Especially since the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Affordable Rental Housing&quot; in 2021, various places have accelerated the financing of affordable rental housing. Listings. In August 2022, Jinan Chengfa publicly purchased 3,000 units of commercial housing as rental reserves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Lin Gang admitted that the rental effect of the resettlement houses built by his company in the community was not good. The above-mentioned project, which was put up for sale by Jinan Chengfa, was completed in 2020. In 2022, I heard that two buildings would be used for lease by the government. The owners who had already moved in expressed their opposition and were worried that the mix of tenants would affect the community environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Some owners have come up with a plan and want to build a wall in the community to separate the two supporting buildings.” Lin Gang said that the owners’ opinions were fed back to Jinan Chengfa. The other party did not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are no companies near the community, it is not convenient for office workers to rent here and commute. The rental rate of the two resettlement houses has not been high. For Jinan Chengfa, this means limited rental income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the downturn in the real estate market, Jinan’s government fund income, which mainly comes from land sales, has been almost halved. Data from the Jinan Municipal Finance Bureau show that the city’s government fund revenue fell to 54.7 billion yuan in 2022 from 101.6 billion yuan in the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There have been very few land auctions in Jinan in the past four or five years.” Lin Gang said that under the influence of real estate regulation and the new crown epidemic, major real estate companies are shrinking, and Jinan’s land auction market continues to be cold. In order to maintain the team, his company has only acquired two pieces of land in Jinan in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its prediction of the fiscal revenue and expenditure situation in 2023, the Jinan Municipal Government pointed out that fiscal operations are still in a state of tight balance, and the pressure to increase revenue, reduce expenditure and prevent risks is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure, the Jinan Municipal Government proposed in the 2023 budget report to increase the profit handover ratio of municipal state-owned enterprises to 20%, and transfer the municipal-level state-owned capital operating budget to the general public budget proportion increased to 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Jinan Chengfa, who has a house in hand, the income from selling houses is obviously more substantial than renting. Taking the housing listings in Huatongyuan Community in Greenland as an example, Anjuke showed that the monthly rent for a three-bedroom apartment of about 140 square meters is 5,000 yuan, and the rent per square meter is about 38 yuan/month. If sold, the new house price is 22,000 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called Jinan Chengfa many times, but the staff declined the interview because the person in charge was not available. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Revitalizing idle properties&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is not the first time Jinan State-owned Assets has sold commercial housing. In July 2023, the Dongcheng Yijia Community developed by Jinan Urban Construction Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Urban Construction) was put on sale. Another property owned by the company, Xijiang Huafu, also announced that it will be launched for sale in the second half of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the equity penetration, Jinan Urban Construction is 90% owned by the Jinan State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and 10% by the Shandong Finance Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two communities are called &quot;civil servant communities&quot; in Jinan. Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of home buyers. The sales staff of Jinan Urban Construction Yi said that the two communities combined have a total of about 12,000 units, which were completed and delivered in 2016 and 2019. Half of the building was previously sold to civil servants, and the remaining half has been vacant until 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Dongcheng Yijia Community has more than 4,000 units for sale this time, and Xijiang Huafu has more than 1,000 units, which are expected to be officially launched after the National Day holiday. &quot;The two properties were originally off-plan properties and were sold internally by civil servants around 2013. The selling price was equivalent to the market price at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Lin Gang was still working as a real estate reporter for a newspaper in Jinan. &quot;When I got to know this community, people had already chosen a house.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Jinan hosted the 11th National Games and built a new Olympic Sports Center in the east of the city as the main venue. After the National Games, the Jinan Municipal Government also began to move eastward, moving into the Long&#39;ao Building, which is more than 100 meters away from the Olympic Sports Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil servants from Jinan Municipal Government units subsequently moved to Longao Building to work. Many civil servants did not have houses or lived far away. In order to meet the housing needs, two residential communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, were built. Judging from the distance displayed on the map software, the two communities are both within 3 kilometers of Longao Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Revitalizing State-owned Assets of Administrative Institutions&quot;, requiring the implementation of the government&#39;s tight living requirements and accelerating the revitalization and utilization of various state-owned assets such as houses, land, and vehicles. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, more than 5,000 units of existing houses have been put on the market in two communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, and Jinan&#39;s property market has been shocked. &quot;This is amazing. The total number of online new houses signed in Jinan a year is only 40,000 to 50,000 units.&quot; Lin Gang sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Jinan urban construction staff said that the current price of a small apartment of 95 square meters in Dongcheng Yijia is about 25,000 yuan/square meter, and the price of a large apartment of 175 square meters is about 29,000 yuan/square meter. Data from Lianjia.com shows that this price is lower than second-hand houses in the same area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because these two communities are all rough housing.” She said that in the two months since Dongcheng Yijia went on sale, more than 400 units have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that these two communities were built earlier, and the unit designs are not outstanding, which has also lowered the price to a certain extent. However, it has a superior location and is equipped with a high-quality school district. It is still popular after being listed and has a certain impact on surrounding second-hand houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 154 properties transferred by the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee of Chaoyang District, Beijing are similar to those in Jinan. This batch of properties is located in the China Railway Construction International City Community, and the listing price is also lower than the price of second-hand houses in the same community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Economic Observer&quot; report, after the completion of China Railway Construction International City, some houses were repurchased by Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee and other units, with plans to use them to solve the housing problem of employees. Later, it was not fully implemented as planned, and some of the houses remain vacant to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee provided Southern Weekend reporters with the phone number of the person in charge, but no one answered the call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lin Gang is a pseudonym at the request of the interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[掰掰告别狮子林桥后，天津还有哪些快乐？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[东亚家庭的悲剧与温情，全程哭着看完]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257890]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The son who has been away from home for many years suddenly received a call from his old man.

He had to borrow money to pay off the debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang had no choice but to work hard in a big city at the age of 18 and almost never came back because he knew that once he fell into this house of gods and men, he would become the same as those god tablets and become the entrustment of the whole family. &quot;hope&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the beginning of the film until the middle and later stages, Lu Yingliang rarely appears in the picture. He basically communicates sparsely with his family in voice-over, and is full of confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation did not change until my father was suddenly diagnosed with cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/e1175bd37c5b0692749d2ef4e85ea3f8.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/e1175bd37c5b0692749d2ef4e85ea3f8.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang finally decided I helped my parents take photos of their deaths, and when choosing photos, I had a rare conversation with my father, and the family sat together, a rare moment of warmth and harmony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe this scene will make many people cry secretly, because its tenderness uses the photo of the deceased (death) as a bridge to connect. The resentment that had been built up for many years gradually dissipated, not because the Lu family was on the right track, but because his father would eventually pass away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a sad ending for an East Asian family. Just like the recent &quot;That Time a Ghost and I Became Family&quot;, the father played by Tuo Zonghua finally opened his heart because Mao Bangyu had passed away. Regret makes people put aside their prejudices and their attitudes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/13e3dceb1b845daa801316bac97ef234.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;605&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/13e3dceb1b845daa801316bac97ef234.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《神人Near the end of &quot;Home&quot;, Lu Yingliang finally returned to the home that had made him frustrated. He tasted the sweetness from the tomatoes grown by his brother, and took his mother on a train to see the sea, fulfilling her long-cherished wish. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The place where this old woman lives is actually only a few dozen kilometers away from the coastline. Apart from her wedding photos, she only had one young and beautiful photo when she was young. All her life since then has been dedicated to it. Three children and a useless husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a god in &quot;House of Gods&quot;, then it is Lu Yingliang&#39;s mother. She is the real glue of this family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/c659b1d78540742f7908265a93145cec.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;599&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/c659b1d78540742f7908265a93145cec.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252730&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Watch &quot;God When reading &quot;Human Home&quot;, it always reminds me of Huang Zi&#39;s &quot;Xiaowei&quot; and Dapeng&#39;s &quot;Auspicious Ruyi&quot;. One of these two films is an art film, and the other is a documentary in the form of a meta-film, but to some extent, they both belong to the category of private family films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The creators of these films have honestly presented the disease, death and discord among members of the native family, whether it is long-term silent hostility or uncontrollable tension. It all reminds us of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;House of Gods&quot; may not be called a blockbuster of the year, let alone a high achievement in terms of images, but the sincerity of emotional expression is indeed something that has not been seen for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Lu Yingliang went from watching his family worshiping gods with a cold eye, to shifting his perspective away from the gods and towards his parents and brothers. This change in perspective is clearly visible. This tells us invisibly that he no longer carefully observes himself and his family in a binary opposition, but chooses to recognize his former identity and accompany his mother on the endless coastline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
