In view of the fact that Zhang Wufeng truthfully confessed all his crimes after arriving at the case, took the initiative to explain some of the bribery facts that the supervisory authorities had not yet grasped, confessed his guilt and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the property obtained from bribery and its interest have been seized and brought to the case, some of the bribery attempts were unsuccessful, and he had made major meritorious services. It shows that there are statutory and discretionary lenient punishment circumstances, and he may be given a lighter punishment in accordance with the law. The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五月天演唱会疑似假唱：应尊重观众要求“真唱”的权利丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261919]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the suspected lip-syncing incident at the Mayday concert has attracted widespread public attention. The incident originated from the analysis video uploaded by the blogger &quot;Wheatfield Farmer&quot;. He used software to analyze the 12 song videos taken by fans at the Mayday Shanghai concert on November 16. After extracting the vocal analysis, he accused Mayday of &quot;in 12 songs. &quot;Five of the songs are lip-syncing,&quot; and another one is &quot;the first few lines are fake, but the rest are true.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, it triggered reactions from all parties. Some music bloggers said they had reported it to the China Consumers Association; the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism said it would require the organizers to cooperate with the investigation; staff of the China Performance Industry Association said they had paid attention to the matter and were &quot;waiting for the results of the cultural law enforcement department.&quot; Mayday officials first posted on Weibo that they would broadcast the entire Paris concert live online, which was interpreted by the outside world as &quot;to dispel doubts.&quot; On December 4, their agency also issued a &quot;solemn statement&quot; stating that &quot;the tour will There is no lip-synching behavior in it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the audio and video materials of the Mayday Shanghai concert have been submitted to the local cultural market inspection department. The relevant departments will conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the investigation results. Regardless of whether Mayday &quot;lip-synced&quot; this time, the old topic of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; has been thrown back into the public opinion field, which deserves further analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this incident has brought new problems to &quot;how to define lip-synching&quot;, which requires industry research and follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Article 31 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations&quot;, lip-synching &quot;refers to the act of actors using pre-recorded songs and music instead of live singing during the performance.&quot; In this incident, judging from the blogger&#39;s accusation, Mayday&#39;s suspected lip-synching was not the simple and crude &quot;pre-recording&quot; in the past, but the method of &quot;back-up singing&quot;: importing instrumental music and music into the concert project file in advance. For the vocal track, &quot;the lower part of the verse is really sung, and the chorus is sung in the background.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;undersinging&quot; is true, then the definition of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; will have a new question: Does &quot;singing the main song really, singing under the chorus&quot; count as lip-synching? In other words, what percentage of a song must be performed live for it to be considered lip-synching? Furthermore, today, when artificial intelligence has developed to the point where it is difficult to distinguish authenticity from fake, if the AI ​​training voice in the future is &quot;promoted and applied&quot;, how should the industry define and prevent it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;actors may not deceive the audience by lip-synching, and performance organizers shall not organize actors to lip-sync. No unit or individual may provide conditions for lip-synching.&quot; In fact, fake The turmoil caused by lip-synching did not start today. Similar incidents are common, and many singers have become the butt of jokes because of their genuine lip-synching. The reason is simple. Even without the constraints of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations, lip-syncing by entertainers will harm their social reputation. Lip-synching at a concert is unjustifiable in terms of professional ethics and legal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Mayday’s agency has issued a statement categorically denying lip-syncing and accusing the relevant remarks of “malicious attacks and rumors and slander”, one of the two statements must be false, and one party is destined to be suspected of violating relevant laws and regulations. This matter also deserves an authoritative investigation result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;the performance organizer should send special personnel to supervise the performance to prevent the occurrence of lip-synching behavior.&quot; According to a staff member of the Beijing Cultural Market Law Enforcement Corps, Mayday this year Law enforcement officers were on site to supervise the six concerts in Beijing. It is worth asking whether Mayday’s suspected lip-synching was only in Shanghai this time? At the previous six concerts in Beijing, did the on-site law enforcement officers fulfill their responsibilities of &quot;supervising the performances&quot; to prevent lip-synching? This should all be clarified in subsequent investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this incident also raises a question: how to define and protect the consumer rights of commercial performance audiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Mayday’s lip-synching is true, some viewers’ demands for “refund,” “compensation,” and “apology” should be supported. Of course, there are many viewers who &quot;don&#39;t care whether they actually sing or not&quot;, and there are also many fans who regard the concert as a ticket to a meet-and-greet. After the Mayday suspected lip-synching incident, some fans also said that &quot;just feel the atmosphere of the scene&quot;, &quot;just seeing them is enough&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter whether they lip-sync or do the real thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a famous saying in the legal world: &quot;struggle for rights.&quot; Any right needs to be asserted before it can be implemented. It is not difficult to imagine that there are people in the audience who are serious about lip-synching, and there are also people who don&#39;t care about lip-synching. There are people in the audience who have &quot;high standards and strict requirements&quot; for the viewing experience, and there are also people who bought tickets and came in just to have fun. In reality, &quot;concert audiences&quot; are not a homogeneous group, and their expectations for &quot;quality of goods and services&quot; are also different. However, since there are audiences claiming their rights in accordance with the law and regulations, the performers should respect their demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are a lot of lip-syncing in the European and American music circles. For example, in concerts later in his acting career, Michael Jackson would choose to lip-sync when singing and dancing some dance numbers due to physical reasons, but he The city will state in advance on its official website that the audiences who come for the &quot;moonwalk&quot; are not interested in whether they really sing or not; Pavarotti also lip-synched at the opening ceremony of the Turin Winter Olympics, but a generation of tenors can perform powerfully. He has won the admiration and respect of the world for showing up despite his illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene, &quot;lowering expectations&quot; and &quot;advance notification&quot; are also widely used methods in the industry. For example, some singers lower the key or change the song in order to ensure the true singing effect. This is a frank admission of the voice. I can no longer really sing. In this case, it may be possible to respect the independent management rights of entertainers and require them to fulfill their obligation to inform, not to sell dogs on sheep&#39;s head, and let the market judge and consumers make their choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, in the face of the controversy over Mayday’s suspected lip-syncing, the industry must define “lip-syncing” more accurately, regulate commercial performances with more detailed legislation and law enforcement, and at the same time In accordance with the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Act, we protect consumers’ rights to know the truth, make independent choices and fair transactions, and respect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers who come forward to question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖南一县委书记在下乡调研返程途中坠江身亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261911]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:57:45&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of December 5, the Hunan Rucheng County Party Committee Office issued a notice stating that the deputy director of the Chenzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee, Comrade Huang Siping, secretary of the Rucheng County Party Committee, died of an accident at 15:31 on December 4 on his way back from a field trip to the countryside.

The Heihe River originates from Qinghai, and Zhangye City is located in the middle reaches. It contains more than 90% of the cultivated land and population in the basin, and more than 80% of the water consumption and GDP. Lushui Bay is known as Zhangye&#39;s &quot;humidifier&quot;, but if too much water is intercepted, it may affect downstream water use. The Ejina Banner of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia in the lower reaches of the Heihe River is one of the origins of sandstorms in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye, located in the Hexi Corridor, is located at the intersection of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. It is a natural oasis on the Silk Road. The &quot;gold&quot; in the ancient name &quot;Jin Zhangye&quot; not only reflects the wealth of this place, but also shows that in this arid zone oasis, water resources are as precious as gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Including Lushuiwan Scenic Area, the inspection report showed that there are more than 30 artificial water surfaces in Zhangye City with illegal and illegal problems, with a total water area of ​​more than 6,000 acres. These artificial water surfaces, which have only appeared in the past ten years, also carry expectations for the transformation and upgrading of Zhangye&#39;s cultural tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zhangye City was designated as my country&#39;s first water-saving society pilot area by the Ministry of Water Resources as early as 2002, and has made many water-saving explorations. However, this time the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspectorate not only reported that Zhangye illegally extracted surface water, but also failed to control over-exploitation of groundwater. &quot;Zhangye City has not implemented the strictest water resources management system in place. Economic development and urban construction have not fully considered the water environment carrying capacity of the Heihe River Basin. The problem of inaction and random actions by some departments is outstanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1,248 acres of artificial The water is involved in &quot;building before approval&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangye Ganzhou is known as &quot;half city of reeds, half city of pagoda shadows&quot;.

However, as the core landscape in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area, the artificial water surface was notified by the inspection team as being built before approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau, the preliminary procedures involved in the artificial lake include: project approval, construction project land pre-examination opinion, environmental impact report approval, water resources demonstration report approval, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members said that almost none of these procedures were completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Zhangye Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the Lushui Bay Scenic Area project did not have a project approval from the development and reform department, and there was no environmental impact assessment of the construction project. &quot;The project approval is a birth certificate, otherwise it is &#39; Black households&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lushuiwan Scenic Area, which was built 12 years ago, has not gone through the relevant procedures, which is incredible. “Lushui Bay is so good that everyone is used to it,” said the above-mentioned person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The artificial water surfaces built before approval in Zhangye are not an isolated case. They also include 11 artificial water surfaces in the Olympic Forest Park (referred to as Orson Park) across the river from Lushui Bay, totaling 1,248 acres. Since the country strengthened the investigation and rectification of &quot;lake digging and landscaping&quot; in June 2020, two artificial lakes have been newly built in Zhangye Ruoshui Park, with a water area of ​​165 acres; the newly built artificial lakes in Baita Rainbow Park and the park on the west side of Zhangye Grand Theater have It also occupied 24.4 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Mine pit turned into park, lack of ecological restoration plan&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the artificial water surfaces reported by the inspector, the water intake area of ​​Zhangye Aosen Park is second only to the artificial lake in Lushui Bay Scenic Area, equivalent to half of the latter. Its story is also similar to Lushui Bay: restoration-planting trees-water diversion-development-development of tourism + real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before 2017, the original site of Aosen Park was a deserted Gobi desert with no grass growing on it. There were many large pits left by sand and gravel mining in the sand and gravel factory. The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Conservancy Bureau responded to Southern Weekend Reporters, diverting water from the Heihe River to build artificial water surfaces is an ecological restoration method that “kills two birds with one stone”: the mine pits are treated to prevent seepage and then filled with water, which is low-cost; the water storage can also provide water sources for the surrounding forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260738&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Olympic Forest Park.

According to its plan, it attempts to create an ecological leisure and health gathering area integrating tourism, health care, sports and entertainment. Aosen Park not only plans to build distribution plazas, sports fields and parking lots, but also supports Shenkeng Hotel, Heihe Water Ecology Museum, Forest Health Care Community, Forest Sports Town, etc. The investment is estimated to reach 2.86 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members believe that these mines should develop tailor-made ecological restoration plans in accordance with relevant national management regulations and scientifically demonstrate their ecological impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge of the Ganzhou District Heihe Forestry Farm, the unit responsible for the Osun Park project, said frankly that how to repair the more than 40 mine pits, whether to cover them with soil and then plant grass and trees, or to prevent seepage and then fill them with water , and no ecological restoration plan has been carried out independently. Finally, depending on factors such as the topography of the mine pit, some cover the area with soil and then plant trees, while others do anti-seepage and then inject water. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why not apply for a water abstraction permit? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Open the satellite map on your mobile phone. The green Zhangye is surrounded by the yellow Gobi Desert. Pieces of agate-like blue water are embedded in the territory of Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye is not rich in water resources. Zhangye has a temperate arid climate, with annual precipitation of only 100-250 mm, but annual evaporation as high as 1400-2700 mm. These artificial water surfaces are created mainly from the Heihe River flowing through Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/2dd96aa896.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/2dd96aa896.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260739&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it.

The water in the main canals has obtained a water abstraction permit. The water consumption of the artificial water surface in Lushui Bay is increased by the main canals. The water consumption for agricultural irrigation does not exceed the total water permit. However, members of the inspection team said that the permitted use of water in the main canal is limited to agricultural irrigation, and the artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area is ecological water and does not comply with the water abstraction permit requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only does Lushui Bay Scenic Area not have a water permit. The inspector reported that Zhangye Ruoshui Huahai Scenic Area has not applied for a water abstraction license from 2016 to 2021. After applying for a new license in 2022, it still drew an excess of 67,000 cubic meters of water from the Heihe River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260740&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Ruoshuihuahai Scenic Area.

According to the Heihe River water diversion plan determined by the State Council in 1997, about 60% of the water volume was released downstream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau said that since August 2000, Zhangye City has continuously completed the water diversion tasks from the Heihe River. Especially in 2023, the precipitation will be 20% less than in previous years, and the annual runoff will be dry. However, The discharge task has still been exceeded, and the downstream Dongjuyan Sea has not dried up since 2004. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant people believe that Zhangye’s arid climate, high evaporation, and illegal construction of artificial water surfaces in the city have exacerbated water shortages. The performance may not be obvious during the wet season, but in recent years the Heihe River runoff has been relatively dry, which has already revealed ecological risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260741&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it. Screenshot of the video of the inspection team&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station introduced that since 2003, the Heihe River has entered a rare 18-year continuous wet season. Song Xiaoyu said that according to data from the Yingluoxia Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Heihe River, the multi-year average runoff entering the middle reaches is about 1.58 billion cubic meters. The average annual runoff from 2005 to 2020 exceeded 2 billion cubic meters, reaching a peak of 23.5 in 2017. One hundred million cubic meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ejina Banner in the lower reaches of the Heihe River feels the greatest changes in water volume. According to &quot;Ban Yue Tan&quot;, from 2016 to 2020, the number of days when rivers in Ejina Banner were closed was reduced from the previous average of 250 days to 55 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the runoff of the Heihe River has decreased in recent years. According to the Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station, the runoff during the 2023 dispatch period is only 1.38 billion cubic meters, less than 60% of the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past three years, the Ejina oasis ecology, which has already improved, has begun to &quot;cry thirsty&quot; again. Data provided by the Alxa League Water Conservancy Bureau to &quot;Half Moon Talk&quot; shows: Since 2020, the Ejina in the Heihe River Basin has The number of flow-free days in this section has been around 100 for three consecutive years. On May 20, 2022, the entire Ejina section of the Heihe River Basin was cut off. The East Juyan Sea has not received water supply for more than 10 months.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2023, respectively Year-on-year decreases of 0.39, 0.26, and 0.81 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, due to long-term large-scale extraction of groundwater, Zhangye City has formed 7 over-exploitation areas, all of which are restricted mining areas. The &quot;Groundwater Management Regulations&quot; stipulate that the provincial water conservancy department, in conjunction with the natural resources and other departments, organizes the delineation of groundwater prohibited and restricted areas within the administrative region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector also reported that since 2020, thousands of excessive water withdrawal problems have occurred in Zhangye&#39;s over-mining area, and the local water affairs department has basically failed to investigate and deal with them in accordance with the law. In the restricted mining area, 160 million cubic meters of groundwater was used beyond the permitted limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter, the relevant person in charge of the Zhangye City Water Affairs Bureau said that although some water wells drew more groundwater than allowed, other wells drew less water than allowed, and the total amount of groundwater drawn in the region was not. Exceeds total permitted range. The reason why there are no administrative penalties for thousands of excessive water withdrawals is because the local government implements a tiered water price mechanism. After exceeding the permitted water use, higher water fees can be charged and adjusted through market mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant analysts believe that this move is suspected of &quot;selling water&quot; and is not conducive to the management of groundwater overexploitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the State Council&#39;s &quot;Opinions on Implementing the Strict Water Resources Management System&quot; required that &quot;in areas where groundwater is over-exploited, new withdrawals of groundwater from agriculture, industrial construction projects and service industries are prohibited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector reported that since 2016, the local water department has illegally approved 20 wells including Zhiyuan Forestry Technology Co., Ltd. In January 2016, the Gansu Provincial Department of Water Resources required that all self-provided water wells within the coverage of the public water supply network be closed in 2016. Not only did Zhangye City fail to implement the relevant requirements, it even issued water abstraction licenses for 49 wells of enterprises in the Economic Development Zone. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the groundwater data provided by the relevant authorities in Zhangye City are confusing and contradictory. The 2015 groundwater water consumption data provided by the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau to the inspection team differed by more than 46 million cubic meters from the data provided to reporters. Southern Weekend reporters asked the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau for the reason, but as of press time, no reply has been received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector stated that this was not an isolated case. During the inspection process, due to the prominent cases of misreporting, concealment and false reporting by relevant competent authorities, the workload of on-site verification was greatly increased. For example, the inspection team reviewed the list of self-provided water wells covered by Zhangye City’s public water supply pipe network. The Municipal Water Affairs Bureau only provided a list of Ganzhou District, including the water wells of three companies. However, the inspection team went to the Economic Development Zone in Ganzhou District for on-site inspection and found that there were 49 water wells in dozens of companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Water conservation requires institutional reform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In winter, the Heihe River enters the dry season. When driving on the Zhangye Heihe River Bridge, the river bed under the bridge has dried up, exposing yellow soil and gray sand and gravel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260743&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;At the end of November 2023, in the Zhangye Heihe River section in winter, some rivers had dried up. Photo by Southern Weekend Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The per capita water resource in Zhangye City is only 1,250 cubic meters, which is 60% of the national average. As a large agricultural city, the average water quantity per mu is only 511 cubic meters, which is only 60% of the national average. Thirty percent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye’s water resource shortage is inseparable from its economic structure. In 2022, Zhangye&#39;s three industrial structure ratios will be 29.3:20.4:50.3, with agriculture accounting for a larger proportion of the economy than industry. Agricultural water accounts for about 90% of the city’s water use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to climatic advantages such as long sunshine hours and large temperature differences between day and night, Zhangye is rich in high-quality agricultural products. The &quot;Wujiang tribute rice&quot;, which has been famous since the Tang Dynasty because the rice grains do not stick together after being cooked, has been significantly reduced due to the water-saving rice planting area. On the large tracts of farmland near Lushuiwan Scenic Area and Aosen Park, billboards proclaiming &quot;100,000 acres of vegetable base for Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao&quot; were erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seasonal distribution of water resources in the Heihe River is uneven, and the timing of incoming water and agricultural water use is not completely coordinated. Song Xiaoyu told Southern Weekend reporters that the Heihe River water resources come from glaciers, frozen soil, snowmelt water and rainfall. The precipitation is mainly concentrated from July to September, and from March to June when agricultural water is most urgent, 60 to 70% The water needs to be supplied by glaciers, frozen soil, and melted snow. Winter snowfall and snow contribute 20%-25% of the water source to the Heihe River runoff in the second year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu said that Zhangye, located in high latitudes and high altitudes, is a sensitive area greatly affected by climate change. The temperature is increasing at a faster rate. The glacier area has decreased by about 20% in the past 50 years, and the snow line is also rising. From October to December 2022, the snowfall in Shandan, Minle and Sunan counties in Zhangye was 70% less than the average of the past ten years. The decrease in surface runoff has also led to an increase in groundwater withdrawals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such economic, social and climatic conditions, Zhangye urgently needs to further improve water resource utilization. Song Xiaoyu believes that Zhangye City has gone through long-term exploration of water-saving work, and the current irrigation efficiency is already at a high level. The next step is to make breakthroughs in institutional mechanisms, such as further deepening the reform of agricultural water rights and water prices, improving the water rights trading system, and continuing to promote High-standard farmland construction, accelerating industrial structure adjustment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu and others have conducted research on Ganzhou District of Zhangye City and found that optimizing the water rights allocation model, high-standard farmland construction and industrial structure adjustment can respectively increase the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources by up to 1.87%. , 8.72% and 3.06%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For local authorities, institutional reform faces many challenges such as funding, technology, and talent. However, in order to continue to optimize water resource management and improve water resource utilization efficiency, this work is imperative. .&quot; Song Xiaoyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[裁判文书里出现“安徽省南京市”？深圳福田法院通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261903]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:05:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Situation Report&lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, some media pointed out Our court has corrected the misstatement of &quot;Nanjing City, Anhui Province&quot; in the enforcement ruling.

Around 2010, Xun Hang found several rolling fans like himself through some post -bar and forums.

The length of the car is 887 meters and the highest point is 60 meters. It is one of the highest and longest ejection roller coaster in China. It can operate at 135 kilometers per hour. It is also one of the fastest roller coasters in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;We didn&#39;t believe it at the beginning, but later realized that it was true.&quot; Yang Kaichun, a member of &quot;Dream of the Rollerar Crossing&quot;, said that the reason why it was surprised is because &quot; The Snow Eagle &quot;has the&quot; very safe &quot;element in the cognition of senior players -brand parks, large equipment, and front -line manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 23-year-old Yang Kaichun has nearly 200 roller coaster brush experience. When he was in a roller coaster for the first time, he was in the sixth grade of elementary school. It was in the Lotte World in Korea. He was timid. With his mother&#39;s encouragement and accompaniment, he was reluctant to get on the car. &quot;Sit down and find out that it is not the same as what I think. Not only is it not afraid, but also very exciting. After sitting after sitting, I still want to wait in line.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left; &quot;>; This experience gave Yang Kaichun a strong interest in the roller coaster. What is this power control system without power? How is the rail path design? In the process of rolling rotation, how to grasp the physiological limit of people? How much correlation does a person&#39;s ride experience have the overall design? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In order to satisfy her curiosity, Yang Kaichun not only searched a large number of roller coaster-related materials on the Internet, brushed the car in large and small parks at home and abroad. Machinery engineering major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The roller coaster is a niche hobby, but Yang Kaichun has found a lot of like-minded friends. In addition to sharing the feeling of brushing, he likes to discuss the mechanical principles and control systems of roller coaster with people who are like Zhizhi. &quot;That is a very pure and forgetful communication. Everyone doesn&#39;t care whether to offend others and quarrels with a question, but it will not affect the feelings at all. Everyone loves roller coaster purely.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p stylele = &quot;Text-Align: Left;&quot;>; After the &quot;10 · 27&quot; roller coaster accident in Shenzhen Happy Valley, the WeChat group of &quot;Roller Coastered Crossing Crossing Crossing&quot; started a warm discussion. &quot;It is mainly discussed at the technical level. Everyone speculates that there may be problems with the stop device.&quot; Hang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Hang said that among the members of the &quot;dream of roller coaster&quot;, some people may recently reduce frequent roller roller roller in the same manufacturer, but the overall as a whole is still &quot;this should be&quot; this should be the same time. Brush the car and brush the car, you should visit the park. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the hundreds of experience of more than ten years of experience in rolling car brush car, these roller coaster fans claim to have not encountered personal safety incidents in person, which made them believe The safety is high. &quot;If the probability of a plane accident is far lower than the road to the airport (the probability of the accident), the probability of a roller coaster is far lower than the road to the park to the park.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 480 air brushing cars, only experienced the roller coaster&#39;s track that caused bumps, &quot;red knee&quot;; More than 320 units have never experienced &quot;risk situation&quot;, but when the service personnel have encountered a service personnel who deducted their shoulders but did not tie the seat belt, they did not perform &quot;dual insurance&quot;; Once a &quot;suspended parking&quot;, the car crawled to the highest point and stuck. Finally, under the command of the park manager, everyone collectively &quot;sold&quot; before continuing to &quot;depart&quot; ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;Text-Align: Left;&quot;>; The safety of roller corses reflected by individual experience also has some objective basis. According to statistics from the International Amusement Park and Scenic Spot Association in October 2023, the probability of people injured in amusement equipment is about 3.7 times per million people, which is lower than kicking football, swimming, cycling and so on. According to the three -year average value, the probability of injuries on the theme park fixed amusement facilities is one 17 million in the first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;If the vehicle hovers in the preset area, or bumps, etc., it is a common problem, which will not cause passengers&#39; security issues. We are not afraid of fear For example, hovering, sometimes I look forward to going through and enrich the experience. &quot;Hang said. Other interviewed roller coaster enthusiasts are similar to the safety risks of roller coaster, similar to Hang Hang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, in the opinion of the professionals, even if there is no casualties caused by personnel, hovering is not always a &quot;common problem&quot;. &quot;Under normal circumstances, passengers hover with a normal position and will not have safety problems. But if the hovering time is too long, or the upside -down hovering of the head, many parks will pay special attention to it. Report to the competent national authority. &quot;Han Zhiyi, a well -known theme park executive, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lin Huanjie, the dean of the China Theme Park Research Institute, reminded that whether it is a small problem or a big accident, when there are accidents such as suspension such as a roller coaster, you should keep it. Calm, wait for the guidance and rescue of the staff, do not shake the body severely because of excitement. &quot;Because people&#39;s excessive reactions may affect the equipment to deal with emergency situations according to the design plan.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73963&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70754&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/dcbccc433c.jpg&quot; IMG- TITLE = &quot;VCG11454610890.jpg&quot; alt = &quot;September 17, 2023, local time, Munich, Germany, a roller coaster at the Breom Festival.

Common sense, &quot;said Hang said. He believes that the wonderfulness of the roller coaster is that every car has almost new experiences, even the same car, and each ride has a different feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This year&#39;s &quot;Eleventh&quot; holiday, Hang Hang took a ejection spin roller coaster in Belgium. In his opinion, this car not only combines the two seemingly unrelated elements of spin and electromagnetic ejection, but also relies on the ups and downs of ups and downs to make the ride experience the throw one by one. &quot;The car body has always been in the irregular spin, you seem to never know what the next spin feels.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This roller coaster also has an electromagnetic electromagnetic electromagnetic electromagnetic In the ejection area, the vehicle is walking to the second section. Relying on a vertical undulating slope, the roller coaster accelerates the weight, and the rolling element is also interspersed in the middle, making people feel like it is in the washing machine. The overall feeling is very comfortable and comfortable, so that Hang &quot;brushed 8 times a day&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Compared to pushing back and explosive power, I especially prefer the weight of the roller coaster. The extreme pleasure, &quot;said Hang. Belgian&#39;s ride experience just satisfied his preference for weightlessness, so he became his &quot;favorite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As for Yang Kaichun, in addition to the ultimate experience on the ride, he also hopes to know it. His exploration topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In terms of orbit, the material is often used for hard steel, but when the roller coaster is twisted, it looks smooth and smooth, and the overall presentation shows A rigid and soft beauty. The rail construction of some large parks can often become landmarks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As a driving car, the ride experience of roller coaster is often closely related to the track. Under different logic, the designer needs not only the ride, not the ride, not The physical safety of the falling must also be considered, and the physical response will be with the physical location of the physical location under the established sprint, rotation or gravity acceleration, and the security boundaries of exploring this reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The body may be hanging at the same gravity acceleration, or like flying, or like a boulder as he is climbing ... I&#39;m curious about this How to produce safety, moderate but exciting feeling. &quot;Yang Kaichun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The ups and downs of the ups and downs when you like to ride the roller coaster can also be immersed in the fun of different themes. Paradments in different countries will have different themes when building roller coasters. For example, most Chinese parks will integrate some traditional cultural elements. Europe and the United States will be linked to Disney and Marvel. With the effects of lighting, VR, and water spraying, roller coasters often like a &quot;fantasy journey&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; More often, both are the happiness brought by the roller coaster. This kind of happiness is not only caused by physiological stimuli, but also the surrounding one. Plant a happy atmosphere. &quot;Whether you have watched the roller coaster or playing with the roller coaster, everyone is very happy. You will be very happy to see so many happy smiles.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73988&quot; group- id = &quot;0&quot; asset -d = &quot;70779&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e246b49.jpeg&quot; IMG- Title = &quot;WeChatimg230.jpeg&quot; alt = &quot;2016, the Six Banner Adventure Park in the United States, the roller coaster&quot; el toro &quot;.

Such equipment will report to China&#39;s special equipment testing agencies at the design stage. Orders are placed in production, and during the production process, special personnel need to be located on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the roller coaster is installed, it is necessary to complete a certain hour of testing according to the requirements of the manufacturer, and then perform air rotation and load test again according to Chinese national standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the device declaration operation stage, in addition to reviewing the filing information, the regulatory authorities will also detect the equipment on the spot. After completion, the qualifications of the test are issued, and there is no safety problem during this time, and the formal operating qualification will be given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the formal operation, in addition to regular inspections such as daily inspections, monthly inspections, annual inspections, the roller coaster will conduct safety management and maintenance of the equipment in accordance with the requirements of the manufacturer. Welcome the random test of the superior units of the park and the corresponding regulatory authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There is a series of institutional files corresponding to the aforementioned security defense line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Many interviewees mentioned that in the management of roller coaster, China&#39;s safety standards are stricter than countries such as Europe, America, Japan and South Korea. &quot;For example, when we play in China, we can&#39;t bring backpacks, mobile phones, keys and other items, but European and American countries are more casual, don&#39;t care much.&quot; Yang Kaichun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lin Huanjie believes that there is a safety problem in the roller coaster, which is generally related to the front-end design flaws, mid-range detection vulnerabilities, and subsequent operation and maintenance maintenance. In reality, &quot;there is a leakage in a certain part of a certain link, and it is difficult to cause large accidents, which often causes security problems to be caused by multiple security checks.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is worth noting that the respondents related to the operation management of the park said that the safety of roller coasters in the real environment is often strictly related to the operator. Regulations to implement inspection, maintenance and maintenance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;For example, some operators do not change some parts to save money. Some problems are also related to the unprofessional operator, no problems can be seen, or it is difficult to strictly implement the regulations in the peak season. &quot;A professional close to special equipment detection agencies revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In November 2023, the State Administration of Market Supervision conducted a major roller coaster inspection nationwide, which emphasized that it is necessary to compact large-scale amusement facilities manufacturing, operation and use Unit safety subject responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, whether the management and operation of the equipment are professional and standardized, it is also related to the scale and conditions of the park where the equipment is located. Many interviewees said that small parks, street heart parks, carnival venues in some cities, because most of the equipment is a non -first -tier brand, and there are fewer rides, and the management operation and maintenance are relatively loose. Compared with the stability of the equipment, the stability of the equipment is Poor safety. Some overseas countries rely on manpower traction roller coasters. In the appearance, the old, rusty roller coasters, or roller coasters with a high talker rate, interviewees do not recommend taking it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When a roller coaster occurs a safety accident, passengers sometimes have certain responsibility. &quot;Once it happened before, a tourist had a lot of cash in the bag. At the moment of the departure of the bag, the bag was taken from the foot of the carriage from the storage cabinet of the platform. Passengers behind. &quot;Han Zhiyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, the aforementioned professionals also introduced that there are multiple high-sensitive sensors on the roller coaster track, and sometimes small objects dropped on passengers will be broken into foreign matter. Identification affects the routine operation of the roller coaster. However, Lin Huanjie said that among the many roller coaster problems, the probability of triggered by tourists is very small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Hang Hang believes that some public currently has some misunderstandings about roller coasters, such as equivalent to the roller coaster with the extreme movement, or the stimulus is dangerous, but &quot;this project is the project, but&quot; this project is the project It is to experience stimuli, not looking for conventional comfort. &quot; In his opinion, in most cases, riding a roller coaster is safe and can bring people some extreme pleasure. &quot;We hope everyone can understand it more comprehensively and enjoy it more relaxed.&quot; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多近的关系，才应该给份子钱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261890]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 13:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; The topics of the money about the money have continued.
