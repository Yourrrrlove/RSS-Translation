Statute; in 2018, the first edition was revised by the Chinese Psychological Society. Both versions of the code have strict regulations on sexual or intimate relationships in the counseling relationship: psychologists shall not have any form of sexual or intimate relationships with those currently seeking professional services or their family members; psychologists shall not engage in sexual or intimate relationships. Professional services are provided to clients in an intimate relationship; within three years after the counseling relationship ends, any form of sexual or intimate relationship with the person seeking professional services or their family members is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that a client and counselor has been involved in controversy over inappropriate intimacy and sexual relations in the Chinese psychology community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, psychological counselor Wang Xingbo was complained to the &quot;Ethics Subcommittee of the Professional Institutions and Professional Registration System of Clinical and Counseling Psychology of the Chinese Psychological Society&quot; for having inappropriate sexual relations with clients. Wang Xingbo was then The registration supervisor for this registration system. After nearly half a year of internal and external investigations and cross-examination by parties, the ethics subcommittee finally confirmed that Wang Xingbo clearly violated the Chinese Psychological Association&#39;s &quot;Ethical Code&quot; and was removed from the registration system. This is the first ethics violation case in the country to be publicized by the registration system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Hunan psychological counselor Luo Dengguo was convicted of forced indecency by the Changsha Intermediate People’s Court in the second instance. The final judgment document of the case shows that since May 2017, the victim Chu sought psychological counseling services from Luo Deng State Office 5 times due to depression and bipolar disorder. During the consultation process, Luo Dengguo took the initiative to talk to the visitors about sex-related topics, and used methods that Chu mistook for psychological treatment, and repeatedly committed indecent acts against the victim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Kaiwen, PhD in clinical psychology from Peking University and founder of DaRu Psychology, is a member of the Psychological Work Consultant Committee and leader of the Ethics Working Group of the Chinese Psychological Society. In 2014, he served as the secretary-general and ethics committee member of the committee. Members of the ethics working group on the Wang Xingbo incident participated in the investigation. He also participated as a team member in the revision of the second edition of the Code of Ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the experience of handling many ethical incidents, Xu Kaiwen summarized five possible situations of sexual and intimate disputes in psychological work, and proposed the handling directions respectively: 1. The counselor did commit sexual assault, which is a criminal offense If there is a problem, judicial channels should be taken; 2. There is an inappropriate sexual relationship during the consultation, which is an ethical issue and needs to be dealt with by professional associations such as the Chinese Psychological Society; 3. Sexual transference occurs during the consultation, that is, an emotional reaction occurs between the client and the consultant. , it is a clinical issue and the counselor can discuss it with the supervisor; 4. The client has delusions of love and may have mental illness and needs psychiatric help; 5. False accusation is a legal issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Li Songwei incident, Xu Kaiwen told Southern Weekend reporters that he would not comment on the incident until the facts are clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of September 2023, Xu Kaiwen accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend regarding possible ethical misconduct and sexual abuse during consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;We have no way to completely determine whether he is completely voluntary&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Wang Xingbo incident in 2014 was the first ethical complaint case regarding inappropriate sexual relations between a counselor and a client that was publicized by the &quot;registration system&quot; in China. As a member of the ethics working group at the time, you were specifically What work was done? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The visitor made a complaint. Based on a large amount of relevant evidence provided by the visitor, we confirmed the facts after nearly a year of investigation and evidence collection. Afterwards, our ethics working group put forward disciplinary opinions in accordance with the &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; after multiple rounds of discussions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When proving that a visitor has been sexually assaulted or harassed , which can be used as evidence? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think this is very difficult, because it is not easy to prove that two people have had sexual relations when they were alone. . However, if the visitor can provide information such as ambiguous text messages, WeChat, and contacts other than the consultation relationship, this can indirectly prove that they have indeed had sexual relations. In this case, it should still be possible to indirectly prove that inappropriate sexual relations did occur. relation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2019 to 2021, you served as a The visitor’s expert witness, what was the situation at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It means that the counselor and the client had inappropriate sexual and intimate relationships, and the client felt hurt, so the client filed a lawsuit A consultant. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Experts assist witnesses in similar sexual controversies What role does it play? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Tell the judge why it is not against his professional ethics for a dentist to fall in love with his patient, but it is not against his professional ethics for a psychological counselor to fall in love with him It is a violation of professional ethics for clients to have sexual and intimate relationships. Because psychological counseling is based on trust, the client candidly show us everything in his heart. First of all, it is not because he trusts us as a person, but because he trusts our profession. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, I had an appendicitis operation under general anesthesia. General anesthesia meant that I completely lost control of my body for about three or four hours. Just kidding. It is said to be &quot;at the mercy of others&quot;. But why was I lying on the operating table &quot;at the mercy of others&quot;? I want to fix my appendicitis. First of all, because I trust my doctor, he will not do anything to harm me because I am unconscious, but will help me instead. But I may not know this doctor at all, so why would I trust someone I don’t know? It&#39;s because I trust the profession, not the person. And there is legal protection here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of psychological counseling is similar to the process of surgery in that only when the client completely trusts us and can confess all the pain, sadness, shame, and hurt he has experienced in front of me, can we It might be possible to help him better. So if we want to win this trust, we must not betray this trust. When a visitor comes to seek help, he must be fragile, he is easily hurt, he is in pain and needs help, so he is in a psychological state. fragile state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trust of our clients in us is the premise and foundation for effective psychological counseling, so this trust must not be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of trust cannot be used to obtain improper benefits. For example, if I do a consultation and I charge him 100 yuan, but the visitor finds it helpful and wants to give me an extra 100 yuan, this is also not allowed. Or he wants to give me an expensive gift to express his gratitude, which is also not allowed. There are additional benefits involved. Because I have mastered your inner secrets, it is theoretically possible for me to use my mastery of your inner secrets to blackmail you into agreeing to some of my inappropriate demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like why teachers in colleges and universities cannot have sex and intimate relationships with students, because he will decide whether you can get credits, whether you can graduate, and whether you can get a degree. This kind of power is not right. Equality may be abused, resulting in improper benefits. In order to avoid this situation, the professional ethics of our industry require that any such improper and additional benefits cannot be obtained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a violation of the &quot;Ethical Code&quot;, even if the client is voluntary, it will be considered a violation of psychological counseling ethics. Because we have no way to completely determine whether he is completely voluntary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You supervised a public welfare psychological counseling project last year. At that time, there was a university A counselor has been accused of sex, can she speak out? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I can’t go into too many details when it comes to the privacy of clients and counselors. To put it simply, it is the client&#39;s belief that the counselor has sexual implications for her. The school conducted a very serious investigation. Of course, whoever accuses has to provide evidence. How do you think the other party sexually harassed you? You need to provide relevant evidence. For example, the teacher sent very ambiguous and sexually charged text messages and WeChat messages to students. These are considered violations of teacher ethics. At least there must be such indirect materials. The student who made the complaint did not provide such evidence, she only talked about her subjective feelings, and no substantive behavior occurred, so of course the accusation is not valid. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/H9QNNJcZX730QWNkD7Mee1KvCKTYL5BiYzSzB16a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/H9QNNJcZX730QWNkD7Mee1KvCKTYL5BiYzSzB16a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253593&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the 2008 American TV series &quot;Inquiry into the Heart&quot;, a case of a female client showing empathy towards a psychological counselor was shown. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Removal from the registration system is the heaviest penalty&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Chinese Psychological Society&#39;s Code of Ethics for Clinical and Counseling Psychology (Second Edition)&quot; involves sexuality There are two rules for relationships. What are the considerations behind these two rules? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The formulation of this rule is actually the consensus of the psychological counseling industry. Regulations like this have long existed abroad. In this sense, they are the result of learning from foreign psychology circles. Such an inappropriate sexual relationship will cause serious physical and mental harm to the visitor, so it is an expressly prohibited behavior. The most important principle in psychological counseling ethics is the principle of benevolence. Maximizing the interests of clients is the first priority and is the purpose of our work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, the &quot;Code of Ethics&quot; and Have the rules around sex changed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Basically not. If anything, behaviors including sex and intimacy electronically are also prohibited and unethical. Cybersex, which does not involve actual physical contact, is also included. In the counseling relationship, any form of sexual and intimate relationship with the client is considered to be exploitative, harmful and exploitative of the client. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to define cybersex? In the absence of physical contact, are confessions, flirtations, ambiguities, etc. on the Internet counted? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are currently no practical cases in this regard. As far as I know, there are currently no relevant legal regulations on cybersex and virtual sex in our country. However, after three years of the epidemic, remote consultations such as Internet phone calls have become more and more developed, so the possibility of such problems becoming more and more likely to occur. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From a psychological point of view, if consultation If a teacher performs inappropriate sexual behavior on a client, what kind of psychological harm will it cause to the client? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the main trauma that may be caused to him is at the level of trust. Because the client believes that we will put his interests first, trust that we will keep his secrets, and we will not use the client&#39;s trust in the counselor to do things that harm him, but all this happens, then he may It will be difficult to build trust with everyone. Because he may have been harmed by others, if this harm occurs again in the counseling relationship, the harm may appear more serious. None of the counselors who should be trusted can be trusted, perhaps all of them, or most of them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Compared to general sexual harassment or assault , when it occurs between counselor and client, will it cause additional harm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No matter what profession, sexual assault or sexual harassment is against the law. If the visitor is non-consensual, it is sexual assault and sexual harassment, which is a legal issue. But if the visitors are voluntary, it may not be a problem in other industries, but for our industry, it is an ethical issue. Because you may have taken advantage of the client&#39;s trust in the psychological counseling profession. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When a female visitor, during the psychological consultation process I feel uncomfortable in this regard. Is there any channel through which I can complain in the psychological counseling industry? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You can complain to the Ethics Working Group of the Clinical Psychology Registration Committee of the Chinese Psychological Society, but the complaint channels may not be very suitable. Because this is the ethics complaint mechanism of an academic organization, it is not a national government agency. If the consultant complained against is not a member of the Clinical Psychology Registration Working Committee of the Chinese Psychological Society, it will be difficult to handle the subsequent complaints. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In other words, in China, if a person Want to become a psychological counselor, but there are no barriers to entry? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. Currently, there are no strict barriers to entry. It turned out that there was a psychological counselor examination from the Ministry of Social Security, but this examination was stopped in 2017. Now, except for those who had obtained the qualification of psychological counselors from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security at that time (psychological counselors), as well as psychiatrists and psychotherapists, other practitioners do not have clear certificates. Our country&#39;s licensing system in this regard has not yet been established. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can it be understood that in the &quot;Registration System&quot; Can these consultants registered here be regarded as regular practitioners? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it is possible, but it cannot be said that only those who work in the &quot;registration system&quot; are formal. There are also a large number of well-trained counselors, including those who have obtained master&#39;s or even doctorate degrees, including those who have returned from studying abroad, as well as counselors with rich clinical experience and good professional ethics, who have not participated in the registration because this is not a mandatory national standard. . So this cannot be the only criterion, but it is a reliable criterion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Code of Ethics&quot; seems to be just an industry restraint, what role can the Chinese Psychological Association play when encountering specific sexual controversies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just like the situation of Wang Moumou (Note: Wang Xingbo) you just mentioned, this should be the most typical Chinese world No. 1 An ethical complaint about inappropriate sexual relations. But what we have done is to remove him permanently, which means that he can no longer be accepted as a registered person in the &quot;registration system&quot; - a registered psychologist or a registered supervisor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is the strictest that can be done now Reaction? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Even if the consultant is removed from the system, the consultant who has been complained Can I still continue my psychological counseling work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, theoretically speaking, this is the case. In fact, the solution should be to establish a license system, just like a doctor has a license. If his license is revoked, he cannot practice medicine. Otherwise, he will practice medicine illegally and may even be held criminally responsible. But we haven&#39;t established a license system yet, so it&#39;s more difficult at this point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Industries with relatively high requirements for moral self-discipline&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some literature believes that sexual ethical aberrations appear as &quot;erotic transference&quot; and &quot;eroticized transference&quot; on the client&#39;s side. This Is it what you call &quot;sexual transference&quot;? Why does sexual transference occur in a counseling relationship? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are various reasons, which may be difficult to summarize in one sentence. For example, if the client has experienced sexual assault, she may develop a mentality that all her value lies in her body, so she will use her body to gain recognition from people with power and authority. It&#39;s a possibility, it&#39;s very individual. So it is difficult to say which one is absolute, it depends on the specific situation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the psychological counseling relationship is also a kind of interpersonal relationship, a professional and professional interpersonal relationship. In the process of psychological consultation and psychotherapy, the counselor will focus on the client, deeply empathize, understand, feel and respond to the client. This is a kind of complete care and unconditional support, which is both professional and There is a certain unreality, because such an almost one-way, client-centered interpersonal relationship is an idealized existence in real life. Because even the closest interpersonal relationships between family members and friends are two-way. While giving and giving, you will also receive the same similar support and rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once interviewed a client who fell in love with her counselor and came to complain. During the consultation, she felt that the counselor was the most understanding and supportive person in the world, and he was also the most considerate. and warm person, so I fell in love with the counselor. But once she enters a relationship or even a marriage, the client soon feels more and more disappointed because she discovers that the person who is completely centered on her will also have emotional demands for herself and cannot fully express herself once she becomes a lover or a couple. Self-centered. This disappointment then led to the breakdown of the marriage, and even led to doubts about the other party&#39;s motives for falling in love with him at that time, and eventually he filed a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This change in feelings from heaven to hell is the inevitable result of crossing the boundaries of the professional counseling relationship and having sex and intimacy. But this does not mean that it is untrue or unscientific for the counseling relationship to provide clients with such a safe, trusting, warm, and supportive relationship. Clients have encountered difficulties and setbacks in their real lives, resulting in psychological pain and distress. , so when people come to seek help, counselors provide them with a psychological healing environment, just like when a person is sick, he needs to live in a very clean hospital ward. Professional doctors and nurses provide professional and scientific medical equipment, environment, nutrition and medicine to help them improve their immunity and restore health. Even when their immunity is low, they have to be admitted to sterile rooms and negative pressure wards. Under the careful care of doctors and nurses, patients can enhance their resistance and restore their immunity. Once you are healthy, you can be discharged from the hospital and live a normal life - in psychological consultation, the client will have the ability to solve his own interpersonal and intimate relationship problems, and the consultation can end at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not wrong for the client to feel that he has fallen in love with the counselor, but it may be an illusion. Counselors need to clearly understand this and work professionally as an important clinical issue in counseling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Does the client need to avoid this kind of sexual transference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think there is some inevitability in the occurrence of sexual transference. It&#39;s not a scary thing, it&#39;s a normal psychological phenomenon. Therefore, if such a situation occurs, it should be discussed and resolved during consultation, which itself is an important issue in consultation. This is a professional question. If a counselor encounters such a problem and has no experience, he can discuss with his supervisor or his superior counselor how to better help the client deal with all this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If the counselor has counter-transference to the client Love, what should I do in this situation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may also happen to counselors. Counselors are also human beings, and they also have emotions and desires, and they also have personal issues that they have not solved well. . He may indeed mistake the client&#39;s sexual transference for love, or even fall in love with the client. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the training and professional ethics of counselors require that we cannot have such sexual and intimate relationships with clients under any circumstances. This is like a law that everyone in this industry implements to the letter. The reason why this article is implemented is because there have been many such situations in the foreign psychology industry before, which have caused great harm to visitors and the reputation of the industry, so it is expressly prohibited. If he can handle such clinical issues well, of course it would be best; if he can&#39;t handle it well, he should find a supervisor; if he still can&#39;t handle it after finding a supervisor, he should stop consulting and then refer the consulting work to a more suitable consultant. Not just keep doing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In this case, the moral self-discipline of counselors is very high? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. Our industry has relatively high requirements for moral self-discipline. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If the counselor issues inappropriate sexual or intimate How can visitors protect themselves during contact invitations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, it is recommended that clients have a clear understanding that sex and intimate relationships that occur in counseling occur in a specific counseling environment. are not completely natural and real emotions, whether the client feels in love with the counselor or the counselor expresses love to the client. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is recommended to inform the counselor that according to the &quot;Code of Ethics&quot;, if the counselor issues an invitation for sexual and intimate relationships, the counselor has violated the relevant regulations and can be asked to stop the relevant behavior. and recommended that he receive supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, if the consultant continues to have relevant words and behaviors, it is recommended to file a complaint with the consultant’s institution. If the consultant himself is the head of the agency, or if this is a private organization, such as the consultant&#39;s personal studio, it is recommended to consider terminating the consulting relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The psychological counseling industry should establish a licensing system&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned that the controversy over sex and intimacy during psychological counseling also involves delusions of love and false accusations. Can you introduce these two situations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Xu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Delusion of love is a serious mental illness. For example, celebrities often fall in love with crazy fans, and the fans think that the celebrity loves him. , in fact, the celebrity has never met him and clearly denies any love for him. This is an example of delusion of love. Delusions are inconsistent with reality and cannot be corrected by reality. Delusions are based on biological genetic factors and do not need to have any realistic basis or psychosocial reasons. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the common motives for false accusations? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The false accusation may be due to dissatisfaction with the consultant. In order to ruin the reputation of the consultant, it is not based on the facts or fabricates some Facts then accuse the counselor. So I say, &quot;Facts are wisdom.&quot; Let’s get the facts straight first. Have you ever had sex or intimate relationships? If so, then the counselor has at least violated ethics and even the law. If this behavior had never happened, then there would be no question of illegality and ethical violation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What price will the false accuser have to pay? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Kaiwen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;False accusations mainly involve issues of reputational rights.

It is indeed very difficult to determine this, and this is obviously not a job that psychologists are good at.

Many clients may not know that sexual relations between counselors and clients violate the ethics of counselors, and this is worth publicizing to the public. Of course, if the visitor knows that he can refuse and knows how to protect himself in a similar situation, this is obviously an effective way. There are cases where counselors actually sexually assault clients, but I think it is still rare. Criminal behavior is a minority after all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When people need psychological counseling services, how to find them?

When I started working as a doctor, the medical industry was not as mature as it is now, so there was a process. We also hope that the media can help our industry call on the country to strengthen legislation in this area. There are legal provisions related to the &quot;Mental Health Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, but they are still not enough for the management of this industry. We especially hope to attract the attention of the government and legal circles and amend the relevant laws. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Mental Health Law&quot; was promulgated 11 years ago and implemented 10 years ago. It is not systematic and comprehensive enough and cannot adapt to modern times. Today&#39;s psychological counseling industry in China is different, and the demand for mental health has greatly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The simplest and most direct solution is to establish a licensing system. Only after obtaining a license can you work as a psychological counselor, and then accept the supervision of the state and industry associations. If there is any behavior that violates ethics, professional ethics and the law, his license will be revoked. If he engages in such work without a license, he is practicing medicine illegally and can be held criminally responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么要讲“科技伦理”？这是攸关文明与人类存续的大事丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258345]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 8, 2023, the official website of the Ministry of Science and Technology announced the &quot;Technology Ethics Review Measures (Trial)&quot;, which stipulates: Units engaged in scientific and technological activities such as life sciences, medicine, and artificial intelligence, if the research content involves sensitive areas of scientific and technological ethics, should establish a scientific and technological ethics (review) committee (Article 4). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This concerning regulation not only reflects that scientific research activities in these fields are highly active and are making visible progress, but also reflects that some scientific research breakthroughs are not only cognitive boundaries, but also ethical boundaries. There is indeed a necessity and urgency to clarify ethical boundaries and build social consensus, because this is not just a matter for individual scientists or the so-called &quot;internal&quot; matter, but a &quot;matter for everyone&quot; involving everyone&#39;s rights. During this period, some misunderstandings about scientific research ethics also need to be analyzed and clarified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, &quot;Scientific research activities are benevolent or at least neutral, so there are no restricted areas for scientific research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientific research is different from scientific research and cannot be generalized. Mathematicians use paper and pencil to perform calculations, while physicists use astronomical telescopes to look into the universe, and use particle accelerators to try to blast apart atomic nuclei to peer into microscopic mysteries. There is no problem in saying that these scientific research are benevolent. It not only expands the boundaries of human cognition and sets a benchmark for truth-seeking, but also has no impact on the values ​​​​that support the survival of human society, but rather adds to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The human trials of drugs, human brain interfaces, artificial wombs, and the manipulation of human embryos and DNA are obviously very different. This kind of scientific research not only directly uses people as research subjects or people themselves as participants, but also the research process and possible results have real and potential major impacts on human society itself, including but not limited to lifestyles and values, and must be treated with caution. Again, proceed cautiously and with social consensus, which is the responsible attitude towards society and civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be more serious, if anti-human elements are allowed to conduct such research and use such discoveries for anti-human purposes, it is not impossible that human society will be destroyed as a result. For example, the cost and acquisition threshold for genetic modification and editing technologies are getting lower and lower, and this technology is not neutral to the survival of human society. Appalling things have happened in the past: using human bodies as test subjects to develop bacterial weapons is a crime against the entire human race. Therefore, in the 1970s, the international community formed the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibited the development, production and stockpiling of such weapons. Nowadays, genetic technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. If such technologies are not regulated, the entire human race will face unprecedented threats. This threat is much higher than the probability of nuclear annihilation. The most terrible thing is not to have risks, but to ignore the risks and fall into arrogance and arrogance. The importance of science and technology ethics can be seen here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, the saying that “scientific research has no restricted areas” is difficult to establish. Scientific research includes research purposes/effects and research methods. In terms of purpose/effect, there are many possibilities such as good/beneficial, neutral, bad/unfavorable, and good/evil/mixed of pros and cons; in terms of means, there are also different situations such as legal, ethical, illegal, and ethical violation. For a specific scientific research field or a specific scientific research activity, should a restricted area be established? What kind of restricted area should be established? Should the restricted area be established from the beginning of the research and development process or should it be established in the dissemination process? The specific scientific research purpose must be systematically measured/ Effects and means cannot be generalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. &quot;Scientific research is a matter for scientists, and the public has no say.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the analysis of the first point, it is not difficult to infer that this point is also untenable. Scientific research activities are high-level cognitive activities that scientists engage in. It is true that they cannot be carried out without a certain amount of talent and professional training. &quot;Debating whether coal should be washed with water or anthracite for rocket launches,&quot; even if professionals reply seriously, they will lose. But beyond that, there are many things that the public or taxpayers have the right to ask about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, if scientific research activities are originally funded by taxpayers’ money, taxpayers certainly have the right to interfere with the rationality of the use of the money, including but not limited to: the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge and the impact of this project on society. What are the benefits and possible impacts on values, whether the cost budget is reasonable, whether the scientific research methods are ethical, and whether the results have achieved the expected goals. If it is private funding, the private sponsor also has the right to ask similar questions. Whoever contributes money has the right to intervene. This reflects the basic ethics of human society: &quot;Being entrusted by others and being loyal to others&quot; is the ethical prerequisite for engaging in any activities, including scientific research activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as mentioned in the first point, if the research field or research activity uses human research objects, or/and has an impact on human life style, values, civilization and even the existence of Homo sapiens as a species, Impact or threat, that is, it is related to everyone&#39;s vital rights and interests. Every member of society has the right to intervene. Research is not funded by taxpayers or &quot;individual freedom&quot; or &quot;scientific research is noble and sacred and an elite activity&quot; are not evading the public. Reason for intervening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, the two major reasons why the public has the right to intervene are the roots of the need for scientific and technological ethics. In this sense, science and technology ethics are not mysterious. They are just the embodiment of universal ethics and values ​​that everyone in human society must follow in the field of scientific research: If any activity you engage in is funded by someone, then you must accept it. Accountability of funders; if the activities you engage in have actual or potential &quot;negative externalities&quot; on third parties or society, you must effectively control them and not do whatever you want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have a halo, but having a halo does not mean that they can ignore ethics, or be dismissive of the public’s right to intervene, thinking that &quot;scientists can just rely on self-discipline.&quot; Scientists are also members of society. They must abide by the ethics that everyone abides by in daily life and follow the guidance of scientific and technological ethics in scientific research activities. Only in this way can scientific research be good and not lose its way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[棉校服里塞碎布条？校服何时成了家长的负担？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258343]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a parent of a student in Dunhua, Jilin, posted a short video saying that his daughter’s school uniform “looks glamorous on the outside but is unpalatable on the inside.” &quot;He will not be allowed to enter the school without wearing a school uniform&quot;, which triggered a heated discussion on the Internet.

It is not difficult to see that parents and students do not have much freedom to choose whether to wear school uniforms or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, in July this year, a middle school in Dongguan, Guangdong issued admission instructions for new students, requiring students to pay more than 4,000 yuan in school uniform fees, which caused controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/246663d7527f58bcab18c4db676eb3e5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; height= &quot;503&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/246663d7527f58bcab18c4db676eb3e5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253591&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Screenshot of school fees&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Dongguan Guangzheng Experimental School WeChat public account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to reduce the burden on parents, the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening the Management of School Uniforms for Primary and Secondary School Students&quot; issued a few years ago mentioned that &quot;students voluntarily purchase school uniforms.&quot; But in practice, school uniforms are often a necessity for school.

Interestingly, Japanese Zhidang research is also troubled by political issues. Although there were scholars like Shigeo Matsueda who were loyal to Chido before the war and began to translate and study it, due to political reasons after World War II, there were very few scholars who studied Chido, and translations were also rare. I have seen only one copy, which is &quot;Essays of Zhou Zuoren&quot; translated by Shigeo Matsueda (Toyamabo Encyclopedia Library, 1996), this book is a new compilation of an old book. After World War II, Matsue also co-translated &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s Hometown&quot;, but his new translation was only this one volume. Hu Shih&#39;s treatment was even worse. Only recently has a biography been published. It was a translation of &quot;Hu Shih and the Chinese Renaissance&quot; by American sinologist Grider, which has been published in China for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after I started graduate school in the mid-1990s, a teacher gave me &quot;The Sorrow of the Oriental People: Zhou Zuoren and Japan&quot; written by Liu Anwei, a PhD student in comparative literature at the University of Tokyo. More than ten years ago, Liu Anwei went a step further and wrote a book called &quot;The Biography of Zhou Zuoren: The Spiritual History of a Literary Man of the Zhini School&quot;, which won the prestigious Watsuji Tetsuro Cultural Award. In order to study Zhitang, Liu Anwei even studied ancient Greek. He discussed the ancient Greek classics translated by Zhitang in the book. This made me curious and wanted to read it in full one day. Recently, Liu Anwei also co-published the Japanese translation of &quot;Reminiscences of Zhitang&quot;, which provides Japanese readers with good biographical information. In addition to Liu Anwei, some Japanese scholars have also been doing Zhitang research in recent years. For example, Professor Ogawa Toshiyasu, who participated in the editing of &quot;Notes from Zhou Zuoren to Shigeo Matsueda&quot;, recently published &quot;Traitor and Hermit: Zhou Zuoren in the 1920s&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, some of Chido&#39;s works have been published in Japanese, such as &quot;Nihon Tan Yi Shu&quot; (Toyo Bunko, 2002) compiled by Chinese literature expert Kiyama Hideo, which includes four &quot;Japanese Glimpses&quot; There are forty-six essays included. As the title of the book indicates, they are all about Japanese culture. The most important one should be the five-volume &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Reading Miscellaneous Notes&quot; compiled by Nakajima Nagabumi, a Chinese literature expert and one of the translators of &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; (Toyo Bunko, 2018). When I saw an advertisement for Toyo Bunko published in the Asahi Shimbun five years ago, the author was shocked because I had the impression that Toyo Bunko had never published five books by the same person. I really admire the courage of this publishing house. After all, it is an old publishing house that has published Japan&#39;s best encyclopedia and &quot;Collected Works of Lin Dafu&quot; and other good books. By chance, I recently borrowed this set of books and read several translations and explanations carefully. I found that it is indeed a good translation that has put a lot of effort into it. It is worth introducing it to domestic readers and seeing how Japanese scholars read it. Zhitang&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/WmMqi6PYTz5zGEB8gOK40WZxUx6wNB8MsL1VybUE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;627&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/WmMqi6PYTz5zGEB8gOK40WZxUx6wNB8MsL1VybUE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253505&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Zuoren and his friends are in Kuyu Zhai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The best Japanese version of Chido&#39;s works&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;We know that Zhitang read countless books throughout his life, and many of the articles he wrote were related to books. In the words of his student Zhang Zhongxing, Zhitang ranks among the best among the older generation in terms of the amount of reading and the variety of reading. Therefore, Professor Nakajima compiled and selected Zhidou&#39;s articles from the perspective of reading. It was a very insightful decision to name this set of books &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Reading Miscellaneous Notes&quot;. It can be said that it captured the main thread of Zhidou&#39;s lifelong pursuit of knowledge. The text used as the translation base was &quot;Zhitang Shuhua&quot; which I had read back then. However, he used a newer version, a two-volume version published by Renmin University of China Press in 2004. The &quot;Chitō Preface and Postscripts&quot; that was published at about the same time as &quot;Chitō Shuhua&quot; was basically not included in the collection, because in Professor Nakajima&#39;s opinion, Chitō wrote the preface and postscript to the books he had personally seen, and as a translator, he had to verify them one by one. It&#39;s not easy, I have to give up. In order to fully reflect the complete picture of Chitou&#39;s works, Professor Nakajima said that he also referred to &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Collected Works&quot;, &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Humanities Collection&quot;, &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Complete Prose Collection&quot; and &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Complete Translations&quot;, which means that it is a fact Above are five volumes selected from all the works. The translator&#39;s seriousness in choosing the original text for translation is truly admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After determining the general direction, how to arrange the specific volumes is also a very difficult matter. After all, the articles written by Zhitang cover a wide range of knowledge and the number of articles is amazing. In his own words, his knowledge is &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;miscellaneous knowledge&quot;. Therefore, Nakajima simply placed the autobiographical article &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot; at the beginning of the first volume. This is the best introduction, allowing Japanese readers who are not familiar with Chido to have an overview of this foreign literati and thinker. learn. After all, compared to his brother, his popularity in Japan is vastly different. Lu Xun&#39;s articles have even been included in Japanese middle school Chinese textbooks. The first volume is after &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot;, and the translator also divided it into sub-categories such as reading theory, banned books, and book records, and included related articles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/BFTwoxiZlzn2Qnf35InJvKi9MDrcUHerQuqXJzTg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;897&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/BFTwoxiZlzn2Qnf35InJvKi9MDrcUHerQuqXJzTg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253506&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two scholars who had a greater influence on Zhou Zuoren are Ailisi on the left and Kunio Yanagida on the right. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second volume is mainly articles related to folk customs. Zhitang&#39;s concern for folk customs lasted throughout his life, and he was a very prominent figure in the history of modern Chinese culture. In Nakajima’s words, in terms of mythology and folklore, Chido can be regarded as the founder of modern Chinese related knowledge. He is not only familiar with the knowledge of the British classical master Ms. Jane Harrison, but also highly respects modern Japanese folklore. Kunio Yanagida, the founder of the school. The third volume includes articles related to women and sexuality. Nakajima said that Chido’s motivation for being very concerned about women and sexual issues is still unclear even now, but at least he was ideologically influenced by the British scholar Ellis. Including relevant articles in the third volume is also a very discerning choice. After all, this is an extremely important part of Zhitang&#39;s lifelong study and thinking. Zhitang said that the one who had the greatest influence on him was Elisabeth. According to Zhang Zhongxing, Zhitang has read more than three million words of Elis&#39;s works, including the seven-volume &quot;Research on Sexual Psychology&quot;, which shows the great influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is no unified standard for the classification of this set of Japanese translations of Chido&#39;s reading miscellanies. Nakajima said that starting from the middle of the third volume, the classification changed from title to classification. He said that it was actually inspired by &quot;I The influence of &quot;Miscellaneous Studies&quot; is basically similar to the classification of Zhitang Shuxue. The fourth volume is composed of Zhitang&#39;s articles discussing old and new Chinese literature. The fifth volume contains many articles about notes, as well as old novels. Zhitang loved to read notes throughout his life. We can know from his collection that he read a large number of notes from past dynasties. Needless to say, his writing style was also affected. Many of his own articles are good notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After carefully reading Professor Nakajima’s selection and classification, the author feels that the articles he selected have included Chido’s lifelong academic thoughts. The author has also read some translations, and the quality is very good. It should be said that these five volumes of translations have provided Japanese readers with trustworthy texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/yviJvXqfXrRQF1Q5rv3EoAwXtz8iZwH82btzm5K3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;838&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/yviJvXqfXrRQF1Q5rv3EoAwXtz8iZwH82btzm5K3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253507&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Anwei from the Institute of Liberal Arts Education, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and his representative work &quot;The Biography of Zhou Zuoren&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Tokyo Institute of Technology website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;An unmissable explanation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Me It turned out that I had been reading Chitou&#39;s works for many years, and I didn&#39;t care if I didn&#39;t read the explanations attached to each book. However, after reading a few pages, I discovered that I was completely wrong. When I patiently read the five-volume commentary, I was first moved by the translator&#39;s efforts, because each commentary was very long, some nearly thirty pages, and the shortest nearly ten pages. In order to make it easier for Japanese readers to read, in addition to introducing a lot of background materials, the most interesting part is the part where Professor Nakajima talks about his views on Chido. There are not only praises, but also sharp criticisms, and some from the Japanese perspective. Some of his profound insights have never been discovered before. Here are some selected ones to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when talking about Zhitang&#39;s concern for mythology and folklore, Nakajima pointed out that Zhitang&#39;s related work was all carried out in his study, and he only collected two hundred works in Shaoxing in 1913. A nursery rhyme. Nakajima said that this was very different from Yanagida Kunio, whom Chitou admired. Yanagida Kunio traveled all over Japan to collect folklore materials and established a set of learning rules for Japanese folklore. Nakajima also pointed out that as both study-type scholars, Chitou is different from Fraser, the author of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, because he does not engage in classification work or analyze data, which means that he does not do systematic work. This point is indeed to the point. Maybe it has something to do with Zhitang&#39;s way of doing academics. After all, he has never felt the need or pressure to write a paper, and has always written in the form of essays. Nakajima&#39;s criticism also made the author have some associations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard a saying before that Zhou Zuoren is known as the best Japanese scholar in China, but he is not a real scholar who studies Japan. At first glance, I was shocked because I instinctively refuted it. Is there any Chinese scholar who knows more about Japanese culture than Chitou? But thinking about it calmly, Chido did not conduct research on Japanese culture by writing a paper. He mainly wrote his observations and analysis of Japanese culture in the form of essays. The same goes for his work on folklore and mythology. Nakajima pointed out that the same characteristics are also reflected in Chido’s focus on and research on women and sexual psychology. He said that Zhitang&#39;s method is based on conscious individuals and is not combined with mass movements, so in practice the effect is zero. In other words, Zhitang wanted to enlighten people through articles, but the result was like waiting for the Yellow River to clear up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/V8zfMLkNUczfDZ2Tuxrg5j0WLCv7gX9cU7keGaF0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/V8zfMLkNUczfDZ2Tuxrg5j0WLCv7gX9cU7keGaF0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253508&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Zuoren in his later years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a saying that the best way to read is to translate. As a translator, Nakajima can be said to have thoroughly read Chido&#39;s major works, and as a result of repeated scrutiny, he has an understanding of Chido&#39;s texts that ordinary readers do not have. For example, one of the issues pointed out by Nakajima, which I have not paid much attention to before, is the understanding of Yanagida Kunio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chido has an article about Yanagida Kunio&#39;s masterpiece &quot;Tono Monogatari&quot;, and the title of the article is &quot;Tono Monogatari&quot;. Nakajima said that when Chitō read Yanagita’s book, he read it in the same way as when he read Hao Yixing and Yu Zhengxie, that is, based on the criteria of thoroughness of thought and readability of the article, but for the most important thing Yanagida’s article wanted to convey, It&#39;s folklore, but I don&#39;t pay too much attention to it, that is to say, I don&#39;t look at it from a cultural perspective. In other words, Chido admits that Yanagita&#39;s book has both the beauty of writing and the value of folklore, but he seems unable to see what he has excavated from Yanagita&#39;s folklore and what he has elaborated on it. Such criticism reminds me of Chido’s own words. He said he just likes to read miscellaneous books and learn more about things. I am neither a scholar nor a scholar, I am just doing odd jobs. Comparing the two sides, it may be easier to understand. Nakajima also said that there is no harm in appreciating Yanagita&#39;s article as a good text, but if the folklore meaning is not read, misunderstandings are likely to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Sino-Japanese relations were deteriorating, Chitou expressed his confusion about his Japanese research. For example, in &quot;Japanese Insights No. 4&quot; written in June 1937, he said that he admired the beautiful Japan cannot be linked to Japan, which invaded China in reality. Chitou confessed that he could not understand Japan like that, and said that he usually felt that the Japanese nation was very different from China, and that was religious beliefs. To borrow Yanagita Kunio&#39;s statement, the Japanese worship rituals often show a state of &quot;harmony between gods and gods&quot;. Chido said that Japan&#39;s upper-class intellectual circles have absorbed Chinese Confucianism and Indian Buddhism, and in modern times have added Western philosophy and science. However, the fundamental belief of the nation seems to be Shintoism from Southeast Asia, which has always dominated the thoughts and feelings of the people. . Nakajima also talked about this part. He said that although Chitou said that he did not understand, in fact, he had basically pointed out the truth of the matter here, because Chitou said that if he could understand the psychology of the strong man who carries the shrine, he would Able to understand Japan&#39;s actions against China. Nakajima said that here Chido finally made full use of Yanagita&#39;s folklore results not from a literary perspective but from a folklore perspective. The analysis of Japan&#39;s invasion of China was not just from the perspective of upper-class politicians, soldiers and intellectuals, but from the perspective of upper-class politicians, soldiers and intellectuals. Turn your attention to the people. Yanagita&#39;s purpose in studying folklore is to unearth those thinking and psychological mechanisms that cannot be simply rationalized. They are accumulated in the unconsciousness of the group and restrict the behavior of the people. Nakajima said that Chido had studied Yanagita for so many years, and now he really understood what Yanagita was talking about. Nakajima&#39;s analysis is indeed very sharp, because this is an issue that is difficult for us Chinese readers to detect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/7foPziv5ixeyj6RBwyROIxk3eYlqFwezpIuIEz8w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height= &quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/7foPziv5ixeyj6RBwyROIxk3eYlqFwezpIuIEz8w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253513&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese scholar Yoshikawa Kojiro. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I remembered the words of another great scholar, Kojiro Yoshikawa, recalling his meeting with Chitō. . At the beginning of the article &quot;The Significance and Methods of Foreign Studies&quot;, Yoshikawa said that he met Chido in Beijing shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. He said Chitou told him that his Japanese studies paid too much attention to the Chinese-influenced aspects of Japanese culture and did not pay enough attention to Japanese religion. These were fatal flaws. Yoshikawa said he answered bluntly that it was indeed the case. In fact, he spoke highly of Chido&#39;s Japanese studies, because in his opinion, most Chinese people at that time did not recognize the uniqueness of Japanese culture, but Chido loved Japan deeply and advocated that Japan had its own culture. In this regard, Yoshikawa believed that Japan People and the Japanese government should express their gratitude. However, in his view, Zhou Zuoren’s Japanese research was actually too biased towards the Heian period, towards the late Edo and Meiji periods of a certain school of literati (should refer to the Shirakaba school), and although these can be said to represent Japanese literature era, but it cannot represent the era of Takeshi in Japan. Even if we cannot say that these are very Chinese parts of Japanese culture, they are indeed an era that Chinese intellectuals can easily understand. Yoshikawa went on to say that Japan still has eras of representative martial arts, such as the Kamakura shogunate, and the religions of Nichiren and Shinran that emerged in the Kamakura period play an important role in Japanese history. These Japanese people are very aware. However, it has been almost completely ignored in Chido&#39;s Japanese studies. The reason for this is that Yoshikawa believes that the Chinese people attach great importance to literature. Japan&#39;s national character of attaching importance to martial arts is inconsistent with Chinese tradition. Yoshikawa said there is another reason, and that is the lack of religion in Chinese culture. Yoshikawa believed that Confucianism was strongly opposed to the idea of ​​finding an ideal world after death, in a super-sensory place separated from the human world. Although this tendency was weakened by the entry of Buddhism, it soon rebounded and was completely finalized by the time of Confucianism in the Song Dynasty. Japan is the opposite of China, and it is here that Japan has its most special place. In Yoshikawa&#39;s view, because Japan was the opposite of China in terms of religion, even the erudite Chido was not interested in it, so his research on Japan was biased, which also led to his inability to understand Japan&#39;s military operations. Yoshikawa even said that Japan’s China studies should take Chido as a lesson and reflect on whether they have made the same mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/QLGfbMLg0t57Taac0rf6AigiLRR5K4hQIArMoTnh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height= &quot;807&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/QLGfbMLg0t57Taac0rf6AigiLRR5K4hQIArMoTnh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jiang Baili. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yoshikawa&#39;s analysis and criticism of Chido&#39;s Japanese studies can be seen together with Nakajima&#39;s More complete. The author believes that Jiang Baili, a contemporary of Chitang, has the most accurate understanding of the martial side of Japanese culture. After all, Jiang Baili had a military background, attended a Japanese military academy, and had some friends in the Japanese military circles. He was very familiar with Japan. The grasp of characteristics is most accurate among Chinese Nippon Tongli, and some views even predicted the outcome of the war. We will understand after reading his &quot;Japanese—A Study of a Foreigner&quot;. Although Chido is proficient in Japanese culture and has many friends in the literary and art circles in Japan, his Japanese studies do have problems with the study style. His misjudgment of the situation may also have something to do with this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Zhitang&#39;s unique literary outlook, of course he will mention his high evaluation of short essays in the late Ming Dynasty. Nakajima&#39;s explanatory essays not only set off a craze in China, but also influenced Chinese literature researchers in Japan across the sea. The author is very ignorant and this is the first time I have heard of this. Nakajima said that as far as he knew, at least two famous scholars were affected. One was Iriya Yoshitaka, and the other was Ogawa Tamaki, who was the first to introduce Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Selected Annotations to Song Poems&quot; in Japan. Yoshitaka Iriya has researched Ming Dynasty literature and is also known for his research on Zen Buddhism. According to Nakajima, Ogawa Tamaki did not directly study the late Ming Dynasty sketch essays, but he always loved reading Chitou&#39;s articles. He followed the lead and collected most of the books mentioned in Chitou&#39;s articles, and now they are all collected in the Ogawa Bunko. Nakajima said that he benefited a lot from Ogawa Bunko when translating. When I read this, I thought it was a coincidence, because I have a set of &quot;Collected Works of Ogawa Tamaki&quot; published by Chikuma Shobo, which is very close to Chido&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/tlWHtV0tNa5wFO8rUzmU751NJYEPwcQ0G0F2ZXMx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height= &quot;766&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/tlWHtV0tNa5wFO8rUzmU751NJYEPwcQ0G0F2ZXMx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253514&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hello Takeuchi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Enlightenment and falling into the water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In summary Zhitang When it comes to the characteristics of a lifetime&#39;s work, Nakajima said it can be summed up in four words: &quot;physical human feelings.&quot; For Zhitang, this &quot;physical favor&quot; is not only the standard of value for judging literary works, but also the standard for judging all things. This point of view is completely consistent with Zhang Zhongxing&#39;s point of view in the article &quot;Re-Talk about Kuyu Zhai&quot;. Nakajima also said that to sum it up in more popular terms is &quot;reasonable thinking and humane feelings&quot;, which is the essence of the Enlightenment spirit that Chido absorbed from his own civilization and foreign ideas. At the same time, this is also the most important prescription Zhitang wants to use to solve China&#39;s fundamental problems. Nakajima said that precisely because of this, his contribution should not be erased because of political missteps. Interestingly, Nakajima changed his tone at this time and talked about the difficulties encountered by this enlightenment spirit in the 21st century. He said that he originally thought that this &quot;physical human relationship&quot; that integrated the essence of Eastern and Western thought would still be effective in another hundred years. However, after entering the 21st century, he found that almost all his ideals were shattered, so he began to doubt whether this enlightenment spirit also had limitations. . The reason for this suspicion is that the Japanese have already led a life of abundant food and clothing, and education is universal. Almost everyone can enter high school, and nearly 60% of them can enter university. Regardless of quality, this is an astonishing number. It stands to reason that this number is very close to the ideals held by people with lofty ideals in modern times, but irresponsibility is prevalent in society where no one is responsible (this is reminiscent of the &quot;irresponsibility system&quot; said by the famous political thinker Maruyama Masao) ), the democratic system seems to have turned into populism, which can be said to have the tendency of obscurantism. In this case, how to promote &quot;physical favors&quot;? If that were the case, wouldn’t all the efforts of the enlightenment sages back then be in vain? This question is too big, and I am not capable of answering it. However, Nakajima is very keenly aware of the serious problems that modern enlightenment may bring. Adorno and Horkheimer, who wrote &quot;Dialectics of Enlightenment&quot;, have long warned about this. , Nakajima is just repeating an old story. However, he was able to discuss the enlightenment concept of &quot;physical human relations&quot; together with the enlightenment trends in modern times, which shows his broad vision, because after all, our enlightenment is closely related to the West. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to write about Zhitang without mentioning his falling into the water. As mentioned earlier, Professor Nakajima believes that he cannot be completely dismissed because of this incident. This is consistent with the spirit of Mr. Zhong Shuhe’s saying that people should return to their own people and the article should return to the article. But how do you view this matter from a Japanese perspective? I remember that many years ago when I was reading Takeuchi Yoshi&#39;s &quot;Inside China&quot;, I saw him mention Chitou, and he said that we Japanese were sorry for him. Professor Nakajima said something similar in the explanation, but more specific, which moved me as a Chinese reader very much. He said that it was our grandfathers and fathers’ generation who carried Chitou out like a scarecrow in a wind and rain festival, made him sit on the shrine, and then threw it to the roadside outside the village. In other words, the great-grandfathers or great-grandfathers’ parents of those working in society today. Their names cannot be remembered, but they are all Japanese. We should not forget this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter what the external reasons are, it is Chitou’s own judgment after all, and the blame cannot be placed on others. However, the opinions of Takeuchi Yoshi and Nakajima Nagafumi, two Japanese scholars who have studied Chinese culture all their lives, If there is any Zhitang who knows this, he will definitely be very moved by these words. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Something about the translator of Zhitang&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After reading Professor Nakajima’s last explanation, I felt particularly respectful. He said that this translation work was originally proposed by the editor of Pingfanshe in 2005, and it took a total of 13 years. It was really a long and protracted battle. Considering his physical strength and age, it was not easy to last until the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Japanese Chido translators, he highlighted Shigeo Matsueda and Hideo Kiyama and paid tribute to them. In his later years, when sorting out Chitou&#39;s letters, Matsueda Shigeo once said, &quot;Half of his life, he fell in love with the Dream of Red Mansions, but his whole life, he fell in love with Zhou Zuoren.&quot; The former refers to his translation of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, and the latter, of course, refers to the correspondence between him and Chitou from their student days to Chitou&#39;s later years. Communicated. It is said that Matsueda Shigeo once planned to translate all of Chido&#39;s works, but was unable to realize this long-cherished wish. In 1973, his student Hideo Kiyama collected Chido&#39;s articles on Japanese culture and compiled them into the book &quot;Japanese Culture&quot;, which was the predecessor of &quot;Nihon Tan Yoshiro&quot; included in Toyo Bunko. Mushan also interviewed insiders and wrote a book about Zhitang&#39;s fall into the water, &quot;The whole story of Zhou Zuoren&#39;s cooperation with Japan - Supplementary Notes and Sequels to &quot;The Story of Kuzhu&#39;an in Beijing&quot;&quot;, which is unavoidable for all readers who are interested in that period of history. past works. He also assisted his octogenarian teacher in compiling and publishing the &quot;Essays of Zhou Zuoren&quot; mentioned earlier, which included thirty-nine famous articles written by Zhitang up to the 1930s. In addition to translation, Mr. Matsue, who rarely writes, wrote an article &quot;Mr. Zhou Zuoren&quot;. Although it was written in 1941, it is one of the best articles about Zhitang that the author has seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading Zhitang’s articles for so many years, I finally have the opportunity to write about Zhitang. It is still the old saying of Mr. Zhong Shuhe, people will return to their people, and the article will return to the article. Zhitang&#39;s political mistakes are indeed regrettable and make the readers who admire him feel worthless for him, because Hu Shi said that a wise man should understand lightly. and serious, but he made a judgment that shocked the people of the country. But his works have their own value of being handed down from generation to generation. After all, Zhitang left a valuable asset to the history of Chinese culture and thought, and some of his ideas still retain their brilliance. It is said that after Hu Shi returned to Taiwan in the 1950s, he asked people to collect Zhitang&#39;s works everywhere. He said that the works of this old friend were still worth reading since the May Fourth Movement. Although it is not without exaggeration, it also tells the undeniable truth. The work of Japanese scholars introduced in this article can also provide us with some new ideas for understanding Zhitang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[解构“讲课费”，数读藏起来的医药腐败丨H5]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258351]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打击缅北电诈有重要突破！揪出幕后“金主”、组织头目23名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258333]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;span>;From June 25 to September 30 this year, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Public Security Based on the characteristics of public security and the security and stability situation, we coordinated and directed the public security organs across the country to mobilize all police officers and go all out to carry out a summer public security crackdown and rectification operation to crack down on various illegal crimes and severely rectify outstanding public security problems, referred to as &quot;Summer Operation&quot;.

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;对阅片无&lt;/span>;数的观众来说，《有生之年》的故事并不陌生，它和电影《一个叫欧维的男人决定去死》类似，也依托于一个“轻生”的念头。由男主角的视角引入，剥开平淡的日常，关照人与人之间的紧密联系，继而得出结论——这种联系既是困局，也是港湾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/72b9154b128945f585394a4613352694.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;高嘉岳与女友分道扬镳，却一直搞不懂自己的问题出在哪儿，女友嘲讽他：“你这辈子都不会懂我在说什么，但你可以考虑重新投胎，可能下辈子就会懂了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/1f4c7850048146d8a0d6da9400ad6164.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;只不过《俗女养成记》里，对中年女性的困境是直给的，女主对自己的人生窘境有着清晰的认识，会毫&lt;span>;无顾忌地放声大哭。而《有生之年》对于男主的境遇刻画，则内敛许多，更符合“男儿有泪不轻弹”的印象。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/be0777d754785d01a6d9e3d1417dc2ca.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;就连小侄子高丞佑，都在用自己的方式关心高嘉岳。高丞佑不小心看到了高嘉岳的遗书，但没有戳破大伯的秘密，而是把自己的“网络女友”介绍给大伯，想要满足高嘉岳“好好谈场恋爱”的愿望。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/e8a28e183c4bb2461544c634660d2595.png&quot;

It may sound a bit confusing at first, but in fact it explains the truth of life very clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it simply, a person should try his best to age slowly, keep his mind young, live a quality and glorious life, and once he faces death and there is no way to recover, he should have a good time. , be optimistic about life, and don’t go against objective laws and make meaningless “struggles”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend talked about an incident. An old man had entered the last moments of his life, and a relative with whom he had a very good relationship was out of town. The old man’s children considered letting them see each other for the last time, so they prepared to use the ultimate method to Medical means extend the life of the old man and let him &quot;wait&quot; for his arrival. He considered and refused again and again, on the grounds that it would add unnecessary pain to the old man before he died. Even if it &quot;makes sense&quot; to him, it&#39;s not humane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone is afraid of the word &quot;old&quot;. Many people are desperately looking for beauty treatments, no matter how much money they spend, they are not afraid of getting old. There are also many people who are obviously old, but they are taboo about being called &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;. But physical aging is an objective law that no one can resist. &quot;Are you young? It doesn&#39;t matter, you will be old in two years.&quot; Zhang Ailing&#39;s famous saying fully expresses the impact of the law of aging on the illusion of &quot;eternal youth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Old&quot; can be divided into two situations. One is that the body ages and the body functions become weaker. The original straight back has collapsed, the original beautiful features have turned into a &quot;mess&quot;, the original speedy steps have turned into slowly moving steps with a cane... The second is psychological or spiritual aging. Some people have a good mentality and appear young, even if they are seventy or eighty years old, they are not old. Some people age faster than their peers under heavy pressure. The so-called &quot;a 30-year-old has a 60-year-old heart&quot; and &quot;premature aging&quot; all have this meaning. The latter type of people is actually more common. Their hallmark is that they want to work hard on the &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; every day, and they also frown and sigh all day long, accompanied by white hair and wrinkled faces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who are not involved in childbirth and are pampered, it is relatively easy to achieve the goal of aging slower. Even at different stages of a person, there are big differences. For example, the &quot;Sha Wujing&quot; who was leisurely swimming in the Liusha River back then must be more beautiful than the Sha Wujing who was walking on the road to seek Buddhist scriptures, eating and sleeping in the open and carrying everyone&#39;s luggage on his shoulders. Appear youthful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most people cannot have freedom of wealth, nor can they rely on others to support themselves without working. This will inevitably lead to people plotting for rice and trying their best to get tomorrow’s steamed buns. Because in reality, it is not easy to make a living, and there are all kinds of internal and external frictions all the time, so there are nine out of ten people who are exhausted both mentally and physically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What to do? As ordinary people, since we cannot change our situation, the only thing we can do is to take it lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once had a neighbor who was in his nineties and could ride a bicycle very fast. Why? In fact, he was not strong when he was young. Instead, he had problems here and there, but he just had a good mentality. Whether you encounter a small trouble or encounter a hurdle that others may think is almost insurmountable, you should be able to deal with it calmly, think less, and worry less. Such people should live longer. &quot;Be heartless and live a long life&quot; may not sound good, but the words are rough and rational, and the mentality of &quot;if you can afford it, let it go&quot; is worth learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person should work hard when working, and should also &quot;try hard&quot; to rest when resting. That is, he should neither be distracted when he should be working, always thinking about lying down, nor should he be lying down when he should be working. I always think about work when I am resting, and as a result, my work is not good and my rest is not good either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can enter the world and you can emerge from it. This is the highest state of life. It seems difficult to achieve, but it is not. How to work and how to rest is a science. As an individual, you must learn to adjust, relax the tight strings in a timely manner, balance work with rest, and laugh at gains and losses. This is a skill that can be mastered. If you can&#39;t do it the first time, do it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are afraid of old age and even talk about death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Speaking of &quot;die faster&quot;, this does not conform to the philosophy of many Chinese people. In contrast, it is greed for life and fear of death. Even if you die a moment later, it seems to be good. This is instinctive and understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to die slowly, many people (mainly family members of the deceased) do whatever they can to survive. As long as they can breathe one more breath in the human world, they are willing to suffer all kinds of hardships. This mentality has far-reaching influence. Most of the savings of many people&#39;s lives are not spent while enjoying life and raising children, but are thrown into the water in a &quot;surprise attack&quot; one or two months before death. Death is already an irreversible outcome. No matter how much money is spent, it is in vain. At most, it can delay the death a little. In the end, one person will lose both his life and property, and even his children and grandchildren will be burdened with heavy debts. It is really not worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of disease, some people are even &quot;scared to death&quot;. As soon as they heard that they had an incurable disease, they would fall into a state of panic and disorder, causing physical and mental harm and exacerbating physical diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult thing in life is to remain transparent on the subject of death. If a slower death equals long-term torture—including torture for children—then the meaning of life will also change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father told me that there was an old lady in the family who lived alone and lived to a ripe old age. She had done &quot;white things&quot; during her lifetime, and she became a favorite story in the village. If a person has seen through life and death, and the true meaning of &quot;disappearance&quot;, what is there to be afraid of, and why must he do it even though he knows it cannot be done? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To let go of life calmly is a kind of great love. It’s not about going against the trend and forcibly delaying death, it’s about cherishing life. Knowing the deadline, waving your hands and going away, isn’t it a kind of optimism towards life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is no need to doubt the significance of saving lives and healing the wounded. Reducing illness and pain in life is a legitimate pursuit. But what we need to take warning from is gambling-like “fighting” in order to die slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are reports that after someone learned that he had terminal cancer, he specifically told his closest relatives not to needless treatment, let alone to &quot;intubate&quot; himself when he was dying, so as not to spend more money. . Having such an open heart is a rational choice after insight. Of course, financial hardship is also one of the reasons, but in general, it is still based on optimism about life and great love for family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To grow old slowly and die quickly is my creed and pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有冇蛋散？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257980]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/LSoqRSrnSyZBlr1s57t36ByNrvH2VbqJ0Lb9A70o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LSoqRSrnSyZBlr1s57t36ByNrvH2Vb qJ0Lb9A70o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Song Dong&#39;s work &quot;You Are There&quot;.

They were wearing uniform white short T-shirts. It was probably a summer vacation activity organized by a nearby school. On August 29, 2023, the second GDMoA Annual Artist Academic Nomination Exhibition was launched at the Guangdong Museum of Art and will last until October 8. The works of the 21 nominated artists are displayed in several exhibition halls on two floors. They are rich in types and styles, attracting a steady stream of visitors. For several consecutive weekends, the admission quota for 1,000 people every half day has been reserved early, and there is a long queue at the entrance of the Guangdong Museum of Art. When the crowds are the strongest, it takes an hour to queue to enter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most photographed exhibit on social media in this exhibition is the &quot;big egg powder&quot; in front of these students. It was made by artist Feng Yu using bamboo curtains and wooden frames, and is called &quot;Wei&quot;. The work is introduced as &quot;an exploration of ancient space emotions, and also an extreme mechanical challenge to traditional Chinese soft materials.&quot; The bamboo curtains and wooden frames are curled and twisted to form several looping and twisting pipes, occupying nearly half of the venue, standing tall and full to the left and right. The promotion speech written by Zhang Zikang, director of the Central Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum, described it this way, &quot;The artist uses the relaxing combination of the movement rhythm of Chinese calligraphy to form a unique spatial scale experience and emotional experience. Every viewer will have a different feeling when entering it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feng Yu’s work &quot;Wei&quot; is called &quot;Dan San&quot; on social media and is widely circulated&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Lang/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the feedback, in the audience’s feelings, it has derived an image that is more suitable for the Internet context - Dansan. Egg powder is a traditional snack in Guangdong. It is made of flour, gluten flour, eggs and lard, fried in oil until light yellow, scooped up and dipped in maltose before eating. In Cantonese, Dan San also refers to a timid or unpromising little person, taking his characteristic of being &quot;not strong enough&quot;. The color of the bamboo curtain and wooden frame is very similar to the light yellow color of the eggs when they come out of the pot, and the irregular bends are like the appearance of the eggs on the plate. Compared with the words in the recommendation, &quot;This spatial art installation will no longer be retained as the exhibition closes. Just like fireworks and life, no matter how gorgeous and bright they are, they will eventually pass away with the wind...&quot;, it is obvious that &quot;the eggs are scattered&quot; Closer to young people’s daily experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A work that is also highly visible on the Internet is the artist Song Dong&#39;s &quot;You&quot;, which is very Cantonese from its name - &quot;无&quot; comes from Cantonese, pronounced mǎo, meaning nothing, This word was first seen in &quot;Guangdong Tongzhi&quot; compiled by Huang Zuo during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty. From the perspective of word creation, the word &quot;无&quot; is the provincial meaning of the word &quot;有&quot;. Song Dong, who was born and raised in Beijing, has a close connection with Guangdong. His works were included in the first Guangzhou Art Biennale as early as 1992. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Guangzhou Fei Art Museum invited Song Dong to hold a solo exhibition. He walked around the vegetable market next to the art museum for a long time and thought that the smoky-looking vegetable market should not be separated from the tall Class A office buildings and private art museums next door. Can you make an unbounded wall? So, he built a 106-meter wall made of old windows. It was made of glass and walls. Various exhibitions could be held inside. The name of the work was &quot;Wall without Borders&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The art museum invites residents from surrounding communities to put in small items that they are reluctant to throw away at home, including Teresa Teng’s audio tapes, thermos bottles with double happiness printed on them, and even BB cameras. During the launch, the museum held a long street banquet. Everyone gathered around the 106-meter wall and chatted while eating Poon Choi: &quot;Where is the boundary between life and art?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Have You&quot;, Song Dong continued his previous style. A rectangular fishing net is pulled out on the second floor of the art museum, and it is covered with about 200 old mirrors. They have different shapes, but they have a unified sense of age. On the back of the mirror are yellowed figure paintings, calendar scenery, and various block letters. words, or clean and old brown wooden boards. When you stand under the work and look up, you will see yourself in the mirror, caught in a fishing net, with age symbols on the left and right. This is where different eras, regions and yourself come together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Dong wrote: &quot;The title of &quot;You&quot; uses the local characters of Guangdong, expressing the juxtaposition of the words &#39;have&#39; and &#39;no&#39; to form the title. I have always believed that nothing is the ultimate The big being is the great nothing. The mirror is not only an indispensable object in life, but also a philosophical object for thinking and understanding. I have been asking &#39;what is a mirror&#39; for a long time, and I think &#39;everything is Mirror&#39;, the mirror divides the world into real and virtual, existence and non-existence. It also integrates real and virtual, existence and non-existence into one place. It is the critical interface between &#39;being&#39; and &#39;empty&#39;. I use a big net to catch The collected mirrors form a &#39;diaphragm&#39;, dividing the space into virtual and real worlds. These mirrors have seen different people and objects, and they are constantly refreshed and vacated. As the saying goes: everything is a mirror body and place. , catching all emptiness and nothingness in one sweep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This thinking text received another interpretation from the students. After they stared at the &quot;Egg Powder&quot; for a few minutes, the teacher asked: &quot;Do you want to go in and have a look? The original intention of this artwork is to hope that the audience can walk among it, interact with the work, feel the changes in the space, and have different emotional experiences.&quot; . Do you think so?&quot; After receiving a unanimous nod, she said with a smile: &quot;But now it&#39;s blocked and you can&#39;t get in. Let&#39;s just close our eyes, imagine, and pretend we&#39;re walking through it. Come on, let&#39;s start. ——&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really closed their eyes and entered a kind of existence and non-being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 13:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最后的“老猎”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258331]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 12:10:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[放下猎枪20年：使鹿鄂温克人的现代化之路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258325]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021856083094&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;China&#39;s last hunting tribe, raising reindeer in the Daxingan Mountains.mov&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/axGGjfymsBkbfbnrKyhAdFttnt16PyWWEfk3fGGH.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/d97a528f5576678021856083094/ lX55HJ107gwA.mov&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot; 360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/d97a528f5576678021856083094/lX55HJ107gwA.mov&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A kind of turbulence The infectious disease is spreading among the reindeer in Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of July 18, 2023, veterinarian Lao Ge received a notice from the village that four reindeer had died in a row at a tourist spot, and he had to go check what was going on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aoxiang, the full name is Aoluguya Ewenki National Township. Driving 250 kilometers northeast from Hailar, the central city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, is Genhe, the county-level city where Aoxiang is located. It borders Mohe, the northernmost part of China, and is the &quot;China Cold Pole&quot; certified by &lt;span>;National Climate Center&lt;/span>; ”——The annual average temperature is minus 5.3 degrees Celsius, and the heating period is 9 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Genhe, the name that is more famous than &quot;China&#39;s Cold Pole&quot; is undoubtedly &quot;Ewenki&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki are one of the ethnic groups with a small population in China. According to statistics from the seventh census, there are 34,617 people in this ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, there were three tribes of the Ewenki people. Among them, the safari Yakuts are called the &quot;deer tribe&quot; because they raise reindeer. The Ewenki people in Aoxiang are descendants of the Shilu tribe, also known as the Shilu Ewenki people. Their population has always hovered between one and two hundred people. They are the smallest micro-group within the tribe and the only ethnic group that raises reindeer in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rudolph the Red-Nosed, who pulls Santa’s sleigh, is the star among the reindeer. This is an animal that lives in the tundra around the Arctic Circle. Its two towering antlers are more than one meter long and have many branches like tree branches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reindeer in Aoxiang are facing a survival crisis. Lao Ge judged that the reindeer that died this time had a high probability of suffering from a blood parasitic disease with a very high fatality rate. He was &quot;not surprised&quot; by this situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In 2003, Genhe implemented the &quot;ecological immigration&quot; policy. The Evenki people who originally lived in the deep forests put down their shotguns and went down the mountains to settle. Lao Ge suspected that the reindeer&#39;s illness may be related to the small animals that come with tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the Ewenki people are called &quot;China&#39;s last hunting nation.&quot; Today&#39;s Ewenki people are ending hunting and embracing a modern lifestyle. They also face the process of adaptation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for this micro-ethnic group, which has been maintained at a scale of a hundred people for a long time, it is also a choice that must be made in order to survive and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 18, 2023, tourists fed reindeer in the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I miss you very much in Aoluguya&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Ewenki originally means &quot;people who live in the mountains and forests.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, both humans and deer lived in the deep forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and reindeer had never been heard of contracting infectious diseases. &quot;It&#39;s hard for reindeer to work in the mountains.&quot; Lao Ge sighed, &quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do to make money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being a veterinarian, Lao Ge also has another identity - the operator of the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. By. On the way to see a doctor, his cell phone rang almost every ten minutes. Most of the calls were made by acquaintances who wanted to waive the 70 yuan ticket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors who visit the reindeer park for the first time are often surprised: the reindeer roam freely in the scenic area without fences, and people can freely have close contact with them. If you spend 20 yuan to buy a basket of fresh moss, you will soon be stared at by the reindeer&#39;s big round eyes, its round and soft nose will come over, and it will dig straight into the basket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff teaches tourists how to take very dynamic photos: lift a bamboo basket filled with moss above your head and run, and the herd of reindeer will follow obediently. However, most tourists were so frightened that they dropped their bamboo baskets on the ground when they heard the hoofbeats of the reindeer behind them. At this time, you can always hear the staff shouting from behind, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, don&#39;t be afraid, the reindeer will not hurt people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides the reindeer, Lao Ge himself is considered the second &quot;star&quot; in the reindeer park. &quot;. He is 51 years old, a mixed race of Ewenki and Russian, with curly silver hair, a high nose bridge, deep eye sockets, and bronze skin. It is said that he looked like the French movie star Alain Delon when he was young. Tourists who have done some planning in advance often take photos with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If reporters visit, the local propaganda department will most likely bring them to Lao Ge. He has a strong desire for expression and a vivid Northeastern dialect, which always makes reporters come home with a full load. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time, tourists can find him in the most luxurious hotel in the park. Choluozi is the traditional residence of the Ewenki people in the mountains and forests. More than ten pine trees are intertwined to form a cone shape, and a layer of birch bark is spread outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why the tuoluozi is said to be &quot;luxurious&quot; is because the birch bark is densely surrounded by a layer of roe deer skin. There are dozens of them. According to Lao Ge, the cost is &quot;worth seventy-eight dollars at least.&quot; Ten thousand&quot;. In the past, that was a treatment enjoyed only by &quot;old hunters&quot; (the term given to experienced hunters). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going west from Luyuan, less than 10 minutes’ drive by sightseeing bus, you will find the settlement of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2003, the Evenki hunters had just moved to this settlement. There were 62 bungalows with red roofs and white walls in the settlement. In 2008, in order to develop tourism, the Aoxiang government renovated the house and specially invited a Finnish construction company to design it. The exterior facade was covered with dark brown wooden boards and the sloping eaves were wider, aiming to create a &quot;Nordic style&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, except for a dozen families who still live here, most families have moved into residential communities in Genhe City. Their houses in Aoxiang have been converted into B&amp;Bs and specialty shops. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I miss you in Aoluguya&quot; - the now pervasive Internet celebrity street signs have also invaded Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the street sign is the most conspicuous house with a huge reindeer mural painted on the exterior wall. It is a B&amp;B run by Yang Lan, the granddaughter of Maria Suo, &quot;the last female chief in China&quot; . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maria Suo is the prototype of the protagonist in Chi Zijian&#39;s novel &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. She died on August 20, 2022, at the age of 101. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many tourists are attracted by the old man’s legendary experience and follow his footsteps. On a sightseeing bus, the tour guide told the tourists the story of Maria Soo adopting a dozen orphans. &quot;How come I didn&#39;t see any of them?&quot; the sightseeing bus driver muttered after hearing this fictional story. The title of &quot;the last female chief&quot; is somewhat of a packaging color. There is no chief among the Ewenki people, but Maria Suo is indeed the most respected elder among the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Can&#39;t you tell some true stories?&quot; However, for this driver, there is nothing to complain about. Driving a sightseeing bus in scenic spots gives him an extra 3,000 yuan in monthly income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to climate restrictions, Aoxiang’s tourist season is short. In previous years, Aoxiang’s attractions were only open from June 1st to October 8th. In 2023, due to the influence of the Zibo Barbecue Fever, the working season of the reindeer was advanced one month. At the end of April, before the snow had completely melted, the scenic spot opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1099&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Migration route map of the Ewenki people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The third settlement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the tourist season, Whenever he gets the chance, Lao Ge still likes to jump to the deer spot on the mountain. There was no cell phone signal there, and no one could find him. It was quiet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the 32 reindeer that come down the mountain to &quot;work&quot;, most of Laoge&#39;s reindeer are still herding deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After some hunters came down to settle down in the mountains, they still maintained &quot;deer spots&quot; where reindeer were grazed on the mountains. Officially, Deer Point is also called Hunters Point to distinguish it from the settlements at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 26, 2023, Lao Ge set off from Aoxiang, traveled more than 200 kilometers north to Alongshan Town, and then drove into the forest fire road from the only main street in the town. On the road, birch trees and larches are scattered at random, rose-red willows grow wildly on the roadside, and sables pass quickly in front of the car from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Walking another 60 kilometers along the fire road, you can reach his deer spot, a place that cannot be pinpointed on the map. Lao Ge hired four relatives to take turns guarding the more than 180 reindeer on the mountain. As soon as we got off the car, the air was filled with a strong scent of pine. Four or five hounds approached Lao Ge with their tails wagging, and the sound of deer bells could be heard in the nearby woods. This is the environment the Evenki people are most familiar with. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, the Ewenki were divided into three tribes: Solon, Tungus and Yakut, each engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting. In 1957, after ethnic identification, these three tribes were collectively called the Ewenki. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv Guangtian, an ethnology scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has verified that as early as 2000 BC, the ancestors of the Evenki people lived on the shores of Lake Transbaikal and Lake Baikal. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Shilu Ewenki people (hereinafter the Ewenki people are specifically referred to as the &quot;Shilu tribe&quot;) came to the Greater Khingan Mountains on the right bank of the Ergun River, the border river between China and Russia, and never left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People living in the mountains and forests&quot; began to descend from the mountains after the founding of New China. At that time, the Ewenki people were hunting on the right bank of the Ergun River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region approved the establishment of Qigan Ewenki National Township. Since then, allowing the Evenki people to settle has become a goal that the party committee and government hope to achieve. After the government built the wooden house (a typical Russian dwelling made of wood and mud), the Ewenki people had a place to settle for the first time. However, although they have a home at the foot of the mountain, except for the township head and the director of the supply and marketing cooperative who live there all year round, the rest of them live in a state of settlement and hunting. They hunt in the mountains for a long time and occasionally live at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, the Ewenki settlement moved eastward from Qigan to a place 17 kilometers north of Mangui Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi, who once served as deputy director of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Genhe City, is a researcher of Ewenki culture. He said that the location of the relocation was very particular: in order to resolve the conflict between hunting and settlement, the settlement was chosen to be close to the hunting grounds and suitable for reindeer living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is the original and real Aoxiang, so named because it is surrounded by the Aoluguya River. In the Ewenki language, &quot;Aoluguya&quot; means a place with lush poplar trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to distinguish it from Aoxiang after the relocation in 2003, the settlement chosen at that time was habitually called &quot;Old Aoxiang&quot;. For the Ewenki people, the period after the relocation was their &quot;golden years.&quot; Schools, grain depots, post offices, hospitals, cultural stations and banks were built where 126 Evenki people originally lived. In order to develop the economy, the township has also set up wood processing plants, hunting production teams and ethnic trading companies. Foreigners also came. At its peak, there were more than 500 people living in Lao Ao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi recalled that in Lao Ao Township, the Ewenki people were considered &quot;nobles&quot;. Maria Suo&#39;s family became the first 10,000-yuan household in the township in the 1980s. Many Ewenki families have bought cameras, bicycles, and &quot;several watches.&quot; It does not cost money to go to school and see a doctor, and students can also receive living allowances. &quot;All outsiders are willing to marry Ewenki people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, young Ewenki people had settled at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Kong Fanzhi, by the 1980s, 40 of the 71 Ewenki adults in Aoxiang had jobs, becoming the first generation of teachers, doctors, drivers, and waiters among the tribe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;However, nearly 40 years after moving to Lao Ao Township, the public facilities have begun to age, the government buildings have cracked, and the power grid and dams need to be repaired. The repair cost is estimated to be more than 10 million yuan, which is greatly exceeded. Root River&#39;s financial ability to pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, the State Council launched the Western Development Plan, with funds earmarked for ecological migration. Therefore, the leaders of Genhe City decided that instead of repairing in situ, it would be better to apply for &quot;ecological immigration&quot;, and the funds would also come from a source. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leader’s idea led to the third settlement in the history of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;At 8 a.m. on August 10, 2003, the first batch of relocated 11 households with 37 people and 260 reindeer took 12 Dongfeng extended vehicles and headed for the new rural address more than 200 kilometers away. ——Departs from a place only 4 kilometers away from Genhe city. Teams organized by towns along the way lined the road to see off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Genhe City Chronicle records that at 4 p.m., the convoy arrived at the new Aoxiang in the drizzle. &quot;The new township site had colorful flags flying, gongs and drums roaring, and two elderly yangko teams singing and dancing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten days before the move, Kong Fanzhi started busy receiving reporters. They recorded the last class of the school in Lao Ao Township, the &quot;minimum post office&quot; with only one employee, and the last bonfire before departure. Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Return to hometown after one day down the mountain&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This relocation attracted Xie Yuanyuan, a Ph.D. in sociology from Peking University. On September 18, 2003, she arrived in Aoxiang and began a one-year field investigation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What aroused her interest was the reversal of the hunters&#39; emotions. Before setting off, she noticed the report in &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, the title was &quot;&lt;/span>;China&#39;s last hunting nation&lt;span>;The Ewenki people returned home after just one day of going down the mountain.

Some hunters made a rough calculation: the annual income of a reindeer is about &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;200 Yuan &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; no &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; investment when raising stock in the mountains. After going down the mountain, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;we have to &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reindeer &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; in captivity &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; just the feed money, every day A reindeer costs thousands of dollars every year. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Originally, what the government promised was that the hunters would move, the reindeer would be kept in captivity, and someone would feed them. “The hunters would just hold the wine bottle and watch the reindeer smile.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reality is that there is no feed at all in the rows of deer pens blocked by brick-red barbed wire in the settlement. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;During the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, some reindeer were lost, injured, and some were not used to eating bean cakes and choked to death. A total of more than 90 reindeer were lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Li Mengchu, chairman of the Aoxiang People’s Congress, was the Minister of Armed Forces of Aoxiang at the time. He recalled that at that time, the township government mobilized cadres to go up the mountain to collect moss, mushrooms and willow twigs. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A reindeer can eat a sack of moss in a day&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, which is equivalent to what one person can harvest in a day. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A few days later, the hunters &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; took the deer out of the deer pen and led &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; back to the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;first &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reared them around Aoxiang, but &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;the moss in the mountains and forests around the city did not grow well&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Go north again&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and continue deep into the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Mountains&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, there are 14 deer spots scattered in the mountains and forests of Xinlao Ao Township. &lt;p>; span>;20 years later, when talking about this matter, a former deputy mayor of Aoxiang said bluntly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Writer Chi Zijian visited Aoxiang in 2004 and found that there was not a single reindeer in the deer pen, only a group of lazy goats wandering along the overgrown path. Go shopping. The butterfly effect caused by this situation was that the Ewenki people descended from the mountain and became the origin of the writing of &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;While reindeer were being raised in captivity&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; also put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, as early as 1988, with the promulgation of the Wildlife Protection Law, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; it was clear that &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; hunting was prohibited , killing national key protected wild animals&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;common prey of the Ewenki people, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;moose&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, black bear, roe deer, gray rat &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They are all on the list&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. In 1996, the Gun Management Law was promulgated, which imposed stricter regulations on civilian use of guns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xie Yuanyuan obtained a document clarifying the meaning of &quot;ecological migration&quot; of the Ewenki people from the then director of the Ethnic Affairs Bureau of Genhe City. She was attracted by a few &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; short sentences with strong tone: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1. If the mode of production does not change, settling down will become a sentence Empty words. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2. Without changing the mode of production, it will be difficult for various economies to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The material clearly expresses the point of view: to change the production method, reindeer must be kept in captivity so that hunters can put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This also makes the third settlement essentially different from the first two: in the past two settlements, the government did not restrict the Evenki people’s choices, but instead increased their travel options. An alternative to hunting. But this time, the goal of letting the Evenki people go down the mountain to settle down is more clear. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;We must change the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;safari &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; such &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &quot;production&quot; Way&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ecological immigration has accelerated the process of closing guns. Li Mengchu remembered that the Public Security Bureau confiscated the guns of the Ewenki hunters right after they moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gu Taozeng, a documentary director who filmed the &quot;Ewenki Trilogy&quot;, recorded&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;this process&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. Li Mengchu&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;is concerned about&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;that the Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;have hunted for generations to survive&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and their guns are gone. , which means a change in the tradition of hunting people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Changes inevitably bring confusion. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Two months after the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;More than a month later, the then Aoxiang Party Committee Secretary&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Liu Panchang&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s nose bone was hunted by Ewenki The people interrupted, and the township head Gu Xianglian, who was also an Ewenki, was sued by his own aunt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Xianglian’s aunt wrote to the then Secretary of the Hulunbuir Municipal Party Committee: “In the past, without subsidies or assistance, the hunters lived quite well. But now, in Genhe &quot;To subsidize life is just like begging for food.&quot; &quot;This is not trying to achieve a well-off life, it&#39;s just trying to make us eat chaff!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as it&#39;s time to go to work, a circle of people rush into Gu Xianglian&#39;s office. The long sofas on both sides of the room were filled with villagers, and the radiator by the window was also crowded with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancient fragrant lotus has nothing to do with it. She complained to Xie Yuanyuan: &quot;I have no selfish intentions at all. I don&#39;t have a house of my own, so I live in a hunter&#39;s business. It&#39;s worse than a hunter&#39;s house! If you were to be the mayor of the township, what would you do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are problems everywhere. In November, the temperature in Aoxiang reached subzero, the new house began to get damp, and black hair grew on the walls of the house. The floor made of wooden boards in Lao Aoxiang was replaced by milky white ceramic tiles. &lt;span>;The designer obviously doesn’t have much experience in rural life. As soon as you enter the house in winter, the snow stuck to the soles of your shoes melts quickly, and you may slip&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; accidentally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Making a living has become difficult&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the Ewenki people used to be respected in Lao Ao Township&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;It seems&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is gone too. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Their appearance is easily identifiable: high cheekbones and deep-set eye sockets. When Xie Yuanyuan and Ewenki women went shopping in a store in Genhe City, they would always see the clerk pointing out, &quot;Look, that&#39;s from Aoxiang.&quot; The restaurant owner also laughed at Xie Yuanyuan for their old-fashioned ways: they only served free side dishes and drank almost all the wine. Before the main dishes were served, I paid and left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan recorded the scene she saw in the winter of 2003: except for the hunters raising reindeer, there was almost nothing for others to do. The only way for pure hunters to amuse themselves is to drink, drinking low-quality liquor that costs 1.5 yuan per pound and is filled with mineral water bottles. &quot;There are three or five people, very quiet, not talking or laughing, just leaning on the sofa or leaning on the bed.&quot; Drinking like that. It feels like they want to get into a state of &#39;drunkness&#39;, the sooner the better.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Twenty years have passed, and Gu Xianglian, who was the township head at the time of the relocation, is now the deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Genhe Municipal People’s Congress. &quot;There is no need to talk about the past.&quot; On July 28, 2023, in her office, she quickly interrupted the reporter&#39;s question, &quot;Go to Aoxiang and see for yourself. I don&#39;t know how much everyone&#39;s living standards have improved. . That&#39;s a huge change.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1014&quot; height=&quot;758&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253539&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Ewenki hunter settlement in Aoxiang is full of Nordic style. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“Almost forgotten everything”&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The latest improvement in living standards &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; celebrates &quot;ecological migration&quot; &quot;20th anniversary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 12, 2023, at the celebration ceremony, 15 dark green high-power tractors were lined up, which were allocated to the mountain&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Deer point. A month ago, the township &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;had &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;replaced &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; each deer spot with 5,000-watt solar energy storage panels. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;When fully charged &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , the solar panel &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; can provide &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;8 kWh of electricity. This means that you can use a refrigerator, TV, rice cooker, and even hot pot at the same time on the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summer travel season has also met expectations, ushering in a major outbreak three years after the epidemic. The price of accommodation in the two hotels in the scenic area is about 1,000 yuan per night. The price of a B&amp;B with simple facilities not far from the scenic spot starts at 500 yuan per night, and it must be booked at least a week in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Genhe, a resource-based city built for forestry, has now positioned the cultural and tourism industry as the &quot;city-building industry&quot; in the government work report, and &quot;Aolugu Ya&quot; has become a key focus The “brand” created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The living standards of hunters have improved a lot in recent years, and the original oppositional emotions have almost been forgotten.” Kong Fanzhi said when talking about the development of Aoxiang in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Change cannot occur without reindeer. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, three years after the relocation, Li Mengchu was appointed deputy mayor of Aoxiang. How to allow the Ewenki hunters to make a living under the mountains became a difficult problem that he had to face as soon as he took office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after taking office, he organized the first Reindeer King Competition, hoping to build the reputation of the reindeer. According to the plan, the antlers of the top three deer kings will be auctioned on site. Worried that no one would bid, Li Mengchu specially arranged a few &quot;trustees&quot; in the auditorium. Unexpectedly, the person in charge of a company auctioned off all the top three antlers, and the most expensive pair was auctioned for 7,000 yuan. At that time, an adult reindeer was worth only 5,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government also took over the entire township’s deer antler business. Deer antlers are deer antlers that have not yet been boned. In traditional Chinese medicine, they are considered to have nourishing properties. Starting in 2005, Li Mengchu led the township cadres to various deer spots to cut the antlers, which would be processed by the township, packaged and sold. &quot;After the sales are completed, the hunters will be given money, and they will be happy with every penny they receive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a few years of unified sales, hunters no longer need government support. After the rise of tourism in Aoxiang, deer antlers are sold by the same gram as ginseng, with prices ranging from 8 to 20 yuan per gram depending on the quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reindeer is the spirit of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the treasure of the Ewenki people.&quot; Lao Ge often repeated this sentence when interviewed by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one can say how the tourism industry in Qing Ao Township became so popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the Ewenki people came down from the mountain, the Aoxiang government made plans for tourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xie Yuanyuan was investigating in Aoxiang, the government had built a &quot;folk custom village&quot;. At first, there were only two buildings: a tent and a tuoluozi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government arranged for Asuo, a young male hunter, to live in a tent and raise 6 reindeer nearby. As long as he stays there, Asuo can receive a monthly salary of 100 yuan. However, Asuo&#39;s situation seemed awkward: he stayed there alone, drinking, dazed, and being sucked by mosquitoes. Later, the township leaders said that the &quot;Folk Custom Village&quot; was located in a remote location and lacked &quot;life&quot;, so Asuo&#39;s &quot;work&quot; was stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, hunters gradually took over the business of the folk village, but they were all in a slump. In 2007, with the support of the township government, Lao Ge invested more than 100,000 yuan, and the township government signed a ten-year contract to take over the business of the reindeer park. &quot;I never dreamed of it, but it started slowly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Mengchu’s impression, around 2008, Hulunbuir’s tourism business suddenly became popular. At that time, tourists drove around Genhe and couldn&#39;t find a place to stay. &quot;They were all confused at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge’s specific feelings about Aoxiang’s tourism industry “taking off” come from the increasing number of reporters visiting. Several groups of reporters from different CCTV channels came. The camera crew of Japan&#39;s NHK&#39;s &quot;China Railway Journey&quot; also came, as well as teams from Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea. Reporters from various countries came to see it all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also took reindeer to Changsha to record the variety show &quot;Happy Camp&quot;. Lao Ge clearly remembers the broadcast time of the March 5, 2011 issue. He chartered a truck, hired two drivers, and took the reindeer with him, and it took him 85 hours to reach Changsha. Finally, the Ewenki clip appeared on the show for 5 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge was originally worried that the reindeer would be frightened after coming on stage and run wild all over the place. The result was good, the deer was calm and even peed on the stage. On the contrary, he himself was very nervous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This deer was later named &quot;Little Hunan&quot; by Lao Ge. The day after returning to Aoxiang, &quot;Little Hunan&quot; disappeared. Half a month later, a forestry worker 40 kilometers away discovered it. Its mouth and body were covered with hunter&#39;s nooses. &quot;Little Hunan&quot; did not survive that autumn and passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, a Hunan tourist made a special trip to the reindeer park and bought the antlers of &quot;Little Hunan&quot; for 2,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height= &quot;514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 28, 2023, tourists watched birch bark boats at the Aoxiang Museum in Genhe City, Inner Mongolia. This was the most commonly used means of transportation by the Ewenki people half a century ago. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;No longer follow the order of the past&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In 2022, Lao Ge’s reindeer park began to be “regularized”, and the Aoluguya Tourism Development Company controlled by the Genhe Municipal Finance Bureau signed a three-year contract with him. Tickets are 70 yuan each, and he takes a 10% commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He is a busy man!&quot; Speaking of Lao Ge, He Xie had not seen him for some days, let alone drank with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xie, the eldest son of Maria Suo, the &quot;last female chief&quot;, is known as Boss He. He always likes to wear a military green jacket and sits on a bench outside his home with his wife Zhuoye. He rarely speaks, holding a 3 yuan and 5 bottle of Hailar beer in his hand, and the volume of the radio on the window sill is turned to the maximum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was young, he enlisted in the army and served as a firefighter. After changing his job, he was assigned to work as a judicial assistant in the township government. At that time, he had thick, long black hair with natural curls, like a rock star. Now, he is 56 years old, his hair is gray, his face is covered with wrinkles, his eyes are squeezed to only a slit, and almost all his teeth are missing. Aging has completely overcome him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distance from the bedroom to the bench is less than ten meters, which is the distance Zhuoye moves every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty-six years ago, He Xie was cleaning a gun at home, and the gun went off. The bullet penetrated the thin wall panel and entered Zhuoye&#39;s head. It has not been removed yet. The accident left her with no mobility in her right leg. After that, she stopped going out and became increasingly fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a curious tourist passes by the door and asks the couple about their Ewenki story, He Xie always walks slowly into the house and takes down two large photo albums from the top of the refrigerator - there is no smartphone yet. In the popular era, visiting reporters and photographers would always mail them to him after developing their photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the photo, they are skiing, singing, and drying dried meat in the forest. If you want to eat meat, pick up your gun and go out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to hunting, the energetic young hunter will briefly return - He Xie is the &quot;old hunter&quot; among the tribe who never misses. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Things in my memories are long enough. Most of the Evenki hunters in the photo have passed away, and the cause of death is somewhat related to alcohol. Of Maria So&#39;s seven children, only He Xie and his sister Dekesa remain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If I hadn&#39;t looked at him, he would have been gone.&quot; Zhuoye said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you don&#39;t drink, what else can you do?&quot; He Xie pushed back. His memories seemed to linger forever in the mountains and forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Lan, a researcher at the Institute of Ethnology of the Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences, has been following the Ewenki people for more than 30 years, and has become old friends with He Xie&#39;s family. Sometimes, Bai Lan would receive a voice message from Zhuo Ye, lamenting that there used to be people in front of her house, but now, they are the only ones left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are all busy now, so how can we have time to drink with him.&quot; In Bai Lan&#39;s view, He Gong&#39;s arrogance as &quot;Boss He&quot; disappeared. He Xie loves to make money, and as soon as he has some money, he calls friends and invites people to drink. But today&#39;s Aoxiang no longer follows the order of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 23, 2023, He Xie was in front of the graves of his mother Maria So and his father Rajmi He. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young Evenki people have their own way of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;36-year-old Gu Musen has 300,000 fans on the short video platform. In 2022, he founded his own media company, signed up young people in the countryside to be &quot;artists&quot;, and attracted tourists by relying on the fans he accumulated on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people who went to big cities to make a living have also returned. After graduating from college, Jue Le originally worked as an administrator in a hospital in Beijing, bought a house, got married, and had children in Beijing. But he felt that the work in the hospital was boring, and staying in the cubicle &quot;was like turning on the mechanical mode.&quot; In 2016, Juele returned to Genhe and ran a tourist spot not far from Aoxiang. &quot;It was very open, just like playing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doing tourism business in Aoxiang can indeed bring considerable income. Juele estimates that he will earn more than 100,000 yuan from tourism in the summer of 2023, which will be enough to support his family throughout the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Lan gave He Xie some advice. The couple was humorous in their dealings with others, and He Xie played the harmonica well. If they could clean up their house and start a small business in the tourism industry, they could make money. He Xie was not willing to do it and thought it was &quot;boring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xie still maintains a rough drinking method: drink vigorously for a few days to get stronger, then sleep for a few days and nights, wake up, then get up and continue drinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Lie, who was once envied by others, has become a person who is left behind and &quot;has not made progress&quot; in the eyes of his relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of July 2023, He Xie returned to Lao Ao Township. Not long after the Ewenki people moved out, the land was acquired by a real estate businessman in Daqing with plans to develop an international hunting ground. As a result, the plan was aborted, the hunting ground was not built, and all the old wooden carving houses were demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old Aoxiang became a deserted land, and the weeds on the roadside grew as tall as half a person. He Xie walked around Lao Aoxiang with his hands behind his back, but he didn&#39;t recognize where his house was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A fellow traveler asked him if he would be willing to come back to raise deer again. He thought about it seriously. This place had been uninhabited for a long time, and there were more wolves and lynxes nearby. &quot;It might not be appropriate to come back again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Romanticism&quot; and &quot;Realism&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As National Day approaches, a brown bear has become big news in Aoxiang . At around 5 o&#39;clock in the morning on September 26, 2023, Lao Ge received a call that a bear had entered the reindeer park - he entered through the ticket gate, and he was familiar with the road. This is the third time it has visited the deer park in half a month. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge joked, &quot;If it comes again, then we will have to deal with it.&quot; When it comes to the beasts that appear more and more frequently, the deer herder on the mountain doesn&#39;t sound so relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a brown bear visited Yang Lan’s deer spot and killed 7 reindeer in one night. In another household, after the arrival of the wolves, only 8 of the more than 30 reindeer were left. In the year when the beasts were most serious, the entire Aoxiang lost more than 200 reindeer, and the total number of reindeer was more than 1,300. In other words, one out of every six reindeer died due to beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Really annoyed, Yang Lan&#39;s father complained to her that if the guns could be returned to the hunters for a week, the problem of animal harm could be solved. Otherwise, in a few years, deer farmers will face personal danger even if they survive in the mountains. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the speaker and the listener know that this is just angry talk. They are all nationally protected animals, who would dare to fight them? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki people are also gradually losing their ability to survive in the mountains and forests, which makes Bai Lan feel a little anxious. How to choose between modernity and tradition? &quot;Everything has given Ewenki an external intervention, so this culture will inevitably have its flaws.&quot; Bai Lan put forward this point of view in an interview with the media at the beginning of the ecological migration in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She felt that if hunters could decide their own development model, obtain certain resource management and use rights in ethnic areas, and be able to engage in moderate logging and hunting, the situation might be different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“That’s the view of literati.” In 2003, Kong Fanzhi had a remote debate with Bai Lan. When he mentioned it again now, he still couldn&#39;t agree with Bai Lan&#39;s point of view. &quot;We can&#39;t just let the Ewenki people live in Zuoluozi in order to protect their traditional culture, right? Who doesn&#39;t want to live a modern life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xie Yuanyuan&#39;s view, these two attitudes come from completely different things. value judgement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the research, she and Maria Saw lived in Deer Point for more than half a month. Get up at around five o&#39;clock in the morning and work, such as beating legba, milking deer, picking wild fruits, cooking leather, and sewing leather goods... The days are simple and repetitive, and no one thinks that life needs any changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Ewenki people of different ages have different pursuits. When younger hunters see the broader world, they will naturally feel that their nation&#39;s customs are backward and want to make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan also wrote at the end of her doctoral thesis that traditional hunters who are attached to forest life do not have the right to speak and cannot easily sacrifice things that are more valuable and meaningful to the long-term development of mankind.&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, doctoral student Xie Yuanyuan became a researcher at the National Institute of Strategic Studies of Tsinghua University. Today, in her opinion, Bai Lan’s views are “romantic”, while Kong Fanzhi represents the “realist”.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It is inevitable for social development for micro groups to enter modernization. Now Xie Yuanyuan feels that from the perspective of national governance, this is a sacrifice that must be made for the development of the nation. Faced with reality, rational The attitude is to remember those people and give them and their descendants a certain amount of compensation. &quot;This is the reality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, since the Ewenki first settled and came into contact with the outside world, Some traditions are slowly changing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki language has no written characters and can only be passed down orally from generation to generation.
