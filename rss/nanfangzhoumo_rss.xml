The picture comes from the official Weibo of the Midi Music Festival&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After witnessing the two classic scenes of &quot;Mud Fight&quot; and &quot;Lifting a Wheelchair Brother&quot;, Liu Rui could have brought this exclusive experience of the Midi Music Festival with him Looking back, I ended my annual music pilgrimage with joy, but I didn&#39;t expect that an unexpected theft incident at the last moment destroyed almost all the &quot;beautiful things in this world&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This senior music fan, like many of his friends, has had a habit of going to music festivals during the National Day holiday for many years, but none of his previous experiences were as exciting as this one in Nanyang, Henan. Unforgettable: &quot;I have heard of things being thrown away at music festivals before, but it was not as serious as this time. This time it is too exaggerated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the National Day holiday, &quot;Central Plains Midi&quot; in Nanyang, Henan &quot;Music Festival&quot; has been on the hot search topic list many times. Among them, according to reports from many music fans on social platforms, a large-scale property theft occurred in the Midi camping area on October 3. Videos and pictures provided by music fans showed that local villagers broke into the Midi camp and brazenly &quot;ransacked&quot; tents. , many computers, mobile phones, musical instruments and other valuables were confiscated. &quot;It&#39;s outrageous that my home has been moved away after I went to the bathroom. It was already an open robbery.&quot; A music fan told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the Nanyang Municipal Public Security Bureau. A police officer surnamed Lu responded: &quot;We are still registering the lost items of music fans. The specific situation needs to be contacted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, the official Weibo of the Midi Music Festival announced that the local police received a total of 73 reports and implemented 65 theft cases. After investigation by the public security organs, some thieves have been captured and detained, and some property has been recovered. On the same day, the WeChat public account &quot;Nanyang Radio and Television Station&quot; issued a notice saying that based on the current registration situation of music fans, 79 ID cards and 3 computers have been returned , 17 mobile phones, and the remaining items are being verified and contacted. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Because of the rain, few people live in the camping area&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is the first time Nanyang has hosted the Midi Music Festival, which will be held for four days from September 29th to October 2nd. In order to hold this music festival, the local government opened a large open space in Huangshan Village on the outskirts of the country, planted a large lawn, and named it &quot;Green Field Monologue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It rained for three days during the four-day music festival.” Liu Rui said that outdoor music festivals like Midi usually provide open spaces for music fans to bring tents for camping. At noon on September 29, the camping area was officially opened to music fans. However, during the past few days of the music festival, except for the sunny weather on September 30, it continued to rain for the other three days. After setting up their tents, many music fans only use them to rest during the day and choose to stay in hotels in the city and take a shower at night. For the sake of convenience, many people do not carry their luggage with them, but put it directly in the tent as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Rui said that the camping site is divided into three areas: A, B, and C. Among them, Area C where he is stationed is located inside. The theft was not serious. He only lost his power bank, The relatively low-value items such as power strips did not call the police. However, thefts in areas A and B near the exit, especially near the fence, are very serious. &quot;It seems that Shenzhen music fans put their things on the wall and suffered heavy losses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to him, he had not heard of any &quot;lost things&quot; in the days before the festival. On the last morning, he returned to After setting up camp, many people found their belongings missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have a (music fan) organization, and we all camp together.” Wu Siqi is from Shenzhen, and this is her fourth MIDI tour. She recalled to the Southern Weekend reporter that because of the rain, she only stayed in the tent for one night on the second night, and stayed in the hotel the rest of the time. She put her luggage in the tent and zipped it up. On the evening of October 2, I was in a very excited mood after watching the performance and found nothing unusual. When I returned to the camping area from the hotel on October 3, I found that the zipper of the tent had been opened, many belongings were missing, and some items were scattered beside the tent. It was obvious that There are signs of being picked up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After verification, she lost a mobile phone, several bank cards, some cash, and some souvenirs. &quot;They should have come in by climbing over the wall.&quot; Wu Siqi said that music fans can get a bracelet on site after purchasing tickets. There are staff on duty at the entrance, and they can enter and exit freely with the bracelet. &quot;There are people watching the entrance, and the security on the wall inside is poor.&quot; She said that the wall at the music festival venue is about two meters high and is not guarded by security guards, making it easier to climb over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wu Siqi communicated with friends from Shenzhen, they all suffered varying degrees of loss. She saw videos and pictures taken by music fans. Some people climbed over the wall and jumped into the camping area, while others were rummaging through tents in the camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Music fan Liu Ling lost her laptop, headphones, power bank, and goods used to set up a stall. When she went to the police station to call the police, she met a stall owner who claimed that more than 80,000 yuan worth of goods was missing. In order to find her lost items, she joined three music fan support groups. Each group has four to five hundred people, all of whom said they had lost their belongings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Liu Ling’s first time to participate in a large outdoor music festival. She had not graduated from college yet, so she took the green train from Guangzhou to Nanyang for more than ten hours. &quot;My family doesn&#39;t know about this yet. I&#39;m still in school now, and it costs a lot,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Another classic scene &quot;Mud Fight&quot;.

The picture comes from the official Weibo of Midi Music Festival&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Multiple suspects have been arrested&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;After the incident, some netizens posted on social media that during the music festival, someone was broadcasting , once released the information that no one wanted the tents after the music festival, which played a misleading role. In response, the Organizing Committee of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival stated in an announcement on October 5 that on the morning of October 4, netizen Chen illegally posted false information that &quot;the event has ended and the scene must be cleaned up,&quot; causing nearby villagers to Taking advantage of the chaos, there were many cases of property being stolen in camping areas. The announcement also revealed that Chen, who published misleading and false information, has been arrested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I don’t know what his mentality is, why would he send such a message?” Liu Rui said that on the second and third days of the music festival, he discovered that someone was “picking up” the moisture-proof mat. Within the acceptable range, &quot;I just want to pick up some small advantages.&quot; The turning point came on the penultimate night of the show, when items from the tent began to be stolen on a massive scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Rui said that he had participated in many music festivals before and had property stolen from time to time. He had even heard of gangs of thieves committing collective crimes, but nothing like this at the Nanyang Midi Music Festival. exaggerate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stealing is stealing. We do believe that a lot of things have been stolen from the entire camp.&quot; Wu Siqi said that she saw some netizens on the Internet excusing the villagers, thinking that what happened in Nanyang Midi The disgraceful incident was not considered theft, but the villagers &quot;took&quot; some items abandoned after the event. She believed that this argument completely ignored the facts, &quot;They are just denying the facts, and this is not acceptable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Siqi said that her trip to Nanyang Midi originally left her with very good memories, but the final encounter ruined these experiences. She said that due to the continuous rain, some music fans&#39; plans to camp outdoors were scrapped. The organizers provided free accommodation for some music fans who could not find a hotel temporarily. They caught a cold after being exposed to the rain. They could also receive free brown sugar at the music festival. Ginger tea. Details including transportation connections and other details are also in place, and the favorability level was once full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also had some contact with local residents. When she went to the city for a stroll during the music festival, the citizens she met were very enthusiastic, because it was difficult to take a taxi, and she also encountered well-meaning passengers and drivers who &quot;crash&quot; &quot;Give them a ride.&quot; &quot;I felt very warm and moved. As a result, when I returned to the camp on the last day, I found that my house had been robbed and stabbed.&quot; Wu Siqi said that the experience of these few days was magical, &quot;It immediately took me back from Utopia. It exposed the reality and made me see the dangers of society.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Kun is a music fan born in the 1970s. Due to the weather, he has been staying in the hotel, but he still witnessed the final &quot;fantasy&quot; scene. &quot;It feels like the mentality of fellow villagers who steal pumpkins, or overturn the fruit cart on the highway, and grab the fruit.&quot; He said that at first, it was just the mentality of taking advantage of it, &quot;picking up&quot; some worthless things, but later people saw that the advantage had been taken away. People picked them up and simply coveted the items in the tent. In the end, the situation intensified and turned into &quot;looting&quot; with open fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, a Southern Weekend reporter called the Midi Music Festival Organizing Committee. A person in charge said that the police have been called and detailed registration work has been done for fans who have lost their belongings. The public security organs have A special work team has also been set up for this collective theft case, and many suspects have been arrested so far. &quot;We compared the recovered items with our registration information at the scene, and have now returned some of the fans&#39; items. We also later learned that one of the netizens, Chen, spread false information on the Internet after the night of the 2nd. The message indicates that the event is over, and no one wants many things. Let everyone pick them up. At present, Chen has been arrested by the public security organs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Encountering a &quot;Black Swan&quot; in investment promotion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Midi The music festival is an original music festival founded by Beijing Midi Music School. It is a music festival IP with a long history in China and has a deep foundation of music fans. In recent years, Midi Music Festival has frequently moved out of first-tier cities and been held in third- and fourth-tier cities in the mainland, which also has box office appeal. However, the arrival of the Midi Music Festival in Nanyang is an initiative of the Nanyang local government to attract investment and attract traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to local media reports, in May 2023, leaders of the Wolong District Committee of Nanyang City led a team to Beijing Midi Music School to discuss cooperation. The leaders of the Wolong District Committee said that Wolong District has sufficient development space and activity scenes. , hoping that both parties will promote cooperation, jointly ignite urban vitality, release industrial potential, highlight cultural charm, and inject more young forces into Wolong District&#39;s &quot;urban growth&quot;. The person in charge of Midi Music School said that Wolong District has a beautiful natural environment and broad prospects for the development of the cultural tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 2, the person in charge of Beijing Midi Music School said in an interview with Nanyang Daily that this music festival was very successful and set a box office record for the 47th Midi Music Festival in 30 years. , the number of live audiences also broke the previous record. There were more than 20,000 viewers on the eve of the music festival, and the number of viewers was close to 40,000 every day for the other three days. All tickets for the music festival were sold out in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, Southern Weekend reporters called the Wolong District Culture and Tourism Bureau of Nanyang City. The staff on duty at the bureau did not provide any more information about the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Rui said that because there are more restrictions in big cities, the trend of large-scale outdoor music festivals developing in third- and fourth-tier cities is very obvious. Local governments choose to cooperate because of the considerations of attracting investment and developing tourism; From the perspective of music fans, it is also a good choice to travel to different cities and experience the customs of different regions while attending music festivals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the music festival ended on October 3, but the National Day holiday has not yet ended. Previously, the usual practice was that many music fans would choose to continue visiting the city where the music festival was held for a few days, and then return Make return arrangements. &quot;So many people come here to eat, drink and play, which can boost the economy.&quot; Liu Rui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liu Rui’s view, before the theft incident, the entire event was actually very successful and basically met the organizer’s expectations. He said that because the lawn of the music festival had just been laid not long ago, after continuous rain, the entire venue was muddy, and it turned into a large-scale &quot;mud war&quot;, which became a scene that went viral on major social platforms and short video platforms; in addition, A young man in a wheelchair from Hebei was lifted up by many music fans to pay tribute at the music festival, and it became a classic scene that moved many netizens. These many factors have caused the 2023 Nanyang Midi Music Festival to frequently fail to appear, attracting attention from the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It turned out that everything went smoothly, but I didn&#39;t expect that something like this happened.&quot; Liu Rui felt sorry for Midi and Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ Liu Rui, Wu Siqi and Liu Ling are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https: //feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color :orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[特诺奇蒂特兰沦亡五百年祭丨古国多少事⑧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257368]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 19:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Flying from Atlanta to Mexico City, the scenery changes three times: first, from the flat and fertile southern plains of the United States to the sea and sky. over the Gulf of Mexico, and then crosses the Gulf of Mexico at a 45-degree angle, then enters the warm and tropical northern coast of Mexico, and finally reaches the rugged central Mexican plateau, which is the starting point of the northern end of the long volcanic belt that forms the Central American isthmus. The Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean connect the two continents of North and South America. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be clearly seen from the plane window that the moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is blocked at the northern foot of the Central Plateau, forming a continuous cloud belt, and finally turns into rainfall and moistens the northern coast again. The central plateau, with an average altitude of nearly 2,000 meters, is cloudless and the sun is scorching; there is little vegetation on the ground and it is very dry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flight arrived over the Valley of Mexico, where the capital Mexico City is located, with an altitude of 2,240 meters, ranking eighth among the highest capitals in the world. Historically, this place was called Tenochtitlan. The precious precipitation from the central plateau gathered here and once formed continuous mountain lakes. It prospered as a result, and it perished five hundred years ago as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;City of the Gods&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although Mexico is the largest country in Central America, it has the Gobi Desert that stretches to North America in the west and the warm and comfortable Baja California Peninsula, and Yucatan in the east The peninsula has lowland jungles and savannahs, as well as alluvial plains and swamps on the north and south coasts. The topography is very rich, but its country name comes from the almost isolated Valley of Mexico (Valle de México) on the central plateau. This is because when the Spanish came to this area in the early sixteenth century, the most powerful city-state Tenochtitlan was located in this valley. Later it became the capital of the colonists: Mexico City, and &quot;Mexico&quot; became the entire The name of the colony - &quot;x&quot; in Spanish is pronounced as &quot;h&quot;, and the Chinese transliteration of &quot;Mexico&quot; comes from this. If it is pronounced in English, it becomes &quot;Mexico&quot;, which does not match the local place name. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Valley of Mexico is actually a basin. The basin with an altitude of 2,200 meters is surrounded by volcanoes with an altitude of 5,000 meters, which is insurmountable. Therefore, there are no outflow rivers here, and all the rainfall meltwater completely flows to the bottom of the valley, forming a rare large mountain lake in history - Lake Texcoco. Its water area reaches 5,400 square kilometers, and it is the largest freshwater lake in my country, Poyang Lake. about 1.7 times. Due to strong evaporation, the water depth of Lake Texcoco changes greatly throughout the year, forming a wetland around the lake that is repeatedly submerged and then exposed. This is very similar to the Tonle Sap Lake (&lt;span style) reported by this edition in October this year. =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Cambodia: The Trisolaran World of Tonle Sap Lake&quot;&lt;/span>;). This wetland around the lake is a rare livable place in the vast plateau. Primitive agriculture was developed here, making it one of the important birthplaces of ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/Nf39MYflXfYxj5apLbXJpHlupSO19gKxLQIhwXey.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/Nf39MYflXfYxj5apLbXJpHlupSO19gKxLQIhwXey.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172829&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mexico Valley Location Map&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to archaeologists Excavations have shown that humans lived here 12,000 years ago, and the city was formed around 1200 BC. The specific location was on the west bank of Lake Texcoco, on the western outskirts of today&#39;s Mexico City - China at that time was still in the late Shang Dynasty. The Wuding and Zhongxing periods. The city was later destroyed by a volcanic eruption on the west side of the lake. The people migrated to the east coast of the lake and settled in a mountain depression called Teotihuacan by later generations, creating an ancient city with a thousand-year civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ruins of Teotihuacan are Mexico&#39;s first World Cultural Heritage and a must-see for travelers. I went to visit it on the second day after arriving in Mexico City. The main landscape is a north-south central axis of the city called &quot;Yellow Springs Avenue&quot;, with dense Mesoamerican-style trapezoidal pyramid buildings on the east and west sides. The two largest pyramids are almost equally tall according to visual inspection, but the Moon Pyramid located at the north end of the avenue is higher, so the Sun Pyramid located on the east side of the middle of the avenue is actually taller. The base of the latter is square with a side length of about 225 meters. The top of the remaining tower is about 64 meters high. Originally, there was a magnificent temple built on the top platform, but since the entire ancient city was abandoned 1,200 years ago, the temple has been completely lost. Now it is impossible to know which god this temple was built for. , and it is not clear what the exact height of this pyramid was in its heyday. What we can determine is that it was built around 100 AD using 3 million tons of boulders without metal tools, livestock for transport, or vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/6VDvlpq1qBNnMXsYZMRHeDeKWNVKF6KeQanjxuBk.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/6VDvlpq1qBNnMXsYZMRHeDeKWNVKF6KeQanjxuBk.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172830&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Imagination of Central American indigenous people building pyramids&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;I came here in mid-January, and chubby local tourists wearing short-sleeves and braving the scorching sun were waiting in a long line to climb the Pyramid of the Sun: the tower has four floors, and you have to queue up again on each floor before you can finally leave. It takes 2 hours to climb the 248 steps to the top of the tower. I sighed and gave up my plan to check in at the world&#39;s third largest pyramid. Instead, I climbed up the Pyramid of the Moon with steep steps, opened a can of Mountain Dew, and breathed calmly while looking down at the Huangquan Avenue in front of me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teotihuacan means &quot;City of the Gods&quot;. Like the &quot;Avenue of Yellow Springs&quot;, &quot;Pyramid of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Pyramid of the Moon&quot;, they are all speculations of later generations about this thousand-year-old city - - Since the Teotihuacan civilization left no written language and the stones themselves cannot speak, historians do not know its origins. They only know that it was a city-state civilization that originated in 200 BC. Its heyday was about 20 years ago. With a population of more than 10,000, it declined before the eighth century AD, leaving only the magnificent buildings and exquisite stone carvings that amazed future generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/25/BDcWwdorOlRgNdGuxLJwAIiD4avXQN84Icp0YXyE.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1446&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/25/BDcWwdorOlRgNdGuxLJwAIiD4avXQN84Icp0YXyE.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172645&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The ruins of Teotihuacan are among the first batch of World Cultural Heritage sites in Mexico. The picture shows the Avenue of the Yellow Springs from the Pyramid of the Moon. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first wave of descendants of Teotihuacan were the Toltecs - the descendants were not Descendants, but those who come after. The Toltecs established a new city-state in Tula, not far to the northwest, and named this deserted but awe-inspiring ruins Teotihuacan, which means the place where the gods built: they obviously It’s hard to believe that this largest ancient city in Mesoamerica was built by humans themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second group of descendants of Teotihuacan were the Aztecs. They named the central axis of the ancient city &quot;Avenue of the Yellow Springs&quot; and named the two largest pyramids after the Sun. and the Pyramid of the Moon. They believe that the magnificent pyramids are mausoleums built by the gods for their ancestors, and these dead ancestors are the potential driving force supporting the movement of the sun - this is based on a method from Teotihuacan to Toltec to Aztec. Ke&#39;s consistent and unique world view is that the survival of the world depends on human sacrifice: nourishing the operation of the world with human life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs are the protagonists of this story, the founders of Tenochtitlan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Lake Country&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Tenochtitlan is often called the &quot;Aztec Empire&quot; today, with the name ranging from &quot;Aztec&quot; to &quot;Empire&quot; In fact, it is not appropriate. Let’s start with the Aztecs (&lt;span>;Aztec&lt;/span>;). This is a legendary nomadic group from northwest Mexico. They migrated south along the desolate Mexican plateau and finally arrived in the Valley of Mexico, which is rich in water and grass. They settled here and became vassals of the Toltecs. After the demise of the Toltec civilization, they integrated with other local ethnic groups for a long time and formed an alliance among three major city-states. They used a common language and called themselves Mexica (&lt;span>;Mexica&lt;/span>;). That is, the people who lived in the Valley of Mexico formed a national identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we use China as an analogy, this is equivalent to the alliance between the two tribes of the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor to build a national identity. Their descendants consider themselves descendants of Yan and Huang, and they call themselves China based on the middle land where they live. People - the &quot;descendants of Yan and Huang&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot; here can roughly correspond to the two concepts of &quot;Aztec&quot; and &quot;Mexican&quot;. But it is obviously not appropriate to call China the &quot;Yanhuang Kingdom&quot;, because &quot;Yanhuang&quot; is an ancient myth passed down from ancient times; similarly, the &quot;Aztecs&quot; are also an ethnic group that exists in ancient myths, and they combine the real It is also inappropriate to call the country of the Mexica &quot;the Aztecs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;empire&quot;, as mentioned earlier, this is actually a loose alliance between three city-states, and there is no unified empire. Therefore, the so-called &quot;Aztec Empire&quot; was actually an alliance of city-states led by Tenochtitlan in the Valley of Mexico. These indigenous people called themselves Mexica and believed that they were descendants of the Aztecs. The civilization they established is now called the Aztec civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/lWSWglsDOpKmCPaHu3pYwguCJR01ShDiYqOG5Ijl.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/lWSWglsDOpKmCPaHu3pYwguCJR01ShDiYqOG5Ijl.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Restored map of Tenochtitlan, with east at the top. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what kind of city-state was Tenochtitlan? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that when the Aztecs moved south, they received a message from the oracle to find an eagle sitting on a cactus with a snake in its mouth. That was their new breeding ground. When they arrived at a sandbar on the west shore of Lake Texcoco after a long journey, they saw this scene and settled on the sandbar. They named the sandbar Tenochtitlan after Chief Tenoch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs built three long embankments to connect the sandbar and the lake shore from the north, west and south. They also built a long embankment between the sandbar and the center of the lake to isolate the waves. and attacks from across the Great Lake; they diverted mountain spring water from the west coast and supplied drinking water to the sandbar through the causeway; because the volcanic ash is rich in minerals, the soil around Tenochtitlan is very suitable for farming, and they rely on corn as their main food , also grow pumpkins, beans and amaranth; they also invented a type of floating island agriculture called chinampa (&lt;span>;chinampa&lt;/span>;), which is somewhat similar to the polders in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, using silt from the bottom of the lake to create fields. , fixed with wooden stakes and wickers, to form fertile artificial islands and expand the planting area; there are no domestic animals such as horses, cattle, and sheep in the American continent, and there are no fish in Lake Texcoco. They mainly raise dogs, rabbits, chickens and ducks to obtain For protein, the way to cook is to bake it on a stone slab &lt;span>;——&lt;/span>; Because the Aztec civilization was still in the Bronze Age and did not have iron pots; they laid a sewage system and put a large pot at the pipe joint. The garbage in the sewage settles in the large tank and sends people to clean it regularly; they implement Spartan-style military education for all people, while the nobles and rich can learn cultural knowledge; because there is no iron, their weapons are made of obsidian Spears, swords and arrowheads - obsidian is the &quot;national stone&quot; of Mexico. It is a natural glass formed after the cooling and condensation of volcanic lava. It is obviously not very durable. The obsidian dagger I brought back from Mexico returned to Shanghai on the first day It broke while my son was playing with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/W9JLbcakm7OzBudPVGpVAOBHEaCV2ORjAbGGJAfh.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/W9JLbcakm7OzBudPVGpVAOBHEaCV2ORjAbGGJAfh.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172834&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Obsidian arrow cluster&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs will witness The place where the oracle was spoken was designated as the center of the city-in their view, it was also the unquestionable center of the universe-and their temple was built here. This temple was later destroyed by the Spanish, and the first Catholic church in Mexico was built in front of it using the removed stones to suppress the &quot;evil spirits&quot; of the pagans. This is today&#39;s Catedral Metropolitana in Mexico City. ). 457 years later, municipal workers accidentally unearthed an important relic of the Aztec temple: the stone statue of the Moon Goddess. The Mexican government decided to demolish the building above the site and fully excavate the great temple so that the Aztecs could The gods are revealed again. So, today we can see two world cultural heritage buildings located side by side on the north side of Constitution Square in the center of Mexico City. On the west side is the Baroque Cathedral, and on the east side is the semi-open-air Tenochtitlan Cathedral. Temple ruins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Constitution Square has existed since ancient times. As early as the Aztec era, it was a large open-air market next to the Great Temple. The Spanish could raze the pagan capital to the ground, but they could not destroy a square into a primeval forest, so they left it as the central square in front of the cathedral. In &lt;span>;1821&lt;/span>;, in order to celebrate the promulgation of the Diaz Constitution after Mexico&#39;s independence, it was named Constitution Square. The government once planned to build an independence monument on the square, but due to financial reasons, it only laid a foundation. The Spanish word for &lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>;foundation &lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>; is called &lt;span>;zócalo&lt;/span>;, so this place is half realistically and half mockingly called &lt;span>;Zócalo&lt; by people from all walks of life in the capital. /span>;square. Unexpectedly, the central squares in other Mexican cities would also be called this name after the capital. As a result, the word &lt;span>;Zócalo&lt;/span>; actually came to mean central square in Mexican Spanish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/1NWLimGFx6W6OzjMdzHn66WAlYCl7v1Zl1ln1o44.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/1NWLimGFx6W6OzjMdzHn66WAlYCl7v1Zl1ln1o44.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172831&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Great Temple Nested Model&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Great God The main building of the temple is a four-story trapezoidal platform similar to the Teotihuacan Sun Pyramid, but its size is greatly reduced - after all, the carrying capacity of the lakeside sandbank in Tenochtitlan is limited. There were originally two altars above the platform, respectively used to worship the Aztec sun god, war god and rain god, but they had long been destroyed by the Spanish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t seem like much? No. The unique thing about this temple is that it has an outer layer covering an inner layer, with a total of six layers inside and outside - that is to say, there are seven temples in total from the inside to the outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s going on? It turns out that Tenochtitlan was a martial city-state that controlled other surrounding indigenous city-states and tribes. Whenever a monarch dies, the next ruler launches a coronation war to regain the loyalty of various territories. Once he takes control of the situation again and spreads military force across the country, he will ask all states and ministries to send people to Tenochtitlan to participate in the construction of the temple, and build a trapezoidal pyramid outer wall from the base to the temple built by the previous generation of monarchs. Wrap it up, cap the outer wall to form a new platform, and build a new double altar temple. The completion of this new temple marks the establishment of a new generation of monarchy, and can be regarded as the Mexican interpretation of &quot;the major events of the country are sacrifice and military service&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the big temples are nested layer by layer, becoming bigger and bigger as they are built. Using simple engineering principles, we can judge that the amount of earthwork in this &quot;matryoshka&quot; project increases in a cubic relationship, which consumes a huge amount of national power and is unsustainable. Tenochtitlan was founded nearly 200 years ago and built a seven-story temple, which cost as much manpower and material resources as the Pyramid of the Sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what are the series of large temples built over generations used for? Sacrificing human beings to offer sacrifices to the gods and pray for blessings - simply put, it is killing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/Luefy4DQN79nus9nDBOvGxZDUSvecV8ONmvbaEsv.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/Luefy4DQN79nus9nDBOvGxZDUSvecV8ONmvbaEsv.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172826&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chuck is a messenger between man and God, used to worship people&#39;s hearts. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Bloodthirsty Civilization&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs believed themselves to be the descendants of the sun. It is believed that the sunrise is the result of the sun god&#39;s victory over darkness. They believe that the world has been destroyed four times and is now in the fifth contest between the Sun God and the Dark Gods. The Sun God needs his people to provide him with nourishment, which is human blood. Therefore, the Aztecs, regardless of gender, were accustomed to using sharp agave thorns to pierce their earlobes, tongues, chests and even genitals to collect blood as a sacrifice to the gods. The priests dipped blood from their temples to paint paintings and dedicated them to the sun god. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, blood collection is only a personal act, and a sacrificial ceremony more sacred than blood collection is a public human sacrifice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The late American archaeologist Patricia R. Anawalt once stated clearly in the opening chapter of her paper &quot;Understanding Aztec Human Sacrifice&quot;: &quot;The use of living humans as sacrifices has always been a common practice in the New World. It has appeared in the Old World. Such examples can be found not only in Central America, but also in Mesopotamia, Egypt and China. The difference is that Aztec human sacrifice has long been known. The understanding of the ancient culture of the Old World is a recent thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take our country as an example. The excavation of the Yin Ruins in Anyang started in the late 1920s allowed us to understand the large-scale development of the Yin and Shang Dynasties. Human sacrifices, 3,684 human sacrifice bones were found in Yinxu alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs’ human sacrifice behavior was even more shocking when exaggerated by the Spanish conquistadors. New discoveries from archaeological excavations prove that the Spanish records are not just a smear campaign against the losers. For example, Mexican archaeologists accidentally unearthed a large number of skulls near the Grand Temple. They were not like ordinary mass graves or mass graves, but were neatly arranged in a three-dimensional matrix in the same direction. After cleaning, archaeologists found strangely that there were holes on both sides of all the skulls, which were obviously dug through artificially. Finally, when the entire site was excavated, everyone understood what was going on: It turned out that there was once a five-row stone shelf more than 30 meters long and more than four meters high. There were many wooden beams inserted on the shelf, and the wooden beams were covered with clothing. Platoon&#39;s skull - as recorded by the Spanish. Later, it was buried with soil and the wooden beams decayed, forming an underground matrix of skulls. Archaeologists named this site &quot;Wall of Skulls&quot; in the Aztec language. They selected three skulls and strung them together with wooden beams for display in the museum behind the Grand Temple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Combining written records and archaeological excavation results, it is now possible to roughly restore the human sacrifices of the Great Temple: under the watch of the vast number of citizens, the sacrificed human sacrifices formed a queue in front of the Great Temple. ，一个个被带上四层平台，仰面躺在双祭坛前的人牲石上；由主祭司手持黑曜石匕首切开人牲的胸膛，掏出尚在跳动的心脏，供奉给太阳神；尸体沿石阶扔下基座，由次一级的祭司将其首级割下，剥去头皮，在头骨两侧钻孔后穿在刚才提到的骷髅架上；人牲的四肢被肢解，交还给他们的提供者，躯干则被遗弃，人牲的鲜血会和玉米饼和在一起作为与神灵沟通的食物，以至于西班牙人来到大神庙时，首先注意到的就是石阶上积累近两百年的血迹和它散发的浓重气味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/KtUOhvUnluAvcqX0MBhOTiEKcgtVLhIUHFigtnN7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;911&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/KtUOhvUnluAvcqX0MBhOTiEKcgtVLhIUHFigtnN7.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;至于上文提到人牲的“提供者”，这涉及墨西哥谷的地缘政治。阿兹特克人近乎狂热地使用活人献祭来维持太阳东升西落，祈求农业风调雨顺，在一片干旱粗粝的高原上维续这座湿地城邦的有限农业资源。但他们并不想耗费自己的人力资源，因此热衷于四出征讨，获得战俘以供祭祀。后来周围部落都被打服了，不愿继续作战，甘心每隔八个月向特诺奇蒂特兰上缴一次贡品。但阿兹特克人依然不肯收手，继续发动其“荣冠”战争，也就是没有宗教、政治、领土和经济诉求，纯粹为了获得人口用于献祭的战争，类似原始部落“猎头族”的行为，最后演变为各个臣服部落定期向特诺奇蒂特兰献出人口，供其屠杀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了上述常规的人祭方式，还有两种特殊的人祭值得一提：一是为了献祭太阳神暨战神，更为“高端”的祭品是俘获的敌国将领，他被绳索拴在一块大石头上无法逃脱，使用羽毛棒与手持狼牙棒和盾牌的本族武士搏斗。如果他能够连胜四人，再与一个左撇子武士搏斗获得胜利，就可以重获自由——当然，这纯属赤裸裸的欺负人；二是为了献祭雨神，使用的祭品是儿童——阿兹特克人相信儿童在祭祀过程中流下的眼泪将会变成灌溉农田的雨水而带来丰收。作为一个父亲，我就不详述这项祭祀的过程了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/VOjzDzuXu2Y8ilgysMO5wzjd5jWj0bdrFK46AXj7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/VOjzDzuXu2Y8ilgysMO5wzjd5jWj0bdrFK46AXj7.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;科尔特斯首先在尤卡坦半岛东岸的Cozumel岛登陆补给，那里现在是加勒比海邮轮之旅中最重要的港口之一。然后他率领船队沿着尤卡坦半岛向西绕行，被沿途的原住民视为天神下凡：原住民没有见过马，也没有见过骑兵，所以认为骑兵是长着四条腿能够移动如飞的神怪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科尔特斯知道自己人单势孤，无法与人数超过五百万人的整个原住民阵营相抗衡，但他很快发现，这个阵营并非铁板一块，而是由特诺奇蒂特兰主导的三城联盟，统治着一群弱小的部落，对抗墨西哥谷以东的两个敌对城邦。特诺奇蒂特兰的敌国们深知其嗜血本性，坚决不肯屈服；特诺奇蒂特兰的属国们则长期匍匐于其暴政之下，不断付出供品和人牲，同样叫苦不迭。于是，科尔特斯明智地与这两个城邦结盟，共同对付特诺奇蒂特兰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在特诺奇蒂特兰这边，阿兹特克人非常崇敬统治墨西哥谷的前辈托尔特克人，全盘接收了托尔特克人的世界观。根据托尔特克人的神话传说，他们离开了墨西哥中部高原，在墨西哥湾下海前往东方追寻羽蛇神——中美洲多个文明所供奉的主神，并将于1519年跟随白色皮肤的羽蛇神从东方回归墨西哥谷。所以，当国王蒙特祖马二世听说一群“漂浮的城堡”从东方蹈海而来，在墨西哥湾登陆，他的第一认知是：神灵回归人间了！ &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;一年后的1521年5月，对特诺奇蒂特兰的地形与弱点已经了如指掌的科尔特斯带着九百名西班牙援军和十万名土著盟军卷土重来。天下苦阿兹特克久矣！过去的属国纷纷反戈一击，形成了墙倒众人推的态势。阿兹特克人孤军奋战，在错综复杂的河网中凭据一座座浮岛、一栋栋房屋负隅顽抗。 93天之后，整座岛城被夷为平地，特诺奇蒂特兰灭亡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联盟的中枢败亡后，整个墨西哥都被西班牙轻松控制。殖民者将这里命名为Nueva Espana，意为“新西班牙”。又过了三百年，到了1821年，墨西哥才获得独立。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这个网名叫“才哥（全国相亲)”的“婚介主播”长期在短视频平台发布相亲信息，明码标价彩礼价格。被介绍相亲女性中有多位是智障人士，视频中不乏“18.8万，交钱结婚”这种令人严重不适的内容。网友怀疑，该网红是个公开明码标价的人贩子。该主播则表示他们是“正规婚介”，有需求可以到线下婚介所相亲，交完彩礼另付2万元介绍费就可以把人领走，“先结婚后恋爱”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事掀起舆论波澜，不少网友认为这是“人口贩卖”。10月4日晚间，云南省弥勒市政府工作人员告诉《上游新闻》称已关注到此事，当地已经成立多部门组成的工作专班，分组对此事进行核查。细审这起事件，除了令人不适之外，更显露出一些深层次问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一，这起事件带来的最大问题是，如此短视频婚介存在哪些法律与道德上的破口？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;婚姻应该遵循自愿原则。“自愿”应理解为可以自主表达，有完全民事行为能力，可以做出有法律效力的意思表示。然而，残障人士的情况比较特殊，是否可以行使完全民事行为能力登记结婚，需要分情况看待。如果残障人士只是肢体残疾而不影响辨认自己行为，则具有完全民事行为能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而如果残障人士是精神方面的残障，那么还可以细分为“不能完全辨认自己行为”的限制民事行为能力人，以及“不能辨认自己行为”的无民事行为能力人。限制民事行为能力人只能独立实施纯获利益的民事法律行为，或者与其智力、精神健康状况相适应的民事法律行为，其他的情况与无民事行为能力人一样，需要由监护人来代为行使民事权利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题在于，监护人是否有权代替残障人士行使民事权利，做出登记结婚的重大决定？在这起事件中，“婚介主播”的短视频多遵循“年龄＋智力状况＋广告语＋彩礼”的套路，明晃晃打出“相亲”“闪婚”的广告字眼，一开始就冲着“收钱结婚”去的。残障人士在此期间有无机会表达自己的真实意愿？或者，婚介方与监护人是否会征询残障人士的意见？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些问题的答案当然是大有疑问的。尤其是在有利益驱使的情况下，监护人未必会尊重残障人士的真实意愿。甚至于从人性角度来讲，监护人面临“丢掉一个累赘，收到一笔大钱”的真实激励。在这条婚介产业链上，残障人士成了最没有话语权的相关方，沦为婚介方与监护人的摇钱树。这有悖于起码的人伦道德，也存在法律上的疑问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在2021年的“河南省泌阳县55岁男子娶20岁智障女子”事件中，当事女性父亲的所作所为曾经引发巨大争议。作为智障女儿的监护人，父亲与继母一手做主“包办”了这场“婚姻”。事后官方调查组的结论是，两人同居不违法，但不能办理结婚证。这个案例就显示，类似“婚姻”的法律效力是存疑的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二，“人口贩卖”的疑云在事件中挥之不去，尤其是与“彩礼”结合到一起的时候。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这名“婚介主播”在接受音频采访时表示，“正常的女孩子彩礼在15万以上，最低也得10多万”“我们要拿两万的服务费”“一对一服务，过来一个成功一个”“两星期内领好证把老婆带回去”。诚如网友所言，挂着彩礼名号的“明码标价”，确实令人直接联想到人口贩卖。这不仅是观感上的不适，也同样涉嫌真正的违法犯罪行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不论这位“婚介主播”多么强调自己的“合法合规”，“拿到彩礼两星期内领证”的操作怎么看怎么都像是变相的人口贩卖，“来一个成功一个”的表述更是让人完全看不到残障女性在其中的发言权，这在根本上已经违背了《中华人民共和国民法典》中“婚姻自愿原则”的法律条文，唯一可以作为补丁的就是监护人的同意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监护人的意见真的就可以代表残障人士的自主意愿吗？这是存疑的。同时，十多万的高额彩礼，最终可以用来改善残障女性的婚后生活吗？这笔钱最终会落到谁的手里，也是不问可知。如果监护人“收钱给人”，那么这无异于银货两讫的人口贩卖，退一步讲也是不折不扣的强迫婚姻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更有甚者，类似“婚介产业”还开发了针对残障女性的“细分赛道”。因为容易被操控，他们甚至还可以“反复回收”残障女性。“买家”在结婚生子之后还可以“退回媳妇”，然后再“介绍”给下一家去怀孕生产，“婚介所”从中再收取一笔佣金，这又无异于直接倒退回已经进入历史垃圾堆的“生育奴隶制”了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;婚姻的基础应该是爱与道德，而不是买卖与算计。但如果加入残障人士这个特殊变量，买卖婚姻甚至买卖人口的性质就加倍地凸显出来。面对如此明目张胆的“标价征婚”，有关部门理应拿出不亚于“泌阳事件”的严肃态度，追查其合规性，保障残障人士合法权益，维护婚姻家庭价值观，不能让残障人士成为一手交钱一手交货的现代奴隶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[读《村上私藏：怀旧美好的古典乐唱片》的乐趣]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258146]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/NrHooXfb2YWhgVkmSI2JGOatUMo7qVTKkk9rrT15.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;村上春树和他的新著《村上私藏：怀旧美好的古典乐唱片》。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（CFP图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;日本作家村上春树喜欢收藏，其中一样他收藏的东西就是古典音乐唱片，特别是黑胶唱片，早前出版的《村上私藏：怀旧美好的古典乐唱片》，就是写他所收藏的唱片精选。在这本把书的开本做成跟唱片封套一样的小书里，他说自己在过去60年来，在世界各地逛唱片店，买回来的旧唱片有过万张，他特别挑选一些最喜欢的，写一下喜欢的原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;村上开宗明义说，这书“充其量就是一本个人偏好与兴趣的书，不具任何系统性、实用性目的，没有&#39;这张是这首曲子的必听盘！&#39;之类的推荐意图”。这书就像早前《村上T》的延续，读者很喜欢村上春树，想知道他穿什么的衣服，也想知道他听什么的唱片，如此而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，古典音乐的每首曲子都有无数的录音版本，不同的指挥、乐团、演奏时间，甚至是同一首乐曲但不同的录制压制技术，都令每个唱片版本独一无二。在今天浩瀚的各个串流音乐平台，也只有不同录音版本的冰山一角。读村上这书的时候，总会有：啊！原来这首曲子还有这个版本，真想找来听听的冲动。不过，想要按图索骥把书里介绍的唱片找回来，很不容易，毕竟村上在书里介绍的唱片，很多都是上世纪五六十年代的产物，要么在旧唱片店里碰运气，也可到著名的唱片交易网站discogs寻宝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;村上说他挑选唱片都是个人偏好，也因此有不少古典乐迷对他的选择都有意见，但讲到明底个人偏好，自然各人所见所喜都有不同。就像村上自己说他不太喜欢钢琴家布伦德尔（Alfred Brendel），但布伦德尔本来就有很多人喜欢。喜欢哪个版本、哪个指挥，很多时候都是和自己的经验有关，而村上跟著名指挥小泽征尔是好朋友，他就自然更偏好小泽征尔的版本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在个人经验之外，另一个原因就是对乐曲诠释的偏好，有些时候音乐家对乐曲的演绎手法都很有特色（甚至到了哗众取宠的程度），乐迷不埋单（或反过来很喜欢）的原因也相对容易可以说出来。举个例吧：马勒的第七交响曲，如果听克伦佩勒（Otto Klemperer）的版本（跟大部分版本比较，全曲长了差不多20分钟），那种极度缓慢的风格，感觉就像看着远处的火车驶进月台，火车逐渐靠近但又总是永远没到达似的，有人说这是一种张力，但我自己就很不喜欢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论怎样，村上在写这些乐评的时候，始终有他独到的手法，让读者即使只是在读村上的古典唱片短评，也一样有读村上春树文字的乐趣。就如他说钢琴家古尔达（Friedrich Gulda）跟维也纳爱乐（阿巴多指挥）录制的莫扎特第25号钢琴协奏曲，听起来“有一种像是在大阪乌龙面店吃清汤乌冬面般不可思议的安心感”；又或是Thomas Beecham爵士指挥海顿的第94号交响曲，总是有种“风度翩翩的旧时代英国绅士印象，就连第二乐章的&#39;惊愕&#39;（surprise）部分，惊吓方式也是稳健又高雅，这种程度的惊吓就连端着茶杯的妇女也不会吓到红茶溢出来”。这些比喻，非常独到，非常的村上春树。莫扎特也好，古尔达也好，怎会想过自己的作品，竟然变成了一碗大阪的清汤乌冬？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，回到一个重要问题：现在听古典音乐，为何还要听黑胶唱片？又或者更大的疑问是：黑胶唱片怎么会起死回生？黑胶唱片的回归，是人类发展史上其中一个最励志的故事。明明已给时代淘汰，笨重又脆弱，承载量少得可怜，但事实证明：只要有价值，哪怕满满缺点，还是有存在的意义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;村上春树在《村上私藏：怀旧美好的古典乐唱片》中说，听黑胶唱片是“那种只要悉心对待，就会有所回应的东西”。在一切都是数位的年代，付出和回应早已变成非常公式的交换，什么都是一个按钮换来一个反应，失去了用心付出所换来的满足。就像你再小心温柔地轻触手机上的串流音乐平台、播放乐曲，播出来的音乐，也绝对不会有任何分别（所以实际上我们也自然不会怎样温柔地轻触手机）。“有所回应”的特质在现今冰冷的世界已经变得稀有，也因此才会令黑胶唱片在今天复兴起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听黑胶唱片，从买唱片到播放，每一步都讲求“悉心对待”的付出。其中之一是音响播放，无论是听黑胶唱片还是听串流平台，本来就是深似海的学问。像最基本的唱盘、前级后级功放（音讯扩大机）、喇叭，或唱盘所用的唱头和唱针、连接设备的线材和接头，甚至是唱盘上放唱片的唱片垫，全部都讲究。村上春树也说，音响是个“行有余力才能培养的兴趣，这也是没办法的事，只能有此觉悟”。话虽如此，只要不是买几百元货色、只有外表的那种一体化播放唱盘，简单一套像样的入门音响设备，价钱其实也是亲民的，并且已经可反映出黑胶唱片的珍贵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不只是音响设备，买（和找）黑胶碟也是讲求付出的活动。像在欧美等地方，不同社区都有救世军、乐思会等卖二手旧物的店，在这些旧物店里，总会有个角落，放满一箱箱的旧唱片，如果有负责任一点的店员（或是整齐一点的物主），都会把唱片分类放好。这个时候，慢慢蹲下来，把唱片逐张翻一翻、看一看，每一张都是未知，随时遇上心头好。这些旧唱片，很多时候都只是十元八块的价钱，便宜到不得了。跟一般旧唱片店不一样，这些旧物店都是非牟利的，负责人既无暇慢慢定价，也通常没有内行人一样懂得行情，了解货品的价值。所以，很容易在这些旧物店找到宝藏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，在旧物店买到的唱片，唱片的状态不一，通常要花更多时间来好好清洁，有时也会买到损毁了的唱片，这些都没法避免，只好在买的时候再仔细检查看看。但像村上春树所说，即使是旧的唱片，只要用心去清洁（清洁唱片也一样有学问），清洁前后的播放音质，还是有显著的分别，至少唱针不会在播完唱片之后积起一堆尘垢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相较之下，专卖旧唱片的商店，很多时候都对唱片做基本的清洁，并清楚标明唱片的状态、品相，相应地，定价也会相应地昂贵。比较世界各地不同的唱片店，日本的唱片店，往往是最整齐和最清洁的。难怪好朋友焦元溥老师说，他去日本的中古唱片店，每一次进去就是7个小时，每次都是天光逛到天黑。听他的分享，无论是精神还是财力，都是非常大的付出，当然每次也是换来大丰收吧。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;如今无论从曼谷考山路包车，或者坐火车约一个小时，当可以远眺到尖塔和金碧辉煌的路牌时，浓厚的历史气息就会扑面而来——坐落于湄南河冲积平原上的大城府，地处暹罗湾潮汐线上方，这个四面被湄南河、华富里河、巴塞运河环绕而形成独特的岛城，有水道通向南方的暹罗湾，可通中国与东南亚诸国，又紧扼北方素可泰的出海门户，成为中、印、欧的地理连接点，更造就了它在贸易、军事、外交上得天独厚的条件：14至18世纪，发达的水陆交通和耀眼的佛教建筑让它的名声享誉东南亚乃至整个亚洲，甚至被目为东南亚最大最美丽的城市。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199733&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;玛哈泰寺的佛像与遗迹&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（张亚萌/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1350年，湄南河西岸的罗斟（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今华富里&lt;/span>;）政权首领拉玛铁菩提（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ramathibodi I，乌通王&lt;/span>;）战胜泰国第一个封建王朝素可泰王朝，罗斟与河东岸素攀政权暹国合并，建立阿瑜陀耶王朝，中国史籍称“暹罗”。当曼谷还是名不见经传的小渔村时，阿瑜陀耶王朝定都之地，已是一座繁华“大城”——旅泰华人认为此城最大，故称“大城府”，连王朝都亦称“大城王朝”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在历史文献中，大城府被称为“天堂”，鼎盛时期人口约有100万，三座王宫、超过2000座镀金尖塔式庙宇和4000多尊镀金佛像，让这里处处金碧辉煌；历33位国王、延世417年的王朝，将佛教文化送上巅峰。大城王朝中后期时，明人张燮还在他的《东西洋考》“暹罗条”里写：“其土下湿，气候岚热不齐，民悉楼居，楼密联，槟榔片藤系之甚固，藉以藤席，竹簟寝处其间。王宫高九丈余，以黄金为饰，雕缕八卦，备极弘丽。”16世纪开始，大城府的声名远播欧陆，1512年葡萄牙人首抵此处，大城府逐渐在17世纪成为贸易中心，欧洲各国使节纷至沓来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果说几百年前大城府的主色调是金色，而今这里，武断一点而言，市中心只有红褐与焦黑两种颜色：红褐色是建筑早已蒙尘的砖块，烈日烤灼、风雨侵蚀，让凹凸不平的地面与墙面，一起化为一片暗红色的海洋。大城府的诸多古刹，乍看之下是吴哥窟的翻版，但仔细鉴赏之后就能发现，与多用大石块构成的吴哥诸寺不同，这里多用红砖；没有吴哥窟雕花墙壁、百转千回长廊，这里却衍生出许多大城王朝时期独有的建筑风格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗卡雅苏塔寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Lokaya Sutha&lt;/span>;）已经不能被称作“寺”，一片蔓生荒草中，巨大卧佛裸露在自然中接受朝拜；建于1491年的帕西桑碧寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Phra Si San Phet，三王庙&lt;/span>;）残存的三座白色锡兰式佛塔一字排开，已成大城府地标：1492年，为供奉父兄骨灰，拉玛铁菩提二世在寺中兴建两座佛塔，开启了泰国用佛塔存放国王骨灰的丧葬习俗，1529年拉玛铁菩提二世驾崩，其子又修建一座佛塔。而今时光还没有把它们摧毁殆尽，旁边历代国王依次修筑的许多小塔虽然破损严重，却依然壮观高耸，如同肃穆的卫兵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;帕西桑碧寺以东，即是以正居院中的宏伟佛塔而闻名的拉嘉布拉那寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Ratchaburana&lt;/span>;）。这座高棉样式的佛塔原本为泰式，系九世王替两位争夺王位继承权决斗而死的兄长举行火葬而建：1424年，因陀罗阇王去世，骑大象自相残杀的两个王子死后，三子从彭世洛南下继承王位，成为波隆摩罗阇二世（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat II&lt;/span>;），建设这座寺庙存放兄长骨灰。穿过如同大三巴一样只剩一面墙壁的大门，四周全是支离破碎的佛像与围墙，仿佛突然掉进遥远的古代。似一根玉米一样的主塔上，楞状塔饰层层叠叠；四周环绕四座锡兰式小塔，乃城中保存最为完整的高棉风格佛塔。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;城中最古老的寺院则在护城河外东南角，崖差蒙空寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho&lt;/span>;）为1357年乌通王为纪念王朝诞生而建，与城内充满沧桑感的废墟式庙宇不同，这里随处可见重建的痕迹，却并不让人觉得突兀，甚至还不如佛塔披挂的黄绫与斑驳的红砖给人的视觉反差强烈。长达28米的洁白卧佛是这里的标志，身披黄色袈裟安详侧卧在白花花的炙热阳光下，淡泊地注视周围饱经风霜的土地与河流。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爬上锡兰式主塔，内部有八座佛像，更令人难忘的是一种混合的奇怪味道充溢其间，硝烟夹杂腐败植物的味道，更多的是人体臭气，让人难于呼吸。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;柴瓦塔那兰寺，佛像的背影&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（张亚萌/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;繁荣的黑暗倒影&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在游人绝迹之时，崖差蒙空寺的卧佛周遭，徒留一片历经岁月洗涤过后的宁静——主塔四周，许多无头佛像静默着，似乎并不想诉说它们所经历的故事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿瑜陀耶的名字来源于印度史诗《罗摩衍那》中罗摩的诞生地及凯旋归来后的登基之地阿约提亚（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ayodhya&lt;/span>;），梵语意为“不可战胜之城”或“永恒胜利之城”，但这名字一如谶语：作为继高棉帝国之后第二个东南亚“超级大国”，当大城王朝达到鼎盛时期之时，它与缅甸之间的战争也绵延展开。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一切辉煌总有一个终结。1766年，觊觎大城府已久的缅甸王孟驳率军围城14个月之后，炸塌城墙攻入城中，在15天的烧杀抢掠之后，三万人沦为俘虏，大城府几乎被夷为平地。不可战胜之城却在战乱中破败——这个泰王国历史上持续时间最长的朝代，带着它所有的风华，在1767年戛然而止，只有十几座“洗尽铅华”的寺庙遗迹——红砖上多见黑色火烧污渍，佛像也被火焰熏得黧黑，沉默不语伫立城中，为大城王朝的黄金时代聊作见证。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在大城府，红的对面是黑。拉嘉布拉那寺之南，玛哈泰寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Mahathat&lt;/span>;）据说是缅甸军队攻打泰国的首要目标：这座始建于1374年即二世王波隆摩罗阇一世（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat I&lt;/span>;）统治时期的寺院曾拥有10余处僧院、立有如丛林般的200余座佛塔，如今寺院正中只剩巨大方形塔基，小塔亦多严重倾斜，摇摇欲坠。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;大城府如同圆明园。阳光给柴瓦塔那兰寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Chaiwatthanaram&lt;/span>;）的高塔涂上金黄，让红砖拥有了狞厉之美，带人回到战火纷飞的时代。当红已变成黑，浮屠兀自伫立，斑驳佛塔、破烂砖墙、黝黑佛像、浩大古迹，毫不留情地掩盖了繁华与覆灭，只有残留的文献与口述的故事世代相传，岁月亦如过眼云烟——盛世的繁荣也会成为幻灭的倒影，一如柴瓦塔那兰寺中，夕阳里高坐于几乎坍塌的基座上的佛像，那恒久的落寞背影。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;军队入侵之际，佛寺尽毁，刀落之处，如作家翁达杰语，“菩萨意味深长的巍峨法相倒向地面，坠入土中”。在漫长的时光中，一颗佛头被千年菩提之根紧紧包裹，环绕的枝蔓将它缠绕于其中，形成了树包佛头的奇观，亦是玛哈泰寺最著名的“永恒微笑”。如同吴哥窟中塔布伦寺景色的“终局”一样，东南亚树木的绞杀现象会让植物最终取代寄主，但而今佛像仍在菩提树中闭目微笑，不着一语，仿佛看尽王朝风云变幻，那是一种与事件万物同在、超乎生死的神奇气度，让人们可以一直站在它面前，注视它很久很久。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;两百余年光阴倏然而过，如今这里更像一个充满乡村气息与休闲氛围的小镇。遗址公园内，草坪、绿树、水塘，一派田园风光；当地人会铺张席子随意野餐，或者租下传统服饰，模仿在此取景的热门电视剧《天生一对》，在遗址中拍照。红与黑的遗址紧挨着新建的民居与寺庙，残砖败石中烟火水乳交融，有种穿越时空的错愕。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot;

In many cases, it can reflect the history and present of a society. , China and foreign countries are no exception. Everyone who has traveled to Europe will have experienced the toilet dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are generally very few public toilets in European countries, and it is often only possible to find one within a few kilometers, so there are apps for finding toilets in Europe. In contrast, in China, the function of finding toilets is covered by map apps. It is not a popular feature and cannot support an APP alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being cheap, toilets in Europe also charge a fee. In many European countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and other places, you have to pay to use public toilets. For example, most of the toilets in high-speed service areas or shopping malls in Germany have to pay. Even the toilets in fast food restaurants, shopping malls, train stations, McDonald&#39;s, and KFC are charged. For example, in Cologne, Germany, there is a fee for using the toilets inside McDonald&#39;s. For another example, a KFC in Poland posted a notice: The restrooms in the store are only available to customers. People without consumption receipts need to pay 30 zloty (approximately 53 yuan) if they want to use the restroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also various forms of charging. There is a person sitting at the door to collect the fee, there is a gate that rotates after a coin is inserted, and some are trustworthy and put a tip tray. In some stores, the toilet door has a password, and the password is printed on the shopping receipt. Not every floor of German department stores has restrooms. They are usually located near the restaurant floor on the top floor. Using the restrooms is generally free, but if there are cleaners there, a tip of about 0.3 euros is usually required. If you are in a tourist area, we will also thoughtfully provide exchange rate conversion, and prices are clearly marked in each country&#39;s currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charges for European toilets are not cheap. The last trip to the toilet costs as little as 0.3 Euros and as much as 2 Euros. 1 euro is equivalent to 7.7 yuan, which is equivalent to between 2 yuan and 15 yuan. Even if the income is higher, going to the toilet in Europe is really not cheap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the richest regions in the world, Europe is also a region with the most complete &quot;social welfare&quot;. Why are there so few free public toilets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it’s because of history. In many European cities, such as London, England, Stockholm, Sweden, and Paris, France, there are semi-open open-air toilets on the streets. It wraps the lower body but can only be used by men. These open-air urinals are used very frequently in the local area. This strange street urinal has been around in Europe for nearly 200 years. This also reflects the historical origin of the lack of public toilets in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result of this historical path, people may not regard public toilets as a government obligation. In fact, public toilets in many places in Europe are basically privatized. In this case, solve the problem according to market thinking. Toilets require regular maintenance and repairs, and you also need to hire someone to clean them. Most European countries are developed countries, and labor costs are high. This has resulted in high maintenance costs for toilets. Businesses are unwilling to include it in a package of services, but charge separately. supply. Private toilets in European cafes, small bars and other commercial places assume some functions of public toilets. Of course, you must consume food first and then use the toilet. Europeans are also accustomed to paying to use public toilets, or go to a coffee shop to buy a cup of coffee to solve their internal problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in European countries is not exactly the same. In Denmark, which has high taxes and high welfare, the government believes that the freedom to use public toilets is a public service that the government must meet. Therefore, in the urban area of ​​Copenhagen, the capital city with a small population, there are sufficient public toilets, good environment, and they are free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Chinese toilets also used to charge fees. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, as the economy developed, cities in China began to build higher-grade public toilets one after another, implementing water flushing and mechanical pumping. As the level of public toilets has improved, the cost has also increased. Some cities have begun to charge for public toilets to alleviate the shortage of funds for public toilet construction and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the 20th century, with the further development of the economy, Chinese people began to have higher requirements for toilets. New residential areas were built, and toilets were increased from one to two bathrooms. However, public toilets are not free so early. In mid-tier cities like Qingdao, public toilets were not open for free until May 1, 2008, which is only 15 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free public toilets, after all, the government has money. After years of accumulation of reform and opening up, especially after joining the WTO, the economy has developed rapidly, real estate has taken off, and local governments have obtained sufficient funds from land finance, so they are able to bear the entire cost of public toilets. Therefore, free public toilets in China are mainly the result of economic development. Whether to charge or not is closely related to the economic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Toilet charges are essentially a matter of government revenue and the scope of government public services. If the situation of public toilets in Europe is very bad, it is because of historical, cultural and customary reasons. Society has also developed various alternative forms and people have adapted to them. In some countries, the benefit of free public toilets has never appeared, and naturally it is not felt much. But if you return from free to paid again, you will have a different perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

Yao Ming said in an interview after the game, &quot;The results achieved this time can be said to exceed expectations, but the growth of a team certainly does not happen overnight. In fact, many people on the team began to emerge 10 years ago, such as the main scorer. Li Meng already achieved good results when he participated in the World Youth Championship in the National Youth Team.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Meng started playing basketball at the age of 5.
