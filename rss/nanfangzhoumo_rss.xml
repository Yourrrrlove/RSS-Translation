Photo courtesy of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Driving from the urban area of ​​Dujiangyan, Sichuan, along the winding winding mountain road to the west, after driving for more than an hour, we arrived at the China Giant Panda Conservation Research Institute Center (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Panda Center&quot;) Wolong Hetaoping Base. The climate here is cool, rainy and humid, and it is located in the natural living environment of giant pandas. It is very suitable for wild training and captive breeding of giant pandas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reintroduction of captive giant pandas into the wild is a key technology pioneered by the Panda Center, which is mainly divided into the stages of reintroduction training, release and monitoring. Over the years, generations of scientific researchers have devoted a lot of effort to establish a complete technical system for giant panda wild training and reintroduction monitoring, which has achieved good results in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why should giant pandas be reintroduced into the wild? What significance does this have for the protection of the giant panda population? From captivity to release, what &quot;training courses&quot; do giant pandas need to take? Recently, reporters conducted on-site visits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3acb8beb101d736d5a5f6e17e6c8354f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3acb8beb101d736d5a5f6e17e6c8354f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253798&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Researchers conduct a health check-up on a giant panda cub. Photo by He Shengshan&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Reintroduction into the wild is an important means to rehabilitate and rebuild the wild giant panda population&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The mountains and forests are green and the streams are trickling. In the rewilding training area of ​​​​Hetaoping Base, except for a path that the staff walked up and down the mountain, there are almost no traces of human activities, and the original ecology is preserved. In order not to disturb the silence, the reporter turned his cell phone to silent and walked in quietly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the dense jungle, giant panda &quot;Bosi&quot; and his cub are sleeping soundly. Not far away, keepers in &quot;panda suits&quot; were using this time to clean the pens and replenish fresh bamboo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In order to mask the human smell, the &#39;panda suit&#39; is sprayed with extracts of panda feces and urine.&quot; He Shengshan, director of the Field Research Animal Management Department of the Hetaoping Base, told reporters that unlike captive giant pandas, the The breeders are close to and dependent on them, and the breeders trained in the wild must remain &quot;invisible&quot; at all times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reintroduction into the wild is an important means to rehabilitate and rebuild the wild population of giant pandas, and is of great significance to the protection of giant pandas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, my country has vigorously implemented natural forest protection, wildlife protection projects and the construction of giant panda national parks to protect giant pandas and their habitats, with remarkable results. The results of the fourth national giant panda survey show that the number of wild giant pandas has increased from 1,114 in the 1970s and 1980s to 1,864, distributed in Qinling, Minshan, Qionglai Mountain, Daxiangling, Xiaoxiangling, Liangshan, etc. Six major mountain systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, natural geographical barriers isolate these wild giant pandas in six major mountain systems, and human activities have divided these six major habitat populations into small local populations that cannot interact with each other. &quot;Habitat fragmentation has resulted in the inability of genetic exchange between isolated populations, reducing the genetic diversity of small local populations and accelerating the disappearance of endangered small populations,&quot; said Wu Daifu, director of the Hetaoping base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To save a species, the integrity and stability of the community in which it is located and the genetic diversity within the species must be protected. &quot;Currently, the main measures taken to protect giant pandas in our country are in-situ protection and ex-situ protection.&quot; Wu Daifu said that the connection point between the two methods is to release giant pandas bred in captivity after rewilding training. Return to small endangered populations in the wild, thereby improving their genetic diversity, reducing the risk of extinction, and reviving the wild giant panda population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As global breeding problems such as difficulty in mating and conceiving and raising young to survive have been overcome, artificial breeding of giant pandas has achieved fruitful results, and the captive giant panda population has achieved self-sustainment. In 2003, the Panda Center launched the training and reintroduction of captive-bred giant pandas into the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2006, the male sub-adult giant panda &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; was released into the wild after independent rewilding training. However, less than a year later, workers found its body in the snow. After analysis and judgment, &quot;Xiangxiang&quot; fell from a height and was seriously injured and died during a fight with a wild giant panda for territory and food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Panda Center summarized the failed rewilding case of &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; and believed that maybe it was the lack of suitable learning objects that led to the lack of survival ability of &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; in the wild; maybe it was because the population in the reintroduction area was saturated, and &quot;Xiang Xiang&quot; was not able to survive in the wild. &quot;Lack of enough living space; the competition for territory and mates among adult male giant pandas in the wild is extremely fierce. &quot;Xiangxiang&quot; may not have enough fighting experience and cannot resist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sum up experience and make persistent efforts. In 2010, with the stable growth of the captive giant panda population, the Panda Center launched the second phase of the captive giant panda rewilding training project, and proposed for the first time a new rewilding training method of &quot;mother animals raising cubs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c89176807e0a5e9d5b83652545c85998.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c89176807e0a5e9d5b83652545c85998.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253797&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The giant panda &quot;Qin Xin&quot; was released into the wild. Photo by He Haiyang&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Helping giant panda cubs learn wild survival skills as soon as they are born&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“At 1:16 in the morning, the cub screamed, &quot;The mother lay on her side to protect her cub&quot; &quot;At 4:53 am, the mother adjusted her sleeping position to protect her cub&quot; &quot;At 8 am, the mother ate 9 bamboos in the morning and drank water twice. The cub screamed loudly and defecated once, but there were no abnormalities.&quot; ...In the monitoring room of the Hetaoping base, the work log of the keepers records in detail the daily activities of the giant panda &quot;Hui Hui&quot; and her newborn cubs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are 4 giant panda cubs in the first stage of rewilding training at the Hetaoping Base: &quot;Zhichun Zai&quot; and &quot;Bosi Zai&quot; who are over 1 years old, and two newborn cubs . &quot;All organs of newly born giant panda cubs are not fully developed. We must always pay attention to them and conduct video surveillance around the clock, and take timely measures if any abnormality occurs,&quot; said breeder Zhang Dalei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the growth and behavioral development characteristics of giant pandas, rewilding training is divided into two stages. From birth to about 1 year old, in a small training circle of about 2,000 square meters, the cubs eat breast milk. ; From about 1 year old to before release, in a large training circle of 200,000-300,000 square meters, the cubs gradually learn to eat bamboo independently. The large-scale training enclosure is located in the wild habitat environment of giant pandas, where there are tall trees, dense bamboo forests and complex terrain, in a completely natural state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on long-term practice and research, the Panda Center creatively implements &quot;mother animals raising cubs&quot; training. &quot;From birth, the cubs live with their mothers and gradually learn survival skills such as foraging for food, finding water sources, and avoiding natural enemies in nature. In the past, breeders could not teach pandas to climb trees in a few days. Now panda mothers use their mouths to climb trees. Just push the baby up the tree, and the panda baby will learn to climb the tree twice.&quot; He Shengshan said that giant pandas can be released into the wild only after completing a series of training and undergoing expert evaluation. &quot;At this time, two or three-year-old pandas will learn to climb trees. Giant pandas are in the post-weaning and pre-adult stage, and as sub-adults, it is easier to integrate into the wild giant panda population.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The selection of female animals is very particular. &quot;It is best for the mother animal to be a multi-parous giant panda with experience in wild life, or an individual with strong ability to raise young.&quot; He Shengshan said that at the same time, the body of the mother animal must be kept in good health, and factors such as age and genetic background must also be considered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid &quot;imprinting behavior&quot; in giant panda cubs, the impact of human activities must be minimized. &quot;Every time the female panda is fed food, the keeper will put on a &#39;panda suit&#39; to prevent the cubs from becoming dependent on humans.&quot; Zhang Dalei said that pandas should be made to avoid humans as soon as they sense humans instead of actively approaching them. Only then can they return to the jungle smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to feeding food, cleaning the enclosures, etc., keepers are also responsible for observing and recording the growth, development and behavioral performance of giant pandas, such as the time of first walking, first climbing, first eating bamboo, etc. Since 2012, Zhang Dalei has raised 7 giant pandas for rewilding training. &quot;Although the work is hard and tiring, as long as they return to the wild and live a healthy life, I will feel a sense of accomplishment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Accompanying giant pandas all year round is an enviable job, but it also contains risks and challenges that few people know about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In summer, mudslides often occur in the mountains, and the wild training circle is often put to the test. &quot;The mudslide that occurred on August 20, 2019, was less than 100 meters away from the cabin where we were resting. The situation at that time was very thrilling.&quot; He Shengshan still has lingering fears. Encountering wild animals in the wild is also common. &quot;Wild boars, snakes, etc. are often encountered in the mountains. Only by accumulating rich experience and being fully prepared can we avoid danger again and again,&quot; He Shengshan said. Now, he and his colleagues always make prevention plans in advance, bring enough supplies before going up the mountain, and carry satellite phones with them to ensure smooth communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researcher Wei Hua almost lost his life while training giant pandas in the wild. In December 2016, the cub &quot;Baxi&quot; who was trained in Tiantai Mountain was close to the age of release, but no sign of &quot;Baxi&quot; was found for two consecutive days. Wei Hua and his colleagues were very worried and entered the training circle to search, but found no trace of him. Thinking of being attacked and seriously injured by the giant panda mother &quot;Ximei&quot; who was eager to protect her cubs. Even so, Wei Hua still believes: &quot;&#39;Ximei&#39; biting me shows that it is wild and maternal. This is exactly the goal we pursue when releasing giant pandas into the wild.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src= &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6b7edb5080465fd325ad27a55d763969.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;556&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6b7edb5080465fd325ad27a55d763969.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253800&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Giant panda mother teaches her cub to climb a tree.

In 2018, giant pandas &quot;Qin Xin&quot; and &quot;Little Walnut&quot; were released into the Longxi Hongkou National Nature Reserve in Dujiangyan City, located in the Minshan Mountains, after undergoing wild training and scientific evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to monitor the survival status of giant pandas after they are released? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Hao said that when giant pandas are released, they will be put on an electronic collar that can be tracked and monitored, and their movement trajectory, health status and other information will be tracked through satellite signals. &quot;However, the collar It will fall off in about a year and a half, and long-term tracking and monitoring cannot be carried out. We must rely on infrared cameras, feces sampling and other methods to collect more data.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wherever the giant panda is, we will follow it.&quot; Xie Hao He said that the monitoring team members searched for giant panda feces in the deep mountains and old forests, recorded relevant detailed information, and analyzed the giant pandas&#39; gender, age, population, and genetic relationships by extracting DNA. &quot;In the mountains and valleys, we often walk for more than half a month, resting wherever we catch up at night. Sometimes we can&#39;t keep up with food supplies, and we have to go hungry.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;November 2021, Dujiangyan During field monitoring, staff of the city&#39;s state-owned forest farm captured images of wild giant pandas through infrared cameras, which were suspected to be giant pandas released in 2018. A team of experts went to the site to inspect and collect fecal samples for further testing. Through the DNA extracted from it, it was determined that this female giant panda over 5 years old was the giant panda &quot;Little Walnut&quot; released in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/8900c1ccd18fd5129b1f27d7af40f4df.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/8900c1ccd18fd5129b1f27d7af40f4df.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253801&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Researchers use radio equipment to track and monitor the movements of giant pandas. Photo courtesy of China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Mingchun, deputy director of the Wild Ecology Research Office of the Panda Center, was excited when he saw the image of &quot;Little Walnut&quot;, &quot;This giant panda has a round body and a good mental state.&quot; Normal and living in good condition in the wild. When the DNA identification results confirmed that it was indeed &#39;Little Walnut&#39;, the rewilding training team was very excited. This showed that the rewilding training of &#39;Little Walnut&#39; for more than two years was successful. I hope it can be It thrives in the wild, and we look forward to finding a suitable husband, breeding offspring, and bringing us more surprises!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the Panda Center has released 11 captive-bred giant pandas, and 9 are still alive. , 7 of which were successfully integrated into the wild population of the Xiaoxiangling Mountain System that are at risk of extinction, and 2 were successfully integrated into the wild population of the Minshan Mountain System. Among the released giant pandas, 1 male and 4 females, a total of 5, are over 6 years old and are in the prime stage of breeding. &quot;Only by releasing giant pandas into the wild population and breeding offspring can we achieve the goal of expanding the wild population. But finding clear evidence that the released giant pandas have offspring requires patience and time,&quot; Wu Daifu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, our country is building an integrated sky, air and ground monitoring system for national parks. &quot;We take this as an opportunity to add cameras, infrared cameras and other monitoring equipment in the areas where giant pandas are released into the wild to improve large-space monitoring capabilities.&quot; said Yang Jian, director of the Investigation and Monitoring Department of the Panda Center. At the same time, we will strengthen the research and development of collars. Efforts are made to improve battery life, improve positioning accuracy, and realize real-time transmission of recordings to understand the wild movements of giant pandas and other wild survival information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We will evaluate the genetic contribution through dynamic monitoring of the population.” Yang Jian said that through technologies such as “cat face recognition” and DNA individual identification, we will use technologies such as “cat face recognition” and DNA individual identification to analyze giant pandas’ kinship, age structure and genetic level. We will carry out dynamic monitoring, establish a database of regional population size, structure and geographical distribution, and verify whether the released individuals are breeding offspring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Daifu said that within the scope of the Giant Panda National Park, we will analyze the factors limiting the recovery of small local endangered populations from aspects such as genetic diversity, population dynamics, community characteristics, and human interference, and scientifically formulate plans. , carry out the reintroduction of giant pandas in an orderly manner and improve the genetic diversity of small populations. At the same time, through reintroduction in ecological corridors, genetic connectivity between populations is enhanced, providing key support for the rejuvenation of giant panda populations in the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, a giant panda rewilding training echelon has been established. In the future, qualified panda individuals will be released into the wild every year, and efforts will be made to revive the small panda population. &quot;We will speed up the innovation and promotion of key technologies such as giant panda training, release, and monitoring, and strive to release 3 to 6 giant pandas every year. We will also increase the protection of endangered small populations of wild giant pandas through introduction, and gradually establish The wild giant panda genetic germplasm resource bank enables two-way genetic exchange between captive populations and wild populations.&quot; Wu Daifu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列情报机构睡着了吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258423]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/xcPaSqDxQmYrHkrCAFG7JH82W519uIJUPDbL0XMu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1436&quot; height=&quot;958&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/xcPaSqDxQmYrHkrCAFG7JH82W51 9uIJUPDbL0XMu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253630&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, Gaza City, Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from October 7, 2023, the Palestinian resistance organization Hamas launched an attack on Israel in the border area between Palestine and Israel. Multiple cities launched compound sneak attacks, not only launching a large number of rockets but also conducting violent ground attacks. According to current statistics, at least 700 Israelis have been killed in Hamas attacks. This is the deadliest war between Israeli military and civilians since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu promised the people &quot;terrible revenge&quot; on Hamas and declared a state of war. This was Israel&#39;s first time in 50 years since the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. declared a state of war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this attack happened suddenly, there should be many clues to follow before such a large-scale attack. Why did Israel, which has Mossad, known as the most efficient intelligence agency in the world, not Can we give early warning? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before discussing this issue, we first need to understand that the intelligence work in the Palestinian-Israeli-controlled areas is positioned as domestic security business in Israel, so the main responsible agency is not the famous Mossad (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Intelligence and Secret Service&lt;/span>;), but the Shin Bet (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;National Security Agency&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shin Bet&#39;s past work in the Gaza Strip has always been considered low-key and effective. For example, in &quot;Operation Green Prince&quot;, they successfully instigated the rebellion of the son of Hamas senior Hassan Yusuf. Mosab Hassan Yusuf, for more than ten years since 1996, has obtained a large amount of intelligence from the core decision-making levels of the Hamas organization through him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Israel assigns the main intelligence work in the Palestinian-Israeli region to the Shin Bet is actually because there are frequent personnel exchanges between the two places, so there are many operations and inspections that require the cooperation of the police department, and Mossad Mainly responsible for external intelligence and covert operations, its personnel have less cooperation with local police forces, which is not conducive to seamless connection. In addition to internal counter-intelligence and anti-terrorism work, the Shin Bet also has security and protection work for dignitaries and important departments. It is closely connected with the police department, which is obviously more conducive to its work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So if we really want to hold the responsibility for the poor response to this Hamas raid, the Shin Bet cannot escape the blame, but in the final analysis, this incident also exposed the structural failure of the Israeli military and police intelligence and security system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information provided to me by some insiders, there are several main reasons for Israel’s ineffective response this time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is Israel’s constitutional crisis starting in 2022, which has led to military The police intelligence and security system is in panic. The judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing government led by Netanyahu may have shaken the foundation of Israel&#39;s national unity, causing experienced intelligence personnel and military police to retire early and emigrate overseas. The morale of those in office has also inevitably been low, weakening the country. overall combat capability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the internal security situation in Israel has been severe in the past year or so. The vendettas and gun battles between Arab gangs on the streets have seriously affected Israel’s social security. Organized crime investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also technical reasons. In recent years, the Shin Bet and the police have tended to rely more on signal intelligence and technical investigation. Due to their extensive electronic monitoring and aerial reconnaissance operations, as well as big data artificial intelligence intelligence analysis, they can obtain There is far more massive intelligence information than in the past, and automated processing is very fast. Classic manual intelligence acquisition methods like &quot;Operation Green Prince&quot; have become &quot;obsolete&quot; techniques and are no longer the focus of the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although signals intelligence has given Israel an advantage in recent years and is in line with the development direction of intelligence work, Hamas has now found a way to deal with it. Since the Gaza Strip is not large, a large amount of information can be transmitted through primitive person-to-person transmission to avoid signal detection. Since there is no electronic communication, no matter how powerful the monitoring technology is, it is useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Israel, the current results can be said to be caused by a combination of low morale, personnel loss, resource tilt, and opponent evolution. In fact, the complexity of intelligence work far exceeds the imagination of the outside world. Some people use the term &quot;finding a needle in a haystack&quot; to describe it, which is actually not accurate. This type of counter-terrorism intelligence work is more like finding the poisonous needle in a sea full of needles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opponent&#39;s counterintelligence work is not limited to keeping secrets. At the same time, it will also release a large amount of true and false threat information to confuse the public, just like the shepherd boy who keeps shouting &quot;wolf is coming&quot;, leaving people at a loss as to what to do. Israel suffered heavy losses this time, and of course the intelligence and security agencies must be held accountable. However, from a professional perspective, the confrontation between intelligence and counterintelligence has never stopped. Signal intelligence obtained through network penetration, artificial intelligence, and big data analysis is not the only method for future military and counter-terrorism. Only through multi-method reconnaissance and multi-dimensional examination can the negative impact of the fog of war be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从费翔到蔡国庆，年轻一代为什么狂追“妈妈严选”男偶像？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258347]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/302c6f1c787a6b4c0b7f30a6519e0044.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/10/302c6f1c787a6b4c0b7f30a6519e0044.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253567&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, two stars born in the 1960s, Fei Xiang and Cai Guoqing, have become popular on the Internet and are deeply loved by young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were all their mothers’ idols when they were young, and were called “Mom’s Strictly Selected” by netizens.

In 1981, Fei Xiang returned to Taiwan and entered the entertainment industry by starring in the Taiwan TV drama &quot;Eleven Women&quot; directed by Sylvia Chang. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1982, Fei Xiang joined EMI Records (EMI Records) and launched his first solo album &quot;Lian Lian&quot; in Taiwan, which began to become popular. Fei Xiang was selected as one of the top ten Asian singers in Singapore. Together with Taiwanese singers Liu Wenzheng, Fei Yuqing, Feng Feifei and Jiang Ling, they were selected and ranked in the top five. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1986, Fei Xiang accompanied his mother back to Beijing to visit his grandmother. This opportunity aroused Fei Xiang’s deep feelings for his family and country. He moved to mainland China to develop and published books in the mainland. With his first solo album &quot;Songs Across the Four Seas&quot;, he became the first Taiwanese artist to cross the Taiwan Strait and enter the mainland music scene. The tape release exceeded one million mark in one fell swoop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1987, Fei Xiang became the first Taiwanese singer to return to the motherland and sang the songs &quot;Clouds in Hometown&quot; and &quot;A Day in Winter&quot; at CCTV&#39;s Spring Festival Gala. &quot;Fire&quot;, Fei Xiang&#39;s popularity in mainland China reached its peak overnight. Its foreign, open, free and unrestrained image, music style&lt;/span>;and performance style are refreshing and make thousands of girls crazy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Xiang has released multiple albums in mainland China, each of which has become a hit. In 1989, Fei Xiang held a total of 65 concerts in 12 cities in mainland China. CCTV and Central News Film Studio also specially made videos and films for broadcast nationwide. In 1990, Fei Xiang went to New York to develop on Broadway and successfully transformed into a Broadway actor with solid singing skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that Fei Xiang&#39;s status in the country in the 1980s was considered to be the top among the top. For the audience at that time, Fei Xiang &lt;span>; was not just a star, he also carried a lot of responsibility. It captures people&#39;s imagination of beauty, future and hope, like a fire in winter, lighting up many people&#39;s lives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1968, Cai Guoqing was born, and he became famous at a young age. He joined the Central People&#39;s Broadcasting Station Children&#39;s Choir at the age of 7, and published his first album at the age of 9. In 1986, Cai Guoqing participated in the first National Hundred Singers Concert and began his singing career. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1990, Beijing held the Fourth National Young Singer Grand Prix. Cai Guoqing won the silver medal in the popular singing group with his song &quot;Beijing&#39;s Bridge&quot;. At the Beijing Asian Games of the same year, which was the first comprehensive international sports competition held in my country, Cai Guoqing sang &quot;Tonight&lt;/span>;The Stars Are Bright&quot; at the closing ceremony, further becoming well-known to audiences across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1991, Cai Guoqing appeared on the stage of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala for the first time, singing &quot;Going to the Distance&quot;. From 1991 to 1995, Cai Guoqing participated as a main actor for five consecutive years. Cai Guoqing is a frequent guest at the Spring Festival Gala. He has appeared on the Spring Festival Gala stage 23 times so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the new century, Cai Guoqing is still active in the music scene, participating in various important theatrical performances, and also participating in some variety shows as a judge from time to time. Cai Guoqing&#39;s elegant and solemn image is still a favorite of his mother, but it also makes some young people feel a bit distant, so he is not very popular among the younger generation. Many people know &lt;span>; him and don&#39;t particularly like him. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/d8c7f22596c2ea307d89512e69702a61.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/d8c7f22596c2ea307d89512e69702a61.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253564 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;&quot;Understand Mom, Become a Mom&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The two &quot;Moms&#39; Choice&quot; were once very popular, but in the era of the Internet and the fan economy, they The influence is more limited to the mother’s generation. This situation has changed this summer. Why are young people attracted to &quot;Mom Strictly Selected&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First of all, let’s look at it from the perspective of a star. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;During the domestic entertainment industry,&lt;/span>;many young top-notch celebrities, such as sky-high salaries, poor acting skills, lack of professionalism, and poor personal ethics, have been repeatedly exposed. The emergence of &quot;Selection&quot; has made young people discover that the older generation of artists are so self-disciplined, dedicated and professional. These are the role models for stars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Yin Shou, played by Fei Xiang, had not stood up, there would not have been the success of &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;. The audience also saw Fei Xiang&#39;s figure in the movie. It simply didn&#39;t look like the body of a middle-aged and elderly man in his sixties. The muscle lines were so clear that there was no trace of fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To maintain a healthy and good figure, &lt;span>; self-discipline is indispensable. As soon as Fei Xiang joined the set, he strictly controlled his diet and carried out devilish training such as equestrian, martial arts, and fitness. The filming lasted for a year and a half, and his training also lasted for a year and a half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Xiang has strong business ability and is very dedicated. As early as 2012, &quot;Painted Skin II&quot;, which he collaborated with Wu Ershan, was released. He participated in many promotions of &quot;Painted Skin II&quot; and was responsible for the promotion of the film in Taiwan alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time the road show of &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot; &lt;span>; took place in 29 cities, 33 days, and 170 shows. Fei Xiang participated in the road shows in 29 cities, and participated in a total of 164 road shows. It was so intense. Big, he still works personally and fights on the front line. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the Venice Film Festival, he initially went alone on behalf of the entire crew. Fei Xiang even participated in the English subtitles of &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot; that was released locally all night long. Translator, I have to attend an event the next day... How many big and small celebrities in domestic entertainment can be dedicated to such a degree? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This time Cai Guoqing participated&lt;/span>; in &quot;Beyond the Troubles 3&quot;. Many people thought that he would sleep on his laurels, but Cai Guoqing had no airs or baggage at all. . On the first stage, he challenged Jay Chou&#39;s &quot;Mojito&quot;, allowing the audience to hear the lyrics of the song so clearly for the first time. However, Cai Guoqing&#39;s singing is also different from Jay Chou&#39;s flavor, and his business ability is still online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, whether he was practicing singing or dancing, Cai Guoqing maintained a positive and energetic state of mind. He worked hard, was humble and sober: &quot;After a breakthrough, it is heaven for me to produce high-quality works.&quot; It&#39;s a great thing; it&#39;s a great encouragement to be recognized by today&#39;s audience.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Young people pursue &quot;Mom&#39;s Strict Choice&quot;, and another one is that the younger generation looks at the elders perspective. For example, the reason why young people affectionately call Fei Xiang &quot;Fei Xiang daddy&quot; is not only because he plays a father in &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;, but also because he is the ideal father figure and ideal elder in the hearts of many young people. image. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In real life, many elders are often keen on preaching to young people as elders and dictating their lifestyles. From Fei Xiang&#39;s series of interviews, we can see that he respects everyone&#39;s lifestyle and has profound insights into marriage, love and other key life issues. He is non-interfering, non-preaching, wise and graceful. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are also some elders who are keen to rely on their elders as elders. I have the final say in everything, young people must listen to me, and young people must respect me. , You have to praise me...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Beyond the Troubles 3&quot;, many young people saw a so real and personal Cai Guoqing for the first time: he has no airs at all and is very He is free-spirited and able to mingle with young people. He is willing to &quot;listen to&quot; others&#39; suggestions and is extremely easy-going and friendly... Who wouldn&#39;t love to have sex with such an &quot;elder&quot;? Young people will not have the pressure, embarrassment and suffering of those in lower positions. They still have respect for their elders in their hearts, and they can still be themselves freely and easily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, the reason behind young people&#39;s pursuit of &quot;Mom&#39;s Choice&quot; is their dissatisfaction with the current internal entertainment ecology, and the fact that young people have been suffering from the pressure of their elders for a long time but are unable to do so. The helplessness of breaking free or daring to be angry but not speaking out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;While we hope that there will be more “Mom’s Careful Choices”, young people might as well follow “Mother’s Carefully Selected” as an example and grow into a better person. people can eventually become better elders. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从张亮和杨国福说起：特色县的产业聚集为何常常以乡情亲缘为纽带？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258299]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It was rumored on the Internet that the two hotpot giants Zhang Liang and Yang Guofu were relatives: Zhang Liang was originally working in his uncle Yang Guofu’s shop He worked part-time there, and later went out to work alone and founded Zhang Liang Malatang. Later, Zhang Liang said: &quot;There is no blood relationship, it is kinship.&quot; Yang Guofu also made the same statement as Zhang Liang. Therefore, one thing is probably certain, that is, Zhang Liang was indeed inspired by Yang Guofu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Liang and Yang Guofu also inspired the locals. Their hometown of Bin County in Harbin has developed into a gathering place for the spicy hotpot industry. In addition to Zhang Liang and Yang Guofu, there are many other brands that are worth mentioning. Known as the &quot;Capital of Malatang&quot;. In the words of the person in charge of production of Yang Guofu Company: &quot;If a village works, everyone will follow, and the industry will rise.&quot; It is not difficult to imagine that countless ambitious young people in Bin County have followed their footsteps and entered Mala. Start a business in the ironing industry to change your destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is not a special case. Many people will remember that when they were in high school, the print shops around the school were owned by Hunanese; in universities thousands of miles away, the copy shops in and around the school were still owned by Hunanese; when studying for graduate school, change places and print. The store is still owned by Hunanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These Hunanese are all from Xinhua County, Loudi City, a famous photocopying town. Xinhua County is located in the central part of Hunan Province, with mountains crisscrossing the territory and a harsh environment. The per capita cultivated land is less than 0.15 acres. The harsh natural environment forced Xinhua people to go out. As early as 1960, before the reform and opening up, Xinhua people Yi Daixing and Yi Daiyu brothers accidentally learned the mechanical typewriter repair technology in Fuling, Sichuan, and this became the Xinhua people&#39;s copier industry. The origin of. Xinhua people spread second-hand copying equipment from Japan and the United States to China through international trade, provide support for maintenance and consumables, and sell it to copy shops through professional markets, forming a complete industrial chain of &quot;international trade + professional markets + professional stores&quot; . With this industry chain, wherever there are new people, the price of copying will drop rapidly, driving people from other regions out of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many such phenomena, such as Tonglu Express, Chengdu Snacks, Shaxian Snacks, Fujian Putian Medical, Caoxian Hanfu, Guanyun Underwear, etc.某种程度上，这是产业聚集与中国式人际关系嫁接所形成的一个独特现象：产业的亲缘、地域聚集。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些产业聚集的形成路径都差不多，最初，是某个当地人在某个行业获得成功，事业扩大，拉更多的亲戚朋友加入；在产业链上也顺着熟人人脉寻找供应商或经销商。再后来，亲戚朋友很可能自立门户，或者其他人看到了也模仿，更多的人加入。最后形成了产业集群。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;形成这个现象的原因是多方面的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;社会学有一个六度分隔理论，即世界上任何两个人，通过六个相互认识的人就能连接起来。简单地说，你通过六个人就能认识美国总统。这看起来不可能，其实说穿了不难，比如其中一条路径：任何人都可以轻易地认识一个大学生，通过大学生的老师，就能连接到校长。大学校长已经是非常高层的关系，再通过两三个人就能上到更高层面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在六度分隔的基础上，有学者提出了三度分隔理论，就是说，相距三度之内是强连接，强连接可以引发人的行为。相距超过三度是弱连接，而弱连接只能传递信息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强连接能引发行动并不难理解。强连接首先开阔了人的视野，提供了选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;B站有一个叫“非洲飞哥”的up主，拍非洲风土人情的视频，赶上了短视频的风口。他文化程度并不高，但因为他有一个在非洲务工超过十年的父亲，所以，他去非洲打工。他人聪明又勤奋，先是打工，后来做生意，再后来发现短视频。显然，没有他父亲，他的人生基本上不可能接触到“去非洲”这个选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强连接还能刺激“自己身边的人”去追求成功，哪怕你只是发了一个小财，你周边的人也非常敏感，产生出羡慕之情。另一方面，身边的人，可能是自己的发小、同学、亲戚，或者朋友的朋友，比较了解，不会神化，会让人觉得是一种可以模仿的对象、可以企及的成功，进而刺激自己也去追求这种成功。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种强连接是传递资源的。有一次，去南通参加一个活动，走访家纺城。遇到一位1997年出生的年轻老板，当时24岁，开一辆宝马五系，经营的家纺店做得很大。活动完了，大家一起吃饭，老板说自己16岁就出来做事了。我问他是什么时候从打工转变为自立门户做生意的。之所以这么问，我的想法是：16岁就出来闯荡，学历不高，肯定是家里经济条件不好，所以才早早出来打工，积累了第一桶金，有了行业经验，然后自己创业，获得成功。但他说：我从来没有打过工，一出来就独立做生意了，我爸妈、我哥哥、姐姐都是做这个的，他们带着我，就自己开店了。这就是强连接提供选择、提供资源的典型例子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商业本身，也追求这种强连接。经济学中的产业聚集，指在一个适当大的区域范围内，生产某种产品的若干个不同类企业，以及为这些企业配套的上下游企业、相关服务业，高度密集地聚集在一起。相同行业的企业聚集在一起，搜索原料产品的成本，获得配套的产品和服务的成本，交通、沟通的成本，都因地理距离变近而变小，带来更大的竞争力，由此导致了产业聚集。本质上，降低成本是推动产业聚集的最基础动力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陌生人之间要建立信任是很难的，企业在经营过程中很大的成本就是沟通成本、信任成本。那么，同样的，从降低成本的角度出发，产业链上的企业就会沿着人际关系聚集。这也是家族企业在各国久盛不衰的原因所在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，换个角度，这就是人们所说的圈子。当然，人从圈子获益也取决于自己，有些人要爹妈送到手上都干不好，有些人只是听说了，就立马行动起来，跟随、学习、模仿，最后获得成功。所以，说到底，最大的因素还是人本身。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;电影《星际穿越》（2014）剧照。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三年前的冬天，和当时的男朋友去约书亚树国家公园观星。去的时候我俩都不知道，原来约书亚树的名声来自于一种过量吸食大麻后的幻觉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;约书亚树位于洛杉矶远郊的沙漠深处，所以也可以说这种幻觉是海市蜃楼的一种。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前男友来自韩国，是虔诚的基督教徒，职业则是科学家。他最喜欢的电影是诺兰的《星际穿越》，他对星空的迷恋可以说是科学与信仰的结合。一方面，他对太空以及人类未知的领域有着穷追不舍的求知欲。另一方面，如果借钱穆先生的比喻，把人类的已知看成这点点星光，茫茫无尽的黑暗则是未知的领域，那么前男友对此的回应则是：一定有一个造物主，创造了这所有一切，而我们人类必须穷尽一生，去探寻他创造一切的美意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我虽然爱读神学书，但并不信奉任何宗教。那时候，星空于我更多是自然奇观。可惜的是，我俩穿上羽绒服，在寒冷的沙漠之夜像雏鸟求食那样高仰着头，映入眼帘的星空却不如我在爱荷华大农场里见过的那样迷人。坐在爱荷华大农场里的拖拉机上，我是真的被头顶的银河系所震撼：那星星点点就如云贵地区溪流上的石桥，断断续续，从河的此岸延续到河的彼岸，我试图用目光追溯着每一颗星点，想象着牛郎和织女就是这样，小心翼翼地踩着星星去中间相会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前男友第一次观星，模糊的约书亚树星空俘获了他的心，他也更坚信是神的手创造了这一切。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;——或许，对待星光的不同态度早已暗示这场感情注定无疾而终。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而今想起这段往事，或许是因为自己这些年漂泊不定。前段日子，圣路易斯华盛顿大学的一位老师请我帮她写推荐信，她的简历写满了学术生涯的坎坷，她在纽约州、宾夕法尼亚州、得克萨斯州，以及密苏里州都担任过教职，而今，在圣路易斯任教十年之后，她终于有机会稳定下来。作为博士候选人的我也深知，倘若自己要寻找教职，也注定要面临这种每隔几年大迁徙的经历。说实话，我已经厌倦了这种日子。漂泊生活最大的困难在于：你永远无法建立长久的联系。好不容易交到了一两个知己，或者以为会相伴终身的恋人，因为自己或对方的迁徙，感情说散就散。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;分离，对我而言，就好比两人一松手，同时坠入浩瀚的宇宙深渊，杳无踪迹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;古今中外，很多诗歌都用星光来比拟分离，这并非偶然。我已经到了念起杜甫的“人生不相见，动如参与商”就会双眼噙泪的年龄。念中学的时候，第一次读起徐志摩的《偶然》只是觉得浪漫，甚至因为各种古老的道德偏见，觉得这是一个花花公子冠冕堂皇的借口。然而如今，再次想象“转瞬间消灭了踪影”的“你我”最终能够念起的只有“这交会时互放的光亮”，感到的更多是无奈。因为失去的关系和情谊已经在黑夜中无迹可寻，唯一可念的就是如星光般灿烂的回忆。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现代心理学把“亲友死亡”“失恋”“失业”“破财”都归入“丧失”（loss）。丧失很难消化，因为再哀悼，再懊悔，再悲痛，也摆脱不掉覆水难收的现实。我自小和人不亲，所以一旦失去亲近的人，难以恢复。即便到今天，离我祖父的过世已经过去了十七年，我仍然想他，仍然会在梦里和他在熟悉的街道散步。即便我清晰地意识到自己身处梦境，仍希望这个梦可以做久一些。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对丧失，不少人最后会陷入赌徒心理，不断地加大赌注以求把之前失去的一切统统赢回来，以至于越陷越深。我碰到过一直念好学校的朋友，因为一次考试的失败或者申请名校的失利，连年不断地申请，以至于人生所有的意义都在于能否扳回这一局。不少人在失恋之后，都会匆忙进入下一段关系，急于把之前的失败经验转作后一次的成功，很可惜，这种急于求成的心理多半只会遭受更大的创伤。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一年，我也孤坐在泥沼般的黑夜里，也差点儿掉入永无天日的赌徒心理之中。最后是古罗马新斯多葛主义哲学家爱比克泰德的名言点醒了我：“不要把丧失看成失去，把它看成归还。”换而言之，那些星光交会的璀璨时刻从来不属于我，而是宇宙暂时借予我的，终有一天，我必须归还这份赠礼，我所能做的就是在借取的时候尽量珍惜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是谁在大千世界背后开着这个慷慨的“图书馆”呢？我不知道，我没有答案。我所能知晓的是：信奉神灵的人是有福的，他们能从信仰中汲取更多度过黑夜的力量。还是拿遭遇丧失为例，虔诚的信徒会剥离对自我的执著，没有了执念就无需倾家荡产，只为扳回颜面，没有执念就会感到行走人间，一切的遇见和陪伴都值得感恩。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Retailers play cards on the exchange. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang, which plans to start subscribing in the secondary market on October 9, 2023, due to Public opinion surged, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange actually stopped the IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, the first day of resumption of work after the holiday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a response to reporters&#39; questions, saying that in the spirit of being responsible for the market and investors, it would respond to the situation reported by the self-media and treat Zhejiang Guoxiang Conduct a special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang was established in 2009 and is headquartered in Shaoxing City. It is mainly engaged in the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning special equipment. It has served Luxshare Precision, BYD, and Ningde Well-known customers and projects in various industries such as Times, Hangzhou Metro Group, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, and Beijing Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, Zhejiang Guoxiang was listed on the New Third Board, and submitted prospectus materials to the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Science and Technology Innovation Board twice at the end of 2016 and in 2020, but the IPO failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Zhejiang Guoxiang once again impacted the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It took 159 days to obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for its IPO registration, which was just one step away from success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, Zhejiang Guoxiang announced an issue price of 68.07 yuan per share, with an issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times. The plan was to open subscriptions on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, after a short holiday, the clamor that its issue price was too high has become louder and louder. In addition, there have been doubts about Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s secondary listing of the same asset in the past, and the controversy has intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again issued a response to Zhejiang Guoxiang’s suspension of IPO issuance, introduced the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s preliminary review and supervision of the company, and stated that in response to the market and the majority of investors, Concerned, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will seriously organize a special inspection of Zhejiang Guoxiang and will decide on follow-up work based on the results of the special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did Zhejiang Guoxiang cause public outrage? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Second listing of the same asset? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets come indirectly from Zhejiang Guoxiang Refrigeration Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Refrigeration), which is the first Taiwan-funded enterprise listed on the A-share market. , which is quite symbolic in the mainland capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taihai.com reported in 2008 that the parent company of Guoxiang Refrigeration was Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, which was established in Taoyuan, Taiwan in 1966. It was the largest manufacturer of industrial refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in Taiwan at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above report stated that in 1995, Chen Hegui, chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, went to Zhejiang to invest and established Guoxiang Refrigeration as a joint venture with Zhejiang Shaoxing Refrigeration Equipment Factory. After that, Chen Tianlin succeeded his father Chen Hegui and became the chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Guoxiang Refrigeration was listed on the A-share market in 2003 with the stock code 600340. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to subjective and objective factors such as poor operating conditions, Guoxiang Refrigeration suffered continuous losses in 2007 and 2008. In May 2009, it was issued a delisting risk warning and became *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2009, Guoxiang Refrigeration announced that it planned to sell out all its existing assets and liabilities through major asset swaps and the issuance of shares to Xingfu Foundation, and at the same time inject the shares held by Xingfu Foundation into Real estate development and regional development business assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month ago, Chen Tianlin resigned as chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration, and Chen Genwei served as chairman and general manager of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Chen Genwei has been working for Guoxiang Refrigeration since 1997, and has successively served as section chief of the Quality Assurance Department, Secretary of the Board of Directors, and Director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2011, Guoxiang Refrigeration Asset Restructuring received approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the real estate company China Fortune Land Development successfully used its shell to go public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since China Fortune Land Development’s main business is real estate investment and development and has no intention of operating central air-conditioning business, in 2012, Zhejiang Guoxiang Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Holdings) controlled by Chen Genwei and his wife used 80 million to acquire the transfer Zhejiang Guoxiang has 100% equity, and Chen Genwei has also been promoted to chairman of Zhejiang Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retailers therefore questioned Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO, which was considered a secondary listing of the same asset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, during the IPO application process of Zhejiang Guoxiang in 2020 and this time, the Shanghai Stock Exchange made inquiries about the source of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, the Shanghai Stock Exchange asked Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain the proportion of its assets from the original listed company in its current assets and the role of its production and operations in its inquiry. It also asked the company to combine Past cases in the capital market indicate whether there are similar precedents in which the assets of a listed company were reorganized and then relisted with the same assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang listed a number of similar cases in its reply, such as Sichuan Instruments (603100.SH), Leon Micro (605358.SH), etc., saying that their main assets came from listed companies’ acquisitions. out assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the secondary listing, the Shanghai Stock Exchange stated in its response to reporters on October 9 that after review, the transactions of this part of the assets occurred in 2011 and 2012, and the total book assets related to the acquisition at the end of 2022 The relevant net fixed assets accounted for 15% and 0.06% of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total existing assets respectively. Zhejiang Guoxiang has shifted from focusing on commercial central air conditioners to mainly industrial central air conditioners. Its business, products, and technology Substantial changes have taken place in research and development, personnel and sales models, actual controllers and management. At the same time, there is basically no overlap between Zhejiang Guoxiang’s sales customers and suppliers and *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding listing standards, the Shanghai Stock Exchange quoted Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, saying that its cumulative net profit in the past three years was 387 million yuan, its net profit in the most recent year was 186 million yuan, and its cash generated from operating activities in the past three years The cumulative net flow was 600 million yuan, and the cumulative operating income was 4.226 billion yuan. &quot;Zhejiang Guoxiang complies with the first set of motherboard listing standards.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 253746&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The closing stock index of the day is displayed on an LED screen outside a building in Lujiazui, Shanghai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Super Raising&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;1.4&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Billion Yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to the secondary listing, the trigger for IPO controversy is also the excessive issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s issue price is 68.07 yuan per share, and the issue price-to-earnings ratio is 51.29 times. Such a high issue price was also beyond Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that the company is expected to use 737 million yuan in raised funds for this fundraising project. Based on the issue price of 68.07 yuan per share and the number of new shares issued of 35.0234 million shares, if this issuance is successful, Zhejiang Guoxiang is expected to raise a total of 2.384 billion yuan, after deducting the issuance expenses (excluding value-added tax) of 227.8 million yuan, The net amount of funds raised is expected to be 2.156 billion yuan, with an excess of 1.419 billion yuan raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times is not only higher than the industry average, but also higher than the comparable companies in the industry it lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;special equipment manufacturing industry (C35)&quot; in which it is located, as of September 26, 2023, the static average price-to-earnings ratio of C35 in the CSI Index industry in the past month was 27.81 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang disclosed five comparable companies in the same industry. After excluding the extreme value Jialitu (180.3 times) and the loss-making Yimikang, the average price-to-earnings ratio of the remaining three companies in 2022 is 45.82 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market criticized Zhejiang Guoxiang’s operating performance as being unable to match the issue price. Within the industry, Zhejiang Guoxiang has not yet occupied a dominant position, and its sustained profitability has been repeatedly questioned by the Shanghai Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang stated in the prospectus that since its establishment, it has been focusing on the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning. After years of efforts, it has grown into a relatively large player in the industrial and commercial central air-conditioning industry. An enterprise with high brand competitiveness. However, the company&#39;s market shares in 2020, 2021 and 2022 are only 1.20%, 1.28% and 1.77% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that Zhejiang Guoxiang’s revenue increased from 470 million yuan to 834 million yuan from 2015 to 2019. However, its net profit fluctuated greatly, which were 53.3466 million yuan, 47.1391 million yuan, and 28.3440 yuan respectively. Ten thousand yuan, 43.937 million yuan, 67.3813 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years of the epidemic from 2020 to 2022, Zhejiang Guoxiang not only increased its revenue steadily, but its net profit also increased significantly, reaching 99.7907 million yuan, 101.3427 million yuan and 185.9114 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this IPO issuance process, the first question in the implementation letter of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Review Center required Zhejiang Guoxiang to disclose the matching of its net profit growth in 2022 with the company&#39;s revenue growth, and analyze the rapid revenue growth in 2022 The main logic of growth and the sustainability of future growth, and reveal the risks of unsustainable rapid growth and provide reminders of major matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Shanghai Stock Exchange Listing Committee meeting held on June 19, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again required Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain whether its ability to continue operating has been significantly improved and improved based on the fact that its assets came from the original listed company *ST Guoxiang. , whether the relevant risk disclosure is sufficient. At the same time, the sponsor representative is requested to express clear opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The motivation for institutions to create new products at high prices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The high issuance price is reported by institutional investors during the inquiry period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that a total of 8,732 placement targets managed by 800 offline investors participated in Zhejiang Guoxiang’s preliminary inquiry. The quotation range is 7.80 yuan/share-103.50 yuan/share, corresponding to the total number of proposed subscriptions. The total number of shares sold was 51.074 billion, and the overall offline subscription multiple was 2,700 times the initial offline issuance scale before the callback. Quotation subscriptions were relatively active. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After excluding invalid quotes and the highest quotes, there are still 733 investors, corresponding to 8,547 allotment objects. The highest excluded quotes refer to allotment objects whose subscription price is higher than 81.49 yuan/share, and allotment objects whose subscription price is 81.49 yuan/share and whose planned subscription quantity is less than 3.8 million shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lower of the average and the median quotes from offline investors is 73.6 yuan/share. Among them, the median quotations from public funds, fund management companies, insurance companies, securities companies, futures companies, trust companies and private equity funds are all around 74 yuan, which is higher than the final issuance price of 69.07 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among public funds, this is especially true for those who quote high prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seventeen products of Golden Eagle Fund quoted a high price of 92.52 yuan per share, a 33.9% premium to the issue price, and were all eliminated. 29 products under Harvest Fund quoted 81.94 yuan per share. They were eliminated because the number of planned subscriptions was less than 3.8 million shares. Another 122 products with the same quotation met the subscription quantity requirements and were shortlisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the valid quotes, Wells Fargo Fund (quoted at 80.75 yuan/share), Chuangjin Hexin (quoted at 80 yuan/share), Shenwan Lingxin Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share), ICBC Credit Suisse Fund and CCB Credit Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share) The quotations of public funds such as 78 yuan/share) far exceeded the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is a company whose performance is really not impressive so sought after by institutions? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity fund person explained to Southern Weekend reporters that the issue price pricing rules are relatively complex, involving the average and median of institutional quotations, and the average and median of quotations from social security funds, pension insurance, etc. Compare. The inquiry for new stocks only eliminates 1% of the high prices. As long as the quotation is slightly higher than the average price, institutions can be shortlisted and finally get the new stocks at the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If new stocks in the market have a good profit-making effect recently, or the subject of new stocks is popular, institutions will increase their quotations to ensure shortlisting. The person said frankly, &quot;Regardless of the finalists, we all point to other institutions to look at the fundamentals. In fact, no one looks at it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main board’s new stock inquiry and pricing mechanism originally had an invisible ceiling of 23 times the price-earnings ratio. After the comprehensive registration system reform was launched, the company&#39;s issuance price was liberalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, market voices generally believed that companies to be listed with good development prospects would obtain higher valuation levels in the issuance of new shares, and companies with relatively limited development space would see their valuations return quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Former senior sponsor Wang Jiyue told Southern Weekend reporters that after the new IPO policy, the supply of new shares was low and the risk of new shares was expected to be low, so prices went up. Not only the institutional quotations of Zhejiang Guoxiang are high, but the overall quotations of new shares are also high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are some irresponsible quotations.” Wang Jiyue analyzed that the reason why institutions quoted high prices was because they expected that the stock price would not break within a few days after listing. Loss is a small probability event and does not affect the interests of fund managers. , the quotation is not binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Institutional quotations have become based on transaction expectations, rather than based on the company’s true value.” In his view, the meaning of the existence of institutional investors is to guide correct quotations. &quot;The power to set the issue price is in the hands of institutions, and there are not many practical constraints on institutional quotations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Institutional investors who participated in the inquiry also attributed the motivation for high-priced new products to &quot;making money from new products in the near future.&quot; Private equity fund Shiva Mavericks has 6 products quoted at 73.65 yuan, which were shortlisted for Zhejiang Guoxiang’s effective quotes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Hong, the manager of Shiva Mavericks Fund who is known as the &quot;Ten Billion Private Equity Boss&quot;, responded to the quotation in Xueqiu and said, &quot;Monguli will have an obvious effect of making new money in the future, and it will sell on the first day of trading.&quot; The average profit is 80%, so the main purpose is to seek finalists for quotations, and don’t care about the price. If you lose money after a few losses, then you have to be selective and quote a lower price.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liang Hong’s view, the problem lies in the high-priced IPOs, rather than in recruiting new ones. &quot;Some people say that this or that company is not worth the money, so why should they pay a high price? I want to know even more, why do they take over the market at a high price after there is so much money after listing? If not, why should I call you?&quot; At present, Liang Hong is Messages have been deleted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after the new shares are listed, who will take over? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xueqiu user &quot;Xiaye Guapeng&quot; cleverly discovered that for stocks listed at the end of each quarter, through the top ten circulating shareholders disclosed by them, we can know what the new shares will be after 5 trading days. Which funds are taking over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no limit on the price of new shares in the first five trading days, and they are subject to special regulatory attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this logic, he analyzed 9 stocks that were listed at the end of each quarter in 2022 and 2023, and found that securities companies, which are strongly related to the issuance of new shares, will use their own funds to make large-scale purchases a few days after listing. Buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Zhiou Technology (301376.SZ) and Guoke Military Industry (688543.SH), which were listed on June 21, 2023, the ten largest circulating shareholders disclosed in the interim report include the securities firm CICC , CITIC Securities, Huatai Securities, Guotai Junan Securities and China Merchants Securities, and they are all new shareholders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Jiyue’s view, high-priced innovation by institutions is not a single issue. &quot;New stock pricing rules, new stock supply and demand, stock circulation ratio, and behavioral finance under the tradition of new stock speculation all need to be taken into consideration.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of millions of underwriting fees are suspended&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Stock investors also have doubts about Orient Securities (600958.SH), the sponsor of Zhejiang Guoxiang, and believe that Orient Securities has not been diligent and responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities’ sponsorship fee for undertaking Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO this time is 2 million yuan. In addition, Orient Securities is also the underwriter, and underwriting fees are charged based on a certain proportion of the total funds raised. This is the more important income of Orient Securities in this IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus shows that the underwriting fees charged by Orient Securities vary according to the total amount of funds raised, and the rate ratio fluctuates in three levels: 7.50%, 7.70%, and 8.70%, and different fixed fees are also attached. cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total fund-raising of 2.384 billion yuan, Orient Securities can receive over 184 million yuan in underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the total revenue of Orient Securities’ investment banking business was 741.5 million yuan. Zhejiang Guoxiang’s underwriting fee of nearly 200 million yuan is of great significance to its performance in the second half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 10, Orient Securities issued an announcement on the investment banking project, stating that the underwriting rate for the Zhejiang Guoxiang issuance was 7.74% as determined through negotiation between the sponsor and the issuer. However, the specific calculation method was not disclosed. Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issuance has been suspended, and Orient Securities has not yet collected underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, the company also has indirect equity relationships with Orient Securities and its affiliates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities Hande holds 2.74% of the total pre-issuance share capital of Zhejiang Guoxiang, while Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, invested 11.11% in Orient Securities Hande. In other words, Orient Securities indirectly holds 0.03% of the shares of Zhejiang Guoxiang before its listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s controlling shareholder Guoxiang Holdings holds 16.34%, 14.71%, 4.44% and 12.51% of the capital contributions of Orient Securities Zhoude, Orient Securities Tangde, Orient Securities Xia De, and Orient Securities Hechuang respectively. share. Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, holds 15.03%, 19.12%, 18.89% and 19.99% of the investment shares of these four companies respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned five companies named &quot;Orient Securities&quot; are all investment institutions mainly funded by Shanghai Oriental Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd. and serving as executive partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oriental Securities has been investigated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 15, 2016, two penalty decisions issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission disclosed the entire process of creating the &quot;demon stock&quot; of Anshuo Information (300380.SZ), which Oriental Securities was mainly involved in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2014, a then computer industry researcher from Orient Securities sent an email to the chairman and general manager of Anshuo Information, saying that the stock price of Anshuo Information had fallen to near the issue price and that the value was absolutely underestimated. , expressed the hope to communicate with the company and then recommend it to the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From June 22, 2014 to April 30, 2015, the then chief analyst of the computer industry at Orient Securities and the above-mentioned researcher used &quot;extremely business scalable, strongly optimistic, and the best quality banking IT&quot; We wrote emails with inductive and exaggerated words such as &quot;Target, Unparalleled, Absolutely Leading&quot;, and sent a total of more than 11,000 emails to 1,279 people in 128 funds, securities firms, private equity and other institutions, disseminating iShares information to carry out Internet financial services and the Internet. financial business situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some fund management companies bought a large amount of iShares Information from November 1, 2014 to May 27, 2015. At the peak, a total of 221 public funds held more than 70% of iShares Information. outstanding shares. Anshuo Information&#39;s stock price rose from 28.30 yuan/share on April 30, 2014 to 450 yuan/share on May 13, 2015, an increase of 15.9 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the China Securities Regulatory Commission opened the case for investigation, the above two Orient Securities employees were ordered to make corrections and were given administrative penalties of 200,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan respectively, and a warning was given to Anshuo Information and the company’s chairman and secretary. , and were fined 600,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[147万名“塔尖”客户金融资产21万亿，“最耀眼明珠”撑起银行逆周期重任]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258401]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;After the existing mortgage interest rates were reduced in batches&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;Almost all deposit and loan business interest rate spreads fell&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;to&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;historical lows&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;very cyclical businesses Do banks still have countercyclical sectors?&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The latest &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; mid-year reports disclosed by various commercial banks revealed an unusual information&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Researcher from Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Taked relevant data of 12 major banks as samples, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; combined with research reports from professional consulting institutions&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;from &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Private&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;People&#39;s Bank of China&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Bank&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Hereinafter referred to as &quot;private bank&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Number of clients and &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;structure&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Assets per capita&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;The development status and influencing factors of private banks were &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; sorted out, compared and analyzed from dimensions such as /span>;&lt;span>;, private bank asset management scale and other dimensions, and it was found that&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>; overwhelmingly The retail assets under management (AUM) of most commercial banks have performed well.

The purchase of insurance and real estate is expected to be expanded in the future, including the creation of family trusts and corporate equity arrangements. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Private practice&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Still &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;at the junior level Stage&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Benchmarking international private banks&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;What is the level of private banks that are increasingly valued in China&lt;/span>; span>;&lt;span>;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Since the financial &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; regulatory authorities first proposed the concept of private banking in 2005, China’s private banking industry has gone through more than ten years&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Process&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the past ten years or so&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; many domestic commercial banks have opened related businesses, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; The scale of assets has grown rapidly. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the meantime&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Although many banks have set up their private banking business separately as a business unit system&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span >;&lt;span>;National vertical management&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;but after the separation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; returned to the large retail system&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;and&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;have the potential to accelerate&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If we take the mature private banking systems of developed European countries as a reference, domestic private banks are still in their infancy in terms of wealth management coverage and customer service levels. This may be one of the reasons why many domestic banks still put private banking business into the large retail framework and do not conduct separate accounting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As for the development of domestic private banking business, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that we can start from the following three aspects&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; ：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, strengthen investment research and professional product design capabilities, and enrich the product system. Continue to track customer needs and market changes, and promptly adjust asset allocation strategies and product structures. Improve the level of asset allocation in major categories, achieve regional diversification and asset class diversification through overseas diversified asset allocation, and help investors ensure investment returns and asset value preservation and appreciation;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;The second is to use technology to help build a digital private bank. With the rapid development of technology, the integration of financial technology and wealth management continues to deepen, and its application chain will gradually penetrate from the client side to product development, investment portfolio, valuation management and other product-side links. With the help of financial technology, we provide investment advisors with investment advice, conduct operational warnings, track customer investment progress, and greatly improve the efficiency of private banking services and customer experience;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The third is to attach importance to non-financial businesses . &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Different from traditional wealth management business, the business scope of private banks&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; includes financial services and non-financial businesses, among which non-financial businesses involve very Extensive, including investment consulting, tax planning, daily consumption, medical health, tourism, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the international &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;mature private banking system, consulting management fees generated in the non-financial field are expected to account for 45% of the overall income&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Domestic private banks can use this as a starting point, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;link to various professional institutions&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;create more&lt;/span >;&lt;span>;Profit&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[上海女童海滩搜寻现“罗生门”，全国究竟有多少“蓝天救援队”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258417]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 20:06:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Blue Sky Rescue Team of Taihe County, Jiangxi Province is conducting a drowning prevention inspection. &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; Under the banner, brand controversies often arise.

The banner of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; often causes brand controversies. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same uniforms are also called the &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; by the outside world. These days, two &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Teams&quot; that do not recognize each other have appeared on Shanghai Nanhui New Town Beach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center (hereinafter referred to as the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center), after a 4 and a half year old girl in Shanghai was lost on the beach on the evening of October 4, 2023, they were rescued the next day. Received search and rescue requests from family members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 7, the center announced that the rescue team &quot;originally planned to carry out a search and rescue mission tonight, but it was suspended due to some reasons.&quot; The statement also stated that any subsequent activities carried out at the rescue site in the name of &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; will have nothing to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, another team &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue&quot; with the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; logo also released news to the media, saying that the above statement was issued by another group of people without authorization and did not represent the Blue Sky Rescue Team. Officially, the Blue Sky Rescue Team has been searching and rescuing the 4-year-old girl at the scene and has not stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters discovered that behind the conflict between the two parties was the &quot;separation&quot; dispute between Blue Sky Rescue Team that lasted for several years. Zhang Yong, the founder of Blue Sky Rescue Team, and Cao Weiwei, the current legal representative of Beijing Blue Sky Rescue, both advocated The legitimacy of himself and the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; - the &quot;Blue Sky&quot; brand, has become the focus of competition between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Simultaneous search and rescue&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center told Southern Weekend reporters that on October 5, they were entrusted by their families to go to Nanhui New City Beach to carry out search and rescue, and they The search and rescue operation was reported to the Pudong New Area Emergency Management Bureau. &quot;After dark, we also use drones (lighting search and rescue).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member did not reveal the specific reason for the evacuation on the 7th: &quot;It&#39;s not convenient to say, I just evacuated that area.&quot; At present, &quot;the government has been conducting search and rescue operations.&quot; But the staff member also said that he had also seen other &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; at the search and rescue site in the past two days. &quot;The other party started to think that we were together, but I said no. He also wondered, why is there another Blue Sky (rescue team)?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said angrily that at some disaster sites before, Some rescue teams will carry out operations under the name of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;, some will raise funds in WeChat groups, but the payee will be a personal account, and some will charge a fee to kill, so that they have to report to the police. Report the crime. &quot;When doing charity, do charity well. If you are really capable, don&#39;t use other people&#39;s names.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was indeed another &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; involved in the rescue at the scene. On the afternoon of October 9, He Dongping told Southern Weekend reporters that as the captain of the Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team, he had been involved in the search and rescue of the girl from the 5th to the 9th, entrusted by the family, and the search and rescue is still ongoing. He Dongping introduced that he is also a member of the &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue&quot; mentioned above. &quot;BSR&quot; is the English abbreviation of Blue Sky Rescue Team. However, he had a &quot;bad opinion&quot; about the evacuation of another team, the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center, from the search and rescue site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qichacha information shows that the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center was established in July 2014, and its legal representative is Yang Chunming. For a long time, this was the only social organization registered as Blue Sky Rescue in Shanghai until 2023. On September 21, 2019, a private, non-enterprise organization named &quot;Shanghai Baoshan Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; was registered and established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping introduced that Shanghai Baoshan Blue Sky Rescue Team is the name they registered with the civil affairs department. Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team, Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team, Shanghai Qingpu Blue Sky Rescue Team and Shanghai College Student Blue Sky Rescue Team are all The team under its jurisdiction. On weekdays, these four teams are coordinated by an internal organization called the &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Coordination Center&quot;, and each team carries out rescue work according to different functions and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping said that the brands of the four &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; teams in Shanghai were authorized from the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team. He and his teammates have been doing search and rescue for many years under the name &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; before. However, before 2023, the local civil affairs department cannot register non-governmental organizations ending with the word &quot;team&quot;. &quot;In order to justify their name,&quot; they officially registered in 2023. The civil affairs department registered as the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping believes that although the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center has exactly the same costumes as them, in fact, &quot;the authorization given to them was canceled many years ago.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to He Dongping, the search and rescue scene was stormy and the waves were strong. Staff from government departments once came to them to verify which team was the real Blue Sky Rescue Team, as well as the team’s skills and equipment. “We told them truthfully. After that, I asked them to leave.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Competing for &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters discovered that the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center is also a private non-enterprise organization registered with the civil affairs department. The difference between them is actually that they belong to different blue sky rescue systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The list of Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center and its team members is listed on the website &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot;; the list of personnel of the four blue sky rescue teams including the Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team is posted on the website &quot;Blue Sky Rescue .China” on. Through the domain name retrieval system and Tianyancha, the owners of the above two domain names are Chi Xiang, the legal representative of Guangdong Blue Sky Rescue Team, and He Dongping, the legal representative of Shanghai Little Savior Technology Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The information published on the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot; shows that Zhang Yong is the commander-in-chief of the Blue Sky Rescue Team; &quot;Blue Sky Rescue. China&quot; shows that Cao Weiwei is the person in charge and captain of the brand management of the Blue Sky Rescue Team . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the country&#39;s earliest Blue Sky Rescue Team was registered with the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, becoming China&#39;s first private, non-enterprise rescue team with independent legal person qualifications. Zhang Yong, who proposed the establishment of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, has long served as the legal representative of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Beijing Blue Sky&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253789&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two different national blue sky rescue platforms.

Internet screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 2020, Beijing Blue Sky’s board members underwent drastic changes. According to the minutes of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team board of directors released by the WeChat public account &quot;BJBSR&quot; (the name of the public account at the time was &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;), on July 27 of that year, Zhang Yong resigned as captain and legal representative at the board meeting. position, the board of directors also elected Cao Weiwei as vice chairman and legal representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Yong later did not admit the authenticity of the meeting minutes. According to the China Judgment Documents Network, Zhang Yong once filed a lawsuit against Beijing Lantian regarding the minutes of the board of directors that &quot;expelled&quot; him, requesting that the four meeting minutes be found to be invalid. Zhang Yong claimed that Cao forged the signature on the minutes of the board of directors. However, the court believed that the evidence submitted by Zhang Yong was insufficient to prove his claim and ruled that Zhang Yong lost the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the WeChat public account &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot; has become the account actually operated by Zhang Yong. On December 23, 2020, &quot;Yuanshan Theory&quot; explained the whole incident, saying that Beijing Lantian discovered huge financial loopholes during its audit at the beginning of that year. After investigation, the target was Cao Weiwei, who was the captain of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team at the time, and it was decided to expel Cao Weiwei from the Blue Sky Rescue System. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Yong ended up being the one who was &quot;fired&quot;. In February 2022, the legal representative of Beijing Blue Sky was changed to Cao Weiwei. In April of the same year, Zhang Yong posted a video on &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot;. In the video, he was wearing a dark blue uniform of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. He raised many questions about Cao Weiwei, who had served as his assistant, saying that he was seeking personal gain. By stealing official seals, forging materials, etc., the legal representative of Beijing Lantian was registered as an individual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 31, 2023, the official WeChat public account of the &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; issued a statement announcing the removal of Chairman Zhang Yong, the removal of director positions and expulsion from the team, and the election of Cao Weiwei as Chairman. On October 1, the public account issued another statement explaining that the reason why Zhang Yong was fired from Beijing Blue Sky was &quot;violation of discipline.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Weiwei explained to Southern Weekend reporters that there were many reasons for expelling Zhang Yong, including &quot;personal issues&quot; and his self-proclaimed &quot;captain&quot; who violated relevant regulations that social groups cannot be managed vertically. &quot;To put it bluntly, he is doing it outside with other people now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Relationship between the headquarters and local teams&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Behind the above disputes are Beijing&#39;s &quot;Blue Sky Headquarters&quot; and Blue Sky Rescue in various places. &quot;Brand licensing&quot; relationship between teams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s private rescue teams were originally composed of outdoor sports enthusiasts. After experiencing the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and the 2010 Yushu earthquake, the private rescue force gradually developed into a large scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Groups&quot; stipulates that social groups are not allowed to establish regional branches. Therefore, both Zhang Yongfang and Cao Weifang have stated that there is no hierarchical affiliation between the more than 2,000 registered Blue Sky Rescue Teams and Beijing Blue Sky. However, the Beijing Blue Sky dispute will still affect other Blue Sky rescue teams across the country through some intangible assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, &quot;BJBSR&quot; stated that the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot; that the National Blue Sky Rescue Team has used for several years has belonged to Chi Xiang&#39;s personal company, and Beijing Blue Sky terminated its cooperation with Chi Xiang in 2020 . Currently, Beijing Blue Sky holds the copyright and patent rights of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, which are well-known to the public, such as the &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue Round Logo&quot;, BSR Square Logo, and Blue Sky Team Uniforms. Information about Zhang Yong&#39;s Blue Sky Rescue Team is disclosed through the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure&quot; Published through channels such as &quot;Platform&quot; and &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 30, &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot; announced that the Blue Sky Rescue Team would change the VI logo system and rescue phone number. Many Blue Sky teams from various places, including the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center, responded one after another. The next day, the &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; issued a response stating that &quot;the relevant signs and logos of the Blue Sky Rescue Team have not been updated or changed&quot; and once again emphasized that Zhang Yongshi was &quot;fired&quot; and &quot;removed&quot; from Beijing Blue Sky for &quot;violating discipline&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the &quot;separation&quot;, in 2014, Blue Sky Rescue Team formulated the &quot;Fuyang Convention&quot; and established the brand licensing model of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;. Beijing Blue Sky is the brand holder and maintains the national system through the structure of &quot;Beijing Team-Provincial Brand Supervisors-Local Blue Sky Teams&quot;. Any locality that is willing to form a team will submit an application, and Beijing Blue Sky will send a liaison officer to review and inspect the application. Those who meet the Blue Sky team building standards will be approved to form a team. Beijing Blue Sky authorizes it to use the name and logo of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, and sets up &quot;brand supervisors&quot; in each province, who are responsible for supervising whether the Blue Sky Rescue Team in each province carries out activities in accordance with the system stipulated by Beijing Blue Sky. If it fails, it will be removed. Local teams have the obligation to implement the various management systems of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and adhere to the development philosophy. However, people, finances, and materials are independently managed by the local rescue teams. The headquarters does not interfere with the regular operations of each team in normal times. It only requires that when conducting unified rescue. The unit obeys the dispatch and command of the headquarters and frontline headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years since then, the Blue Sky Rescue System has developed rapidly across the country. Some teams and personnel have chosen to withdraw, and more volunteers want to join. But from the actual legal status, the Blue Sky headquarters is equal to the Blue Sky teams across the country. Zhang Yong once explained that private rescue teams can register with the local civil affairs department to become a &quot;certain blue sky rescue&quot; organization. If this team does not want to join the blue sky rescue system after registration, or has withdrawn from the blue sky rescue system, it can still continue to use it. The registered name of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;. When they carry out activities, they do not need to assign tasks through the headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Weiwei explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;brand management&quot; is a kind of intentional cooperation. Unified trademarks and team uniforms are for resource sharing and common ideas among different team members. In addition, Beijing Blue Sky cannot restrict the behavior of teams from various places through other means, &quot;it all depends on the spirit of volunteerism.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But some civilian rescue team staff have different perspectives. Li Yanzhao, an early member of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and captain of the Qingdao Red Cross Rescue Team, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that many private rescue teams need &quot;Blue Sky&quot; because it has a high social reputation. Relying on this &quot;brand&quot;, many times they can &quot;protect yourself&quot;. Li Yanzhao left the Blue Sky Rescue Team in his early years because he disagreed with the Fuyang Convention. In his opinion, compared with the unified &quot;Blue Sky&quot; brand, what the private rescue team actually needs most is &quot;professional and standardized operation and rescue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[入职三天因“氛围不好”走人：要分清是公司不行还是自己不适应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258393]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a post viewed by more than 5 million people on the Internet has aroused heated discussion: A young man has been working for three days because of the atmosphere of the unit. It’s not easy to leave your job. As soon as this topic came up, countless netizens started a heated debate on the working atmosphere and salary and benefits: some said that the working atmosphere is very important and is the bottom line of being a human being; some believed that working is just to make money, and as long as the treatment is good, you should endure it. Just have to endure it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the working atmosphere or salary is more important is a matter of opinion. There is no unified standard answer. But everyone should pay attention: the working atmosphere cannot be defined simply as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. The key is whether it suits you personally. When considering whether you are suitable or not, you cannot rely on your own vague feelings, but must have measurable standards, such as: industry prospects, company development, leadership ability and charm, teamwork, nature of work, job division, your own suitability, and Salary level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is a sunset industry, a company that lacks a future, a strong bureaucracy, widespread flattery, team intrigues, a depressing working atmosphere, fierce competition and other truly bad operating conditions, there is nothing wrong with choosing to leave. And habitat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if the industry is booming, the company has a good future, the company is full of vigor, the leadership and business backbones are strong, the teamwork is close, the relationship between colleagues is harmonious, the competition is fierce but the system is fair, and rewards and punishments are clear... it&#39;s just that It is not good to easily give up a hard-won offer based on some vague feelings because you are temporarily unsuitable, unable to keep up with the rhythm, and your self-esteem is temporarily frustrated. After all, it is difficult to fully and objectively understand a company and related industries after only a few days of employment. Frequent employment and resignation within a short period of time will also have a negative impact on an individual&#39;s credibility in the workplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 years ago, when I was young, I had several experiences of leaving my job quickly after a short time in the job. This was because I felt that the company was small, the equipment was backward, and the business it undertook was also small. The lower end is not good for your future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I had the opportunity to join a 4A advertising company. I was very frustrated at first. The working atmosphere was not good. The &quot;senior creative&quot; was unwilling to teach a new &quot;design assistant&quot; like me. The creative director (Creative Director) was basically Don&#39;t look at me seriously. However, seeing so many award-winning works in the company, the advertising agencies of large companies, the profound insights of CDs and SCs in analyzing problems during meetings, and the many Apple &quot;Macintosh&quot; graphics workstations in the creative department... I feel that I am lucky to be in the company. As long as people don’t forcefully kick me out of this prestigious creative enterprise, I must stay and learn all their skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, when I became the creative director, I also faced the problem of new employees leaving within a few days of joining. The reason was: I felt that the big brothers and sisters in the company did not respect them enough. This new employee was in school. He had served as a cadre of the student union at that time, and other classmates were probably polite to him and were used to it. Suddenly he entered a company and became the bottom of the team. The psychological gap was too big. This is not a &quot;bad atmosphere&quot; in the company, but a &quot;bad mentality&quot; on his part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A HR friend from a headhunting company once said to me: Do you plan to be a part-time worker for a long time, or will you be able to do it yourself in the future? The way you deal with it in the workplace is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to be a part-time worker for a long time and eventually become a professional manager, then in the early stages of your career experience, you should change jobs frequently to enrich your experience and look for opportunities as much as possible. As you gradually mature, you will need to slow down the frequency of job changes in order to accumulate your own workplace personality. Because the headhunting market is now all connected to the Internet, the boss and the board of directors have increasingly strict requirements on the workplace ethics of senior managers. The previous &quot;meritocracy&quot; has gradually developed into &quot;both ability and political integrity&quot;. In the early days of starting a business, I was still rampant in an immature market, so of course I advocated &quot;meritocracy&quot;. Now, as those with successful careers are getting older, they have to consider whether their foundation will be passed on to the &quot;second or third generation&quot; in the future. Therefore, their employment methods have also begun to select harvest-type talents to avoid &quot;restless&quot; talents. People rise to the top. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to do it yourself in the future, you must find a company that is large enough and complex enough, fully understand how an industry operates, how a company operates, and understand the market and people in the workplace. How do you survive? The focus is on observing the market, understanding people&#39;s hearts, and understanding human nature, not &quot;working atmosphere&quot; or &quot;salary benefits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This HR friend also believes that &quot;college students&quot; should be cautious when starting a business. If they have just graduated from college and do not understand the market and have no insight into human nature, they will go into debt to start a business and even use up their parents&#39; pension. That&#39;s not good. Tens of millions of college students graduate every year around the world. How many Jobs and Musks are there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;College students should find employment first. Even if they change jobs a few times, experience some things in the world, get a preliminary understanding of the market, get in touch with complex human nature, and then start their own business, the probability of success will be higher. Even so, we do not advocate &quot;resigning after three days of employment&quot;, because in three days, you can&#39;t learn anything, you can&#39;t understand anything, and you can&#39;t even find out what problems the company has. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
