But going into the city is different, especially since there are so many anxious moments in Paris, such as catching a car or a flight. At that moment, I usually turn on the &quot;Assassin Mode&quot; and constantly remind myself: Concentrate and go straight to the goal, so as not to delay things. For example, one morning, I made an appointment with a friend from China who was visiting an art museum, and we had breakfast together in her hotel. I went out and found that it was already a little late. I was going to take bus 72 to the Louvre Museum. I saw bus 72 passing in front of me. It was still 500 meters away from the next stop. While the car was waiting at the traffic light, I ran forward in one breath, hoping to catch up before the car reached the next stop. I ran about a hundred meters when the bus driver caught up with me and honked the horn for me to get on the bus. After I got on, everyone in the car looked at me with sympathy. They must be thinking, this woman is really a bit hard-working. I was a little confused for a moment, thanked the master, and swiped my card in a hurry. In fact, I didn’t expect that the harder work would come later. When I took the plane back to China, I realized that every second counts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I first planned to go by car, and everything was arranged in an orderly manner. My friend Mike is an Italian petty bourgeoisie living in Paris (Li Piao is keen on shopping in supermarkets, saving points, and discovering various money-saving strategies). He has never taken me to the airport because he used to drive a diesel car with pollution level 5, which could not be driven except on weekends. Now that he has a new car with pollution level 2, which is ready to go on the road at any time, he enthusiastically said that he would give it to me. And the timing was coincidental, he got off work at five o&#39;clock and we set off at five twenty. My flight is at 9:20, so I leave four hours early. Charles de Gaulle Airport is only 30 kilometers away from where I live, so I should be there in an hour. I thought about it and thought it was appropriate. At five o&#39;clock, I went to a nearby shop and bought a bowl of fish fillet rice bowl. It was topped with a layer of tuna and salmon. It was not soupy and watery. It could be enjoyed before boarding the plane, so there was no need to eat on the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We set off at almost half past five. The atmosphere was relaxed, listening to music, talking and laughing. The first few kilometers were pretty smooth. Once on the ring road, the road was basically like a parking lot. Only motorcycles were speeding in the gaps between cars. Ambulances and police cars passed one by one, and the cars on both sides gave way. I looked out the window and thought about what&#39;s so good about a big city. It&#39;s so chaotic. But I really had plenty of time, so I tried to relax. The radio in the car played the soothing, melancholy and melodious singing of jazz singer Bilie Holiday, which was like a massage for the soul. It was about a woman. Crazy for love, you can move mountains and so on for love. Mike said it would be nice if you were a homeless person living under a bridge and didn&#39;t have to rush back to work. I want that too, but I like soft beds, I love my job, and I have to rush back to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were stuck in traffic on the ring road for an hour and planned to get off, but when we got to the side road, the car stopped there, unable to move forward or backward. On the map, the entire city&#39;s routes were red, and I waited until almost seven o&#39;clock. I looked out the window, and there were cars all around me. I became more and more panicked. I began to imagine the tragic situation of being expelled from school because I couldn&#39;t catch up with class. Even the brisk jazz tunes couldn&#39;t calm my mood. The city outside the window seemed like It&#39;s getting more and more aggressive, and the blue sky and white clouds seem hollow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mike was at a loss, so he took out a ticket from his wallet and said to me: &quot;You get off here and go straight to Line 4. From there you take the bus to North Station and then take the RER express.&quot; , Line B to Charles de Gaulle, it takes an hour to get to the airport. This area is very chaotic, be careful with your wallet and mobile phone. Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was not ready, but I got off the bus bravely , if there were any mistakes in the middle and I couldn&#39;t make it within an hour, I would have missed my flight. But if I sit in the car and wait, I will definitely miss my flight. I grabbed my luggage from the trunk (I was glad I had four wheels) and sped down the bike path like an antelope being chased by a lion on the grassland. I turned on &quot;assassin mode&quot; while running, with the goal of getting to the airport within an hour. I am glad that I wear sneakers and have good physical strength like a retired athlete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The beginning went well. I was standing in the subway station, hesitating where to get off. An old lady said loudly: &quot;It&#39;s the same on both sides.&quot; As soon as I got underground, there was a subway waiting with its door open. Before going up, I confirmed with a gentle man whether I was going to the North Station. I looked at the stop sign carefully, worried that I would miss it. But when I got to the North Railway Station, things became complicated. There were many trains, RER lines and subway lines. I couldn&#39;t find the B line at once. I followed the signs but ended up in the wrong place. Fortunately, I asked before getting on the train. You didn&#39;t get on the wrong bus. I was walking around like a headless fly when I saw an officer on duty who was on the phone. I rushed over and asked him where to sit at Charles de Gaulle Airport. He must have been shocked by the fact that I was sweating profusely. While he was talking on the phone, he quickly led me to the car. Coincidentally, the car I was going to take arrived at this time, so I might have a better chance of catching the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then there were forty anxious minutes. Each stop seemed extremely long, and people got on and off the bus leisurely at each stop. I thought that only flash floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and subway failures could prevent me from going to the airport at this time. I was very anxious and kept looking at my phone and looking at the two women sitting next to me who looked calm. They also had huge luggage, but they must have more time. I sighed that I was still sitting on a deck chair by the river yesterday afternoon, eating raw ham and cheese, drinking beer, and today I was about to go through such a test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport, twenty minutes before it closed for boarding passes. I followed the crowd and rushed to the counter. A handsome black man opened his hand and said to me: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll make it in time. Just relax.&quot; I handed him my passport, thinking that I must look very good. It&#39;s so embarrassing, it&#39;s like a bandit crossing the border. The passengers next to me were also complaining about the heavy traffic jam today, seeming to explain my late arrival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sent my luggage, queued at the security check, and sent a voice message to my Italian friend about what happened today. The girl in front of me turned out to be Italian, so she said to me: &quot;You should be in front of me. If it were me, I would be extremely anxious.&quot; We are truly sisters from all over the world. She said that she had worked at L&#39;Oréal Paris for three years and was now going to Shanghai to stay for three years. Her plane was behind me. I thanked her and moved in front of her without any ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I arrived at the boarding gate, I found that the sweat on my body had turned cold, my T-shirt was completely soaked, and the yellow fish pattern printed on it had turned brown. I suddenly felt very worried. I saw a retail store next to me, so I spent twenty euros on a souvenir T-shirt for my trip. I went to the bathroom to put it on and dried my hair to make sure everything was safe. At this time, there is no longer any queue at the boarding gate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m in line to board the plane.&quot; I called Mike to reassure him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I just came home too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Thank you for the airport light rail ticket today, thank you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t You delivered it. I&#39;m eating the fish fillet rice bowl you forgot on the seat. It&#39;s not bad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a good appetite.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a safe journey. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, I walked out of Chongqing Airport wearing a slightly tacky T-shirt with a huge Eiffel Tower printed on the chest, like a tourist who had just checked in. I have to say that catching the plane this time has given me a lot of confidence to face the future while feeling lucky. I remembered a scripture: There is a time for everything, a time for everything under the heaven...A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to abandon; a time to tear, and a time to mend; a time to be silent, and a time to speak...I feel that everything is There is a certainty that sometimes you miss your flight and sometimes you catch up: when necessary, turn on the &quot;assassin mode&quot;, stay vigilant&lt;strong>;and&lt;/strong>; move forward bravely, and there is always a chance of catching up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[导游变身导买，这样的旅游团还能走多远？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256920]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, I signed up for two tour groups, namely Three Gorges and Wulong. The orders were placed on the same travel platform. The customer service is very patient, the procedures are very standardized, and electronic contracts, travel notices, insurance purchases, etc. are all available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenery on both sides of the Three Gorges is beautiful. On the cruise ship, you can watch the rising sun in the morning and the bright moon and stars in the evening. You can hold a sleeve of breeze and watch the river flowing eastward. It is really a good place to express your love for the mountains and rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gap between the Tiankeng and the ground in Wulong is even more amazing. The Tiankeng is really as if God accidentally dropped a huge boulder, creating a huge crater on the ground. It is majestic, strange, dangerous and... It&#39;s quiet; the crack in the ground is like a narrow crack in the depths of the earth. The rock walls on both sides are steep, with springs and waterfalls splashing above, and streams flowing below. It&#39;s endlessly ethereal and breathtaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the beauty of these two journeys only ends here, because traveling also requires eating, sleeping, and a tour guide, which does not feel so wonderful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the tour guide first. Tour guides have long implemented the local accompanying system. They change tour guides at each place. When they arrive at the scenic spot, they change to another commentator. Along the way, there are many tour guides. One face is not familiar yet, and another face is changed immediately. It’s a revolving door. Similar. This is very unfriendly to me who is face blind, but that&#39;s it - there&#39;s nothing I can do about it - after not traveling far for three years, I was surprised to find that the guide system has always been the same, but now the tour guide&#39;s style has changed again , have turned into guides and bought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we swam at the Three Gorges Dam, on the way to the dock, the tour guide started selling beef, small fish products and sesame food in the car. She said that the quality of these products was guaranteed and the prices were reasonable. She wanted to buy them. Earn money for interest classes for my daughter. The driver cooperated and drove slowly, and then simply stopped on the side of the road. About one-third of the tourists bought the products she put in the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the middle of the trip to the Three Gorges, we got on a small boat and traveled to Shennu Creek. In addition to the boatman, there is also a tour guide named Amei on the boat. Shennu Creek is very beautiful, and the guide’s introduction was pretty good at the beginning. However, after only being “good” for a while, she introduced her hometown and various specialties from her hometown, which are “purely natural, pollution-free, and have special effects on the human body.” Efficacy&quot;. As I expected, on the return trip, she started selling the local specialties that had been placed on the cruise ship. During the entire return journey, I heard the tour guide shouting in the headset: &quot;Please support our hometown.&quot; &quot;How many packs do you want?&quot; The mood of watching the scenery was ruined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving in Chongqing, the tour guide did not help me buy any real items. What she sold was a night tour in Chongqing, three places, 70 yuan. When the car arrived in the city, she got off the bus with the tourists participating in the night tour and asked us to go to the hotel to check in. Then the tourists got into a quarrel at the hotel front desk over who checked in first and who last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wulong Tour also took us to a Miao Village Scenic Spot. In this scenic spot, the most impressive thing was that the tour guide of the scenic spot constantly promoted their silver products. In his mouth, these silver products are unparalleled in the world. The only thing left is that it has a full range of health care effects, blah blah blah. As a result, no one bought it, so he ignored us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about food. Most of the two tour groups include meals. Except for the three meals on the cruise ship, which are normal, the rest is hard to describe. The meal price is 40 yuan per person, eight dishes and one soup. These eight dishes include meaty ones such as very fatty pork belly, stir-fried chicken offal with onions, etc., and vegetarian ones such as cold skin, potatoes, pumpkins, etc. The soup is a veritable soup. I only saw three pieces of radish in one radish soup... &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As for the accommodation, each person is only guaranteed to have a bed to sleep on. As for whether the lights are on, whether the bath water is at a suitable temperature, and whether the door lock is broken, tourists are left to their own devices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traveling, you don’t make a guide, don’t plan a route, don’t bother to think about the car, meals, hotel, etc., but leave it all to the travel agency and become a hands-off shopkeeper yourself. I think it’s very strange. Economical and convenient model. Your travel agency makes money, and I, the tourist, enjoy the beautiful mountains, rivers and good mood. Both parties get what they want, how wonderful! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what I wonder is, why is the tourism industry running in the opposite direction? You see, the tour guide will almost reach into your pocket and take out the money. The group meal costing 400 yuan per table can be reduced to 40 yuan. The cheaper the room, the better, no matter what facilities it has. Don’t they think they are seeking a dead end and pushing tourists away? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after the epidemic, the market demand for tourism is huge. If the tourism industry seizes this trend, rectifies its business practices, provides high-quality services, changes its image, and builds reputation, it should be able to attract many tourists. under their command. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a pity, they are going further and further on the road of deceiving tourists. I don’t know how far this kind of tour group can go. At least, I don’t dare to join the tour group again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a retired teacher in Jiaxing, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The reporter learned from the China Bicycle Association on the 17th that my country, as the world&#39;s largest bicycle manufacturer and exporter, currently has more than 200 million bicycles in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Wenyu, vice chairman and secretary-general of the China Cycling Association, said that based on a survey of travel data in eight cities including Beijing, Changsha, and Chengdu, about 30 out of every 100 trips taken by urban residents across the country are made by bicycles. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; has been completed, and &quot;two-wheel travel&quot; occurring around rail stations across the country accounts for more than 20% of the total travel volume. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; reduces carbon emissions by about 10,000 tons across the country every day. Based on a fuel consumption of 8 liters per 100 kilometers, this is equivalent to saving about 6.6 million liters of gasoline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to promote product structure optimization. Guo Wenyu said that the current output of lightweight and intelligent electric-assisted bicycles has increased significantly. In the past two years, the domestic sales growth rate of electric-assisted bicycles has exceeded 20%, and electric-assisted bicycles with intelligent functions are favored by young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to advance digitally and intelligently. Guo Wenyu said that currently on the production side, welding robots, painting robots, assembly line feeding robots, etc. have a wider range of applications, and more than 20% of industry companies have carried out production line automation upgrades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the consumer side of the bicycle industry, relying on technical support such as big data and the Internet of Things, new products and new models such as shared bicycles and centralized charging and swapping have emerged. Chu Yiqun, vice president of Haro Group, said that as a leading company in shared travel, Haro&#39;s number of registered users and orders have increased steadily in the past few years. &quot;Using high-level cycling products and services to continue to popularize low-carbon travel and healthy living, shared bicycle companies have a duty-free responsibility.&quot; Chu Yiqun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学者谈县域教育：要给没有能力进城的学生一定的教育发展空间]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256753]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBPeNQWX2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBP eNQWX2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 2, 2021, in a rural primary school in Tengchong, Baoshan, Yunnan, preparations Sleeping students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2017, Lei Wanghong, who was still studying for a doctorate in administration at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, was working on Looking for a topic for her doctoral thesis, she set her sights on grassroots education for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This decision came from a &quot;shock&quot;. She graduated from a rural school in Jianghan Plain and studied all the way to get a doctorate. However, when she returned to her hometown, she heard that the school was no longer what it used to be. Students were fighting and the enrollment rate was declining. The junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and wiped in the back of the classroom. tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Lei Wanghong visited county schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Henan and other regions, and she found that this phenomenon was not a special case. She noticed that some drastic changes were taking place at the end of basic education, and these changes at the end were silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the wave of urbanization in education, rural students are pouring into counties, and what is left in villages and towns are often children who cannot afford to go to cities to study. Some of them do not like to study, are disobedient to discipline, and are almost self-indulgent. Giving up, the teacher also has a headache, and both parties are in confusion with no way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Wanghong believes that for county-level governments, the main goal of education urbanization is regional development, that is, by attracting rural students to study in cities and driving rural people to buy houses and consume in cities, thereby promoting land The closed fiscal cycle ultimately promotes regional economic development. However, from a practical point of view, the introduction of education into cities has not greatly stimulated local economic development as expected, but has resulted in some students being left behind in villages and towns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She found that counties in central and western provinces and eastern provinces have different development paths in the process of promoting urbanization of education: public and private education are more balanced in the eastern region, while private education in the central and western regions is relatively stronger. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there such regional differences? Educational urbanization has experienced at least ten years of development. How effective is it? Under this wave, what should the remaining children do? Lei Wanghong is now a lecturer at the School of Public Administration of Central South University. She was interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters on related issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The economic foundation determines the development path of county education&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you pay attention to county education issues at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>; Once when I returned to my hometown, a neighbor kid told me that my junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and was wiping tears behind the classroom. When I was studying, she was very majestic, and I respected her very much. This contrast was shocking. In addition, the situation in my hometown has not been very good for higher education in recent years, and there has been a fierce discussion in society about the uneven distribution of educational resources. At that time, our team had been studying grassroots governance, and no one had studied grassroots education issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After May 2017, I went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and Guizhou and other places to investigate different villages, townships and counties. The education situation of various school stages in the space, and understanding the development of government education, students&#39; family situations, and school social evaluation, the overall research perspective of county education gradually emerged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eastern and central and western regions, in county education What problems do each face during development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The eastern region has sufficient educational resources and capable parents. They generally form better home-school cooperation with schools, but competition in education It is very fierce. For example, the Hangzhou Family Committee election was reported in the news before. In order to give their children more performance opportunities, parents will engage in fierce PK. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important problem in the central and western regions is intergenerational separation. Parents will also follow the trend and adopt some self-help behaviors, such as &quot;accompanying students&quot;. The phenomenon of accompanying students in Gansu, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Hubei is very universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you found any similarities in the education situation in different regions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One similarity is the urbanization of education. To put it simply, the improvement of the quality of schools in the city will attract students to study in the city, which in turn will encourage more families to buy houses in the city, thereby revitalizing land finance and regional development. But there are some differences between the eastern region and the central and western regions. The former&#39;s education urbanization is more of a natural urbanization. Parents move to cities to work, live and take their children to receive education because there are job opportunities in the city. The latter&#39;s education urbanization is driven by local governments, because rural areas The supply of school education is too poor, and local governments have invested more resources in urban schools, thus forcing people to send their children to urban schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, I went to a developed county in Zhejiang for research. Basically, all the local village primary schools were withdrawn and concentrated on running schools in towns and villages. Township schools are well-equipped and beautifully built, and their teachers are of high standard, many of whom are admitted from other places. However, due to the urbanization of education, rural children have gone to cities to study, and those who are left behind are children with poor family conditions who do not like to study and are not easy to manage, which is a headache for teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I found that this phenomenon is very common. The end of the eastern region is at the township level, and the end of the central and western regions is at the village level. Being at such an end, unable to provide students with enough educational hope, teachers are also in pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The development logic of education urbanization in the eastern and central and western regions is the same ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Due to different economic bases, the eastern region and the central and western regions have very different spatial distribution. The eastern region has a developed economy and strong education supply capacity, and the quality of public education in various urban and rural areas of the county can be guaranteed. The eastern region has developed industries and large employment opportunities. Parents go to the cities to find jobs, and their children also go to the cities to study. Families can buy houses and live in the cities. Its urbanization is a natural urbanization in which education and production are synchronized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of counties in the central and western regions have not yet established local finances that allow local governments to obtain sufficient financial resources. They are unable to ensure the balanced development of urban and rural education and provide employment for local migrant workers returning home. There is also very little space. Young people from peasant families can only go to the eastern cities to work and earn money. Because they cannot afford the high cost of education in developed areas, the children can only stay in their hometowns to go to school and be taken care of by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1278&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Lei Wanghong and his team conducted research in a certain county. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public education needs to respond to social needs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since at least ten years ago, there have been many views that urbanization of education is a &quot;green engine&quot;. You What is the entry point for research on educational urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, I was mainly stimulated by two things. First, many people in the academic community regard urbanization of education as a positive behavior. However, during the actual research process, I found that there are many problems in urbanization of education. Everyone’s educational anxiety is very serious, and many families bear an excessive educational burden. Education, medical care, and housing have become the new &quot;three mountains.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that I was deeply inspired after reading the doctoral thesis &quot;Children of Urbanization&quot; by Professor Xiong Yihan of Fudan University. The phenomenon we are concerned about is very similar - can rural children share the blue sky of education with urban children after entering the city? In fact, rural children are easily marginalized when they move to cities. For example, teachers in the city will mention that rural children have stereotypes such as being unhygienic and unruly. The campus culture of urban schools will make rural children feel inferior to a certain extent; rural children rarely have access to class power. structure, because teachers are more likely to accept children who are influenced by urban culture and form effective communication and interaction with them. When I held discussions with urban and rural students, I also found that urban students have stronger expressive skills and are good at showing themselves, while rural students are introverted. When they want to speak, they will inadvertently look at urban students for fear of saying something wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To promote the urbanization of education, local governments must build new schools in counties and open Between public and private schools, which option do most counties prefer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The government is more willing to build public schools. Because private schools have difficulties in management, they can charge fees independently, use enrollment policies flexibly, and attract high-quality students through benefits. After the results of the high school and high school entrance exams are released, these students become the &quot;living signs&quot; of the school&#39;s publicity. Teachers will further gather in private schools, putting local public schools in a weak position and affecting the local education ecology to a certain extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in fact, the central and western regions will still choose to introduce it Private school, why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because the local finances of some counties in the central and western regions are not enough to support the development of public education. On the one hand, the local government has the task of attracting investment, and on the other hand, it has to ensure the supply of education and is under multiple pressures. Private schools in some areas are introduced through investment promotion. The local government has not only completed the corresponding investment quotas, but also alleviated the pressure on local degree supply. At the same time, the outstanding students cultivated by private schools can also be counted as the educational achievements of local governments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do parents prefer private schools? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The main reason is that many public schools have not responded to parents’ educational demands. This year I went to a township junior high school in a central province for research and found that the student cafeteria was not equipped with tables and chairs, and students squatted at the top of the stairs to eat. Some schools arrange for students to live in houses that were built 20 or 30 years ago, and the walls of the dormitories fall off from time to time. In 2021, I met a driver during my research. He said that both of his children were studying in private schools, which cost 60,000 yuan a year. The couple&#39;s salary was only enough to cover the expenses of the children, and their life was very stressful. I asked him if he would be willing to go to a public school if it could provide relatively good room and board services, but it would cost an extra thousand yuan per semester. He said he would definitely do it. This is also the sentiment of most parents. Only when the government finds a way to truly respond to the demands of the people will students slowly return to private schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 11, 2020, a newly built primary school was put into operation in Suining County, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Respect the laws of natural flow&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After research, what problems have you found that urbanization in education may bring about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first is debt risk. Some local governments use education as the starting point to promote education to revitalize the city and invest a large amount of money in a short period of time. New schools were built, leading to serious debt. Recently I heard that a county in a central province is spending huge sums of money to build a school. Many counties in the survey have huge debts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the maintenance cost of schools is very high. Some local governments build schools to the highest standards ahead of schedule, leaving a large amount of space idle, resulting in very high school operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, farmers have a heavy education burden. When building primary and secondary schools in some places, they only focus on pure education issues and do not consider the overall social division of labor. Some newly built schools in urban areas are not equipped with dormitories and canteens. Rural parents who send their children to the city still need to rent or buy a house in the city to accompany them to school. They cannot Parents who take care of their children leave their children to child care institutions. For example, the child care institutions in Guangxi are particularly developed now. The child care institutions not only take care of students&#39; lives, but also take care of after-school learning. Whether it is renting or buying a house to accompany students to study, or hosting, it has greatly increased the financial burden of education on farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is the adaptation problem of rural students just mentioned. A new dual structure of urban and rural education has essentially been formed in urban schools. The family background and family knowledge ability of rural students may not necessarily support them in the city. receive a fair education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since there are so many problems, why are the grassroots in the central and western provinces still there? Promote education urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In addition to facilitating management, the county government is also trying to activate local land finance through education urbanization. By vigorously developing education in county towns, farmers can move to cities to buy houses. Local governments can promote the return of capital, population agglomeration, and the formation of a chain to activate the county economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are these efforts effective? I saw that in the three central and western counties you visited for your doctoral thesis, housing prices did not rise in the end. Why is this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, farmers are not very motivated to buy houses in cities. In 2014, the house price in a county in Gansu was 4,000 yuan/square meter. But when I went to the county for research in 2017, house prices were still hovering around 4,000 yuan. Even so, the house still couldn&#39;t be sold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the development of county education lies in the county economy. The fundamental reason why farmers are not enthusiastic about buying houses in cities is that the cities lack an industrial foundation that can support them to maintain their family life. If migrant workers can only work as construction workers, waiters, etc. in the county, their income level is not enough to support them to buy a house and settle down in the county. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is educational urbanization a local development path worthy of recognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The urbanization of education is an inevitable trend, but there are differences in speed. What we are criticizing is the phenomenon of using education as the starting point to promote urban development through education. Educational urbanization must be promoted at a reasonable speed. On the one hand, the natural flow laws must be respected. People who have the ability to go to the city and want to go to the city must respect their choices. At the same time, we must also see the impact of human factors promoting education urbanization. Problems such as incoming debt, high maintenance costs, and difficulty for students to adapt. At the current stage, a more appropriate way is to build good township schools and give students who cannot afford to go to the city a certain space for educational development. Children who study in this space can hope to enter high school and college, which will improve the mobility of the entire social class. Only by maintaining smooth flow can there be hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打破出身论？上海民办高校毕业生可报考选调生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256922]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9eMe4ayu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1123&quot; height=&quot;748&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9 eMe4ayu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251072&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 20, 2022, Wuhan, candidates took the 2022 Hubei Provincial Selection Examination . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Graduates from private colleges and universities who were once exclusively admitted to prestigious public schools can also apply. On September 1, 2023, the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee issued an announcement for the selection of outstanding university graduates in 2024. Students from 7 private universities in the city were included in the selection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Selected students are fresh graduates recruited by the organization department on the basis of merit from colleges and universities. They are divided into targeted and non-targeted. There are special requirements for recruitment such as political profile, scholarships, and student cadre experience. Among them, the requirements for targeted selection are more stringent and are mainly targeted at key domestic universities or key majors in some universities, while the minimum requirements for non-directional selection are generally from ordinary public undergraduate colleges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the landscape of tune selection is changing.据南方周末记者不完全统计，除上海外，湖南、福建的部分民办高校毕业生也具有报考选调的资格。另外，四川、山西、广东等10个省份，报考范围还扩大到国（境）外高校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，选调生规模也在扩大，这与各地稳就业政策相关。 2023年7月，上海市就业工作领导小组发布的稳就业措施中，就提到逐步扩大选调规模，且要“持续实施面向应届优秀大学毕业生的选调招录工作”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“最主要是不以学校出身来判断英雄。”一位接近上海市委组织部的人士对南方周末记者表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;范围扩大，门槛也在提高&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;根据前述上海市委组织部发布的公告，有四类高校的学生可以报名选调：北京大学等44所不限专业高校、中央财经大学等30所限定专业的高校、华东政法大学等29所本市高校以及新增试点院校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;民办高校被包含在第三类“29所本市高校”之中，共7所，分别为上海杉达学院、上海视觉艺术学院、上海外国语大学贤达经济人文学院、上海建桥学院、上海师范大学天华学院、上海兴伟学院、上海立达学院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些学校大多由专科院校升格为本科，其中上海立达学院升本时间最晚，直到2018年才开始招收本科生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招收民办高校毕业生并非2023年才开始的，南方周末记者发现，这一政策早在2021年就已实行。此前，上海市选调仅招收北京大学、清华大学、中国人民大学等15所高校毕业生，其中市内985、211高校占到9所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年起，上海放宽对高校的条件限制，将30所本地高校纳入名单，其中就包括了前述7所民办高校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为补充基层党政领导干部的重要方式，选调生制度在诞生之初就是优中选优。 1965年，教育部分配一部分大学毕业生到农村工作，选调生制度自此开始。 1970年代末，这项制度陆续在各省开展，选调对象主要为大学中党性较强、成绩优秀的本科毕业生。而为了解决基层干部队伍中缺乏高学历人才的问题，2009年，重庆市首创面向清北等985大学的定向选调制度，拉开向名校定向选调的序幕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者注意到，目前一些省份公布的定向选调公告中，还会特别注明，招录院校范围不含独立学院、民办高校。但也有省份把选调范围扩大到民办学校，从全国范围来看，福建、湖南部分民办高校的毕业生，也可以报考选调生。福建就曾采用指标分配的方式，将选调名额定点分至仰恩大学等省内民办高校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范围扩大，报考门槛也在提高。以上海为例，并非名单中高校的所有毕业生都有报考资格，除了年龄、学习成绩要求外，还需至少满足一项“其他条件”，包括中共党员（含预备党员）、担任一年以上的校院系团委书记等相关职务、获得优秀或三好学生荣誉称号或奖学金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于前述包括民办学校的第三类本市高校而言，则需要同时满足获得国家奖学金或上海市奖学金，以及担任一年以上的校院系团委书记等相关职务的条件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而湖南省2023年的选调生考试中，不再区分普通、定向选调，也不再限定“双一流”与非“双一流”学校毕业生可报考的岗位，但考生均需满足（预备）党员和学生干部任职的要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;境外高校纳入选调范围&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，此次上海选调，在第四类试点高校中首次纳入了世界排名前50的海外高校毕业生，由市委组织部单独划定分数线。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者统计，截至2023年9月，明确表示招收国（境）外高校毕业生的省份共有10个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大部分省份界定的学校范围，是以QS世界大学排名前100位为准，并要求考生具有硕士及博士以上学历。有的省份对本科学历有所限制，如河北省需要考生取得纳入选调范围的国内本科高校学位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于留学生是否为中共党员，或者是否获得奖学金，各地规定有异。如广东、山西未作强制要求，仅在公告中注明满足要求者优先选调，北京则需留学生具有下述三个条件之一：中共（预备）党员、三好学生等荣誉称号（最高学历期间获得）、具有参军入伍经历。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就组织部门的工作难度而言，将国（境）外高校毕业生纳入选调范围或难度更大。 2022年12月，有网友在人民网领导留言板上留言，建议福建将国外学校优秀毕业生纳入选调生考试中。福建省委组织部回复称，“因无法到学校对考察人选进行实地深入考察并作出考察结论，所以一直未将境外高校纳入选调范围。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于选调国（境）外高校毕业生，四川招收数量较多，该省也是第一个吃螃蟹的省份。早在2015年，该省就针对国（境）外高校毕业生单独出台相关政策，首批共录用24名国（境）外高校毕业生，其中有5名博士。 2023年，在四川的定向选调生中，国（境）外高校毕业生人数达到82人，比2015年翻了3倍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者不完全统计，四川2015年首批录用的24名国（境）外高校毕业生中，目前有4位已达正科。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“一年只有一两个”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;选调生的范围为何在不断扩大？ “之所以纳入民办高校，除了对本市高校倾向照顾以外，最主要是不以学校出身来判断英雄。”一位接近上海市委组织部的人士告诉南方周末记者，择优审核时会将高校上报的考生分配到负责的干部手中，按照学生的基本条件如所获奖项等指标进行加权考核，“与学校不挂钩”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，早在2018年5月21日，中共中央组织部召开新时代激励干部新担当新作为暨加强改进选调生工作座谈会，就提到“突出政治标准，适当扩大规模，分级分类精准选调”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但各地扩大选调生范围也有稳就业的考量。在前述2023年7月上海市就业工作领导小组发布的《关于优化调整稳就业政策全力促发展惠民生的若干措施》中，就提出要“逐步扩大选调规模”。而2023年重庆公布的非定向选调人数达到600人，较前一年400人而言，扩招50%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范围扩大之后，是否有更多的民办高校毕业生进入选调序列？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海建桥学院、上海杉达学院就业处工作人员均对南方周末记者表示“近年没有考上上海选调生的”。而上海外国语大学贤达人文经济学院工作人员则透露，“一年只有一两个”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海杉达学院的工作人员认为，虽然可以考，但“的确很难，奖学金、班干部（等要求）都要达到”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前述接近上海市委组织部的人士表示，在考试过程中，名校生整体的表达能力要优于一般民办高校，“最终录取结果处于正态分布，清北、人大毕业生多一些，其他高校少一点”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大股东违规减持被重罚：股市不能成为“韭菜收割机”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256916]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 16:15:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;2023年9月15日星期五，股市收盘后，证监会通报：对违规减持的南京我乐家居股份有限公司（我乐家居）大股东予以重罚。同一天，另一家上市公司东方时尚公告，其董事长、实控人因涉嫌操纵证券市场罪被逮捕。两家公司违规减持的股东被重罚，显示监管部门对违规减持等行为动了真格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;证监会网站9月15日通报，持有我乐家居7.11%股权的大股东于范易及其一致行动人违规减持我乐家居股票，拟依法没收于范易及其一致行动人违法所得1653万元，并从严处以3295万元罚款，合计罚没4948万元。根据通报，于范易及其一致行动人在2021年通过二级市场买入我乐家居股票达到5%时就没有依法履行信息披露义务，被警示。而这次，于范易等在2023年9月5日、6日两天将其持有的7.11%股票全部减持，再次违反了持股比例变化达到5%时应公告并在3日内不得再买卖该股票的规定。对此，证监会决定予以重罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;证券法对持有（包括通过一致行动人共同持有）上市公司5%以上股份的股东买卖股票作了不少特别规定：持股达到5%时，应在3日内向证监会、交易所书面报告，并通知上市公司予以公告，在此期间不得再次买卖该上市公司股票；此后每增减5%时，也要进行报告和公告，并在公告后3日内不得再买卖该公司股票；持股达到5%后，每增减1%时，应该在次日通知上市公司予以公告。作出这些规定，是因为持股5%以上的股东被认为是重要股东，其买卖股票行为可能对公司股价产生重要影响，影响其他小股东的权益，因此需要及时公开。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;股票市场设立的目的，是为了让上市公司获得业务发展所需要的资金，同时给投资者提供分享公司未来收益的机会。上市公司为投资者创造价值，通常有两种途径，一是股价上涨，二是现金分红。但A股有不少上市公司股价已经跌破发行价（破发），也就是说上市至今股价不仅没有涨，反而跌了，虽然不排除中间涨跌过程中有部分投资者是有收益的，但总体来看，投资者是亏了。据界面新闻统计，截至2023年9月6日收盘，A股有758家上市公司破发，在5000多家上市公司中占比不算少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再来看分红。根据中国上市公司协会的数据，自资本市场成立以来，全部上市公司累计现金分红总额不足16万亿元，而包括首发和再融资在内，股权融资总额达到18万亿。现金分红总额还没有融资总额多，也就是说，总体来看，中国股市投资者还在给上市公司输血，而没有得到足够的回报。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就是在这样的投资环境中，上市公司的控股股东、实控人等屡屡通过减持公司股票大额套现，割中小股东韭菜，几成A股顽疾，备受投资者诟病。不少A股公司上市目的就是圈钱，大股东、实控人从来没有想过为投资者创造价值。一些公司，在上市之初就通过财务造假等手段通过上市审核、抬高发行价格，上市之后，又抓住一切机会变现，或者通过减持，或者通过抵押股票贷款，有的则通过再融资再次从股市圈钱。正是因此（当然还因为长期存在的信息披露违规、操纵股价等违法现象），A股市场被一些投资者称为“韭菜收割机”“投机市场”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;股市的这些不合理现象，严重侵害了投资者尤其是中小投资者的利益，也破坏了投资者的信心。而近来A股市场走势一路向下，与投资者缺乏信心有着密切的关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了整治大股东侵害中小股东利益的问题，证监会日前颁布《进一步规范股份减持行为》新规，要求上市公司存在破发、破净情形，或者最近三年未进行现金分红、累计现金分红金额低于最近三年年均净利润30%的，控股股东、实际控制人不得通过二级市场减持本公司股份。也就是说，如果上市公司没有为二级市场投资者创造足够的价值，其控股股东、实控人等不得通过减持来变现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新规的初衷是好的，关键是能否执行。所以，这次当我乐家居、东方时尚等上市公司股东违规减持发生后，股民都在等着看监管部门如何处罚。如果还是像以前那样轻描淡写地由交易所进行“谴责”“警示”，而没有实质性处罚，那新规显然不会有太多威慑力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好在，从最近公布的处理进展来看，这次监管部门显然是动真格的了：我乐家居大股东被没收违规减持的收益并处巨额罚款，基本上吐出了因减持而得到的全部收益（包括合法减持部分的收益）；而东方时尚的董事长更是因为被发现还有其他操纵股价的行为，要被追究刑事责任。雷厉风行地执法，对于提振市场信心无疑具有重要的意义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，限制上市公司大股东、实控人减持，只是堵住了他们变现的一个途径。要让资本市场真正成为投资者和上市公司双赢的市场，避免上市成为大股东、实控人割韭菜的途径，还需要更多措施，让大股东、实控人更难从股市圈钱、变现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，2023年2月交易所出台的新规，允许限售股通过转融通渠道出借。有观点认为，这让战略投资者可能通过该机制变相减持，可能存在公平性以及制度一致性等问题。最近刚刚上市的金帝股份，上市首日就融券卖出（相当于做空）450多万股，金额高达2.2亿元，而这些券，疑似来自公司高管、核心员工等“战略投资者”所持有的限售股。此前也有公司上市首日“战略投资者”大笔出借限售股融券卖出的情况。这是否涉及上市公司高管上市首日“卖空”自家股票锁定收益，是否会侵害二级市场投资者利益，值得关切。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;经查，为配合“网红”在直播间的虚假宣传，MCN机构找河北保定某传媒公司、北京徐某等网络水军团伙开展“投流”业务。该传媒公司使用1000余个营业执照，在短视频平台注册广告账户，以100元至160元增加1千个关注粉丝的价格，在直播间为网红涨粉。徐某通过专业平台接单，下发至各地“机房”批量操控机器人账号，伪装成消费者,在直播带货期间评论商品产地、夸大产品功效，让网红主播在短时间内贴上助农、公益等标签。通过“投流”平台，MCN机构将网红精准推送给相关兴趣爱好、适宜年龄段、特定区域的网民，以达到涨粉、引流的目的，制造爆款、抢单的假象，诱导消费者购买产品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该网络水军团伙主要有以下几个特点：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;01&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;组织严密&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;通过实地走访当地群众、调取网络信息、摸排直播团伙等方式深入侦查，发现网红主播前端表演，水军团伙幕后引流，形成了“吸粉-引流-带货-变现”的产业化运作模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;02&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;迷惑性强&lt;/h4>;

The dexterous front paws resemble the small hands of a human baby and can grip round nuts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, raccoons are cute little animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Raccoons are native to North America and are named &quot;raccoons&quot; because they often perform cleaning actions near water. However, when they came to the European continent, they were on the &quot;blacklist&quot; of invasive alien species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as January 2020, the German-language daily &quot;Grenz Echo&quot; reported that raccoons were infested in eastern Belgium, calling it the &quot;raccoon plague.&quot; In September 2023, Belgian authorities once again disclosed that &quot;50,000 raccoons have made their home in the country&#39;s southern mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the first North American raccoons set foot on the European continent, traders planned a profitable fur business. More than ninety years later, raccoon populations have overrun forests and cities, and the problem of biological invasion is imminent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to control the spread of raccoons, some parts of Europe acquiesce or encourage the hunting of raccoons. However, animal protection groups called it a &quot;massacre&quot; and condemned &quot;hunters&#39; attempts to use so-called species protection slogans and flimsy hunting arguments to justify the massacre.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo, deputy secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Southern Weekend reporters that around the world, when an invasive alien species (IAS) causes very serious ecological problems, it directly Hunting has become one of the last resort methods of governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, these measures usually require careful planning and execution to ensure their effectiveness and minimize adverse effects.” Wang Huo said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Raccoon &quot;plague&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Belgian media reports on September 4, Belgium is fighting against &quot;invading&quot; raccoons. Authorities admit that more than 50,000 raccoons have made their home in Belgium&#39;s forested southern mountains and it is too late to eradicate them by hunting them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Céline Tellier, an environment official in Wallonia, Belgium, said in an interview: &quot;This animal looks very cute. Unfortunately, around the world, invasive alien species Species are one of the five major causes of biodiversity degradation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is an unprecedented and spectacular invasion.&quot; Eric Alkemade, Liège, Belgium A professional hunter in the city told Southern Weekend reporters that since the invasive crisis emerged, he has received many calls about raccoons every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As commissioned by customers, he captures 9-15 raccoons every month. His income has increased significantly thanks to a surge in local raccoon business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In people&#39;s imagination, raccoons are cute little friends. But in fact, if they are not satisfied, they will be very aggressive.&quot; Eric said that raccoons have sharp claws. Will scratch and bite hard. When they cannot find food on balconies, they may sneak into human homes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The damage caused by raccoons is self-evident.” Eric said raccoons can destroy the nests of various birds, including black storks. In addition, raccoons will also attack human poultry and pets, such as &quot;chickens, rabbits, ducks&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the raccoon population is limited, perhaps humans can keep an appropriate distance from these &quot;troublemakers.&quot; Unfortunately, the raccoon population is growing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, the number of raccoons in continental Europe is estimated to have exceeded 500,000. In addition to Belgium, in many European countries, this animal has also become an invasive alien species that causes headaches for the authorities.&quot; Wang Huo said to the south Reporters over the weekend said that raccoons have been included in the European Union&#39;s List of Invasive Alien Species of Concern since 2016. This means that throughout the European Union, the import, breeding, transport, commercialization or intentional release of raccoons into the natural environment is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why does the little raccoon make the European Union &quot;colorful&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Raccoons are omnivores and feed on birds, insects, aquatic organisms and plants. Overpopulation will not only compete with native animals for food, but also directly threaten local biodiversity .&quot; Wang Huo said that raccoons can destroy habitats, especially when looking for food. They may dig burrows or damage trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, raccoons carry many viruses including rabies, posing a threat to local wildlife and domestic livestock. Raccoons sometimes forage in trash cans, causing waste management and sanitation issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Survival Master&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The introduction of North American raccoons into Europe originated from two man-made species migrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public reports, raccoons were introduced to Germany during the Nazi rule in the 1930s for hunting and fur. In the 1960s, many of the animals brought to France as mascots were released by U.S. Air Force personnel, and they took up residence around an air base in the Aisne region of France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo added many details to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1930s, raccoon fur fashion was once popular, and many breeding farms in Germany raised raccoons. However, captive raccoons were not as good as wild ones, so some female raccoons were released into the forests of western Germany. Within ten years, a stable population was established and expanded to eastern Germany. In 1945, due to war air raids, many farmed raccoons escaped and became wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Belgium is located between Germany and France, so it has naturally become a migration destination for many raccoons. In their new home, the raccoon population ushered in a period of rapid growth, showing strong adaptability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In the wild, raccoons can find nutritional supplements on land, underwater, in trees, almost anywhere. In cities and towns, raccoons can find food by digging through garbage. , climb into human houses and courtyards to look for food. In addition, raccoons are cute in appearance, and humans are usually not hostile to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of breeding strategy, raccoons often choose tree holes, ground holes or caves as their breeding grounds. These places provide a relatively safe and secluded environment that facilitates the survival of the pups. Also, raccoons don’t nurse for long. Raccoon pups are weaned and start living independently by the end of the summer of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu, an animal keeper at Nanning Zoo in Guangxi, told Southern Weekend reporters that compared to other mammals, raccoons have stronger reproductive capabilities. For example, monkeys give birth to one baby a year, and they start reproducing at an average age of 3-4 years. Raccoons can give birth to about 4 babies a year, and they mature sexually early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, raccoons also have many advantages in survival. &quot;In nature, raccoons can swim, dig holes, climb, and can survive on trees and on the ground. In cities, garbage is the easiest way for raccoons to obtain food. However, raccoons also rely on human garbage to survive. But it is bigger than mice, has fewer natural enemies, and can even fight with human pet cats and dogs, so it has obvious advantages,&quot; Mr. Liu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The out-of-control proliferation of raccoons in Europe may also have something to do with the scarcity of wild animals that can control them (such as hawks, falcons, wolves, foxes, etc.). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo pointed out that the owl is a common small raptor, but it is fatal to raccoon pups. In nature in Europe, if there are raptors circling nearby, the nursing mother raccoon will be forced to move with her cubs in her mouth and find another safe nest. In a healthy natural ecosystem, a significant proportion of the pups will die in the first 6 months, and only a proportion will survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric told Southern Weekend reporters that some Belgian residents hope to use the natural food chain of raccoons to maintain ecological balance through natural enemies of raccoons, such as foxes and wolves. But it was &quot;too late&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric said that in order to achieve the effect of controlling raccoon numbers, wolves must settle in certain areas for a long time. At the same time, raccoons&#39; rapid reproduction created an imbalance between prey and predators. &quot;This war is already unequal. Without drastic measures, it will be difficult to curb their rapid growth,&quot; Eric said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Hunting&quot; controversy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In recent years, hunting has become one of the common ways to control the proliferation of raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data disclosed by the German Hunting Association (DJV), during the 2020-2021 hunting season, German hunters legally captured 200,163 raccoons, a 57-fold increase in two decades. The association also revealed that the number of raccoons hunted has continued to rise since the 1990s. This indicates that &quot;invasive species have spread widely across space.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to control the proliferation of raccoons, there are even organizations that pay special fees to remove raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Belgian hunter Eric told Southern Weekend reporters that he usually accepts commissions from the private sector or local municipal departments to hunt, and is paid monthly, usually 1,500 euros per person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eric revealed that the local government had used water conservancy and forestry officials to eradicate raccoons, but &quot;their numbers were too few and their equipment was not good.&quot; Eric holds a hunting license and has professional hunting skills. &quot;I go to see the traps I set every day. I have a weapons license, rich experience, and well-equipped equipment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Eric&#39;s work was not recognized by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A lot of naive people protect and feed raccoons and think I’m a savage.” Eric said that the prevailing animal protection trend has made people sensitive to hunting raccoons, but he feels that his job It is in the public interest and to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, hunting measures have also been opposed by some animal protection organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The German People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA-Team) has called for &quot;an end to unnecessary raccoon hunting.&quot; The association offers five reasons for protecting raccoons, including that hunting raccoons is counterproductive because &quot;raccoons may respond to hunting by increasing reproduction,&quot; and that raccoons pose no threat to local biodiversity because &quot;endangered species are rarely Raccoon Food” etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noted that the organization launched an online petition in July 2022, calling on the European Commission to remove raccoons from the list of invasive species. So far, it has 7,643 supporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In North America, where raccoons are native, people have a more tolerant attitude towards raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A1 Raccoon Doctor&quot; small animal protection company is located in Toronto, Canada. The company&#39;s main business area is to help customers deal with wildlife invasion, pest protection and other issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees of the company told Southern Weekend reporters that they often encounter raccoons at work and often invade human homes. Two months ago, a raccoon attacked people and pet dogs in Vancouver. &quot;The puppy was blinded in one eye.&quot; It also happens that humans become infected with rabies virus after contact with raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the areas served by the company, people still hold a tolerant attitude towards raccoons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The law does not allow us to hunt wild animals. We only expel some raccoons that have invaded human settlements. Everyone basically has a good impression of raccoons.&quot; An employee of the company told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Houston, USA, raccoons often come to the yard of Chinese Xiao Ai&#39;s (pseudonym) home to eat at the &quot;buffet&quot;, which is a self-service feeding box specially set up by Xiao Ai for raccoons. There are also chickens and fish in the yard, but &quot;the raccoons never rumble.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ai said that when she rented an apartment in the past, she often saw raccoons rummaging through public trash cans at night. &quot;But they just go through the garbage and leave after eating. Sometimes neighbors who throw away garbage will encounter raccoons. &quot;Most of them think they are cute, and I have never seen anyone panic or disgusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Raccoons don&#39;t Unprovoked invasion and destruction. &quot;In Xiao Ai&#39;s view, humans have invaded the homes of wild animals, causing raccoons to lack food and have to dig through garbage to eat. She opposes the killing of raccoons and advocates the use of sterilization to control the overpopulation of raccoons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huo believes that compared with Compared with killing, sterilization is usually regarded as a relatively mild and humane method to control the population of invasive alien species. However, this method also needs to consider factors of time, resources and feasibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; “Controlling the proliferation of invasive species is a complex issue that often requires a combination of measures. &quot;Wang Huo believes that dealing with the problem of invasive species requires comprehensive consideration of various factors, including the characteristics of the species, environmental conditions, and social and ethical considerations. Usually, the best approach is to adopt a combination of methods to maximize Minimize adverse impacts on local ecosystems and economies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第31届澳门国际烟花比赛汇演璀璨进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256910]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[数据安全榜：守护你的数字财富，哪家金融机构的金盾更坚固？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256908]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:27:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the era of digital finance, the security of personal information, especially personal financial information, is related to everyone’s wealth security, and even more so to finance. The mission of the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regulatory agencies have always regarded protecting the security of personal financial information as an important regulatory task. From September 15 to October 15, 2023, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the People&#39;s Bank of China and other relevant ministries and commissions are jointly carrying out the &quot;Financial Consumer Rights Protection Education and Publicity Month&quot; activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2021, the People&#39;s Bank of China has issued the &quot;Financial Data Security &amp;nbsp;Data Life Cycle Security Specifications&quot; (JR/T 0223-2021). This &quot;Specification&quot; combines the characteristics of financial data to sort out the security principles, protection requirements, organizational guarantee requirements and information system operation and maintenance guarantee requirements of financial data life cycle, and establish financial data covering the entire cycle of data collection, transmission, storage, use, deletion and destruction. Security management framework. Among them, the protection of personal financial information has become an important part of the security management of financial data life cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, the data security of financial institutions is like an indestructible golden shield, and the strength of the golden shield reflects the strength of financial institutions in protecting data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to objectively evaluate the data security level of various financial institutions, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center set up eight secondary indicators from four dimensions, and assigned different weights to the sub-items according to the importance of each indicator. . Under this indicator system, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center selected the &quot;Data Security List&quot; based on the information related to eight secondary indicators disclosed in the 2022 annual reports, 2022 ESG reports or social responsibility reports of 26 financial institutions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given that the data security standards of various financial institutions are quite strict and no serious incidents have occurred, this list only reflects the strategic attention and execution capabilities of financial institutions to data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Four dimensions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Eight sub-indicators&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Data Security Ranking&quot; evaluation The indicator system is divided into four dimensions: organizational construction, institutional processes, technical tools and effectiveness. At the same time, we subdivided the above four dimensions into eight secondary indicators. The following is a detailed description of the relevant indicator system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251050&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Organizational Building&lt;/strong>;Yes Refers to the organizational structure of financial institutions in terms of data security. The evaluation team of Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center considers the number of relevant responsible departments disclosed by financial institutions. This indicator reflects the importance financial institutions attach to data security and information protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;System process&lt;/strong>; refers to the degree of standardization of the process of building a data security system by financial institutions. This indicator is mainly comprehensively considered through two secondary indicators: the number of its own relevant systems and the number of supplier management-related normative documents. The degree of standardization of the process is an important indicator to consider whether the construction of the data security system of a financial institution is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Supplier management&lt;/strong>; refers to the process by which financial institutions conduct effective risk identification and assessment of external partners (IT service providers, cloud service platforms, etc.). Vendors have access to sensitive data from financial institutions. Security vulnerabilities and irregularities in vendor behavior can result in information or data security incidents for financial institutions. Therefore, financial institutions conduct rating reviews of suppliers every year. However, most financial institutions currently only focus on the performance of suppliers in terms of environmental protection and social responsibility. In order to strengthen the importance that financial institutions attach to the management of suppliers&#39; data security, the evaluation team of the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has disclosed the performance of financial institutions. The number of documents on the supplier management system is also taken into consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Technical tools&lt;/strong>; are the core part of the network security system. This first-level indicator directly reflects the financial institution&#39;s ability to protect data and privacy and the effectiveness and reliability of data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this first-level indicator, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluation team set three secondary indicators: the number of relevant patents, the number of relevant systems, and the number of certification systems. Among them, the number of relevant patents refers to the number of patents containing words such as data security, information security, vulnerability and attack in the patent summaries applied for by the financial institution under evaluation that year. The number of relevant systems is based on the number of platforms and systems mentioned in the annual report of the financial institution under evaluation. The number of certification systems comes from the number of certifications published in the annual reports of the financial institutions under evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the evaluation process, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that some banks did not disclose the secondary indicator data for this evaluation. Therefore, in order to reduce information asymmetry, financial institutions that do not publish a certain indicator will have the lowest score for that indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Effectiveness&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Indicator&lt;/strong>; is the only qualitative indicator in this list, consisting of the number of security incidents (minus points) and awards (plus points).

Among joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank and China Everbright Bank performed well. Among them, China Everbright Bank was better in terms of relevant systems and the number of certifications obtained, while Industrial Bank received the award for disclosing detailed data security and privacy protection work in its annual report. More points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of patents, state-owned banks are stronger, and the number of patents of state-owned banks is generally higher than that of joint-stock banks and insurance companies. However, it is worth noting that the number of related patents of Ping An of China, 119, is only lower than that of ICBC, 259. Looking only at this secondary indicator, Ping An ranks second in the entire list. This is because Ping An has both banking and insurance businesses. Compared with financial institutions in a single industry, Ping An&#39;s data is more diverse and complex, and its requirements for ensuring data security are also higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive quantitative indicators, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China rank among the top three state-owned banks, with total quantitative indicator scores all exceeding 400 points. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranks last with a quantitative indicator score of 196 points, and is the only institution on this list with a total quantitative indicator score of less than 200 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive qualitative indicators, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Life Insurance and Bank of Communications ranked among the top three, with scores greater than 150 points. Among them, ICBC ranks first, mainly because the awards it has received are all national-level and it has been selected as a pilot demonstration unit in multiple fields of data security. China Life and Bank of Communications follow closely behind with multiple awards at different levels in terms of qualitative indicators. In addition, Pacific Insurance, China Merchants Bank, PICC and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank did not disclose awards in their 2022 annual reports, resulting in scores of 0 for their qualitative indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the different nature of banking and insurance businesses, the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center evaluation team split the overall list into two sub-lists: the data security list of banking financial institutions and the data security list of insurance financial institutions. The list is designed to more objectively present the data security competitiveness of financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Bank list: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;While the pursuit is underway&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;there are leaders in each echelon&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of banking financial institutions shows that, Among the six major state-owned banks, the three major state-owned banks, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, rank in the top three. Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank ranked seventh and eighth. The above five state-owned banks are all ranked in the top ten. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last with a score of 125.65 points, a gap of 223.93 points from the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Postal Savings Bank’s poor performance in data security may be related to its low level of digital construction. In the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks, AIA ranks last among insurance companies&quot;>;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks First, AIA ranked last among insurance companies, Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last among the six major state-owned banks with a score of 431.62. Therefore, the Postal Savings Bank still needs to work hard on digital financial construction and data security system construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank, Ping An Bank and China Everbright Bank surpassed the two major state-owned banks, Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank, with 238.36 points, 237.24 points and 233.94 points respectively, relying on their advantages in technical tool indicators to rank among Top six. However, the performance of China Guangfa Bank, Hua Xia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in terms of data security is not as good as that of some city commercial banks. These three banks are all ranked after the tenth, and are interspersed among the rankings of city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;City commercial banks are subject to factors such as geography, business volume and scale, and their overall scores are lower than those of state-owned banks and joint-stock banks. But there are also some who perform better. Taking Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Beijing as examples, these two city commercial banks surpassed China Guangfa Bank and Hua Xia Bank, two joint-stock banks, with 185.48 and 172.67 points respectively. From the perspective of qualitative indicators, the results of these two city commercial banks are relatively outstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Insurance ranking: China Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;award&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Ping An patents dominate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251051&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Looking at the data security rankings of financial institutions in the insurance industry, China Life and Ping An of China rank first and second due to their advantages in the number of awards and patents respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the insurance industry, China Life has built the industry&#39;s first safe, green and elastic hybrid cloud. This distributed hybrid cloud won the special prize of the second &quot;Financial Innovation Achievement Award&quot; of the Capital Financial Innovation Incentive Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of data security-related patents, except for Ping An of China, which received 119 patents due to its business nature of both banking and insurance, the number of data security-related patents disclosed by other insurance institutions did not exceed 5 indivual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunshine Insurance ranks low in various index scores in terms of data security, resulting in a total score at the bottom. It is also the only financial institution with a score below 150 in the data security list of financial institutions in the insurance industry. Similar to the Postal Savings Bank, Sunshine Insurance ranked first in the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Financial List: ICBC ranked first among banks, AIA ranked last among insurance companies&quot;>; Digital finance list: ICBC ranks first among banks, and AIA ranks last among insurance companies. It ranks second from last in the digital finance list of insurance financial institutions. Regardless of digital finance or data security, there is still a certain distance between Sunshine Insurance and other financial institutions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the score is related to the small amount of data disclosed by Sunshine Insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the digital finance and data security construction of lower-ranked banking financial institutions and insurance financial institutions are not perfect enough. Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that these companies urgently need to improve their strategic considerations for digital transformation and pay attention to building and improving data security systems while improving the level of digital finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also called on financial institutions to disclose relevant data and information as much as possible to make it more transparent to enhance customer trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Assistant researcher Zou Huan, Liang Chenghao and Yang Chaoqun also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
