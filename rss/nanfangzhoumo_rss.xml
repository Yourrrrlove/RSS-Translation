Among my country&#39;s major financial fields, the banking industry is the largest and is the main transmission system for macroeconomic control policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the banking industry is facing multiple challenges: under the counter-cyclical trend, the net interest margin of the banking industry has dropped to a historical low; at the same time, as the real estate industry enters a new stage, banks regard it as high-quality assets. The mortgage business is facing difficulties; after testing the waters of equity investment, the investment research capabilities of bank wealth management subsidiaries have also been questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s A-share “profit king”—can the banking industry achieve breakthroughs by leveraging financial technology? Has it reached a critical point in transformation? How do banks shape their core competitiveness? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A researcher from Southern Weekend’s New Finance Research Center interviewed Zhang Wei, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. Zhang Wei focuses on researching monetary policy and financial crisis early warning mechanisms. He also took the lead in compiling the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; and taught more than 300 training courses for the five major state-owned banks and some joint-stock banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/zslPwg6O7gV7qMYCXPkV9k3e0LDmM0nIxuTB425I.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height= &quot;410&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/zslPwg6O7gV7qMYCXPkV9k3e0LDmM0nIxuTB425I.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhang Wei, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mortgage securitization&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;High risk&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our research found that housing mortgage loans in my country basically have floating interest rates. Most foreign bank mortgage loans have fixed interest rates. Why is it different? What is its background? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Most foreign mortgage interest rates are fixed interest rates, while our country’s mortgage loans have quasi-floating interest rates, that is, they are not completely floating. There is an essential difference between the two. In the past, after the central bank adjusted interest rates, existing mortgage interest rates were not adjusted immediately, and were often adjusted accordingly the following year. In other words, the central bank can adjust the interest rate multiple times within a year, but the borrower&#39;s mortgage interest rate remains basically unchanged within a year and can only start to adjust on January 1 of the following year. Therefore, it is not a fully floating interest rate but a quasi-floating interest rate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the development of the banking system, the primary purpose of various policies was to make banks grow and grow, and to reduce bank capital operation risks. The choice of a floating rate form stems from banking tradition. Fixed-rate mortgages are lower risk for the borrower but higher risk for the bank. In the past two years, some reforms have been made to mortgage interest rates. Borrowers can choose fixed interest rates or floating interest rates. However, existing housing loans still account for the majority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We also found through research that the balance of domestic housing mortgage loans is huge, but Mortgage asset securitization (MBS) has developed slowly since its inception in 2006. In the first half of 2023, there will be zero issuance of RMBS. This is also very different from the mortgage business in developed countries. Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four reasons for the slow progress of domestic mortgage asset securitization. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, mortgage asset securitization is an imported product. Mortgage securitization tools such as MBS in the United States have been developed since the 1970s. China&#39;s housing loan market developed relatively late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, domestic mortgage asset securitization started in 2006, just as the U.S. real estate bubble began to burst. The following year, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis triggered a chain reaction of MBS defaults and credit derivatives such as CDO and CDS, which eventually led to the 2008 global financial crisis. The external crisis requires us to re-understand the pros and cons of mortgage securitization. For regulatory agencies, a more cautious approach has been chosen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, mortgage asset securitization is a financial derivative. China has always been cautious about the development of financial derivatives because derivatives are highly leveraged and risky. Domestic laws on futures and derivatives were promulgated many years after the subprime mortgage crisis broke out, and did not include credit derivatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, over the past 20 years, my country’s commercial housing market has experienced a process of development and regulation of relaxation-tightening-relaxation-retightening-relaxation again. Maintain strict control over the financing of the real estate market through asset management products such as credit and trust to prevent the real estate market from overheating. Mortgage asset securitization is an important means of real estate financing and will also be strictly controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think it is possible to accelerate the implementation of asset securitization to activate the market? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Activating the real estate market through MBS is an option. my country&#39;s real estate credit market is an issue and hold model. If mortgage assets are securitized, banks can package the mortgages and sell them through securitization, and brokers can then distribute them to institutional investors including funds. The final investor may be an individual or a business. Mortgage risk is thus dispersed. Banks also receive more liquidity as a result. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mortgage asset securitization is a double-edged sword. Because it has high leverage, if there is any disturbance or unfavorable situation, the impact it will have will be huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, mortgage securitization is indeed a direction. However, I believe that the risks are relatively high, the supporting systems and regulatory measures are still weak, and it should not develop too fast. Especially in the current situation where risk prevention is the keynote, it is even more unsuitable to launch. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Need to shift to intensive&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;development&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Under the counter-cyclical situation, the profits of the banking industry generally increased slightly and even the profits of individual banks dropped sharply, and the provision coverage ratio and capital adequacy ratio both declined. The 2023 interim reports of various banks revealed this group signal. However, under the current capital market conditions, refinancing on the stock market is difficult to achieve. How do you think banks can replenish core capital at this stage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Commercial banks can replenish their first-tier core capital by issuing common shares, increasing capital from existing shareholders, or issuing additional shares. In addition, endogenous funds are also important channels. Such as retained profits, other comprehensive income and risk reserves, etc. This is to make &quot;blood&quot; by oneself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listed banks are the &quot;outstanding elements&quot; among banks. There are more than 4,000 small and medium-sized banks that cannot replenish capital through the stock market and can only increase capital through targeted capital increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks mainly issue subordinated bonds, preferred stocks and perpetual bonds to supplement secondary capital. However, the threshold for issuance of perpetual bonds and subordinated bonds is relatively high, and not all thousands of small and medium-sized banks are eligible. In addition, the issuance of special bonds by local governments is also an important means to supplement the capital of small and medium-sized banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned that endogenous funds are also very important. How do most banks get rid of the predicament of becoming increasingly dependent on external financing as they develop? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the past few decades, the scale of the banking industry has expanded rapidly and interest rates have been earned. In recent years, both the return on assets and the return on capital have been declining, and companies can only &quot;win&quot; by relying on scale. Large scale, low efficiency, and rapid capital consumption. If you cannot support the rapid expansion of asset scale by relying on your own &quot;blood production&quot;, you must rely on more external financing to replenish capital. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To completely get rid of this predicament, banks need to conduct refined operations on existing assets and earn more profits with the same asset scale, rather than simply increasing absolute profits by increasing scale. Extensive way. The core is to shift from the current extensive development model that emphasizes scale to an intensive development model that emphasizes efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, interest rate spreads have fallen to historic lows, and the financial sustainability of bank operations is in doubt. When the current scale remains unchanged or even continues to decline, banks must find ways to be more refined and detailed, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, especially to reduce management fees and other costs. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of fund utilization. For example, adjust the direction of loan investment, make more efforts in the financial market, and do more financial market business. In addition, efforts need to be made to improve risk control levels and reduce bad debt costs and risk losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now digital finance has become the transformation path for banks, and it is also the only way to achieve inclusive finance. You also had similar views in the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; published by &quot;Tsinghua Financial Review&quot;. You also believe that when financial institutions build underlying business logic in accordance with the genetic requirements of the Internet, they need to break the internal data barriers of the institution and make comprehensive adjustments to the working mechanism. In this process, banks are bound to be exposed to many risks. What do you think is the underlying business logic of banks’ Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The core of bank digital transformation lies in data connectivity. At the same time, the organizational structure and top-level design must be reconstructed according to Internet thinking. There will be many challenges and risks involved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there are many obstacles in data connection. A bank is a behemoth that involves many businesses, institutions, personnel, and outlets, and the phenomenon of data islands is serious. This is especially true for large banks, where it is difficult to integrate data between head offices and branches, between various departments of the head office, and even between departments within the same department. In addition to breaking through internal data barriers and breaking down information islands, it is also necessary to achieve safe and standardized connections with external data such as government data, corporate data, alternative Internet data, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always held the view that the banks of the future will be technology companies with banking licenses. It requires data, scenarios, and technology, that is, &quot;no data, no finance&quot;, &quot;no scenario, no finance&quot;, &quot;no technology, no finance&quot;. This is the Trinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, in order to open up external data, banks need to build some scenarios themselves and have the ability to continuously generate new data. Therefore, establishing the scene is particularly important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks need to pay attention to this matter from the top-level design and reconstruct the business logic structure and organizational structure that are different from traditional banks in the past. The difficulty is that traditional genes may eat away at Internet genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the traditional business of banks is still strong - the Internet business is still &quot;Sesame&quot;, and the traditional business is still &quot;Watermelon&quot;. However, in the future, the Internet business will grow into a &quot;watermelon&quot; and the traditional business will gradually shrink into a &quot;sesame&quot;. Due to operating pressure, traditional businesses still have to pay attention. &quot;Sesame&quot; cannot become &quot;watermelon&quot; overnight. It requires a process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform must not only prevent some new businesses from being cannibalized by traditional businesses, but also prevent traditional businesses from simply being moved online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the recruitment situation this autumn, most bank IT R&amp;D positions Hiring is down. This may be related to the rise of large model technology. Some banks’ fintech strategies are shifting from building their own intelligent customer service systems to cooperating with external technology platforms. What do you think of this phenomenon? Will outsourcing financial technology business bring greater risks to banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Outsourcing has advantages and risks, and different organizations should have different choices. Large and medium-sized banks should maintain their core technologies and avoid relying on outsourcing institutions; while small and medium-sized banks can consider outsourcing part of their business or cooperate with other platform companies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on external institutions can quickly solve the bank&#39;s current problems. In the long run, over-reliance on outsourcing institutions and platforms and loss of opportunities to develop internal skills is the biggest risk, followed by the risk of data security. The reason is that relying on outsourcing makes it difficult for banks to establish solid core technical capabilities over time. This is particularly important for large banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the long run, banks, especially large banks, will still have to build their own systems. Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing. It is a long-term solution for large banks to improve their internal capabilities. For some small banks, they can choose to outsource most of their businesses to build their core competitiveness in other aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Test the equity market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Establish a high-level &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;investment research team&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Yes Important matters&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The bank’s financial management subsidiary is testing the waters of equity financial management The product is 3 years old, but generally performs poorly. As of October 16, 2023, among all 34 bank equity products, 29 have broken the net. What do you think of this phenomenon? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After the new regulations on asset management, the development model of bank financial management has undergone fundamental changes. The development of equity financial management products is one direction. . Compared with public funds, wealth management subsidiaries or the asset management departments of many banks are too young. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of equity products of bank wealth management subsidiaries being depleted is, on the one hand, the downward environment of the entire market, which is also the main reason. On the other hand, it is caused by the lack of management capabilities of the financial management subsidiaries themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a novice, the wealth management subsidiary is inferior to the market in equity investments, but it is still tolerable at the moment. But in five to ten years, if there is no improvement, the road for equity bank financial products will only become narrower and narrower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Should financial management subsidiaries cooperate with fellow fund companies and share the latter investment research results? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the long run, building a strong investment research team is a top priority for financial management subsidiaries. It is difficult for wealth management subsidiaries to cooperate with fund companies under the parent bank because competition between the two outweighs cooperation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the incentive mechanism and salary levels of financial management subsidiaries are a major shortcoming. Subject to salary distribution constraints, the salary levels of wealth management subsidiaries of major state-owned banks are significantly lower than those of public funds. This is a great constraint on building a high-level investment research team. A breakthrough is needed in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[串标围标在工程建设等领域多发；招标方设租寻租不容忽视丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260146]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate released a number of typical cases on the official website of punishing the crime of collusive bidding in accordance with the law. The relevant person in charge of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate said that in recent years, problems in the bidding process have become prominent. In many fields such as engineering construction and equipment procurement, illegal and criminal cases such as collusion in bidding, bribery, and bribery have occurred frequently, causing hidden dangers to project quality and safety management and seriously disrupting Market Order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tendering is a procurement method used in some large-scale projects. In theory, tendering is a means to promote competition, especially public tendering. From the perspective of a tenderer, let your procurement needs reach more potential suppliers and promote competition among them as much as possible so that you can buy the best goods, services, etc. with the least money. For bidders, through public bidding channels, they can learn more about business opportunities, participate in competition, and win business through strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, national regulations stipulate that some specific projects must identify suppliers through public bidding. For example, the Government Procurement Law stipulates that government procurement projects of goods and services above a certain amount (the specific amount is uniformly stipulated by the provincial level, and many provinces set it as more than 2 million yuan) must be publicly tendered. Relevant construction law rules stipulate that if the estimated price of a single construction contract for housing construction and municipal infrastructure projects is more than 2 million yuan, or the total project investment is more than 30 million yuan, bidding must be conducted, all of which use state-owned funds or state-owned funds. Those holding a controlling or dominant position must invite public bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if multiple bidders or even tenderers collude with each other and collude in bidding, the bidding will become a cover to hide the public and fail to achieve the purpose of bidding. For example, in a typical case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate this time, an information technology project of a certain unit was openly tendered to the public. Two companies colluded in the bidding. As a result, the winning bid price of the project was more than 35 million yuan, which was far higher than the actual cost. Such a result has caused serious losses to the bidding unit. In addition, collusive bidding by multiple suppliers will also affect market competition. Some bidders even bribe bid evaluation committee members to give their bids high marks in order to win the bid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases of bid-rigging, the tenderer may not know about it, but the bidders collude with each other to raise the price and obtain more benefits. However, there are also many cases of bid-rigging. The staff of the bidding unit are not only informed, but they may even actively collude with the bidders to raise the price, or give the project to a designated bidder to benefit themselves. As for other companies participating in the bidding, they only &quot;accompany the bidding&quot; to meet the requirement of multiple suppliers participating in the bidding. In fact, the contents of their bid documents are worse than those of the designated bidders, and it is impossible to win the bid. They appear just to cooperate in acting and get a little &quot;accompanying fee&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is undoubtedly rent-seeking, bribery and bribery. If the bidding unit is a state-owned enterprise or even a government agency or public institution, it will be suspected of bribery by public officials. Even if the bidding unit is a private enterprise, collusion in bidding will also constitute crimes such as job embezzlement and bribery of non-state personnel. The bidder paid bribes. The corruption behind this rent-seeking is quite astonishing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Zhejiang Daily&quot; once reported that Zhu Zhixiang, the former chairman of Shaoxing Urban Investment Group, as the main person in charge of the bidding unit, colluded with others and the bidders during the bidding process of relevant projects. , the total winning bid amount of the bidders reached more than 4.42 billion yuan. In April 2023, Zhu Zhixiang was sentenced to eleven years and six months in the first instance for bribery and bid collusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in some fields, bid-rigging and collusion have formed a complete industrial chain. Some practitioners do not have relevant qualifications themselves, so they &quot;affiliate&quot; with qualified units. The affiliated units charge a certain percentage of the winning bid amount as a &quot;management fee&quot; and share the profits from the winning bid. There are also professional scalpers and engineering brokers who specialize in bid-rigging. They have great powers, and some may be related to the tendering party, and some can even obtain the contact information of bid evaluation experts in time and bribe them. There are also &quot;hackers&quot; who can invade the bid evaluation expert database and provide them with expert lists and contact information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang police once uncovered a company with only nine employees and no construction team, but it repeatedly won bids for large engineering projects. In just two years, it participated in a total of 338 bids for engineering projects. The investigation found that this is a professional bid-rigging gang. After winning the bid, they illegally sell the project and profit from it. These engineering projects are stripped down and subcontracted at many levels. Not only will the project cost increase, but the quality of the project will also be difficult to guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the latest criminal prosecution standards formulated by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security in 2022, collusion in bidding, the winning amount of the bid is more than 4 million yuan, the illegal income is more than 200,000 yuan, or threats, deception, bribery By using other means, colluding in bidding multiple times, etc., they are all suspected of committing the crime of colluding in bidding, and a case should be filed and prosecuted. In particular, we must severely crack down on rent-seeking and corruption involving insiders of the tendering party to maintain a fair market order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[允许博士生分流转为硕士，你支持吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260095]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[平均降价58%！南周记者直击第九批国家药品集采现场]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260170]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄乌情报体系对抗：“外卖小哥”下毒引发的暗战 | 智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260154]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, 2023, Russian media reported that recently, A &quot;delivery boy&quot; attempted to &quot;poison&quot; dozens of Russian military officials and pilots at a celebration event for the alumni of Russia&#39;s Armavir Higher Military Aviation School, but the attempt failed after the Russian intelligence agency discovered it in time. It is reported that the &quot;takeaway boy&quot; is Yegor Semyonov, a 32-year-old man from Melitopol, Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian Armavir City Court arrested Yegor Semyonov for &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; and detained him for 15 days. He may face more serious &quot;terrorism&quot; next accusation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Victor Fisen, chairman of the Veterans Committee of Russia&#39;s Armavir Higher Military Aviation School, said that this was a large-scale poisoning attempt against the school&#39;s graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident also aroused public attention on the &quot;secret war&quot; between Russian and Ukrainian intelligence agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Poisonous Big Cake&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 21, 77 alumni of the Armavir Higher Military Aviation School in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, from the class of 2003, returned to school to attend Graduation 20 The anniversary celebrations included a number of active Russian Air Force pilots and senior officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the restaurant party, a &quot;takeaway boy&quot; suddenly delivered a 20-kilogram cake and several boxes of whiskey, claiming to be a gift from an alumnus who could not attend the party. The huge two The layer cake immediately grabbed everyone&#39;s attention. Everyone immediately started taking photos and posting in the chat group to express their gratitude. At the same time, everyone was asking each other who was the person who sent this gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since no one &quot;claimed&quot; the gift, partygoers became suspicious of the origins of the cake and whiskey. A Russian military officer who attended the event prevented the pilots present from drinking and eating cakes and immediately reported it to the Russian Federal Security Service. Subsequently, the Russian Federal Security Service tested the cake and whiskey and found that they contained highly toxic substances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a school security officer captured the figure of the &quot;delivery boy&quot; from the surveillance video. Agents of the Russian security service identified the &quot;takeaway boy&quot; as 32-year-old Yegor Semyonov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian police quickly identified Semyonov and arrested him. After graduating from high school, Semyonov became a weightlifting coach, often participating in various weightlifting competitions, and later worked as a security guard. Since 2015, Semyonov has lived in the suburbs of Moscow, the Russian capital, and has been engaged in the installation of video surveillance systems and walkie-talkies. In recent years, he has developed a keen interest in firearms and sports shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After delivering the poisonous cake, Semenov planned to fly back to Moscow, but was intercepted and taken away by Russian security personnel at the airport. Semyonov confessed to his actions and told prosecutors how he learned about the celebrations. He even painted the military academy&#39;s logo onto the cake for a greater realistic effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian side believes that Semyonov may be a spy sent by Kiev to Moscow. This &quot;toxic plot&quot; to murder the Russian pilot was probably carried out under the instruction of Kiev. This is Ukrainian defense intelligence An assassination planned by the General Administration. If Russia relaxes its vigilance and becomes paralyzed this time, it will pay a heavy price for this incident. Currently, Russian security services are &quot;looking for the person who made the cake and others involved in this sabotage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Russian-Ukrainian Unrestricted War&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The national security department or the military intelligence department serves the needs of national security military struggle. To a certain extent, it can kill the opponent or be defeated by the opponent. If put to death, one of the two must be one. The competition between the Russian and Ukrainian intelligence services can be described as each other’s shadow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when the war between Russia and Ukraine is raging, the &quot;poisoning of a delivery boy&quot; incident in Ukraine shows that both Russia and Ukraine have the characteristics of &quot;unrestricted warfare&quot; in terms of means, strategies, and moral integrity. This kind of Although the lethality of &quot;underhanded tactics&quot; cannot change the outcome of a conflict, it will have certain negative effects on changing the local situation on the battlefield, damaging the opponent&#39;s morale, and selecting combat methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Ukraine’s intelligence system structure and confrontation capabilities have been greatly improved. The U.S. intelligence agency is huge, and with the human and technical intelligence support provided by the U.S. intelligence agencies to Ukraine, Ukraine and Russia are launching an intelligence &quot;secret war&quot; on the &quot;hidden&quot; front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Agency has been involved in many assassinations in Russia. In 2022, the National Security Service of Ukraine planned and executed the car bombing that killed Dukina. A Ukrainian security official said: &quot;Dukina is the daughter of a Russian propagandist. The car bombings and other actions on Russian soil were meant to show Ukraine&#39;s enemies that even for those &#39;disrespecting Ukraine, punishment is at hand&#39; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former official of the Fifth Directorate of the Ukrainian National Security Agency said that these actions can only leave a &quot;deep impression&quot; on Zelensky, but cannot help the Ukrainian army move towards victory. “Kill one and another will soon take his place.” The assassination campaign in Ukraine was clearly driven more by impulse than logic, and not only lacked a strategic objective but may have exposed Ukrainian intelligence agents. This kind of &quot;assassination squad&quot; may be free from the hands of the president or the military and become a source of &quot;terrorism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western countries’ intelligence support for Ukraine has even more impact than arms assistance. Ukraine’s new intelligence capabilities proved their worth at the outset of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The Ukrainian Security Service obtained intelligence about high-value Russian targets and carried out strikes, killing several commanders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The top priority target of the Ukrainian National Security Agency is the bridge connecting the Russian mainland and the island of Crimea. In 2022, the Ukrainian Security Bureau attacked the bridge twice. The Ukrainian Security Bureau placed powerful explosives in a truck and later used drones to launch a second sabotage attack on the bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ukrainian military intelligence also used its own drone fleet to launch dozens of attacks in Russia, including penetrating Russian air defense systems and attacking buildings in Moscow. In May 2023, an operation affected part of the roof of the Kremlin. The attacks were carried out by both long-range drones launched from Ukraine and by agents and guerrillas working in Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the series of assassinations and sneak attacks carried out by the U.S.-backed Ukrainian intelligence agencies, the Russian government has repeatedly accused Ukraine of adopting a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; strategy and has also taken a series of powerful counterattacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 9, 2023, ITASS reported that the Russian Federal Security Service arrested a Russian citizen recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services and accused him of trying to blow up a bomb in Crimea in June. A natural gas pipeline. On August 13, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a video of a Russian drone destroying the &quot;Starlink&quot; satellite system communication terminal used by the Ukrainian army. The Russian drone operator discovered the &quot;Starlink&quot; satellite system communication terminal supported by the US military and disguised by the Ukrainian army. The drone accurately struck and destroyed the communication terminal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zakharova said on a TV program on October 24: &quot;Whether it is in Russia or in its surrounding areas, a large number of terrorist attacks will not start in 2022, but will start later. Start early. It is no secret to anyone that the security services affiliated with the Kiev regime are responsible for these large numbers of terrorist attacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An opponent is an opponent&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Historically, Russia and Ukraine The intelligence system was born out of the KGB during the Soviet period. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Russian and Ukrainian intelligence agencies adopted an administrative system with decentralized powers and separate administrations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1995, Russia established the new Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. , the Federal Security Service of counterintelligence. The Russian General Staff established the &quot;GRU&quot; responsible for military intelligence, which is the General Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. Its director is concurrently served by a Russian Deputy Chief of General Staff. The main goal is Collect military intelligence from strategic to tactical levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ukraine established the National Security Agency in March 1992, maintaining a special system directly led by the President of Ukraine, and inherited almost all functions of the KGB during the Soviet period. 1993 In July 2020, Ukraine established a Military Intelligence Bureau in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, similar to Russia’s Intelligence Bureau of the General Staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current construction of Ukraine’s intelligence system has also received full support from the United States.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To control the risk of &quot;serious penetration by Russia&#39;s FSB,&quot; the CIA spent tens of millions of dollars to transform Ukraine&#39;s Soviet-style spy agency into a powerful ally against Moscow. The CIA and Ukraine&#39;s National Security Service Cooperate to establish a new department against Russia, the &quot;Fifth Directorate&quot;, intended to implement &quot;urgent measures&quot; against Russia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Security Service of Ukraine has also added a Sixth Directorate to cooperate with the British MI6. Training base Based outside Kiev, CIA personnel mentor hand-picked trainees, requiring agents to &quot;be able to operate behind the lines and work as covert teams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In helping the Ukrainian Security Service establish the &quot;Secret Service&quot; At the same time as the &quot;Fifth Directorate&quot;, the CIA also invested &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; to transform Ukraine&#39;s military intelligence agency. A former US intelligence official who has worked in Ukraine said: &quot;We have calculated that the Military Intelligence Agency is a smaller, A more agile organization where we can have a greater impact. MI is our little baby. We provide them with new equipment and training. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At bases in Ukraine and later the United States, Ukrainian MI agents were trained in a variety of skills ranging from covert exercises behind enemy lines to weapons platforms and explosives. The CIA provided state-of-the-art surveillance and electronic eavesdropping systems, including mobile devices that could be placed along Russian-controlled routes in eastern Ukraine and software used to eavesdrop on the cell phones of Russian officials visiting the occupied territories from Moscow, with all information collected being shared with the United States.&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;A former senior military intelligence officer said: &quot;In one day, we can intercept 250,000 to 300,000 individual communications from the Russian army and the Federal Security Service, and the amount of information is so large that we cannot manage it ourselves. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thousands of data were transmitted back to Washington through the CIA’s newly constructed facilities, where they were scrutinized by CIA and NSA analysts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Military Intelligence also A network of informants was established within the Russian security apparatus. As a measure of mutual trust between the United States and Ukraine, the CIA was allowed direct contact with agents recruited and managed by Ukrainian intelligence services.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian-Ukrainian Intelligence Special Operations , due to different countries, different social systems, different war backgrounds and natures, the tactics and methods are also very different, and the effects are very different.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident of Ukrainian takeaways delivering poisonous cakes to Russian pilots shows that Ukrainian agents It has been trying to launch raids on Russia through various channels in an attempt to weaken its military power and national security. The Russian intelligence agencies have taken timely and powerful countermeasures. This shows that both Russia and Ukraine have strong intelligence systems to support them to varying degrees. .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[收容两百万阿富汗难民的巴基斯坦为何“变脸”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260164]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the early morning, gunfire rang out again in Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 4, 2023, the Pakistani military stated that it killed 9 militants that day.

Most refugees and migrants gathered at border crossings, awaiting exit procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most Afghan refugees entered Pakistan at three points in time: the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the US invasion after the &quot;911&quot; incident, and the Afghan regime change in 2021 After the change. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The United Nations Refugee Agency announced that there are approximately 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, making it the country hosting the largest number of Afghan refugees. But the process for refugees to obtain a legal residence permit in Pakistan is by no means easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;“Many Afghan refugees have their own businesses and houses in Pakistan, and their children go to school there&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Their descendants have not even seen Afghanistan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Atta Nassib, professor of international affairs at George Washington University, said&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;But given that Pakistan does not have a dual citizenship law, most Afghans cannot obtain Pakistani citizenship. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, it was a time when the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for hegemony. The United States and other NATO countries hope that Pakistan can accept Afghan refugees and provide financial and material support to Pakistan to ease the pressure on Pakistan to accept refugees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the help of international aid, Pakistan not only built refugee camps, but also helped refugees work and receive education, and also provided certain policy support. For Pakistan at that time, hosting refugees became a win-win choice, and the domestic economy also developed to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Jiadong, director of the South Asian Studies Center at Fudan University, believes that during the war, Pakistan received aid from many countries, and Pakistan also used part of the aid money to help Afghan refugees. . But now, many countries have reduced or even stopped aid. Pakistan&#39;s economic burden has also risen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion may cause more contradictions and conflicts with Afghanistan in the short term.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said, but from the perspective of Pakistan , driving some people back will make it easier to control the remaining refugees, that is, &quot;long-term pain is worse than short-term pain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In addition to economic issues, the grievances between Pakistan and Afghanistan are particularly deep.&quot; He said that Pakistan and Afghanistan also have many cross-border ethnic issues, which have led to constant border disputes.

On the same day, armed men attacked two Pakistani security posts near Pakistan&#39;s northern border, killing four soldiers and 12 attackers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani military noted in a statement that the attackers were &quot;equipped with the latest weapons&quot; and suggested they may have crossed the border from Afghanistan. Pakistan urges not to allow terrorists to use Afghan soil to carry out long-term terrorist acts against Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past two years, the violence of &quot;Bata&quot;-led attacks has increased. Just in January 2023, a suicide bombing occurred at a mosque in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province in northwestern Pakistan on the afternoon of the 30th. Hundreds of people died and more than 200 were injured. On the night of the incident, &quot;Bata&quot; members said that the attack was revenge for the previous police crackdown on Bata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu, director of the Pakistan Studies Center at Northern University for Nationalities, believes that after the change of Afghan regime, the bilateral relations that Pakistan expected were not established. Instead, conflicts and frictions continued, especially There have been many exchanges of fire in border areas. Pakistan has also become the target of terrorist attacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2023, in addition to frequent attacks by traditional terrorist forces in Pakistan, the Khorasan branch of the &quot;Islamic State&quot; has also begun to attack Afghanistan. Transfer within Pakistan. This has caused tremendous security and domestic pressure on Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It is difficult for Pakistan to control border security issues, and the cost is extremely high in reality.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said that a large number of weapons are now flowing from Afghanistan to Pakistan, which has become a problem for many Equipment of anti-Pakistani militants. &quot;Afghanistan is not particularly active in helping Pakistan, which makes Pakistan quite annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani government also accused Afghanistan of providing provision for militant groups that carried out these attacks. provided a &quot;safe haven&quot;, causing tensions in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. It said that of the 24 suicide bombings in Pakistan in 2023, 14 were carried out by Afghans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But what is noteworthy is that as early as the 1990s, when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan, some Taliban members came from Pakistan. Many media reports stated that Pakistani military officers even directly participated in the Taliban&#39;s operations at that time and received support from the Pakistan Intelligence Agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan is an important regional player in the power game in Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu said. However, the rise of the Taliban has stimulated the development of religious extremism and ethnic separatism in South Asia, causing refugee and drug problems to further spill over into South Asia, resulting in severe challenges to the regional security situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Other armed organizations saw that they could successfully seize power, and they also tried to imitate and follow suit. This is a major incentive for terrorist forces in Pakistan to become active again.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu Analysis shows that the security situation in Pakistan had improved in the past few years, but has worsened significantly recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that Baa has a unique relationship. For example, the two countries share a border of about 2,570 kilometers and are also important trading partners. There are also many close ties with each other such as culture, race and religion. The outside world believes that Pakistan and Afghanistan are &quot;love-hate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for many years. This is not an easy task.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said that not every country can do this Not to mention that Pakistan is not a rich country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu believes that Pakistan has tried to expel or repatriate Afghan refugees many times over the past decades, but with poor results. The regular flow of Afghan refugees to and from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area has become the norm. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Deportation order&quot; is also a &quot;pressure order&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Today we say goodbye to the people of Afghanistan as they begin their journey home .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Earlier, Pakistan’s interior minister publicly tweeted on social media and attached a video of Afghans boarding a bus, adding &quot;This action proves that Pakistan is determined to deport any individual living in the country without proper documentation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&quot;If they don&#39;t send us Send it back and we will live here for the rest of our lives.&quot; 35-year-old Afghan Mohammad Rahim&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; was born in Pakistan.

She didn&#39;t know where to go next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For decades, millions of Afghan refugees have lived in Pakistan for a long time, bringing huge financial burdens and various risks to Pakistan. A large number of illegal refugees The detention of Afghan refugees not only brings certain security risks, but also has a certain impact on the employment of Pakistanis.&quot; Ma Jianfu analyzed that Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees is also due to economic pressure. Undocumented immigrants and refugees are widely believed to have drained the country&#39;s resources for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For Pakistan&#39;s &quot;deportation order&quot; operation, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration condemned Pakistan&#39;s plan to bring &quot; Serious protection risk”. Restrictions on female NGO staff in Afghanistan have resulted in fewer employment opportunities for women in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data from the United Nations Refugee Agency shows that among Afghans who have recently returned home, 78% said that fear of being arrested in Pakistan was the reason for their departure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees this time will further worsen the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan and put tremendous pressure on Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu told Southern Weekend reporters, Due to complex reasons, it will be difficult for Pakistan&#39;s expulsion work to proceed normally, and it may also trigger armed resistance and worsen the anti-terrorism and security situation in both countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that this is not the first time that the Pakistani government has expelled Afghan refugees. Pakistan only uses the refugees as a tool to put pressure on Afghanistan. Pakistan’s expulsion will not go too far, because some terrorist forces and extremist forces are trying to take advantage of this opportunity, so Pakistan’s move is likely to be “loud and rainy”, using large-scale propaganda to achieve the desired effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s pressure strategy has been tried and tested time and time again.&quot; He said. As long as the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is tense, Pakistan will expel the refugees &quot;until Afghanistan cannot bear it anymore and will give in to Pakistan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, local time, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation of the interim government of Afghanistan stated that the Taliban government is currently providing assistance from multiple locations to families returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan. , and placed them in temporary camps. At the same time, some families with residential houses left the camps and went to the provinces where they lived, but there were also some families who did not have shelter and faced challenges in their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Taliban government also stated that it will try its best to find jobs for the returnees. However, according to World Bank data, Afghanistan&#39;s unemployment rate more than doubled from the time the Taliban took over to June 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that international sanctions on Afghanistan’s banking industry and the reduction of international aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban took over would lead to return Immigrants and refugees put enormous pressure on already limited resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当引进的高学历人才决定离开县城]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260140]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the morning of February 13, 2019, a city&#39;s talent service &quot;one-stop&quot; platform The window was opened, and applications for housing security for the first batch of imported talents in the city began to be accepted.

The reason for her choice is also very simple. Five years ago, she graduated from a 985 university in Shanghai with a bachelor&#39;s degree in human resources management. She changed many jobs but could not satisfy her parents. &quot;They felt that I must have an establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is no need to repeat the enthusiasm of parents and students for public examinations and compilation examinations. In the past, it was a stereotype unique to certain provinces, but now it has become The other side that everyone dreams of reaching. But there is obviously more than one road leading to Rome. In addition to the conventional paths such as national examinations, public examinations, and selection and transfer, the relatively low-key talent introduction policy that has been in place for many years has attracted more and more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talent introduction, as the name suggests, is a recruitment method used by local institutions, usually in counties or urban areas, to recruit graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from well-known universities to work within the system. . Different from the administrative establishment provided by selection and recruitment of civil servants, talent introduction can only provide career establishment. Places that adopt the talent introduction method will omit the written examination link and promise candidates a certain talent subsidy, settling-in allowance, etc., which is intended to reflect the needs of the local area. The wise are like thirsty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the opening of autumn recruitment in 2023, a new round of talent introduction has also begun. On various recruitment consultation websites, there are many announcements about remote counties offering high salary subsidies and hiring masters or even PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, some young people who were attracted found that the balance between ideal life and reality was far more difficult than imagined. The problem is not new. If the county can still provide the &quot;one-stop-seen&quot; life that our parents did, it may not be able to match the talents they are vying to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In an article published in 2022, Fang Changchun, a professor at the School of Social Sciences at Nanjing University and director of the Employment Quality Research Center, once pointed out that various regions are actively recruiting highly educated talents. While being open-minded, we should also accurately select and use materials based on the actual economic and social development of the county, and treat the use of talents with caution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was a little anxious to go ashore at that time”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Back to a Thursday in May 2022, Lu Min was attending tutoring She was in class and preparing for a teacher preparation exam when she got a call asking if she could participate in the county talent recruitment interview on Saturday. She signed up three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are only two days left before the interview. The day before the exam, Lu Min dug out the high school uniform from the bottom of the box - a black suit jacket, paired with a light blue shirt and dark suit pants, to make up a complete formal suit. In the evening, I made a phone call with a friend who was familiar with public examinations to improve my interview skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a one-person interview. The examination room was a classroom in a local middle school. In the middle, there was a table prepared for interviewers, covered with a piece of white paper. Opposite, five examiners sat side by side, with timers placed beside the table. 10 minutes, the countdown has not started yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was hard to contain the tension, but fortunately, the temporary assault content came in handy. Similar to the exam preparation guide, among the three interview questions Lu Min encountered, the first question was pragmatic and asked about work attitude; the last two questions were pragmatic and asked what to do if agricultural products are unsaleable and how to properly place trash cans in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Min later reviewed his performance on that day and consciously answered well, &quot;I took the impact of the epidemic into consideration for the last two questions,&quot; but for the first question &quot;I should quote more materials, but I was nervous and forgot about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is not the first time Lu Min has sought to enter the system. After graduating from college in 2018, in order to meet her parents&#39; expectations, she took the civil service exam in her hometown city once, but stopped taking the written exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the spring of 2021, Lu Min joined a private vocational and technical college as a teacher. This job has no establishment, but the teaching pressure is low and there are many vacations, which once made her very satisfied. However, her parents gave her an ultimatum and she must take the entrance examination in 2022. To this end, starting from February 2022, Lu Min &quot;cast his net everywhere.&quot; Most of the positions applied for were for teachers, but the only one who heard back was the one for talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​week after the interview, Lu Min received the notification that he had successfully landed. She was happy at first, &quot;I can finally shut my parents&#39; mouths.&quot; But worries soon struck that this was not a job she really wanted after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year has passed, and Lu Min is always wandering around the personnel files. Compared with many other government agencies, this job is considered gentle. Except for the employment season, she only needs to send and receive three or four files a day. However, she was never sure whether this was her ideal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unlike Lu Min, Meng Qiping was already 35 years old before he successfully landed through talent introduction, and his life was full of frustrations and dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Meng Qiping graduated from a general state university in the United States with a science major. After returning to China for employment, he worked as a programmer and an IELTS training teacher. In 2020, before the &quot;double reduction&quot; was implemented, he went to the UK to study for graduate school. After graduating in 2022, he applied for a doctorate from a school in Malaysia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although at that time, going to Southeast Asia to study for a Ph.D. had become synonymous with &quot;mixed&quot; academic qualifications, the pressure of studying for a Ph.D. was still beyond his expectation, and &quot;the frustration was relatively strong.&quot; . In October 2022, Meng Qiping dropped out of school and returned to China again. This time, he set his sights on the hottest thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a native of Kunming, recruiting talents from this province is his first choice. However, after several interviews, Meng Qiping discovered that the salary offered by Yunnan was very attractive. The competition is too fierce, and it is normal for &quot;about ten people to compete for one or two positions&quot;. After many failures, at the end of 2022, Meng Qiping decided to move to northern Guangxi to participate in a talent introduction interview in a certain county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruitment information shows that the position Meng Qiping applied for at that time was a &quot;party and government talent position without restriction on majors&quot;, with a total of 10 positions open. On the day of the interview, he unexpectedly discovered that due to the epidemic, only 6 applicants came to participate. &quot;This means that as long as you attend the interview, you can get a job,&quot; Meng Qiping said happily. He didn&#39;t know it at the time, but this job would just add to his years of wandering life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, one month after resigning from the county’s Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Meng Qiping once again recalled the choice he made a year ago, admitting that “at that time Some are eager to get ashore.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 13, 2023, a job fair in Mengzi City, Yunnan Province.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Refreshing the highest educational level of employees in the unit”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rush to go ashore is not a person’s idea, but a spread The anxiety that comes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping later learned that the five people who passed the interview in the same batch as him were, without exception, master students. One of them also had an overseas study background, and two of them had a background in overseas study. They were assigned to the County Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, which “refreshed the highest educational level for employees in the history of the bureau.” Lu Min, who lives in the northern county of Henan, mentioned that the people introduced with her all graduated from 985 and 211 universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the &lt;span>;Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Social Science Literature Press jointly released&lt;/span>;&#39;s &quot;Social Blue Book: 2023&quot; &quot;China Social Situation Analysis and Forecast&quot; mentioned that between 2018 and 2021, more and more college students want to abandon first- and second-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and return to third- and fourth-tier small and medium-sized cities, small counties, grassroots towns and rural work . In August 2023, the 2022 College Students Returning Home Employment Survey Report released by the educational research organization Max Research Institute also mentioned that the proportion of graduates returning home for employment is on the rise, and nearly half work within the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The flow of talents into the county system is exactly what the local government expects. Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, a county with a permanent population of only 650,000. In an interview event in early 2020, a total of 316 master&#39;s and doctoral students from famous domestic and foreign universities such as Fudan University, Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Columbia University participated.&lt; span>;In the end, only 23 people passed and are expected to obtain career establishment&lt;/span>;. In the official publicity, the interpretation that “the competition for talents has reached a record high” is highlighted in bold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters show that since August 2023, more than 10 provinces have announced talent introduction plans for public institutions in their counties and cities, and single recruitment is open. The number of positions mostly exceeds 100, among which full-time master&#39;s and doctoral graduates are the main recruitment targets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have been doing this for a long time by taking part of our staff to recruit people in other universities and colleges. It is just a term used to introduce talents in recent years. It was made more clear.&quot; Wang Meng works in the Organization Department of a municipal party committee in a southwest city. According to her memories, the province held a talent work conference in 2021, which specifically listed talent work as a focus and established talent at the provincial and municipal levels. Work first area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wang Meng’s observation, counties and districts that can vigorously recruit talents usually have a leading industry or leading industry. “Like Anshan, the local area will definitely choose some steel industries. Professional talents in this field can do research and have development prospects.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Small cities show their enthusiasm as much as possible. Wang Meng&#39;s area provides free talent apartments and house purchase subsidies for high-level postgraduate talents. If they work for more than five years, there is also a cash reward. Children&#39;s education, parents&#39; medical treatment, free physical examinations, etc. are also supporting benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, an unavoidable fact is that the boom in talent introduction is also driven by policy factors. Southern Weekend reporters searched and found that the talent introduction work first appeared in the public eye, which can be traced back to 15 years ago. In 2008, places such as Rizhao in Shandong, Hebi in Henan, and Fuzhou in Jiangxi took the lead in proposing to open up some positions in public institutions to introduce high-level and high-quality talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Two years later, in May 2010, the Second National Talent Work Conference was held, &quot;National Medium and Long-term Talent Development Plan Outline (2010-2020)&quot; Issued. Zhang Lei, an economist at the Qingxu County Personnel Examination Center in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, mentioned in the paper that under the influence of policies, party and government agencies and public institutions across the country have also begun to pay attention to talent work and regard it as an important part of the reform of public institutions. carry out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Organization Department of Yongjing County Party Committee in Gansu Province recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that &lt;span>; his county started to introduce talents in 2020. Initially, In two years, I can recruit two or three times a year&lt;/span>;, but the number will be less in the future. &quot;I can&#39;t say when the next time will be. It&#39;s possible that we won&#39;t recruit next year, or we may recruit again. The establishment is dead, and if the unit is short of people, we will definitely recruit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As the number of participating counties and cities increases, the “level” of talent becomes higher and higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2023, Yucheng, a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Dezhou City, Shandong Province, a city famous for Dayu&#39;s flood control, issued an announcement, It is planned to introduce 6 Ph.D.s to work in municipal units under the jurisdiction of five departments including the Yucheng City Government Office, Science and Technology Bureau, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, and Commerce Bureau. This is the first time that local talent recruitment has been specifically targeted at Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the past, our standard for recruiting talents was that only master&#39;s degree students and above were required.&quot; A reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the other party in the name of applying for a job, and the person responsible for the recruitment Staff from the social sector explained on the phone that the reason for raising standards was “mainly to attract talents.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Selection methods specially formulated for talents also emerged. Different from the preliminary review, qualification review, written examination, interview and other processes required for regular recruitment in public institutions, the human resources and social affairs department will organize a group of applicants from time to time to conduct centralized interviews within one to two months through staff introduction and doctoral introduction. Just choose. As of late September, the centralized interviews for the first batch of applicants have ended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The imported talents are relatively easy to use.&quot; Wang Meng introduced that the talent introduction in his city will arrange for face-to-face communication between employers and job seekers, &quot; Asking about your intentions, future development direction, everything can be asked, and the evaluation and understanding of a person will be clearer and deeper.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The level of economic development is here”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More generous salaries and better benefits, in the aforementioned paper , Zhang Lei mentioned that in order to attract talents, &quot;giving money, giving houses, and giving household registration&quot; have become the &quot;three axes&quot; of local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the person directly responsible for the talent introduction work, Wang Meng knows very well that many highly educated talents come here for the settlement subsidies and cash rewards. Before the epidemic, the brain drain rate in her area had always been relatively serious. To solve this problem, welfare benefits were indispensable. &quot;After all, there is a war for talent everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, after winning the iron rice bowl as expected, highly educated talents may also encounter disappointment in actual work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before joining the job, Meng Qiping paid special attention to the fact that the county&#39;s &quot;monthly basic salary is 4,000, and the performance at the end of the year is 30,000&quot; for introducing talents. In the local The conditions are quite good. But it wasn’t until he officially joined the company in March 2023 that he learned that in addition to the 4,000 yuan monthly talent subsidy for the first five years, the more than 4,000 yuan received at the end of the month already included a monthly prepayment performance bonus of 1,500 yuan, which would be paid at the end of the year. The actual performance does not exceed 10,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like Meng Qiping, Lu Min&#39;s actual salary after joining the company was also lower than expected. &quot;I received more than two thousand, and with the recent cancellation of assessments, the salary was reduced every month.&quot; Thirty or forty yuan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping concluded afterwards, &quot;The salary levels in various places are not very transparent, which means that you have to go in to know the true salary levels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most counties and cities that introduce talents can offer limited treatment conditions. In the aforementioned telephone consultation, the Southern Weekend reporter had not yet asked about the target salary level. He only mentioned another prefecture-level city, and a staff member of the Yucheng City Human Resources and Social Security Department added, &quot;We are a county-level city, and the salary you expected must be the same.&quot; There is a difference because the level of economic development is here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the staff member, after the introduced talents with master&#39;s degree become regular workers, they will receive The salary is about 4,300 yuan. If you graduate from a &quot;double first-class&quot; university, there will be an additional monthly subsidy of 1,300 yuan. The salary for a doctoral degree must refer to the document standards published by the government&#39;s official website. However, Southern Weekend reporters did not find the details of the relevant documents on the official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Being acclimatized&quot; is also Du Lin&#39;s experience. In 2022, through talent introduction, she got a job as a business editor in a prefecture-level city in central Gansu with a population of less than 500,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Lin graduated from an ordinary university in the west with a bachelor&#39;s degree. She is the first employee recruited by the company through talent introduction. Most of her colleagues are junior college graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;After studying for a few more years, I was always told that I was too old to find a partner. Several male colleagues in their thirties and forties also introduced me to A local unemployed man, they always ask me, how was your conversation.&quot; This very traditional value evaluation made Du Lin feel uncomfortable. &lt;span>;Although she is also from another county&lt;/span>;, &quot;My family never said that I should get married as soon as possible, and they never said that I should stop studying when I get older.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nearly two months after joining the company, Du Lin did not receive clear information about her position. &quot;Department, office, workstation, none of these.&quot; She was once assigned to debug the online conference equipment. After the meeting started, a male colleague came over and said that the leader&#39;s office needed to be cleaned, &quot;I need to learn how to be a good person first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are already cleaning staff in the unit.&quot; Du Lin guessed that maybe using her to give her colleagues a &quot;sense of superiority&quot;, but delving deeper, the reason It may be that the entry of highly educated talents has brought them career anxiety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Meng Qiping also had similar feelings. He imitated the tone of his colleagues: &quot;Hey, what&#39;s the difficulty with this? Don&#39;t be afraid, there are graduate students here to support them. Graduate students can do everything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Dilemma of Over-education&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;Graduate students who “know everything” may be doing the job they are least good at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they first joined the company, Du Lin and Meng Qiping both worked in the unit&#39;s general office. This is seen as a regular way to sharpen newcomers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While working in the general office, Meng Qiping and other colleagues needed to follow a roster. When it&#39;s his turn, he has to rush to the office early in the morning, and then start various chores: making tea, booking a bus, taking photos, and printing name tags. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Meng Qiping’s view, this job does not require a graduate student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The accumulated pressure and confusion finally erupted late at night after a basketball game during the May Day holiday. When Meng Qiping returned home after one o&#39;clock in the morning, he suddenly questioned his years of hard study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In fact, there is no difference in promotion and work content between talent introduction and those who are admitted to public institutions through other methods.&quot; As a recruiter of talent introduction , Wang Meng does not deny that the county’s talent carrying capacity is not as sufficient as imagined. There was once a doctor who was admitted to her urban area through selective transfer, but because &quot;he was doing very basic work&quot; and it was not in line with his expectations, he was not able to retain him in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the view of Luo Rundong, director of the Institute of Labor Economics of Shandong University (Weihai), such educated people engage in jobs that do not match their academic qualifications, which leads to their The phenomenon that the skills learned cannot be fully utilized is over-education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a paper study published in 2010, based on the comprehensive social survey data CGSS, Luo Rundong and Peng Mingming, a doctoral student at the Institute of Economics of Nankai University, conducted a study on different Statistics on overeducation among employees with higher education in type units. The results show that the proportion of overeducation in administrative agencies and public institutions is generally higher than that in business units, and among business units, state-owned or state-controlled enterprises are higher than those in foreign-funded enterprises and private enterprises. At the same time, when other conditions are equal, party and government agencies, public institutions, state-owned or state-controlled enterprises and other units will further continue to increase the proportion of over-education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the phenomenon that everyone yearns for and needs higher education is more obvious than when the paper was published. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, when a Southern Weekend reporter consulted the Talent Office of Libo County, Guizhou Province as a master&#39;s student at a 211 university, the staff first repeatedly强调工作内容和所学专业不冲突，紧接着又透露，工作初期，单位为引进人才分配的工作一般都很轻松，像是收发文件或撰写材料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;过去一年，陆敏自认不过是做着“螺丝钉”的工作。收发档案，对于人力资源管理专业毕业的她来说，只消很短时间就能上手，一年试用期很快过去，她站到了转正的拐角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;最近又到招聘季，局里迎来了一批又一批面试者。有天，陆敏一眼认出，其中一名面试者是自己的高中同学。对方很快也认出了她，“你竟然在这里上班？”语气中的诧异掩饰不住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“对方在高中时成绩并不如我，这次是以研究生学历来报的名。”想到自己的本科学历，陆敏生出一种耻感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但更让她感到“低人一等”的，还是自己工作、生活的小县城。 “大学同学大都在上海。初高中的同学里，待北京的比较多，也有深圳、广州的。他们常常在朋友圈里晒，去哪里旅游了，周末又看了一个什么展。”而县城里，连购物中心都没几个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陆敏心想，“如果能考上研究生，我的人生或许可以打开另一番局面。”2023年9月18日，她瞒着父母递交了辞职信，专心备考研究生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;8月，在入职四个月后，孟启平也决定离职。他了解过，当初上岸的6个人，有一人在入职前放弃。剩下5人中，除了自己，有一人也有离职的想法，还有两个人希望“考上公务员”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他看到一种独属县城的人才困境。 “县城一方面需要人才去建设它，但人才真的来了以后，好像很多时候也发挥不了该发挥的作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;像是一个闭环，孟启平的下一步计划又变回了读博。他希望读完博士后，能在国内高校得到一份教职。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这不是“代骂”从业者第一次遭到处罚。 2023年8月，湖南长沙警方就依法将在网上发布“代骂”广告的李某东抓获归案，对其行拘。据警方调查，李某东以100元一天的价格帮助客户在指定社交平台上对他人进行网络言语辱骂，2022年10月至今已非法获利近万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“代骂”的风险在于被骂者可能会报警。 《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》第42条规定，“多次发送淫秽、侮辱、恐吓或者其他信息，干扰他人正常生活的”构成违法，处五日以下拘留或者五百元以下罚款；情节较重的，处五日以上十日以下拘留，可以并处五百元以下罚款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在警方惩处“代骂者”不法行为的同时，也有几个问题值得深入考量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，代骂者已经违法，购买“代骂服务”的人是否需要负起法律责任？或者说，购买者花了这笔钱就可以“借嘴骂人”，从而达到“借刀杀人”的效果，还能免除自己的责任？从本案看，易某至少代替了一百个人辱骂他人，如果其中存在“严重后果”案例的话，那么出钱购买“嘴替”的人，倒成了不显山不露水的“幕后操纵者”，可以大喇喇地“买凶骂人”，这是因为每笔业务标的太小而不处理吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国民法典》规定，二人以上共同实施侵权行为，造成他人损害的，应当承担连带责任。教唆、帮助他人实施侵权行为的，应当与行为人承担连带责任。理论上，购买代骂服务的人才是侵权行为的源头，符合“教唆、帮助他人实施侵权行为”的认定标准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，“骂人”本身是个非常宽泛笼统的概念，存在如何界定的问题。哪些言语攻击属于骂人行为，又有哪些骂人行为属于人身攻击与侮辱从而涉嫌违法犯罪，其中尚有非常之大的区间分布，不宜一概而论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样是广义上的“骂人”，遭遇不公之后的言语反击，与有组织有预谋的语言霸凌、侮辱显然不能相提并论，前者怎么说都称得上是语言上的正当防卫。而在“代骂服务”之外还有“代吵架服务”，这种“茶壶里的风暴”就不大容易涉嫌违法犯罪。顺着这个思路推下去，老派文人“知己知彼”“适可而止”“出言典雅”“以退为进”这些今天用来仍不过时的“雅骂”招数，恐怕就更难归类为触法言行了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不难想见的是，这些代骂者之所以被行拘，还是因为骂人言行符合人身攻击与侮辱的定义，构成对受害者的侵权，乃至涉嫌违法犯罪，而不是笼统的“骂了人”。移动互联网技术的发展，只是让本来就有的人身攻击、侮辱、污蔑诽谤行为变得更为便捷，甚至还让其变成了一款可以在平台上交易的“服务”而已。技术本身是中性的，有“夸夸服务”自然也会有“代骂服务”，这些“情绪需求”植根于人性深处。 “代骂服务”看起来是个新事物，但其内核却相当古老。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其三，既然“代骂服务”是互联网技术加持下的新业态，那么技术进步恐怕还会催生出更新的“骂人”业态，这恐怕才是值得审慎考量与严加警惕的。以大语言模型ChatGPT为代表的生成式AI，带来的恐怕会是更为疯狂与难以想象的未来。可以设想的是，如今的“代骂服务”还只是真人在互联网上“接单开骂”，那假如是“AI代骂”呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，AI训练的换脸、拟声、作文都已近乎以假乱真，完全可以在赛博空间克隆一个真人的数字生命，再凭借虚拟号码/账号介入现实。如果你被音色与现实生活中完全一样的真人的AI假人骂了，或是被完全虚拟的AI假人骂了，辱骂的内容又与你的个人信息高度吻合、涉事者又难以追踪的话，由此产生的各种麻烦与法律风险，肯定要比如今的真人代骂高出好几个数量级，给人格权的保护带来更大难题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如你以为现实生活某个人骂了你，其实只是第三方购买了AI骂人服务，只是提取与使用了真人的音色与语音特征，你可能错误地与该真人产生实际的冲突，而这一切是某个第三方操纵的结果。这造成的问题在某种程度上与“视频换头术”是同构的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以近期爆火的“AI配音”为例，从特朗普到歌星泰勒•斯威夫特都可以开口用自己特色的音色讲中文普通话，“AI正在取代语音工作者”的前景并不遥远。如果这项技术也被拿来“代骂人”的话，后果势必比真人代骂更为耸动。设想有一天你的通讯工具收到了亲友乃至名人的“辱骂音视频”，光是精神损害恐怕都够你喝一壶的，消除误会也势必费时费力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，面对尚在苗头的“代骂服务”，及如火如荼的生成式人工智能，确实需要前瞻性地廓清其边界，界定哪些骂人行为侵权，哪些涉嫌违法犯罪，购买骂人服务者又是否需要担责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot;

&lt;p>;当天，果敢同盟军在社交平台上分享了一段战场视频。视频中，同盟军的红色军旗高高飘扬。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月27日，果敢同盟军、若开军和德昂民族解放军三支缅北民地武装结成“三兄弟联盟”，对缅北多地的缅军军事据点发动武装袭击。此后的十余天，果敢同盟军在社交媒体保持日更频率，高调公布战果。按照果敢同盟军的说法，缅北联军已占领120多个国防军营地，目前仍在持续向老街推进。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而缅甸军政府则鲜少表态，只是回应称有三个政府控制区失控。11月2日，缅甸国防军宣布进入紧急状态，不日将发动反击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“以往，民地武装往往是单独向缅甸政府军发起行动，即使有联军协助，也是分线孤军作战。但此次果敢同盟军的军事行动不仅有民地武装加入，也得到其余反军方力量的响应和支援，这将会导致战局更加复杂。”缅甸华人学者、华侨大学华侨华人与区域国别研究院助理教授亨凯向南方周末记者分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，战火持续升级，缅北联军与国防军交火不断，并日渐围绕果敢形成对峙局势。连绵的枪炮声之下，数万缅北民众被迫逃离家园，难民人数持续增加。而与缅北隔河相望的云南边境小镇畹町，也被战火殃及。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月2日，中国外交部发言人呼吁各方立即停火止战，坚持通过对话协商，以和平方式解决分歧，避免事态升级，并采取切实有效措施，确保中缅边境安全稳定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年10月31日，果敢125难民营，志愿者正在卸物资。受访者供图&quot;

&lt;p>;阿仁是缅甸人，长期居住在云南昆明。10月25日，他从云南返回腊戌探亲，没想到到家后的第三天，就意外亲历了缅北冲突。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在缅甸果敢老街工作了13年的智祥似乎更加幸运一些。10月16日，智祥有事离开老街，恰好避开了。他本来计划28日返回，结果战事一起，地面交通陷入瘫痪，智祥没能回到果敢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月27日凌晨4点开始，掸邦北部清水河、勐古、贵慨、滚弄、腊戌等多个地区同步遭遇缅北联军袭击，收费站、警察哨所、城市军队以及警察局均受到攻击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当天的枪炮声特别密集，感觉就像是在耳边爆炸一样，十分吓人。”阿仁回忆说，“怎么也没想到会遇到这样的事情，我感觉记事以来从来没有出现过如此紧张的情况。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腊戌是缅甸北部掸邦首府，也是缅甸军方东北军区司令部所在地，“在城市中心山顶上，政府军连续十几天发射了多枚炮弹。”阿仁说，为了安抚民众，腊戌当地媒体曾特意发文提醒，这些炮弹主要是为了支援其他战区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“1027行动”以其发动日期10月27日命名。《外交学者》杂志政治分析员Kyaw Hsan Hlaing估计，大约有2万缅北联军参与了此次行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“与果敢地区往年发生的冲突相比，此次军事行动不仅规模大，而且战略覆盖面更广更全。”亨凯指出，“三兄弟联盟”不仅对包括清水河在内的果敢战略要地发起攻势，而且同时攻打腊戌，试图牵制缅甸国防军，阻止其支援缅北。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月2日，缅甸国家管理委员会发言人佐敏吞回应，在多个地方连续交战之后，清水河、捧线、棒赛三个政府控制区失守。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;清水河位于果敢，捧线和棒赛则隶属于木姐，均是重要的中缅贸易口岸。三地紧邻中缅边境线，最近处不过一水之隔。据缅甸政府商务部统计数据，2023年4月至9月，缅甸与中国的边境贸易总额为18亿美元（约25亿新元），其中超过四分之一是通过清水河交易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缅甸民族地方武装表示，封锁从腊戌到清水河和木姐的道路，可以切断缅甸政府军进入掸邦北部的陆上通道。但对于缅北民众而言，这些陆上通道更是重要的生命补给线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“果敢老街的物资大多依赖清水河，现在中国和缅甸的货物都进不来，大米的价格已经暴涨了逾三倍。”缅籍华人阿兰告诉南方周末记者，“原来一袋大米大概二三百人民币，现在已经涨到了1400元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于担心后续买不到物资，阿兰的朋友想囤几箱泡面以备不时之需，但却无处购买。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在胶脉和腊戌，由于货物难以外运，反而出现了降价销售的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿金一家在缅北胶脉从事养殖业。“胶脉有大量的养殖户，他们通常会将鸡蛋运到曼德勒和其他城市销售。由于现在公路被限制通行，鸡蛋只能在城内便宜销售。”阿金对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年11月6日，果敢125难民营，身穿黄色马甲的工作者正在打扫卫生。受访者供图&quot;

&lt;p>;但在冲突更为激烈的其他战区，民众却难以在退和留之间从容选择。有的人不得不慌忙逃难，有的则被迫在惶恐中留下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当冲突进入到第二周，缅北联军相继在滚弄以及果敢东山区、西山区连续作战，逐渐对老街形成包围之势。果敢同盟军单方面称，已拔除老街周边多个缅军据点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“老街的局势越来越紧张。”智祥说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而缅北民众却面临着难以逃离的困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从老街回腊戌，需要经过清水河、滚弄、南扎拉和木邦，这些地方要么被缅北联军占领，要么正在交火。他们不是不想离开，而是没法离开，就怕路上更不安全。”阿兰告诉南方周末记者，她有很多朋友现在被困在老街，“他们很恐慌，但又别无选择”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年11月6日，联合国秘书长发言人斯特凡·杜加里克表示，自10月26日以来，缅甸北部已有近33000名男女老少流离失所。据缅甸当地媒体报道，仅仅在125果敢边境线附近设立的安置点，目前已收容逾12000人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;智祥过去13年一直在果敢从事志愿服务工作。缅北冲突以来，他所在的服务机构和果敢联合青年会，共同承担起其中一处难民营的运转工作。短短十几天，难民营已经接收了1300多名难民。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在智祥发给南方周末记者的一段难民营视频中，红黄蓝绿各种颜色的简易帐篷，密密麻麻地排列在一片旷野之上，帐篷下则是咯人的石头和黄土。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“目前营区的供电还好，但我们最缺的是水和大米，而且现在米价越来越高，越来越难买。”智祥说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缅北联军和缅甸国防军连番激战之下，大量滚弄民众纷纷外逃。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者联系上一位曾在社交平台上求助的人士，她告诉南方周末记者，“已经安全撤离”，但其中的具体细节并不愿意谈及。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但即使安全撤离并不意味着可以免受战火之苦。一家人外出逃难，回来后发现房子被烧成空壳，过去这些年，智祥已见过太多类似场景。“只要是跑到偏远山区逃难，回来时基本上一无所有，我想这一次也不例外。”智祥说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年11月6日，果敢125难民营的早餐。受访者供图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/123db821dd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot;

&lt;h4>;“和平才最重要”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在果敢地区工作13年，智祥经历了当地发生的多次冲突。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与云南接壤的果敢自治区及其首府老街镇，曾长期是果敢同盟军的据点。2009年8月8日，缅甸政府军以果敢枪械修理厂制毒为由，派出30名警察，欲强搜该厂，遭拒绝后与果敢同盟军形成对峙。随后，果敢同盟军内部发生内讧，副司令白所成率部投靠缅甸政府。8月30日，缅甸政府军全面控制果敢，同盟军余部败退山林。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，果敢同盟军先后于2015年和2017年连续发起两次军事行动，试图重新拿回果敢掌控权，但均被缅甸政府军瓦解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次，缅北联军发表联合声明称，“1027”行动旨在联合所有革命组织推翻缅军人集团的独裁统治。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月29日，是缅甸军政府上台执政的第1000天。在亨凯看来，缅北民地武装选择这样的时机发动袭击并非偶然，而是基于战略目标的综合考量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2021年政变以后，缅甸掀起了声势浩大的反军方行动，政府军与反对力量冲突不断，缅北联军以&#39;反独裁&#39;的名义发动军事行动，更易于获得反军方势力响应。”亨凯分析，其最根本的目的，还是要重新夺回果敢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十余天来，缅北联军持续向果敢推进。其称，从10月27日到11月5日，三家民地武装已经夺取了120多个国防军营地。但缅甸军政府并未正面回应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“缅北联军声势浩大，攻下这些据点不难，但想要守住却并不是一件容易的事。”亨凯指出，而且从目前来看，果敢同盟军拿下的大多只是城市周边的据点，很难说会对城镇管辖权产生多大影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月3日，缅甸军政府最高领导人敏昂莱警告，军方将向掸邦的少数民族地方武装组织发起反击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“缅甸国防军仍具有压倒性的实力，但自2021年以来缅甸军政府始终四面受敌，甚至连首都内比都也曾遇袭。”亨凯分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年2月1日，缅甸政局突变，国家权力被移交给缅甸国防军总司令敏昂莱。部分反军方人士则随即成立民族团结政府和人民防卫军，采取军事行动对抗国防军，并不时和民地武装采取联合行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据缅甸战略与政策研究院统计，自缅甸政变至2022年11月15日的21个月里，缅甸全国至少爆发了7855起冲突。其中，军方与少数民族武装组织交火4548次，与人民防卫军交火2267次，军方与少数民族武装组织和人民防卫军的联合交火达925次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次缅北联军发起军事行动以来，缅甸各地已有14支“革命组织”宣布支持“1027行动”，其中部分宣布将加入战斗。另据缅甸当地媒体报道，在连续四天进攻后，克钦独立军联合当地人民防卫军，已于11月6日占领了实皆省高林镇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在缅甸军政府腹背受敌的情况下，战局究竟会走向何方，目前还很难说清。”亨凯说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但对于饱经战乱之苦的缅北民众而言，讨论政治或许太过于遥远，稻田中待收获的水稻才更为重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“缅甸一年有三个季节——热季、雨季和凉季，眼下正是雨季水稻收割的季节。”阿仁说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腊戌一位农民告诉当地媒体，“过去两周，因为下雨，无法收割水稻，雨停后，战斗就开始了。由于经常听到飞机和武器声音，大家都不敢去田里收割，接下来也只能视情况而行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在采访中，南方周末记者询问了多位受访者对这场冲突的看法，得到的回答几乎一致——不管谁打赢，对于我们老百姓来说，“和平才是最重要的”。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;On November 6, an online post reported that Hubei Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital was suspected of selling birth certificates, saying that after more than a year of undercover visits, it was discovered that Ye Moumou, the director of Xiangyang Jianqiao Hospital, colluded with intermediary gangs in many places.

According to the online post, the buyer only needs to provide identity information and pay 96,000 yuan, and the hospital will follow the &quot;normal&quot; production process and handle a full set of true information such as filing, prenatal check-up, hospitalization, delivery, and discharge at the hospital. &quot;Two days after being discharged from the hospital, the customer can take the &quot;bought child&quot; to the hospital to collect foot blood (foot blood is collected when a newborn is born), and then apply for a birth certificate. The entire process can be completed in up to 7 days.
