This remark triggered a lot of discussion, with both praise and criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One criticism says that experts from the pan-humanistic society tend to fall into reflection on &quot;new technologies&quot; and &quot;new trends&quot;, giving people a sense of criticizing for the sake of criticizing. However, this does not mean that Yan Fei’s statement is without value. Whether it inspires resonance or triggers refutation, it shows that it has touched many people and must be right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What exactly has social media brought to us? Is it empowering us, allowing us to better control our lives, helping us contact and discover the larger world, and achieving better selves? Or is it going too far and consuming us, and we are being included and swallowed, becoming this &quot;superorganism&quot; &quot;Human flesh input and output terminal, everyone produces fragments, and is fed fragments? The answer may be different for everyone. Different views on a technology can reveal its different aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a positive perspective, social media has indeed reduced the cost of communication. You can establish links with strangers in distant places without leaving home and just inputting and clicking a few times, sharing your opinions with each other and getting timely feedback; Moreover, in the online world, everyone can take off the mask they wear in real life and reveal their true self without worrying too much about offending others with their honesty. Some people will unite into a community based on common knowledge background, values ​​or hobbies, find an ecological niche that suits them, and find the meaning of survival. For those who feel lonely and out of tune with the people around them offline, it is also a kind of happiness to find that &quot;I am not alone&quot; online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, with the deepening popularity of mobile Internet and smartphones, more and more freelancers can work from home or even anywhere, especially for knowledge workers. For these people, social media is already an infrastructure for doing work, or a productivity tool. Others’ criticism and reflection on social media are just clouds and noise to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, barring a massive catastrophe, it is impossible for us to return to the state of things before social media for long. In this sense, all criticisms and reflections on social media are irrational and fleeting, while those that are reasonable can at best promote the improvement of social media. Of course, each of us is free to choose, and can independently decide the frequency and type of social media use, and the appropriate proportion and time of online and offline life. Therefore, we cannot treat our mental weakness and disability as Blame it on social media or something else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this general premise, we may admit that Yan Fei’s statement sees a problem. Of course, what appears to be social media’s problem is actually our own problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A netizen said, &quot;I feel very close to my heart&quot;. He said that he likes to watch the dusk of vegetation and other things captured in the video, but he doesn&#39;t want to see it in real life. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course life that is staged or filtered is not real life. You have a choice. You can put down your phone and go for a hike to watch the sunrise or watch the sunset on your balcony. Connect with the real world and real people and feel the beauty around you. You can also keep your phone in your hand. The algorithm will continuously push content to you based on your needs and desires, keeping you high until you feel dizzy, exhausted, and left with a sense of consumption and emptiness afterwards. Of course, you can also use your phone sparingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, you want to accompany your children to enhance the understanding and relationship between parents and children, or go outdoors with family and friends on weekends to enjoy a quiet time. But if you pick up your mobile phone, turn into a heroic fighter on social media, and scold Fang Qiu, then you may have really ignored the people around you who need care and &quot;lost the perception of the beauty around you.&quot; But as long as you step away, social media is just a dead thing to you, and a responsible person will not shirk his responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen retorted: If there is beauty around us, do we still have time to use social media? Don’t we all just want to get rid of the chicken feathers around us and find our fantasy world through social media? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Properly withdrawing from real life, relaxing and letting yourself go is harmless and beneficial. The way of civility and martial arts is to relax. However, escaping from real life is not advisable. You cannot live a failed life in the real world and become a great hero in the virtual world. Those who &quot;abandon treatment&quot; in the real world will find it difficult to &quot;resurrect with full health&quot; in the virtual world. If the virtual world becomes an anesthetic for you to escape from real life, it will only amplify and intensify your failures in real life. Every time you log off the Internet and return to reality, you will face endless spiritual emptiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Needless to say, real life means daily necessities, responsibilities and pressure. We can take a break from stress, but eventually we have to face it. It is better to face it sooner rather than later. The vast majority of parents cannot support you for a lifetime, and the idea of ​​&quot;full-time children&quot; is just self-deception. A person&#39;s growth, a person&#39;s spiritual growth into a qualified adult, fundamentally lies in stimulating one&#39;s inner motivation and courage, using one&#39;s natural talents and acquired abilities, claiming one&#39;s own responsibilities, and doing one&#39;s own business. If you take it up, the reward is the unparalleled sense of accomplishment when you accomplish something, and a mentally stronger self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the vast majority of people who need to fight in the real world, social media should be an adjuvant and a snack, not an anesthetic and a meal. From the perspective of receiving effective information, social media should not be fully committed to delivery. Some social media have reached the pinnacle of deliberately creating &quot;information cocoons&quot;. For the same news event or hot post, the comment areas for men and women can be completely different to accurately cater to your thoughts, or to be precise. How can you not be afraid of controlling your cognition? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, what social media brings to you, whether you dominate it or it dominates you, fundamentally depends on your independent choice and how you use it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从卖寿衣到“古装大佬”，它凭什么抢占了半壁戏服江山？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257711]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cao County has always produced coffins and shrouds, monopolizing 90% of Japan&#39;s The coffin market above.

Photo provided by interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case of 18 people who were convicted of privately building a pontoon that once attracted widespread attention has made new progress. On September 27, 2023, the Baicheng Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Jilin Province made a retrial decision, believing that the original judgment was indeed erroneous in the application of law and met the conditions for retrial, and decided to bring the case to Baicheng Intermediate People&#39;s Court for trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The criminal verdict of the Taonan City People&#39;s Court shows that from 2005 to 2018, Huang Deyi and others secretly traveled along the Taoer River from Zhenlin Village, Wafang Town, Taonan City to Ping&#39;an Village, Ping&#39;an Town, Taobei District, Baicheng City. Build a hull pontoon bridge, intercept passing vehicles and collect bridge tolls. The toll is 5 yuan for a small car and 10 yuan for a large car, totaling 52,950 yuan. For the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, Huang Deyi was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years. Another 17 relatives were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one year to three months in prison, all with suspended sentences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A legal person close to the case told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;According to our country&#39;s judicial practice, the court is very cautious in initiating retrials and usually undergoes very strict review.&quot; The legal person analyzed that correcting the original judgment There are two possibilities, one is not guilty, the other is a reduced sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Retrial decision letter.

Respondents provided&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Whether it is a forced request&quot; or the focus of the retrial&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The original judgment was indeed wrong in applying the law&quot; mentioned in the retrial decision, analyzed by the above-mentioned legal experts , according to the judicial interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, to constitute the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, there must be certain hooligan motives and coercive objective behavior, and disrupt social order. The focus of the retrial of the case will be on whether Huang Deyi&#39;s relevant behavior constitutes the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, that is, whether Huang Deyi has the subjective intention to commit the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble and the objective behavior of forcing others to do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Therefore, the focus of the retrial may be on whether Huang Deyi had objective behavior of forcing others to cross the bridge. Specifically, whether Huang Deyi forced others to cross the bridge.” The legal person believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter in July 2023, Huang Deyi explained that the reason for building the pontoon bridge was because his family had land on the other side of the river, and at the same time, his ancestors were boat builders. Huang Deyi said that the charging standard of &quot;5 yuan for a small car and 10 yuan for a large car&quot; was determined after discussion with the villagers crossing the bridge. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/252355&quot;>;Village Bully Involved in Gangs , destroy lanes, return bridge tolls? Those convicted of building bridges respond to the controversy&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are different opinions in previous media reports regarding Huang Deyi’s claim that there is no mandatory toll. . In July 2023, Gu Tianfu, the party secretary of An&#39;an Village, which is only separated by a river from Zhenlin Village, said in an interview with the media that Huang Deyi had deliberately dug up the river channel, so that villagers passing by had to walk across his bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment determined that the amount of charges was 52,950 yuan. In previous interviews with Southern Weekend reporters, many villagers claimed that it was more than this amount. A villager who had also built a pontoon bridge on the Taoer River estimated that the amount built by Huang Deyi The fees charged by the pontoons may amount to millions of dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the determination of the amount to be collected will have an impact on the retrial judgment, the above-mentioned legal experts analyzed that the retrial decision stated that the original trial was an error in the application of the law, and the retrial stage should focus on the application of the law. &quot;This case is not a crime of amount. Whether Huang Deyi constitutes a crime and the sentencing has no absolute correspondence with the amount.&quot; At the same time, Article 469 of the Interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that, except for the protest of the People&#39;s Procuratorate, the retrial shall generally not increase the penalty of the defendant in the original trial. &quot;From this point of view, it is unlikely that Huang Deyi will be given a heavier sentence in the retrial.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the criminal verdict of the Taonan City People&#39;s Court, in addition to building a pontoon bridge, Huang Deyi also organized 17 relatives to guard the bridge. If any of the other 17 people involved in the bridge guarding case engaged in forcible behavior, would it have an impact on the case and Huang Deyi? The above-mentioned legal person said that if others forcefully demand it, he himself may not commit a crime because there is no intention to commit a crime together, but the premise is that Huang Deyi himself does not know about this behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The new bridge will be completed and opened to traffic at the end of October&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to the case itself, the &quot;floating bridge imprisonment&quot; has attracted attention, and the travel needs of villagers have also attracted local attention. In July 2023, &quot;Taonan Release&quot; issued an article stating that it plans to build a convenience bridge near the original pontoon bridge, which will be completed before the autumn harvest. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/252709&quot;>;Struggles for land, crossing rivers And bridge demolition: the dilemma of 11 illegal floating bridges behind the &quot;privately built floating bridges&quot; case&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Southern Weekend reporters, the location of the convenience bridge was not in the original Near the floating bridge, it was built in Yushu Village, Fushun Town, about ten kilometers downstream. On September 30, Yushu Village Party Secretary Wang Zuoxiang told Southern Weekend reporters that the reason why the Bianmin Bridge was built near Yushu Village was because the river surface in this section is narrower than that in other places. Other river surfaces on the Taoer River are four to five hundred meters long. Width, &quot;Our place is more than 200 meters wide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the river narrow and it is easy to build a bridge, it is also because it is at the &quot;center point&quot;. There are two rivers in Taonan, the Taoer River and the Jiaoliu River. About 67 administrative villages are distributed on both sides of the two rivers. Before the new convenience bridge was built, there were only three bridges on the 156-kilometer-long Taoer River, namely No. 1 Bridge, Manchudai Bridge and Zhenxi Bridge. Wang Zuoxiang said, &quot;The bridge is located here and can be accessed from both the north and the south. After the bridge is repaired, it will be about 20 kilometers away from the Manchudai Bridge and about 35 kilometers away from the Zhenxi Bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public signboard for the project It shows that &lt;a>;&lt;/a>;&lt;a>;the newly built convenience bridge is made of steel plate material, with a length of 327 meters and a width of 5 meters. The investment is 6.852 million yuan, and the planned completion time is October 31, 2023. &lt;/a>;Wang Zuo Xiangxiang, the local autumn harvest begins in mid-October every year. &quot;Now our Taonan side has basically completed the construction, and the bridge deck has been paved.&quot; However, because the Taoer River built by the Convenience Bridge is the dividing line, one bank is Taonan City, and the other side belongs to Taobei District, Baicheng City. On September 30, Wang Zuoxiang told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;There is a branch of the river in Taobei District, about 50 meters wide, which has not been repaired yet. Now the bridge is a Duantou Bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taonan A staff member of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee told a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;The situation I know currently is that they are accelerating the construction of the bridge. The main body of the bridge has been basically completed. The &#39;Duetou Bridge&#39; is the approach bridge to the other side. In the process of our bridge construction, It must be guaranteed. If the project is started and implemented, it can be completed in two or three days. It is not very complicated. There is definitely no problem with the bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zuoxiang believes that after the convenience bridge is completed, It will definitely be more convenient for people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. But he has new worries. He believes that after the bridge is completed, there will be a lot of vehicles coming and going, and his Yushu Village is only about 3 kilometers away from the convenience bridge. The vehicles entering and exiting will &quot;clearly use our village&quot; and will crush the village. There is a 4-meter-wide cement road, and the risk factor for villagers&#39; travel has also become higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He hopes that the relevant departments can repair the damaged roads in the village in the future, and at the same time, set up signs at the intersections around the convenience bridge, such as marking intersections or T-shaped intersections. &quot;I am the head of a village, and I have to be responsible for the safety of the villagers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[规避现代认知框架的陷阱：读葛兆光老师序言有感]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257798]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/XpeYfU92LInHlfvSMnOs1PA617EDgUhWQU0xWSXD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;910&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/XpeYfU92LInHlfvSMnOs1PA617EDgUhW QU0xWSXD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bao Gangsheng has two works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had time to read Teacher Bao Gangsheng’s new book &quot;Confucianism, Legalism and Taoism: Political Imagination in Early China&quot; (Guangxi Normal University Press, 2023), just after reading the preface by teacher Ge Zhaoguang, I felt that this book must be very interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have read Bao Gangsheng&#39;s &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot; (Peking University Press, 2015) and his works on democracy. I do not study political science, but am interested in discourse analysis, so the so-called Reading is just a superficial reading out of curiosity about political science discourse, especially the cognitive evolution of terminology and the presentation of discourse. Bao Gangsheng’s academic foundation and keen awareness of issues are absolutely top-notch. Just because I read his &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot;, I am full of expectations for his new book, but I also have some mixed thoughts about what Teacher Ge said in the preface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Ge is positive about Bao Gangsheng’s approach to the history of ancient thought from the perspective of modern political science, and believes that this is promoting the dialogue between Western theory and Eastern thought. He believes that it is meaningful to re-examine ancient thoughts from the perspective of modern political science. I completely agree with this, but I feel that in doing so, we must avoid the traps of modern cognitive frameworks. Cognitive frames have many functions, one of which is what William James called &quot;selective attention.&quot; One consequence of selective attention is that we pay too much attention to the similarities or differences between the objects being observed, ignoring the fundamental differences or similarities between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Give an example. When Bao Gangsheng introduced China&#39;s political outlook in &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot;, he mentioned three different political outlooks, one is modern, one is ancient, and there is also the Soviet model, that is, class rule. Let&#39;s not talk about this for now. . In the words of Bao Gangsheng, in the ancient political view, &quot;politics&quot; &quot;is most commonly understood to refer to the activities of the monarch and his ministers in ruling the country and governing society.&quot; Simply put, it actually means &quot;monarchy.&quot; According to Bao Gangsheng’s explanation, the modern political outlook is “the Chinese translation of English politics” and is a foreign concept. He quoted Sun Yat-sen&#39;s view that &quot;the management of people&#39;s affairs is politics.&quot; There is another sentence before: &quot;Government is a matter for everyone.&quot; Therefore, the politics in Sun Yat-sen&#39;s mind is &quot;administering political affairs by the people&quot;, which is the so-called &quot;democracy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to teacher Gao Quanxi in the book &quot;Modern Western Political Thought&quot;, the ancient Western monarchy is completely different from the ancient Chinese monarchy. If Bao Gangsheng’s summary and Gao Quanxi’s statement hold true, “monarchy” politics and “civil rights” politics are different concepts and belong to different cognitive frameworks with essential conflicts. Western &quot;monarchy&quot; theory and ancient Chinese &quot;monarchy&quot; or &quot;royal power&quot; also belong to different cognitive categories. According to the most basic assumptions of discourse analysis, terms generated by different cognitive frameworks and categories belong to different semantic fields and form different semantic relationships with related words. Two questions arise: 1) Is it appropriate to use different cognitive frameworks to explain political concepts expressed in the same text? 2) Is it appropriate to use words with different semantic relationships to explain the same term? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why I have such doubts is because there are many such examples in &quot;Political Science&quot; that I think are specious. For example, &quot;Confucius believed that politics should be upright. If the king above is upright, the people will be upright.&quot; When commenting on the concept of Confucius, Bao Gangsheng mentioned &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; written by Adam Smith. He seemed to think that &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot; are synonymous with Confucius&#39; &quot;rectitude&quot;, as if It is said that Confucius&#39; &quot;benevolent government&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot; are highly similar to Adam Smith&#39;s moral outlook. Is it really like this? Is Confucius&#39;s moral outlook centered on &quot;royal power&quot; and based on the differential order pattern the same as Adam Smith&#39;s moral outlook based on the concept of equality centered on &quot;civil rights&quot;? If traditional ethics are virtues, then why did Lu Xun think that ethics cannibalize people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example, &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot; is based on Han Fei&#39;s &quot;The master of the Ming Dynasty guides his ministers with only two handles. The two handles are the virtue of punishment. What is the virtue of punishment?&quot; Killing is called punishment, celebrating reward is called virtue.&quot; This passage makes the following judgment: &quot;The principle here is close to the management philosophy of modern industrial and commercial organizations, that is, organizational management should pay attention to clear rewards and punishments.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t understand the philosophy of modern industrial and commercial organization management. Is such a simple principle of clear rewards and punishments the fundamental principle of modern industrial and commercial organization management philosophy? Are the premise of this principle for industrial and commercial organizations to be the same as Han Fei’s? What are the standards of modern principles? What are its basic assumptions? Do the two involve the same semantic relationship? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same section, the author draws this conclusion based on Han Fei&#39;s &quot;If a person does not die, the coffin will not be bought. Love does not mean hating people, but benefits from people&#39;s death&quot;: &quot;In fact , Han Fei had a perspective similar to Adam Smith more than 2,000 years ago, and he had elaborated the &#39;economic man&#39; hypothesis and the methodology of individualism to a certain extent.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;As an economic concept, doesn’t “economic man” have different basic premises and presuppositions? Is the core semantic term of &quot;individualism&quot; as an ism just &quot;profit&quot;? Are their semantic fields the same as Han Fei&#39;s? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw Teacher Ge’s high-level summary of some of the book’s viewpoints in the preface, such as “summarizing Taoism using methodism, weakness, inaction, and abandonment of wisdom.” Based on past readings, I even had the idea You shouldn’t have unreasonable doubts if you haven’t read the original work. I don’t know how the discussion of the book unfolded. Taoism&#39;s &quot;following the Tao, being weak, doing nothing, abandoning wisdom&quot; all have their own specific historical context and intertextual relationship. Is the &quot;wisdom&quot; mentioned in &quot;Qi Zhi&quot; a general sense? In terms of semantic relationship, can &quot;abandoning wisdom&quot; be separated from &quot;extreme sage&quot;? Although the political thought of Taoism is mentioned in academic circles, those who do not talk about &quot;governance&quot; but pursue &quot;governing by doing nothing&quot; and do not talk about &quot;law&quot; but hope for &quot;a world of supreme virtue&quot; generally use &quot;quan&quot; as the core meaning. Xiang’s “political thought”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Teacher Ge’s perspective in writing the preface is different. He criticized that &quot;some people always want to advocate &amp;nbsp;&#39;interpret China by China&#39;&quot;, meaning that these people attempt to study ancient Chinese thought in isolation from the world&#39;s modern pluralistic knowledge system. I totally agree with this. I think of Takeuchi&#39;s &quot;Asia as Method&quot; and Maruyama Masao&#39;s &quot;China as Method.&quot; The methods they advocate do not exclude the world&#39;s diverse knowledge systems. They just hope to use China&#39;s historical experience and traditional thoughts as one of the world&#39;s cognitive systems and methods. The reason why those advocates of &quot;explaining China in terms of China&quot; are problematic may be because they want to break away from the world&#39;s diverse knowledge system and develop a system that only they (here, they themselves) understand, and cannot communicate with others because they ignore consensus. The mystical explanation system of dialogue; or because its purpose is not to explain China in terms of &quot;China&quot;, but to explain China from the perspective of traditional &quot;rulers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Ge is right in criticizing that these people always want to &quot;advocate going back to ancient times&quot; to find a &quot;whole must and tail&quot; explanation system. If these people have any basic respect for common sense, they should know that they cannot go back after receiving modern education. According to the basic assumptions of pragmatics, the context on which cognition is generated is not reality, but a construction, which is the result of selecting specific parameters. The so-called ancient context is actually a modern construction they made for a special purpose and based on their chosen cognitive framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, what Teacher Ge said: modern concepts and re-division and integration, &quot;allowing the originally chaotic ancient culture to present an understandable face&quot; should refer to allowing ancient culture to be understood in the modern cognitive environment. However, any contemporary &quot;rediscovery&quot; of ancient documents is actually a cognitive reconstruction of ancient times based on modern knowledge or experience. Therefore, how close this understanding is to the original face of the research object also depends on different perceptions. Know the choice of framework. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course I am not opposed to re-examining ancient ideas from the perspective of modern political science to present different modern understandings. I just want to say that the premise of this kind of review is that we cannot ignore the historical semantic fields and semantic relationships of various conceptual systems, and we cannot cut them off to suit their needs. What cannot be forgotten is that the reason why we can find modern elements in ancient concepts, that is, the so-called &quot;ancient concepts&quot;, is more because we have replaced the cognitive framework and placed related concepts in different semantics. field, a new semantic relationship is constructed based on the new semantic field. But because the words are still words from the past, it is very easy to mistake our construction for the original semantic items of these words. This is what I think is the trap of modern cognitive frameworks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book &quot;Political Science&quot; actually has a clear understanding of the differences in historical semantics. As the book points out, ancient Greece, the source of Western political science, had a fundamentally different view of politics: “In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, politics was the governance and management activities in which citizens of the city-state participated. The concept of politics at that time itself included citizen participation. The meaning of city-state affairs. Only the participation of citizens in the governance and management of city-state affairs can be called politics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, although the political words of &quot;royal power&quot; and &quot;civil rights&quot; have not changed, they Do they belong to the same semantic field? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had the chance to read &quot;Confucianism, Legalism and Taoism: Political Imagination in Early China&quot;. &amp;nbsp;These are at best a record of random thoughts caused by reading the preface of the book posted online. I will wait until I have time to read it. , be sure to read the original work carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 18:25:27 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[哪些孩子需要课外培训？我在高考大省的观察]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258018]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 16:57:11&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, Professor Shen Yan of Peking University HSBC Business School published a paper in Economics (Quarterly) entitled &quot;Education Burden Reduction, Family Education Expenditure and Educational Equity&quot; paper. The author uses the China Family Panel Study (CFPS) survey data of 14,960 households in 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country from 2010 to conduct empirical analysis on a total of 42,590 individuals to evaluate the overall impact of burden reduction policies on students&#39; academic burden and family financial burden. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the results of the paper, students from families with incomes in the bottom 10% have an average probability of entering high school that has dropped by 9.3%, total education expenditures have dropped by an average of 21%, and weekly study time has dropped by an average of 9.19 hours. . For students from families with incomes in the upper 10%, the probability of entering high school has increased by 5.3 percentage points on average, total education expenditures have increased by 67% on average, and study time per week has increased by 10.37 hours on average. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The overall conclusion is: first, the previous burden reduction policy has brought about the differentiation of educational output, increasing the probability of students from high-income families entering high school, while the probability of students from low-income families declining; Second, the burden reduction policy has also led to the differentiation of education investment: on the one hand, the education expenditure and student learning time of high-income families have both increased, while the low-income families have experienced a decrease; on the other hand, families with high investment in the early stage will reduce their family education expenditure. And low-investment families will increase their education expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This conclusion is simply that children from high-income families invest more in educational expenditures and educational time, and the results are better. Children from low-income families, on the other hand, experience a decline in financial resources, time, and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be said that this research is basically consistent with my observations around me. I live in Shandong, which is a province with a large population and a high level of college entrance examination. The difficulty of the college entrance examination also falls into the &quot;hell mode&quot;. In such a general environment, it is impossible to be completely &quot;flat&quot; on education issues. Parents attach great importance to education and examinations, and basically spare no effort in investing in education within their capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an English training institution downstairs from my house. Although it is not as well-known as New Oriental and Xueersi, the management is generally quite formal and the student pool is decent. Many children have signed up there. The &quot;double reduction&quot; policy was introduced and business resumed after a period of suspension. This kind of reopening is also compliant, because the &quot;double reduction&quot; has a series of clear requirements for off-campus training, as long as you fully cooperate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, except for those places in the country where the college entrance examination is in the &quot;easy mode&quot;, many places are facing the pressure of competition for higher education. In these places, even people in the education authorities are also faced with the education problems of their own children. They still have some understanding of the actual situation at the grassroots level, so with a pragmatic and people-oriented attitude, some management aspects that are more humane can play a certain buffering role during the implementation of the policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reopening, prices have generally increased. For old customers, with various discounts, prices are basically the same as before. For new customers, the price has increased compared to before. Moreover, if you choose to pay fees for one year before, you can enjoy certain discounts. However, according to the latest regulatory requirements, you can only pay fees for one quarter at a time, and the discounts are no longer available. In fact, it is also a disguised form of payment. Price increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My eldest child is 11 years old this year, and my second child is 6 years old. One is in sixth grade and the other is in first grade. My child&#39;s classmates have previously enrolled in various cram schools, including mathematics, English, composition, etc. Of course, there are also those who don’t enroll in any classes. The overall situation is that those who used to enroll in various classes are still enrolling now, and I haven’t heard of a decrease. I used to rush to events on weekends, but I still rush now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of &quot;double reduction&quot; is to reduce the burden on families and children. However, the specific situation in each province and each region is somewhat different. In a province with a large population like Shandong, the pressure of competition in the college entrance examination will be passed down through the layers. Although parents also hope that their children can develop in an all-round way, they do not dare to take the scores lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents of several children get together, the focus of the chat will easily fall on the issue of future studies. Not only the college entrance examination, but also the previous high school entrance examination, high school and junior high school school selection and other issues. A very real problem is that although academic performance is downplayed in policy, most parents still focus on performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not all children who need tutoring are suitable for tutoring. Top academics are never taught. Academic champions generally have strong self-learning ability and self-motivation. They don&#39;t need to make up lessons, and it can even be said that their level may be better than the teacher&#39;s. It is a waste of time and money for top students to make up lessons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;stupid students&quot; do not need to make up lessons. The diversity of this person and society must be recognized. Just as not everyone is suitable for scientific research, many children are not suitable for learning book knowledge and Test taking. Of course, this does not mean that they are really stupid, but it means that learning book knowledge is too difficult for them. There is not much difference between making up lessons and not making up lessons, so there is no need to spend money and time on it. . Those who are at the middle level and have the motivation to make progress will see results after just a little supplement. This group of students needs supplementary lessons the most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, it is to improve grades, and on the other hand, it is to let children know that grades can be improved by working hard, and work can be done well by working hard. In my opinion, the learning process is also a process of building self-confidence and responsibility. Improving grades is important, and self-training and self-growth during the learning process are also important, or even more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我与白塔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257994]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/bs57e1x4IQJ6KraNGzDhWuiQBUA9SVAGzsL5VDqO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/bs57e1x4IQJ6KraNGzDhWuiQBUA9SVAG zsL5VDqO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252400&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Children feeling the winter snow under the white tower&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;（&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaaaaa;&quot;>;Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a person from a small town in the northeastern border, I have a close relationship with the White Tower in Beijing What&#39;s the fate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who has lived in Beijing for a long time has his or her own feelings and memories about this city, and more or less longing for it. That year, when the lease of my studio in Wangjing came to an end, I tried to find a house in the alleys of the old city, thinking that this would be closer to the nobility and wealth of the city and would be conducive to new development. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;先去了后海和护国寺，再找遍了东直门和东四，几经辗转又来到白塔寺，终于寻到一处合适的房子。中介与房东阿姨谈好了价格，我想回去考虑一下再决定。刚转身没走远，房东突然出来叫住我，说家里老人想再聊聊。原来大爷偶然听我说起了故乡，而他年轻时曾下放到那里做教师。大爷的表情折射出那段经历对他的特殊意义，我在他眼神里看到了一丝他乡遇故知的唏嘘。老人拉着我详细询问了家乡现在的状况，大大小小，不厌其烦。因为这意外的缘分，房子很快就定了下来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或许，一个人最初出发的地方会在冥冥之中赋予人生以底色，决定人生的某些选择。有些关口单靠人力无法强行扭转，勉强为之，多是徒劳；而顺其自然，随遇而安，却能见到柳暗花明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就这样，我与白塔的缘分拉开了序幕，心中的那座白塔也逐渐清晰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/jEn7Z0GY4C23HpNmcwD6YDqlDfw3Kaj5egrhQCDq.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;工作室在二层，窗户正对着白塔。朝阳升起，把金色铺满窗台；日头低垂，则在纱窗上投下树叶的影子。屋里摆着一座断臂的维纳斯雕像，听大爷讲，是一位工艺美院的画家租客留下的。雕像与白塔经常出现在同一画面中，光影在两者之间流淌，咏叹四季的变换。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6NdsISkOezbywy1NFtuk6TR9j6tOavRRu9rtt8LO.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;夏天多雨。不像南方的绵绵细雨，这里即使到了雨季，下起雨来也是欢快热烈的，转瞬即收。有时走着走着突然赶上一场骤雨，硕大的雨点打得树叶哗哗响、屋瓦啪啪响，行人都慌不择路地跑起来，寻找躲雨的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秋天真好啊。只有到了秋天，这里才完全展示出她的美。每一条胡同，每一家的门洞里、阳台上、大门两旁都摆满了各种各样的花草，点缀出一幅色彩斑斓的画卷，掩映着碧蓝的天空。那情景也许只有老舍先生的《北平的秋》能诠释得尽了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冬天又是一番风景。一场大雪仿佛把时光拉回到一百年前，白茫茫中分不清南北东西，依稀可见那个大师云集的北平。人们都闭门不出，我却跑到风雪中，用相机捕捉这个穿越了的黑白世界。雪后冰消，鲁迅的家又变回了他的纪念馆，我又回到了现实，回到了北京的白塔下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/T3moYVA9HC1x8ARXk9h7C6nvofjUhGIKDPF7LT9Q.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;微博上有人吐槽起国庆节扎堆的婚礼，瞬间引发了网络热议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，当宾客被份子钱等“红色炸弹”轰炸时，新郎新娘也因喜糖喜饼陷入了纠结。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近日，#精心挑选的喜糖被说差劲#冲上热搜，如何准备喜糖的话题引发热议。有网友精心准备了自己爱吃的小零食，如亲嘴烧、蒟蒻果冻等作为喜糖，被质疑这样的喜糖过分差劲。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不知何时开始，“沾沾喜气”的喜糖走向了内卷赛道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，中国喜糖市场短兵相接、两派分立。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一派是专注喜糖领域的企业，如爱哆哆等；另一派则是传统糖果企业，如德芙、徐福记等。专注喜糖的企业从定制化以及包装上发力，传统糖果企业则主打国民度和性价比。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比以前祖父母辈的婚礼以包装简单的水果糖、奶糖为主，如今高端化的喜糖是当代新人的选择，比如他们会选用5元1粒的歌帝梵巧克力彰显品位——如今，定制化、个性化、高端成为了喜糖的关键词。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;受喜糖驱动，喜铺近年来也迅猛发展，目前全国各地规模以上的喜铺有22000余家，南方喜铺文化盛行，占到了全国的六成，北方的喜糖则习惯于从糖果批发市场、大卖场、网上购买，喜铺尚有待发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎堆的婚礼背后，是连番轰炸的“红色炸弹”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数据显示，上海、浙江等地的份子钱平均为1000元，而一向只是主张讨个彩头的广东人，平均份子钱只有100元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一边在豪掷“千金”随礼，另一边则在豪掷万元办婚礼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，近九成的中国新人都为婚礼花费了5万元以上，甚至还有0.4%的新人花费超过50万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，个性化的婚礼，比如“物哀感”婚礼、碳中和婚礼等也成了年轻人的新选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，“知道”就跟你聊聊关于喜糖与份子钱那些结婚的甜蜜烦恼。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;而我在上一篇文章中提出的解释是：正如旧社会的货郎能言善辩，在走街串巷的过程中无论潜在客户买与不买，都能让对方心情舒畅一样。在现代社会中，像李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”向其粉丝提供的绝不仅仅是眉笔、粉饼和口红，还有情绪价值，而后者甚至比实际的货物更重要。 （建立链接：《在“知心闺蜜”恶语相向之前：李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”何以逆势成功？》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，在一向用“所有女生”作为直播开场，用一口“闺蜜腔”把消费者捧在手心又哄上云端的“知心男闺蜜”在倦怠中突然爆发，对消费者开始“奋斗教育”的时候，其本人被情绪价值“断供”的消费者们推入舆论的漩涡也是意料之中的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以说，“情绪价值”不仅是李佳琦从商业帝国的云端到舆论漩涡的风口的关键要素，也是“赛博货郎”这一职业在现代社会赖以生存的根源。实际上这个概念早已超越了直播电商这个行业，泛滥在这个社会的各个领域之中，在职场中要讲“情绪价值”，在恋爱中也要讲“情绪价值”，甚至在家庭生活中也要讲“情绪价值”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，这个人人都想要，在商品交易活动中比商品本身还重要的“情绪价值”究竟是个什么东西？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;成人世界的心灵奶嘴&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;与绝大多数人的直观印象相反，情绪价值（Emotional Value）这个看起来非常像心理学术语的名词其实是一个彻头彻尾的营销学概念，其本身的含义是指在营销的过程中，情绪受益和情绪成本之间的差值。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简单地讲，在一次购物中，无论交易是否最终达成，只要销售方提供给消费者的积极情绪体验大于消极体验，消费者就获得了正面情绪价值，这是一个对销售方有利的结果。而反之，如果消费者获得了负面情绪价值，对销售方则是不利的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在销售行业中，情绪价值理论经常被用于销售流程设计与优化、指导销售人员培训，用于为客户提供更好的消费体验，以及潜在客户的转化与固定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而正如前文所提到的那样，在当今社会，无论是“情绪价值”这个概念还是情绪价值理论本身，都被大大的滥用了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几乎在所有的社会人际交往领域，人们对“情绪价值”的需求都在变得越来越迫切和强烈，在某流行社交APP上，随处可见因索取情绪价值不及预期而提出的各种抱怨：上司无法提供情绪价值、同事无法提供情绪价值、恋爱/婚姻对象无法提供情绪价值、父母无法提供情绪价值，甚至偶有交集的陌生人无法提供情绪价值的抱怨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这里，“情绪价值”从一个营销学理念变成了一种能力，一种能用语言让人感到“心情舒畅”的能力。无论这种语言是不是理性思维的结果，也不管其说辞是否符合客观事实，只要能够让人感到“心情舒畅”，就是具备了“提供情绪价值”的能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在生活中惯于向他人索取“情绪价值”的人有一个共同的特点，就是不管自己是否具备这种能力，但一定要求对方具备这种能力。一边在公共生活中寸步不让，一边又抱怨他人无法提供足够的情绪价值。这种既强横又脆弱，既要索取又不愿付出的心态，在社会公共生活中形成了一个又一个易燃易爆的火药桶，随时随地爆炸在他们失去奶嘴的瞬间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，一个显而易见的事实是，在现代社会中，信息技术和通信技术将个体越来越紧密地联系在一起的同时，不断解体的共同体也让个体变得越来越孤独，人们最终成为了汉娜•阿伦特所说的那种“原子化个体”——他们或许排列得非常紧密，但又同时彼此孤立。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种“喧闹的孤独”使原子化的个体通常将物质享受置于极高的地位，以此缓解和慰藉精神上的孤独，相应的，这种个体在心理上的脆弱也驱使其无休止地向外界索取所谓“情绪价值”，因此现代社会中泛滥的情绪价值，早已从一个营销概念变成成人世界里的心灵奶嘴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;巧言令色的谎言天堂&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;正如在“赛博货郎”用“家人们”“女王们”构筑的商业帝国里，情绪价值的重要性超过商品本身一样，泛滥在社会其他领域的“情绪价值”也超过了理性、逻辑和客观事实本身。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，在公共事务的讨论中，随处可见的“抛开事实不谈，难道XXX没有错吗”话术正是这种心态的绝佳例子，完全不顾客观事实，也不考虑自身的思维逻辑是否存在问题（抑或根本没有逻辑），只要对方让自己感到主观上的不舒服，那就是没有提供“情绪价值”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当某个个体将“情绪价值”作为社会生活的最高目标，泛滥的、无度的情绪索求必然在无形中消磨和摧毁了他们基于理性和逻辑进行思考和表达的能力。所谓的“思考”变成了一种“没有奶嘴就要闹”的动物性的条件反射。而所谓的“表达”统统都是堆积情绪的宣泄，人们无法进行任何有意义的讨论，因为所有基于事实的讨论都将偏离其本来的轨道，终结于一场歇斯底里的胡搅蛮缠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个充斥着这样个体的社会，必然是一个“人人脆弱，个个待哄”由“6岁256个月的孩子们”组成的幼稚园，也自然会成为各种巧言令色的骗子如鱼得水的谎言天堂。对某些人来说，“杀猪盘”里甜言蜜语的网络异性，显然比现实中“低情商”的交往对象能提供更高的“情绪价值”。对老人来说，天天围在身边打转，满口“爸爸妈妈”的保健品贩子，显然比一个月回来一次，三两句话就不耐烦的亲生儿女更能提供“情绪价值”。最终，一个“总要有人哄着你”的社会，必然变成“总有一款骗子适合你”的社会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;调节自身情绪的能力是生活在现代社会中成年人的基本能力，人的情绪受到他人影响而产生波动是正常现象，但如果一个成年人的情绪完全由他人提供和控制，那么他只能是一个生理学意义上的成年人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;社会现代化的过程不可逆，在社会现代化过程中出现的个体原子化、精神孤独脆弱、心理低幼化等问题，不可能通过重构“鸡犬相闻”的前现代社会解决。现代化导致的问题，最终的出路还是现代化本身。从“情绪价值”这个切面，我们看到了一个需要正视也亟待解决的“现代性危机”。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 22, 1993, &quot;The Fragrant Soul Girl&quot; directed by Xie Fei and Li &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; directed by An jointly won the Golden Bear Award at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei spends a lot of time in film festivals of all sizes every year. After the epidemic, he can only When participating in the film festival in China, he thought that the directors of his generation were nearly eighty years old and had not participated in social activities for many years. He asked the film festival: Can some old filmmakers be invited? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This group of &quot;senior moviegoers&quot; has become a unique sight at the 2021 First Youth Film Festival and Pingyao Film Festival. Xie Fei and his classmates were mostly film graduates in the 1960s and are representatives of China&#39;s fourth generation of directors. They call the beautiful years of making movies the &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;. Xie Fei explained, &quot;When we were filming the first and second movies, we were very young, even naive, but we had something sincere in it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Today, most of their lives have nothing to do with movies. 79-year-old Xie Fei is busy sorting out his parents&#39; information during their lifetimes. A few years ago, he published family letters for his father and is now sorting out his diaries. His goal is to complete them all before the age of 85, otherwise &quot;if you are confused and unable to do it in the future, you will regret it.&quot; Others praised him for his good health and that he should continue to make movies, but he disagreed. In addition to movies, there are many important things in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He publishes film reviews on Douban every now and then, and is known as &quot;the biggest film critic.&quot; His vision of watching movies is very broad, and he has to check out the latest movies, popular online dramas, and even popular animations. The Japanese science fiction anime &quot;Evangelion: The Movie: Finale&quot; has a Douban score of 9.2. Before watching this movie, Xie Fei deliberately made up for its more than 20 years of animation history, but he still felt &quot;confused. Can’t understand”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, the Pingyao Film Festival replayed his 2000 work &quot;Yixi Dolma&quot;. Xie Fei marked the film as &quot;seen&quot; on Douban. Netizens replied below: Have you not only seen it? &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot; uses the life story of a Tibetan woman to reflect the changes in Tibet over half a century. Several Tibetan actors who were in their early twenties are now in their forties. Xie Fei invited them from Lhasa. They said that Lhasa is different now and more modern. Reviewing old works, Xie Fei was objective and confident: &quot;Although this movie has many shortcomings, it is not outdated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei&#39;s film career began after the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. He shot nine movies, &quot; &quot;Best Year&quot; and &quot;Scented Soul Girl&quot; won the Silver Bear Award and Golden Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. It was the prime year for Chinese-language films to emerge in the international film industry. In 1993, the Golden Bear Award was unexpectedly awarded with a &quot;double yolk egg&quot;. Xie Fei&#39;s &quot;Scented Soul Girl&quot; and Ang Lee&#39;s &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; won at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Yixi Dolma&quot;, 58-year-old Xie Fei announced that he would no longer make movies. He filmed two TV series. Later, in 2003, he was infected with SARS and was classified as a seriously ill patient in the hospital. After recovering, Xie Fei stopped filming completely and devoted himself entirely to teaching at the Beijing Film Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei admires his 83-year-old old classmate Ding Yinnan the most. He is good at making biopics such as &quot;Sun Yat-sen&quot; and &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot;. In 2015, he co-directed his latest work with his son. &quot;He still has a lot of plans, so he won&#39;t stop. His physical condition is very good now. As long as his son is with him, he can take pictures until he is 90 years old.&quot; Xie Fei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The representatives of American new Hollywood movies are about the same age as China’s fourth-generation directors. Martin Scorsese and Xie Fei are the same age, and they continue to create films at a rate of two to three years. Xie Fei wrote in a Douban film review, &quot;Envy, jealousy, but not hate. Everyone has his own destiny.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, 2021, Xie Fei accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend in the office of Beijing Film Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“You are not a real director if you don’t make three movies in a row”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the experience of veteran directors participating in the film festival this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We old comrades are very interested in watching the first and second movies made by these children in the digital age, including the later I have reviewed the award-winning films &quot;The Last Farewell&quot; and &quot;A Man&#39;s Funeral&quot; on Douban, and there are also some more traditional and solid films. And we found that such a folk film festival is doing very important work in supporting the growth of a new generation of young people. It was a very difficult process from graduating from undergraduate to graduate, shooting one or two short films, and then to making feature films. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, we were all in the era of planned economy. The biggest difference between us, apart from the difference between film and digital, was that we were assigned to traditional national studios after graduation. There will definitely be tasks in it. We will act as assistant directors and scene recorders, and let you direct independently when you have certain abilities. And the country will require: This movie is for comedy and to make money; that movie is about kung fu, you have to do it even if you don’t like it; this movie is something you can explore freely and consciously on your own. So at that time, we had better conditions for growth than young directors today. After graduation, many of us would become independent after working as assistant directors for five or eight years. After independence, everyone made one movie a year and two movies a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the studio at that time, if you had something you wanted to shoot What about movies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, you have to fight for the filming rights. For example, like the now famous director Li Shaohong, she was assigned to Beijing Film Studio after graduation. I was Xie Tieli&#39;s assistant director and worked as many assistant directors. But her first film must be one that makes money. So she made her first movie called &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;, which was a thriller and did well at the box office. After that, the factory believed in her, because a girl had made a good film independently, and she made the second film she wanted to make, called &quot;Bloody Morning&quot;, which is based on the Latin American fantasy novel &quot;A Pre-publicized Story&quot;. Adapted from &quot;Homicide&quot;. She transplanted it to rural China, and the final shot was wonderful. In the planned economic system, you also have to look for your opportunities. For example, director Ning Ying came back from studying in Italy. She has her own school of thought. However, her first film at the Beijing Film Studio was a romantic comedy called &quot;Someone Prefers to Fall in Love with Me&quot;. Then she could make &quot;Have Fun&quot; - an art film that she really wanted to make and that had won many awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this era, we see that digital technology has lowered the threshold for photography. As long as you have the desire for expression and talent, you can sometimes shoot what you like, and it is very formal. Innovative films and we greatly appreciate their creativity. But after these people make this film, if there is no market in the future, no one will invest in them, and many people will not be able to take on the second film. And directing is a practical art, especially when you are around thirty years old. If you don&#39;t make three movies in a row, you are not a real director. You only have one movie, you haven’t had a creative team for several years, and you have less experience. I have met many directors at First. They made a beautiful movie and won various awards, but after three to five years, they never made another movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are many young directors short-lived? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A lot. This is also (because) as freelancers now, in a commercial market-dominated situation, he must stubbornly only want to shoot his own things. He is not adapted to, does not know how to, and does not take the initiative to engage in entertainment and popular styles. Go and learn. Li Shaohong and Ning Ying, who I just talked about, have to force themselves to study well how to shoot entertainment films, comedies, and thrillers, and they will do well. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the current film ecosystem, what new directors face Are funding issues more difficult than they were then? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was not very difficult at the time. &quot;Black Stallion&quot; found many Hong Kong people to contribute money, which was actually only more than one million yuan. Because the market is small, we don’t need to invest so much. We don’t have any special technology or equipment, and they are all quite cheap. The most expensive one was the filming of &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot;. By 1999, the filming was completed for 4.5 million. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now it depends on the director. If you want hundreds of millions or tens of millions, of course it will be difficult. The key is that the producer only dares to invest if he thinks he can make money back. How much is invested and how much is recovered is the job of the producer, not the director. The director&#39;s job is to be artistically complete. If the producer thinks that your story and actors can only make 30 million at the box office, then your investment cannot exceed 10 million. However, whether this estimate is correct or not is the producer&#39;s job. Now it is wrong to say that everything is the responsibility of the director all day long. Movies are a comprehensive art, and the director did not say that he would definitely earn 100 million. If you insist that you can earn 100 million, if you invest lavishly, if you dare to shoot with 100 million, then the protagonist will not give up until he earns several million. Some of them are very unprofitable. You should blame the producer, not the director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was filming &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot;, when I started looking for money, I also thought that maybe using a star would make this movie better. I approached Gong Li, and Gong Li&#39;s producer said after watching it one day, who should she play in this drama? At first when I was in my twenties, and later when I was in my seventies, I couldn&#39;t rely on anyone and felt like I couldn&#39;t act. Later I discovered that this was impossible. One was that the original taste of Tibet was lost. I saw another group of actors in Lhasa, including old actors in their seventies and actors in their twenties, and they were suitable. It’s effortless. You were originally a subject of art films and suddenly wanted to enter the commercial market. This was a miscalculation. Fortunately for me, I didn&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Chinese films must be passed down from one generation to the next to have a bright future”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What old movies did you screen at the film festival? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Ding Yinnan’s &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot; was filmed in 1992, and it is now thirty years old. I very much hope that modern young audiences and The creators took a look at how our fourth generation represented the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and a great man like Zhou Enlai in the early 1990s, and how we reproduced China&#39;s reality and history. All of us old people rewatched &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot; together with the young people. It was all shot in real locations, because at that time, Deng Yingchao said that he wanted to shoot in the Prime Minister&#39;s original house, as long as you think it&#39;s artistically acceptable. Therefore, even the clothes and shoes worn by Zhou Enlai and the handkerchief he put in his pocket every day are real. The ward of Hospital 305 where Zhou Enlai was seriously ill was also the same. The restoration of the external texture is very wonderful. So today&#39;s young people, how do you use your methods to truly express and record the real life in China? This is your responsibility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Back then, it was a mission for these directors to make movies with the main theme ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s not a task, it’s their request. No movie is made to commemorate any festival. Because the education they have received since childhood is the education of revolutionary history, they feel that these are important great men. I personally think that the main theme is also the same. The key is how you shoot it and whether you respect the audience. Many reviews of some movies today just count the stars, not the historical figures of that time at all. What is very important is that the most sensational TV series this year was &quot;The Age of Awakening&quot;. I was very excited to watch it. It was very good. It reaffirmed the achievements of Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, and it was also presented in a more artistic way. Further down, &quot;Mountains and Seas&quot;, a TV series about poverty alleviation, starts from the trail and writes about a village very vividly. I think if the main melody is made according to the rules of art, it may be done well and the audience will like it. The audience may also be disgusted by competing for stars and scenes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of screening and watching these old movies today? What is the meaning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Our generation is still alive now, so if you can speak, speak as soon as possible. Next year I think I will hire the fifth generation if it doesn’t work out. Except for Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, most of the fifth generation are no longer on the front line, and they haven’t filmed in several years. Most of them are my students. Tian Zhuangzhuang is still filming. Recently, a film has not been cut out. Wu Ziniu has not filmed much anymore. In addition, Wang Jixing who filmed &quot;Jiao Yulu&quot; and Huang Jianxin have been doing it. Ye Daying filmed &quot;Jiao Yulu&quot; back then. &quot;Red Cherry&quot; was very sensational, and Mi Jiashan also filmed &quot;The Unruly Lord&quot;. If these films are taken out and watched today, young people will find them very vivid, and they never expected that they were so beautiful and had such pioneering consciousness and ideas. I personally feel that we need to understand the benefits of these works and the reasons of the times why they were produced. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese films must be passed down from generation to generation in order to have a bright future. For example, people of our generation watched the third generation and the second generation. The earliest ones include &quot;Street Angel&quot;, &quot;Cross Street&quot; and &quot;A River of Spring Flows East&quot;. The best tradition in the early days of Chinese films is realism, and family ethics dramas are particularly good. . Family ethics are placed in the context of the great times. You think of &quot;A River of Spring Flows East&quot;, which expresses the great times through family ethics and has become a Chinese movie classic. In the third generation, &quot;Furong Town&quot; directed by Xie Jin is also about the moral and ethical changes of the family. Therefore, the type of family ethics is something that has been very successful in Chinese film realism. We must inherit it now. We cannot simply reject it and think that family ethics is tacky and the love between children is not grand. Another example is the second and third generation of Chinese films. They created kung fu films based on Chinese martial arts. From &quot;The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple&quot; to &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; they have conquered the world. We young people can’t help but be interested, and we can’t understand that whether it’s an artistic film or a commercial film, it must be passed down. We don’t require everyone to cover everything, but we hope that there will be an inheritance as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the issue of inheritance? First of all, you need to watch movies that you have never seen and have forgotten. Your mind is filled with foreign things, especially some popular foreign movies. For example, in the Chinese theater industry, Western musicals have been praised over the years. I have seen it on Broadway several times. It is very popular, but it is very short and is far behind our operas. The opera actors have better kung fu than them. Much stronger. There are obviously such good operas in China, but they don&#39;t inherit or develop them. Instead, they just insist on reviving musicals in China. They have been doing it for 30 or 40 years. Do you think there is a mature one? Is there one that is loved by the wider music audience? Chinese film and television also have this problem. I watched Japan&#39;s &quot;Neon Evangelion&quot; the other day. I really didn&#39;t understand how great it was, including the recent &quot;Dune&quot;. This is the culture of foreigners, and they have had it for decades. If we Chinese are chasing these things to the death, you will never be able to make something that represents Chinese quality. When making movies in China, you have to learn things from the fourth generation, and even a lot of things from the third and second generations. You have only heard of &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot;. You need to take a closer look at why &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot; is rated so highly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What traditions of the fourth generation do you think are still relevant to today’s young filmmakers? Lost it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think what is very important is social thinking and cultural thinking. I think one of the biggest characteristics of the 1980s is that after &quot;Practice is the Only Criterion for Testing Truth&quot;, it caused the whole society to reflect on the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. Scar literature and scar movies were produced on the basis of reflection, and later, root-seeking appeared. In literature, we have to look for the reason and our bad nature from two thousand years of feudal culture, so many movies are adapted from these novels. The greatest advantage of our time was that our thoughts and creations advanced side by side and encouraged each other. The stagnation of thought can easily lead to the author&#39;s self-restraint, and the author has no choice but to write some self-expression of small favors, small grudges, and small disputes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/qEXM00Mnot1TgNA20aj93BJgsFbicHy87XI74aMt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/qEXM00Mnot1TgNA20aj93BJgsFbicHy87XI74aMt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173877&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xie Fei (left) and Jia Zhangke at the press conference of &quot;The Black Horse&quot; at the 3rd Pingyao International Film Festival on October 14, 2019. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Many movies that are considered classics in China have not been seen by Westerners. to”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why the fourth generation of movies seems to have less impact on young people Is it as big as the fifth generation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have a doctoral student who is a foreign girl. Her topic is the recommendation of Chinese films by the three major Western film festivals. In the Western world, film festivals have a strong value-added function. As long as this work is selected by a major film festival and enters the main competition, it will immediately rise to a level. If it wins the grand prize, many critics will want to see it, and in the end, it may become famous in historical circles. Consider it a classic. Before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, Chinese films were basically not produced in the West. &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; won the Golden Bear Award in Berlin in 1988. This was considered the first breakthrough. Zhang Yimou suddenly became famous all over the world, and then &quot;Qiu Ju&#39;s Lawsuit&quot; in 1992 &quot; and &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; in 1993. In the same year, all three major film festivals (awards) were won by Chinese films. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reputation of the fourth generation of directors is not as good as them, because they have continuity. Zhang Yimou later had a series of films that won awards at three major film festivals, as did Chen Kaige before and after, and they appeared in the theoretical circles The title of &quot;fifth generation&quot; was adopted, and the previous generations were deduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a student, I have read a lot of information about the three major film festivals. The third, fourth, and fifth generation films in the new era are all recognized by Westerners, but by some strange combination of circumstances, they all think they are fifth-generation films. generation. Xie Jin&#39;s &quot;Furong Town&quot; was wanted in Cannes after it was filmed in 1986. However, it was not given and was given to the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic. If he had gone to Cannes at that time, he might have won the award in 1986, and the third generation would have become extremely popular. Without the award, the West didn&#39;t talk much about the overall review. In fact, in the later retrospectives, the West highly praised &quot;Stage Sisters&quot; directed by Xie Jin and thought it was a very good director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a textbook used by many universities in the United States called &quot;Understanding Movies&quot;. It was published in the early 1980s. Every time it is reprinted, new movies will be added. There are now fourteen editions. There is only one movie from China, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. Other Asian films, such as several films by Japan&#39;s Akira Kurosawa and even older films by Rai from India, were considered classics by Westerners, and their reputation soared. As for Chinese films, the three major film festivals have made Westerners aware of some Chinese films. The final conclusion of this study is that Western films have a one-sided understanding of Chinese films. Many films that are considered classics in China have not been seen by Westerners, do not know them, and have not been evaluated. We Chinese think it is good, but some of them do not recognize it due to political reasons. For example, they don&#39;t watch these main theme works directed by Ding Yinnan, but actually ask us to watch them. They are already very good, not much worse than their &quot;General Patton&quot;, but there are political barriers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a very clear example. The Sixth Generation was not screened in China at the beginning, but Jia Zhangke became famous all over the world. When he was probably less than fifty years old, he was awarded Lifetime Achievement Awards by several international film festivals. I heard at that time that &quot;Three Gorges&quot; is the Chinese film that has sold the largest number of films to all five continents and countries around the world, because from a humanistic perspective, Westerners think that the great migration of millions of people is a huge human social phenomenon, and this film is very Artistically expressing this change, they believe that Jia Zhangke&#39;s film is a thirty-year history of social changes in China&#39;s counties, and has very strong cognitive value. Then it was released (in China) and the box office was also very low. I remember that when &quot;The Good Man from Three Gorges&quot; was being performed, Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;A City of Gold&quot; was released. Jia Zhangke said sadly that no matter how good a good man is, he can&#39;t compare to gold. Jia Zhangke has organized various festivals and schools in China, and is also a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, so his status is quite high. But if you really ask the general audience, very few people have seen his movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in the fourth generation or even the third generation, many people have not had the opportunity to go out to some of our good works back then. Some, like mine, have gone out, but people have the impression that you are one of the fifth generation. So we often tell these doctoral students that in fact, from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the glory of Chinese films in the world was jointly created by three, four, and five generations. Another thing is to see that foreign opinions have their correctness and limitations. They are curious. For example, if you praise the correctness of the light, they will not be interested. But when they enter social reality and criticize reality, they are particularly interested. interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you care more about the recognition of foreign film festivals in the past than now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; It has always been the case until today, but now I don’t take it so seriously. It seems that there was a news last year and this year that one of the three major festivals is a Chinese film None, unfortunately. After 2007 and 2008, Chinese films also entered the main competition, but they were very scattered. There are some that have won awards, such as &quot;Fireworks in the Day&quot; and &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot;, but these films themselves are not particularly well received in China. Unlike at that time, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is still the most highly rated Chinese film on Douban now, so you can&#39;t say that the masses are influenced by foreign film festivals, and it itself is genuine. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/mFbNH1GMGKoFxmapTeecAQAZX2Q5CVZ0qbxQUp2E.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/mFbNH1GMGKoFxmapTeecAQAZX2Q5CVZ0qbxQUp2E.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xie Fei and Jiang Wen on the set of &quot;Ben Ming Nian&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;The complexity of human nature is not captured in the photo. The Chinese people in the future will also see I don’t understand”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After participating in domestic film festivals, what do you think of the current youth What is the overall level of filmmakers? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After I came back from Pingyao and First, I wrote a Douban article, mainly to comment on several award-winning films. In fact, I feel that the form is greater than the content, and I work hard on the form, but the content and even the basic plot narration are not up to standard. This is a bad thing, because content is the core. If the content is not explained clearly, the explanation will be even less weighty, and the movies of this era will not have brilliance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many of your films are adapted from literary works , now many young directors like to write their own scripts, what do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One is that many people do not read novels or read literature, and their literary foundation is poor. There are still some good works by writers who are still active in China. You have to be patient and read them. Every year, for example, the Mao Dun Literary Award awards countless novels. Not long ago, a TV series called &quot;Zhuangtai&quot; came out, which was very successful. This author also wrote a TV series called &quot;Zhuangtai&quot;. &quot;Protagonist&quot; is also very good, and it seems that it will be adapted into a film and television work. No matter whether it is a full-length novel or a medium-length novel, there is still an author who is writing things seriously. If we directors can pay attention and read more, we will find that there are many things that are more important than the stories we come up with and are worthy of your expression. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another one is that he is self-satisfied and thinks that he can write screenplays. After finishing writing good screenwriters, he has already started directing. Why should I make wedding dresses for others? We over-praise directors. In TV dramas all over the world, screenwriters are king. Indeed, screenwriters play the biggest and fundamental role. For example, South Korea respects screenwriters very much, and even three directors take turns filming, so no episode will be the same, and the quality of the show will not be lost. We are not here now. Many people say that except for a few high-IQ creatives, the film crew is all migrant workers. There are no technical secondary schools, junior colleges, or blue-collar schools for the grassroots production staff, and their cultural and technical abilities cannot be cultivated. Some film and television teachings talk all day long about whether they can cultivate a little swallow or a Zhang Yimou, as if this is the school&#39;s credit, which is wrong. You should be comprehensively trained, because film and television production and media-integrated audio-visual production are very vast and require a large number of technical talents and talents of all levels. You have to respect them, including those who make clothes, design hair accessories, and make them, all of which require skills and culture. Therefore, farmers in a village can provide lighting for Chinese TVs. This is a phenomenon that is not seen in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Where do you think the best movies of the moment will appear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t know because I have seen very little. One is for ourselves to affirm, and the other is for the international community to affirm. I have repeatedly made a point that what foreigners cannot understand today will not be understood by Chinese young people in the next two or three generations. Don&#39;t think that you can understand him because he is Chinese, because he has left today&#39;s society. For example, they will think, why don&#39;t they go to the city in the countryside? Some people say they have household registration and food stamps, and they ask, what are those? Foreigners today can&#39;t understand it because they don&#39;t understand it. If your movie is just a matter of fact and fails to capture the complexity of human nature, they won&#39;t be able to understand it. Chinese people in the future won&#39;t be able to understand it either. If you insist that he understand what China&#39;s planned economy is all about, why should he understand it? People used to often say, Xie Fei, if your movie is applauded by foreigners but not by Chinese, you are not considered a success. I said, just wait and see. Two or three generations later, if the Chinese still praise my film, they will not be able to understand the film you praise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
