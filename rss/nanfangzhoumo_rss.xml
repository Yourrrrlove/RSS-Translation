Lu Jingyu is his immediate boss, and the two have deep interests tied together. Lin Yingying was the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman.

The Japanese military officer issued an order to &quot;find out the insider&quot;, which triggered an office struggle among insiders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, ignoring the bugs in the character&#39;s logic, this part is quite watchable, and it can be regarded as a low-end version of Qiuzhuang&#39;s ghost-catching in &quot;The Wind&quot;. Lu and Yu&#39;s small team took action one after another, some to protect themselves, others to bite each other. It didn&#39;t matter who the real mole was, what was important was to take the opportunity to eliminate dissidents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/e48a3c0d3863c0c34d242363a2399c45.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/e48a3c0d3863c0c34d242363a2399c45.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259927 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why is it called a low-end version? Because there is a clear MacGuffin in &quot;The Wind&quot; (the focus of the suspense film) - who is the old ghost. However, &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; revealed the truth to the audience from the very beginning. The identities of Jin Shenshui and Lin Yingying were two bright cards that were played too early, and there was no suspense left. We&#39;re just waiting to see how they can use their strength to survive the internal purge. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/b3d3ffeeaf284eab333a9359d504203e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/b3d3ffeeaf284eab333a9359d504203e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259924 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The highlight of &quot;The Wind&quot; is by no means torture, but this was highlighted in the pre-release marketing in the past. The trailers and character specials of &quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; also have similar ideas. It mainly highlights the continuous punishment stunts during the internal fighting, such as pulling out nails, pouring sulfuric acid, sitting on the tiger bench, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/61b498a3a850489f380e99831aef8c6f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/61b498a3a850489f380e99831aef8c6f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259925 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the director made reasonable use of the characteristics of the actors&#39; past high-profile roles&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (for example, Huang Zhizhong&#39;s performance is similar to the role of Yang Liren in &quot;The Righteous Way in the World is Vicissitudes of Life&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; span>;&lt;span>;, so that they can maintain stable performance while performing experiential performances,&lt;/span>; at least the audience can accurately grasp the characters they convey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cruel scenes that challenge the physical limits, the medium-to-high-intensity &quot;werewolf killing&quot; and the survival game in which everyone is in danger ensure the tension in the first half of the film. But unfortunately, since the victory of the Lu faction and the end of the internal fighting, the film has fallen into piecemeal chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first hour and the last hour of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; are as separate as if they were not the same movie. The second half of the film focuses on Jin Shenshui&#39;s abandonment of darkness and the light under the influence of Lin Yingying, the destruction of the military command group in Nanjing, and the two men&#39;s revenge like lone rangers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/4d15d7961ec0dec26a49b22d4e8969e5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/4d15d7961ec0dec26a49b22d4e8969e5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259928 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because the plot was too complicated and fragmented, and the time&lt;/span>; span was long, the director had to arrange multiple long monologues for Jin Shenshui, with voiceovers revealing the changes in the situation and the characters. destiny. However, using dubbing to promote narrative in film and television works is undoubtedly a very weak choice. On the contrary, it proves that the film is unable to tell stories with pictures and characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259926&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although there are many characters appearing in the first half, they still have distinct personalities. But the characters who appear in the second half, such as the members of the military command team stationed in Nanjing, Lin Yingying&#39;s relatives, etc., these supporting roles are too homogeneous. In fact, there is no need to type subtitles for every person who appears, nor do you need to give everyone equal time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such a passing character and hasty explanation of the ending give the second half a sense of deja vu, as if you have finished the plot and left work early, and the narrative is cohesive&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; span>;Compared with the first half, it can be regarded as loose prose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a common saying to describe the impression of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot;, it is that &quot;it is full of energy, then fades, and three times it is exhausted.&quot; The more you watch, the more discouraged you are, until it collapses thousands of miles. The film wants to portray the change of mentality of the triple agent. It stands to reason that the character will be highlighted and sublimated at the end, but this mechanism obviously fails in this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259931&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Wind&quot;, which has a lot to do with the tendency of film and television adaptation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The original work of &quot;The Sound of the Wind&quot; is divided into Dongfeng, West Wind and Jingfeng. From the perspectives of different narrators, it restores the ghost-catching past events in Qiuzhuang with different versions that are difficult to distinguish between true and false. If it were shot strictly according to the logic of the original work, it would be a polished remake of &quot;Rashomon.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But the director accurately picked out the main line of the story, filled it with flesh and blood, and drastically deleted unnecessary plots. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film version of &quot;The Wind&quot; is a bit like a colorful stage play, and it does use the three principles of drama&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (observe time , location and actions are consistent)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;——The isolated Qiuzhuang is an excellent stage for the story to be staged. The protagonists with different thoughts seek faith and survival. Time and space are further compressed to highlight the characters and stories as much as possible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/9b97d4839579d0da47de7da325e491c2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;760&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/9b97d4839579d0da47de7da325e491c2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259930 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The original work of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is divided into upper and lower volumes. The positive side is about Jin Shenshui, and the negative side is about Lin Yingying. Together they are the complete context of the history of the two fighting side by side. This novel focuses on the growth of the characters and has a large span, which makes the adaptation quite difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The problem with the film version is precisely that it&lt;/span>; wants to completely present the whole character, but ends up copying the gourd and being constrained by the original work. Based on the size of the original work, it would be a good choice to make a 40-episode TV series. The 120 minutes of the film version is really difficult to carry such complex characters and emotions. It is better to only retain the first half of the film and delve deeper into the characters to make them fuller and richer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ff2a834d717cfb87e4f5e915174ce941.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ff2a834d717cfb87e4f5e915174ce941.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259929&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even without &quot;The Wind&quot;, &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; would not be considered a success&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. Because it was difficult to choose side branches from the main plot, the movie was turned into a double-speed explanation video of the TV series, which was really a mistake. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Director Gao Qunshu also has &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and &quot;Gunshots from the Secret Service&quot; on his waiting list. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; I don’t know when they will be released.

For example, at the end of June 2023, the balance of ICBC&#39;s green loans reached 5 trillion yuan, accounting for more than 30% of the bank&#39;s total loans; state-owned banks are also at the forefront of the total green bond issuance and green bond underwriting amount indicators. For example, by the end of 2022, Bank of China’s green bond issuance amounted to 87.7 billion yuan, and its green bond underwriting amount was 453.9 billion yuan, ranking first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of ESG governance, the six major banks have all set up organizational structures and performance appraisal systems that are compatible with green finance.

This shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green loans to support the development of green industries. At the same time, joint-stock banks rarely issue green bonds, and the average size of green bond underwriting is only about 1/10 of large state-owned banks, which also shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green financial products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are not no benchmarks among joint-stock banks.

As a benchmark, nine life insurance companies were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively from the four dimensions of economic performance, environmental performance, social performance and corporate governance, and fourteen sub-indicators were set, and different weights were given to each sub-indicator according to the difference in importance. The total weight of the above indicators accounts for 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center comprehensively rated nine life insurance companies from the two dimensions of expert review and media factors (each accounting for 15% weight) , to build a green finance list for the insurance industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Green Finance List Life Insurance List Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /29/086e8a479b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/086e8a479b.png &quot; data-key=&quot;259952&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green Finance List Life Insurance List Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The quantitative and qualitative indicators of the life insurance ranking index system are explained as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the economic performance dimension, based on the scale of green investment , operating profit is measured by two third-level indicators. Green investment refers to investing in green industries or conducting green business activities, such as purchasing green bonds, green index funds, etc.; operating profit is used to measure a company&#39;s operating performance. In theory, it should be measured by green investment business income generation indicators. Taking into account actual information disclosure, operating profit replace. The total weight of the above two indicators is 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the environmental performance dimension, total greenhouse gas emissions and per capita values ​​are core indicators, echoing the &quot;3060&quot; dual carbon goals. Taking into account the service industry characteristics of the financial industry, natural resources and energy consumption are measured in terms of electricity, water, gas and oil consumption. The total weight of the above five indicators is 25%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The social performance dimension mainly sets three three-level indicators from the three perspectives of consumers, employees and communities: consumer complaint volume, employee turnover rate and charity investment measure. The total weight of the above indicators is 15%. Stakeholders such as governments and partners are not included because the information disclosure standards of each ESG report are different and comparability is poor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Corporate governance dimension, set the number of core issues, MSCI rating, scope&lt;strong>;three&lt;/strong>; data disclosure, ESG reporting third party There are 4 third-level indicators of certification status. The total weight of the above four indicators is 20%. Among them, carbon emission scope three data is an important part of carbon emission accounting at the organizational level, including greenhouse gas emissions from upstream and downstream (value chain) activities related to corporate production. For service industries such as finance, business travel and employee commuting are the main components of Scope 3. However, due to greater accounting difficulties in this part, fewer life insurance companies proactively disclose it. In addition, although the insurance industry has paid more attention to ESG reporting, most ESG reports have not obtained third-party certification, so their objectivity and independence are questionable. Based on the above reasons and from the perspective of encouraging standardized information disclosure, corporate governance dimension indicators are set in a qualitative manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Life insurance list: Ping An Life takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Life insurance According to the green finance list of industrial financial institutions, Ping An Life, PICC Life and Sunshine Life ranked among the top three in total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the perspective of quantitative and qualitative indicators, Ping An Life, PICC Life and AIA Life are leading, but PICC Life and AIA Life failed to provide any supplementary information in time during the survey. , so the media factor score is 0, which drags down the total score and ranking.

In the same period, only 37%and 52%of the company&#39;s research companies in my country and Hong Kong conducted a certain degree of verification in 2021. One of the reasons is that my country&#39;s regulatory agencies are currently disclosed by the company&#39;s disclosure of social responsibility reports and issued certification opinions are still in the encouragement stage.

The former refers to Hengdian Film and Television Base now the world of the &quot;vertical screen short drama&quot; shooting team; the latter refers to Reelshort, a short drama application platform, has begun to siege overseas, and even rush to the first place in the American iOS entertainment list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 22, the &quot;2023-2024 China Microta Drama Market Research Report&quot; released by Ai Media&#39;s Consultation shows that the size of the Chinese online drama market in 2023 was 37.39 billion yuan, an increase of 267.65%year-on-year. In the first half of 2023, there were 481 new short dramas, which had exceeded the annual level of 2022. It is expected that in 2027, the scale of China&#39;s short drama market will reach 100.68 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The rise of short videos, which not only reshaped the audiovisual habits of netizens, but also accommodated the search, shopping, entertainment, and social needs of netizens: run from search engines, from search engines Turn to short dramas, from playing online games to short videos, shifting from e -commerce shopping to live broadcast and cargo ... &quot;Short Video+&quot; is profoundly affecting the ecology of the Internet industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The major Internet platforms are therefore derived the new business models of &quot;short video+advertising&quot; and &quot;short video+e -commerce&quot;, which greatly subverts the traditional profit model: the byte beating has announced the shrinkage game business. Fully embrace short videos; netizens have surpassed the online game time; traditional online authors have poured into the new track; major film and television bases have become &quot;vertical screen version&quot; ... These phenomena show that the short video era has created short short -term video. The prosperity of the play has also profoundly changed the overall ecology of the upper and lower reaches of the industrial chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;2023 China Network Audiovisual Development Research Report&quot; shows that about 50.4%of the 1 billion short video users in 2022 have watched short dramas within 3 minutes. In 2023, the market size of the short drama market can reach half of the box office of the national movie, which has created a lot of myths of traffic miracles and wealth. The myth of wealth that is &quot;finished in a week, launch one month, and a freedom of wealth&quot; is also widely circulated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The roots of the success of short dramas are planted in human nature. This is a deep demand that people cannot erase. Human nature naturally loves &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;relieve qi&quot;, seek emotional vent, and desire emotional compensation. While the audience scolded the same three short dramas, they still couldn&#39;t help but go to bed with dozens of episodes, and experienced the excitement of &quot;the original success and love can come so fast.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Short dramas often satisfy some &quot;refreshing points&quot; of people, and &quot;hit&quot; a pleasant mechanism inherent in human nature. The themes such as &quot;giants and grievances&quot;, &quot;love first and love&quot;, &quot;overbearing president fell in love with me&quot; and other themes have been prosperous. I don&#39;t tire. The protagonist of the short drama either has become an alternative Earl of Christian Mountain, or the film and television &quot;Long Aotian&quot; and &quot;Mary Su&quot;, or the product of the shortcut keys after the long -proclaimed urban emotional drama is pressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is slightly different from the previous Internet ecology, and the current industry supervision has become more and more synchronized. This is a new situation worthy of attention. Recently, the news of &quot;Douyin, Fast Hand, WeChat Three Platforms combined with illegal short dramas&quot; has also been with the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, &quot;has removed 25,000 short dramas a few days ago, and the next step will be launched again. &quot;The announcement echoed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen that the Internet industry is indeed &quot;three or five years of leading&quot;. In the past, the success may not be able to maintain it in the face of the new air outlet. Short dramas have emerged with the rise of short videos to fully explain this. At the same time, the &quot;grass reckless state&quot; of the barbaric growth and horse race of the Internet industry has passed, and the advancement of the technical format and the follow -up of regulatory regulations have more and more present a &quot;same frequency&quot; state. Under the requirements of following the regulatory regulatory regulation, the pursuit of high -quality fine content is still the main axis of the short drama market in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七百岁村庙的“一生”：东南最早元代建筑被发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261520]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ Image/23/11/29/9cbb99999f.png &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 706 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/23/11/ 29/9cbb99999f.png &quot;data-key =&quot; 259937 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Overlooking Fushan Hall. &quot;No name for the time being&quot; Photo &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Since seeing Fu Shantang for the first time in 2017, I have always been thinking about it. &quot;No name for the time being&quot; is his net name.

There is a title of Qing Kangxi under the porch. The stage shows the late Qing Dynasty style. The main hall itself contains different components and structures of Yuan, Ming, and Qing, let alone the &quot;strata&quot; of the rich &quot;strata&quot; of the entire building complex. &quot;The era of&quot; Yuan to Qing &quot;to describe the age of Fushantang is more accurate, and it is closer to the essence of architectural heritage.&quot; I don&#39;t think it is for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Liu Yan said that architectural archeology is &quot;architectural detective&quot;. By collectively collected the clues on the scene, architects found the slight changes in the buildings in the river of time, thereby pushing the changes of society and personnel. What he wanted to do to Foshantang was such a thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The early construction of the institute did, it was architectural archeology, but at that time, the focus of scholars still wanted to find the earliest building and find Tang Guo.

The Hall of Hualin Temple in Fuzhou is such a classic representative. = &quot;Text-Align: Left;&quot;>; Today&#39;s Archeology is different from the pursuit of early scholars.

There is a gallery bridge in the village. There is a gallery bridge at the end of the village.

There are two gallery bridges next to the village. &quot;Those who have the power to build a gallery must be the position of this village on an important channel. It may be an important business road in ancient times. Such a large gallery. &quot;Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; What surprises Zhou Miao is the Ming dynasty in Zhengwei Village. There may be more than five or six dwellings in the Ming Dynasty, and there are many exquisite Qing dwellings, which shows that this village has been prosperous very early.

As the villagers of Zhengwei Village are very familiar with firearms, the Zheng&#39;s Ancestral Hall in the center of the village naturally became the guerrilla firearm repair plant. Today, the pentagram above the main entrance of the shrine was the sign of the firearm repair plant in Northeast Fujian guerrillas at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16c28ba.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1360 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16fb3c28ba.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259946 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Zheng Weicun&#39;s Zheng&#39;s ancestral temple.

On May 13, 1948, Zeng Jingbing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese and Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and more than 200 guerrilla members watched Gan opera with local villagers in Fushantang. Later, Fu Shantang became a general cultural relic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1982年，村民对福善堂大殿局部修缮，据暂不观察，当时的用料粗陋细小，“与原构相去甚远”， It may be that the conditions are too limited. In 2017, Zheng Weicun obtained the protection of the &quot;traditional Chinese village&quot;. The Fushan Hall and Porcelain Porcelain were repaired local. In 1982, the components that did not meet the specifications were replaced, and the roof was also renovated. Now in the temple, the light -colored wood is replaced in 2017, and the difference between the dark and old materials is clearly distinguished. It is this cautious repair that keeps many questions in Foshantang in Mo Shu&#39;s titles in mind. Until six years, you will not carry infrared cameras to visit again ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left; &quot;>; Compared to Yu&#39;s Ancestral Temple, the Fushan Hall is lucky. It enjoys hundreds of years of incense, and because of the special identity of the affiliated architectural drama, it has escaped the change of the turmoil of the 20th century until a group of people discovered it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/728732b.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 810 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/728732b.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259947 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Overlooking from the hill behind Fushantang, the Fushantang building group is covered in the green bamboo.

The removal of Yu&#39;s ancestral temple, as well as Anxi Baofengyan (during the Ming Yongle period), Zhangping Longjian Palace (1482), Youxi Zhuo&#39;s Temple (During the Ming Dynasty), Datian Hongnong Temple (Ming Chenghua to Hongzhi period ), Yongtai Xianpu Realm (1513) ... Most of them have no protection identity. “他们手上对历史建筑的整理非常准确、完整。”刘妍、周淼与福建当地的古建爱好者群体都有很多接触，比起官方的统计数据，他们有时候会更加仰仗这些人的material. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“现在面临的一个问题是，很多地方政府其实不愿意承担这个风险，知道它是一个有价值的文物，但不愿意上报，这种情况是存在的。”郑锦兰对南方周末记者说。只要不上报为文物点，损毁之后便没有人需要负责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;保护尽可能多的古建筑样本，是学者进行系统性研究的基础。福善堂在元代建筑中究竟处于什么样的位置，连专门研究宋元建筑的周淼也很难说清，“因为南方的元代建筑实在太少”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;北方的元代建筑相对留存较多，在特定区域内，数量可以多到分析其历时性的变化。 “在北方大致能对元代建筑做一个等级区分，来评述不同等级分别是什么样子。”周淼说。如果将福善堂置于北方元构之中，那么它毫无疑问是低等级的村佛堂的级别，然而它的大殿却比一般村庙要大很多，“北方元代之后，因为战乱，低等级建筑的构架的组合方式开始变得很乱，很混杂，或者说法度乱了、不讲究了。但福善堂的规制、秩序还是挺好的，这也出乎我的意料。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;福善堂大殿走过了历史的风浪，如今面临的是乡村的空巢。 1950年代以前，村子里最兴旺的时候有五百多户人家。如今郑魏村本村只剩下不到八百人，整个行政村（包括周边的6个自然村）也不过一千多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;古建筑背后不仅有发现者和研究者，还有与其息息相关的使用者。伐木产业消失之后，村子事实上没了营生。整个村子一年的开销要20万元左右，村两委的工资、村里的卫生开销有时候都很难保障。村里没有年轻人，这一代青衣斋婆逝去之后，福善堂的日常维护与使用很可能将失去活性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刘妍也很感兴趣青衣斋婆的仪式与服饰，以及村子的戏班。 “这个村子似乎有种魔力，能够保留下这么多样的古老的东西”，他计划明年寒假、暑假再来调研和测绘，尽可能长久地“泡”在当地，做真正的建筑人类学的田野调查。 “把人和建筑结合起来讨论，才会更有意思”。他也明白，如果不尽早记录，围绕着福善堂的这一整套文化系统都将消逝。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;建瓯当地对福善堂的“升格”运动正在展开。原本福善堂只是一般的文保点，连县保也不是，现在它正在“越级”升格，“升格为省保的材料已经做完了，就等省里通知下来，之后我们可以把材料交上去，就可以做升格的工作。”郑锦兰说。进省保是为了未来进国保做准备，“元代的南方木构，一定会进国保的。”刘妍说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;青衣斋婆的日课肯定会受到文物保护等级升格的影响。郑发旺打算为她们在殿外准备一个鼎，让香烛不再入殿。和青衣斋婆们告别之后，刘妍和暂不继续驱车向北，去浦城山中寻访云峰寺。暂不说那是一座坐西朝东的国保建筑，“日出的时候，会非常美”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《再见爱人》：婚姻里谁都没错，日子怎么就没法过]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/92I6YaI3L2s2KiC36TxIsoT8b4MEQEvR9IDfU0Kz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/92I6YaI3L2s2KiC36TxIsoT8b4MEQEvR9IDfU0Kz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260006&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《再见爱人》制片人刘乐&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《再见爱人》做到第三季，制片人刘乐终于实现了提出方案时的梦——带着嘉宾进入民政局拍摄一天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿合奇县民政局办事大厅不到200平米，结婚与离婚都在这里完成。三对不知道会不会离婚的嘉宾见证了数对当地情侣的结合与家庭的离散。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘乐曾经是社会新闻记者，在民政局蹲过新闻。决定做《再见爱人》后，她让团队去民政局门口蹲人，虽然无果，但成员们都直面了原始的震撼，当下说不出什么，回去后每个人都心潮起伏。 “我想拍悲欢离合都在一个场所，人类的感受并不相通。你在承诺的时候有没有想过会分开？分开的时候你记不记得当时的承诺？”刘乐说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，与“离婚”紧密关联的真人秀《再见爱人》第一季上线。节目中，三对在婚姻中出现问题的嘉宾进行了一段为期18天的旅行，回首相爱的美好，剖析婚姻的问题，寻找感情的答案。 The show presented a trivial life in public, and the excavation of the details of marriage and deep contradictions resonated with the audience. 2023年秋季，《再见爱人》第三季播出，傅首尔和老刘、纪焕博和王诗晴、王睡睡和张硕三对外人“看上去很美”的恋人，戳破假象，直面各自的困境，再次引起关于亲密关系的讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这档节目的核心、制片人、总导演刘乐当过四年社会新闻记者、十年《快乐大本营》导演，最近三年，除了《再见爱人》系列，她的作品还有《春日迟迟再出发》——同样与离婚相关。 She has been paying attention to emotional topics for a long time. She likes to send emotional paragraphs from time to time from time to time many years ago. She went to do &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; and &quot;Separate Separation Separation&quot;. Most of the program copywriting was written by her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《再见爱人》是刘乐十余年从业经验的总呈，其中兼有传统新闻人的触觉与敏感、综艺导演的娱乐与灵巧、情感博主的锐利与机锋。作为一名单身女性，她推动很多已婚人士在婚姻与亲密关系的探索上往前走了一步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;节目播出后，刘乐获得了比预期更多的关切和支持。有同事看完甚至想结婚了。观察室嘉宾胡彦斌告诉她：“如果离别不是那么可怕，我们对于彼此还有这么深切的关怀、这么美好的祝愿，有这么体面的分别，那我也渴望婚姻。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《再见爱人》第三季录制结束后，刘乐接受了我们的专访，讲述了三季以来与节目相关的喜乐、苦悲和她摸索到的人性幽微。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;不吵架就不能离婚吗？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《再见爱人》做到第三季，依然能触动What is yours? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这一季最让我震撼的应该是首尔和老刘的这种无过错感。首尔来之前跟我说，我不吵架，能行吗？我说谁说《再见爱人》就要吵架，不吵就不吵。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们去民政局那期，局长问怎么过不下去，出了什么事？是不是不回家？是不是喝酒？是不是打你？他有大量的“临床实验”经验，他提出的这几个问题非常有含金量。我们在日常生活中听到别人离婚，也会问有什么问题。假如他说没什么问题，那为啥要离婚？好好的日子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多人的惯性思维，非得出个轨，非得家个暴，非得骗我钱，我才能离婚。 no.所以我们这一季打的主概念是隐痛，缓慢生长。我不能讲出来它具体有什么。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前几集播出的时候，大家可能会觉得，是不是在无病呻吟啊，是不是在强说愁，就是为了上节目编了一套词。像首尔，播出前半段和后半段，我看过一些公众号，最开始就写，傅首尔肯定是来赚钱的，她肯定不会离婚。过了几集，又有公众号写，傅首尔肯定是来赚钱的，因为她早就打算好要离了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大家会怎么去认知她，这也是说服首尔最难的地方。大家会怀疑她是不是出于功利。我跟她讲，如果你愿意面对你的真实困境，你就来。这样的声音怎样都不会消散。说服她最重要的点还是她有真实的情感诉求。这十几年的婚姻真真实实的扎根在她心里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认识她好几年了，我还在《快乐大本营》时，她来做我的嘉宾，她说我特别羡慕你的状态，一种随时都可以谈恋爱的状态。我说你是不是婚姻里遇到了什么困惑？跟她聊了一些。做了《再见爱人》之后，前两季她经常给我发一些观后感，我觉得她讲的话其实带着她自个儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首尔防备心挺强，她会自我保护，又想讲，又不会讲得非常透彻。看上去嘻嘻哈哈的，但心里肯定有一片满目疮痍埋藏在她想要让所有人都快乐的表象之下，我很想把这个东西挖出来。第二季结束之后我就跟她提了，肯定有说服的过程。我跟她讲，你要是下定决心，所有事儿都不是事儿。问题是问题，但是能解决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的判断是她迟早要面对，不是说一定要来上节目，但是她心里有很多结，通过和朋友聊天无法疏解。一方面她想要寻求改变，另一方面她也渴望被更多人理解。她还是很大程度上有“旧剧本”的那一部分，我婚姻十几年，大家都没犯什么错，我们都尽力了，为什么过不好？那如果是这样，我们能不能选择分开呢？我感觉她跟老刘都是一个被困住的状态，这个事儿她没办法真正和解，以至于她愿意上一个节目来把一切都摊开了给大家看，真实的情况是这样，那我可以被理解吗？她那么渴求被理解，她先锋又守旧，主动又被动，是非常迷人的矛盾体。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;希望有一天她能接受自己真实的困顿，不去向另外一种人生强硬地靠拢，这样可能会轻松一些，但首尔就是一个不轻松的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mMKm7vnUfWoevoLlB9wzEMH9GCU4sFugv5gJIt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;另外两对都是自己报名。王诗晴第二季就报名，但当时跟她聊，还没有像这一季有这么大的矛盾，今年感觉深刻许多。大家从去年封闭的状态打开以后，进入一种动态，会带来非常多剧烈的冲击。如果关系本身是很好的，这个动态有可能会让你们更好。如果本来就不好，就加速分崩离析。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王诗晴的工作机会多起来了，明显感觉自己好像更强大了，人脉、社会给予的回馈都变得极其具象，实实在在感觉到好像“我正在高飞&quot;.而想要拉住我的人，他的动作也变得更加明显了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王睡睡在第二季之后报名，当时张婉婷和宋宁峰的很多争吵让她想到自己，她觉得自己也喜欢骂人，也过得不开心，就填了报名表。最早看他俩资料，没有像节目中呈现出来这么多的问题，第一轮接触，很多导演都判断是鸡毛蒜皮，问题过于细碎，日常好像不那么值得去剖析，不那么发人深省，不那么有往下延展的空间等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我说会不会鸡毛蒜皮的东西才是真正值得延展的东西？ Will the show team trapped by a so -called heart that wants to pursue texture?是不是我们在对亲密关系的呈现上，太迷恋那些看不见、摸不着、说不清的东西，而那些看得清、摸得着、抓得住、直接就能判断对错的事儿，都被我们排除在外了？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们就反思，第一季里，朱雅琼说了非常多感受，但最后让人记住的是那一分钟的拥抱。还是落实在具体的事件上。具体的事件可以让人有抓手，可以去反思自己有没有这样的行为，更好地去建立一个对比的坐标体系，所以我们定了他们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多人说《再见爱人》就是要靠激烈的争吵来吸引人注意，不是，节目组不希望没完没了吵，那个东西让人绝望、让人窒息。但因为是真人秀，一旦他们开始，我们是不能干涉的。我们不可能上去告诉他们别吵了，你们赶紧给我和好，更不可能去跟他们说你俩现在可以开始吵了，这太荒谬了。我们能做的只有如实记录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;飞行嘉宾加入进来带什么话题、可以去做一个什么新的项目，这些我们可以隐形植入到旅程中，触发他们变化。其他的根本不知道他们会在什么游戏就炸了，哪一句话就让他怒了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你看张硕当时给伴郎发微信&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（第一期，王睡睡和张硕因婚闹事件吵架，二人不欢而散。后因为别的事情吵架，此时张硕给伴郎发微信试图缓解与睡睡的矛盾）&lt;/span>;，他那一刻最真实的感觉就是那么做是好的，肯定能够挽回：她因为别的事情生我气了，我马上要做一件事情来弥补这个事儿。但正是因为他做了这些事情，让观众直观地感觉到他的模式就是拆东墙补西墙，而且拆的也不好，补的也不好，整个人非常敷衍。这个敷衍是不是社会常态？ yes.所以引发了最大的共鸣。吵架只能让大家来看热闹，但是能让大家在热闹之后留下的一定是吵架背后的痛感。是能共情的点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我觉得张硕还是代表一种很普遍的现象：我不需要把这个事儿做到100分，我永远在控制我的付出，做到10分就可以了，20分就可以了，在任何地方都躺平，无论对他的工作、社交还是爱情。黄执中说得对，他很吝啬他的精力。现在支付了10分精力，你如果不承认我这10分的价值，我就不开心，这是不是自私？ of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以张硕后面上的“社会的镜子”的热搜，我觉得观众也能非常直观感觉到这样的情感模式对于当代的年轻人来说是多么的无力。为什么这么多人不想恋爱了？大家都说我不用那么满了，如果爱都不深爱了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实张硕有很多优点，我们对他是怒其不争，但是恨不起来。他确确实实是一个心地很善良的小孩，非常会照顾到周围情绪。但是为什么偏偏在亲密关系上是这样的模式？节目里一直在探索，观察室也在讲。 （其中一种原因可能是）人都渴望正反馈，这是一个生理机制。如果我做错了，是希望得到一些建议，而不是被质问是不是错了？没有人喜欢一直被鞭子抽，抽了以后我可能做得更不好，这是一种行为机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;节目弹幕里很多写“睡睡快跑”，大家都理解不了为什么他俩这样了还要在一起。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得观众是直接看到了一个呈现，会觉得都这样了怎么还不分手呢？但是作为睡睡来讲，这个人是我的初恋，在一起10年了，他曾经对我也是很好的，下决心要分开并不容易，在遇到问题的时候肯定还是先想怎么解决，到底是什么改变了呢？我能不能改变呢？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人得有希望，这是一个很正面的事情。以前的人大多走另一个极端，无论再怎么苦再怎么累，受多少委屈，我们都要把这个日子过下去，死不离婚。现在新的趋势是：稍微有一点不对，马上拜拜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《再见爱人》一直想要找一个中间的平衡，既不要轻易的分开，也不要作死的拖拉。我们希望拥有，既能离开也能修复的能力，可能这是更健全的爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我相信对王睡睡来说，她决定来上节目的时候，就是想要再给这段关系一个最后的机会，能好就继续，好不了就分开。在这个过程中她的每一次摇摆、愤怒、心软都是极其真诚的，她在努力去重新认知这个人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;节目播出后，张硕的行为引起了很大controversy.他的反馈是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;他很痛苦。感觉自我被完全粉碎了，被全方位否定了。播出期间他时不时会来跟我们讨论，基本都是自省，我觉得这一点非常不容易。没有人能够真正迅速地承认自己是一个糟糕的人，这是很残酷的事情，也需要时间，但我们看到张硕一直在努力。他还是一个探索的姿态。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张硕在节目里算是一个挺阳光的人，挺能够自己给自己找乐子。这些舆论无论正确与否，对他的冲击很大。他又痛，又不得不承认有些评论可能说得挺有道理。就像人要消化刀子，一个刀子已经在肉里了，它在割我的瘤子，痛得哇哇叫，又必须忍着。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nLyveKvA0eqTxGrsUpslEL6wyPrRU1fvAaZcq6UT.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;不是有意为之。通常我们都不是冲着有共性去攒素材，是攒的过程中发现能够拎出这个东西。像第一期标题《看上去很美》，就是我们拎出来的共性。三对都是分开前采，在每个人单独的海量的素材里面，我们拎出了这个点，就是我们的婚姻都是外人看上去很好，但实际上不是这样。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于女强男弱，我觉得我们只是提供一种讨论角度，可能大家看完会有这样的总结。其实这三对都不是绝对的女强人，也有弱的地方，所以我们讨论了到底什么叫作强，是经济实力吗？如果只有这一个维度，可以算作三对都是女强男弱。但是话语权呢？渴求被爱的需求呢？在婚姻里的存在感呢？自在度、舒适度呢？谁是情感里的上位者呢？回到这些维度，她们未必是强。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你刚刚说希望这个节目是探寻一个平台，这是节目的初衷吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;做着做着才有了这个方向。我们每次遇到一对伴侣，他来到我们节目，他的表现可能多少都有超出阈值的部分：过于操控，过于没有安全感，过于忍耐等等。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有超出阈值的部分，我们都希望让大家意识到，这个有点超出了，可以回来，我们努力站到一个更安全的区域。但有的时候，有些问题发生的时候，也希望大家不要觉得这个事儿是多大的事儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在NPD&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（自恋型人格障碍）&lt;/span>;、煤气灯&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（一种心理操纵手段）&lt;/span>;、边缘性人格等名词经常出现，大家在遇到什么事情的时候可能会立刻下定论，那这些词真正的、专业的定义是什么？会不会有矫枉过正的部分？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从第二季以后我也在想这个问题，是不是这个人的行为举止一旦有超出我们日常认知的部分，我们就可以断定他是一个疯子？或者一旦我们给一个人下了一个什么判定，那么是不是接下来他所说的所有话都不可信？我觉得不是的。郭老师&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（郭柯宇）&lt;/span>;在第一季就说过：“人有太多面了。”我特别认同这句话.人就是各式各样的，疯狂的、低沉的、高价值的、低价值的人都有，人本身就是复杂而不完美的动物，但他们索求被爱的心都是真的。爱里人人平等，亲密关系人人平等，这就是为什么《再见爱人》没有去严格区分明星还是素人，我们全部放到一个场域来进行讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我看过一个评论，说《再见爱人》像解鲁班锁，让扣得不够紧的扣得更紧，让濒临散架的平稳落地，而不是暴力拆解或者永不解开，所有摇摇欲坠的鲁班锁，我们都给它找一个最后的结局。我很认同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;当谈亲密关系不再羞耻&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当时怎么会想到做这样一个节目？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;从行业来说，离婚赛道是一个空缺，那时各大平台都在摸索离婚IP。已经存在的国内外的离婚IP，有一些问题没有真正被解决。比如诉求是什么？如果你已经离婚了，把你们放到一起旅游，那你有没有诉求？还是说这是一个节目的诉求？是一个观看的诉求？如果人物毫无诉求，呈现出来的东西可能会非常空泛，飘荡不落地。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离婚冷静期是我想起这个IP的关键，它可以作为一个诉求。我最早锁定的是已经进入了冷静期的夫妻。只有30天，我们就要去看这个单子拿不拿得了。在婚姻里面可能每一个人都无数次想过要离婚，为什么想？想了以后你付诸了什么行动？去修复，还是忽视？ ……这里面有非常多的人物动向可以被讲述，而因为离婚的动作还没有真正完成，所以我们还有探讨的空间。第三季的嘉宾应该说是最贴合我最早的方案，都还没有离完。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前两季也基于这样的一个构想，我们挑选的人至少在我们判断中没有冷透，冷透了就没有故事可讲。离婚太久的也不行，最好是两三年以内，这两个人还时不时有一些来往，甚至有人提出过复合等等，还有牵绊，还有诉求，还有一些困惑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在日常生活中，看别人的事儿都很清晰，看自己的事儿总是能拖就拖，说不定又好了。没有一个巨大的事件作支撑，人不太容易在一种相对平缓起伏的情绪中手起刀落。大家意识不到深层次的裂痕，哪有力量来觉察这个，谁会没事拿个x光照自己的情感？很多人要么出于恐惧，要么出于懒惰、逃避。差不多行了，老说这些干嘛，多矫情。尤其男性在关系里面更常见的就是这种，有什么可探讨的？我要出去喝酒。我好多同事，公司好多事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沟通和交流很多时候是两个人的事，不是单方面的选择，假如我跟别人讲，我想跟我的爱人聊一聊我们这八年来的婚姻里的问题，但他不跟我好好聊，所以我要跟他离婚，别人可能说你有病。但是放在《再见爱人》这个场域，再细小的问题都会被重视，大家就会来讨论，那你这个要怎么聊啊，你这个婚该不该离啊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《再见爱人》把亲密关系里的很多问题做了一个聚焦，我拿放大镜打了这块地方，大家都说你这个问题好像真的值得重视。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这至少是给困在婚姻里的人、想进婚姻的人、想要聊这些又不好意思的人一些抓手，我不再羞愧，我今天想要跟你聊一聊，我们沟通你对我的忽视。我不会觉得这非常突兀，我不会觉得羞耻，这是健康的，这也是一种勇气，也是一种勇敢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;为什么选择的旅行目的地多在景色很美、但相对人迹罕至的地方？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;选这些地方一方面是好看。原始、自然的美景很重要，人想不通的时候都应该去接触一下自然，但是很少有人这么做。而我们选的地方，就是希望可以长久地停留，让他们非常艰苦，又极致地感觉天地之大、人之渺小，是一种直观的心理暗示。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自然还是有很强的疗愈作用。我们努力创造一个高纯度的（拍摄）环境，让他们放心进入深水区探讨。这个过程并不容易，美景是一种短暂的安慰，无论如何，他们是非常非常勇敢的一群人。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我必须得理解他为什么这一刻要做这样的事。他为什么有这个感受？为什么做这样的判断？肯定不能百分百共情，但在这个过程中，什么是值得提出的问题？这些可以通过训练培养，就是提问直觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我觉得我没结过婚是好事。我接触过一些同行，听说我要做这个题材，特别想跟我聊，聊下来我觉得每个人都太聚焦自我了，很容易下定论，“婚姻就是什么”，像这样的句式我在那段时间听了非常多，千差万别，唯一的共性就是他们都非常相信自己在婚姻里的判断。这个时候我就清空，我不听任何人的话，我只把你们所有人的话当作一个样本来呈现，样本可以有很多内核让观众自己去总结。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果我已经有一段婚姻，我不敢保证自己会不会说这个不存在，因为在我的婚姻里没遇到这种情况，这太荒谬了，给他剪了。没有开放性的思维，是很危险的事情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爱肯定是千奇百怪有不同样子的。做节目的时候我也会回溯自己过往的关系，意识到我也犯过这样那样的错。这是非常有意思的事，看别人都看得很清晰，说到自己，谁又是一个完美伴侣呢？所以反观自我，我觉得爱是一个长久的功课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我更期待我的感情观从真实的感情中来，而不是从节目里来。我希望《再见爱人》是辅料，它不应该是主菜，你要去感受具体的人真实的人，而不是一些道理。傅首尔已经非常会讲道理，王睡睡也非常会讲道理，但为什么她们还是过得没有那么开心呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;节目进展到现在，观众也感受到了很多欢笑的部分.但欢笑无法抵消婚姻中实质的痛苦。你认为“笑”的意义是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;痛苦就是痛苦。如果痛苦是往下的话，笑就是往上提溜一下。可能增加一点抵御痛苦的能量，或者让人更清晰地俯视痛苦的全貌。笑着应对痛苦就很艺术，木心说的，人从悲伤之中落落大方走出来，就是艺术家。这个笑就是一种落落大方。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmMsEze0OeD4DDlhxS62rJ0TiM23umaiU2JTGhDs.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;当时觉得年轻人太容易放弃了。我以前也很喜欢劝人家要清醒，但是当越来越多的人都在说要清醒、要放弃，这个没什么大不了的时候，我就觉察到这可能是新的风潮，我们在讨论的时候就说再把这些想要分手的人拉到一块。 “再来聊聊”这个行为本身是否有点老土，是否有点不符合年轻人当下“我永远要去找新的人”这样一个现状？所以我们才说再见是容易还是很难，想到了“再见”和“再见”，英文是“see you”和“see you again”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现代人太容易看到别人的瑕疵，没有办法进深水区，永远在浅水区打转，接触再多的人，个把月后全都一样，就很怀念会谈好几年恋爱的时候，那个时候好像人收获的滋养不一样。现在短视频都在教你，“他这样做你就要警惕”、“他不这样说就是不爱你”……这样的拆解非常粗暴。感情中还是有很多不可归因的部分。假如大家都被这些粗暴的逻辑影响，觉得咱们都在水面上玩玩就好了，这是很可惜的一件事情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在已经不需要谈恋爱就能够获得很多快乐的时代，还要去谈恋爱，这是一件极度浪漫的事情，我希望我能歌颂（这种爱情和浪漫）。以前的人结婚可能还有很多出于现实的需求，我需要一个人来跟我一起面对生活。但现在是，好像手机解决一切了，就算不谈恋爱不结婚，大家也能活得挺好。在这样的情况下，还要去寻找亲密关系，这是一件多么浪漫的事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你觉得人在这种情况下还要寻求亲密关系What is the reason? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;刘乐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;因为它真的很好，如果到过那片山，就明白那儿的风景是很好的，但是爬山的过程是很累的，希望大家不要因为这个累就不去爬了，不要觉得在地面上是最好玩的，地面上是安全的，是轻松的，是自在的，是ok的，但是你没有上去过，就不要说山上的风景我不稀罕。 《再见爱人》给大家展示了崎岖的山路，但大家还是可以去爬自己的山。认真付出的人会收获更多的风景，一定是这样的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;根据中国政府网信息，1994年，国家国有资产管理局成为财政部管理的国家局（副部级），主要任务是对中华人民共和国境内外的国有资产进行综合管理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1998年3月，国家国有资产管理局被正式撤销。 In the same year, the CPC Central Committee&#39;s large -scale enterprise work committee was formally established. During this period, state -owned enterprise management institutions changed several times until 2003 established the State -owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1998年机构变革之际，胡静林进入财政部财产评估司任职，而后担任财政部经济建设司司长、财政部办公厅主任、财政部新闻发言人等职位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国新办官网介绍，胡静林长期以来从事国有企业改革和宏观经济理论研究及实际工作，工作经验丰富，理论功底深厚，参与过多项财政、产业管理体制重大改革及宏观经济重要政策研究工作，著（译）有《国有企业改革和途径》《金融资产评估》《美国联邦政府预算》等多部论著。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2009年，胡静林任财政部部长助理、党组成员一职。五年后，升任财政部副部长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据澎湃新闻报道，升任财政部副部长时，胡静林分管办公厅、农业司、国家农业综合开发办公室、离退休干部局、信息网络中心、中国财税博物馆，协助时任财政部部长楼继伟分管国务院农村综合改革工作小组办公室。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在财政部任职期间，胡静林多次强调预算管理的重要性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年，胡静林在全国财政行政政法工作会议上强调，就预算而言，要增强预算的法制性和约束力，如何解决年初预算编制不细不准、年中预算调整频繁、年末预算结余过多的问题，“就需要会同部门建立起&#39;预算即是法&#39;的观念。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“绝不让医保基金成为&#39;唐僧肉&#39;”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;担任财政部副部长四年后，胡静林调任国家医疗保障局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年3月，十三届全国人大一次会议表决通过了关于国务院机构改革方案的决定，组建中华人民共和国国家医疗保障局（副部级），成为国务院直属机构。胡静林成为首任局长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时的国务院机构改革方案提出，将人力资源和社会保障部的城镇职工和城镇居民基本医疗保险、生育保险职责，国家卫生和计划生育委员会的新型农村合作医疗职责，国家发展和改革委员会的药品和医疗服务价格管理职责，民政部的医疗救助职责整合，组建国家医疗保障局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去几年，胡静林在任内积极推动解决老百姓用药难、用药贵等问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年3月，全国两会期间，胡静林在“部长通道”接受采访时表示，要通过优化目录结构，让更多救命救急的好药进入医保，以进一步缓解和减轻人民群众的用药难和用药贵问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月的国新办发布会上，胡静林介绍，五年来，国家医保局加快医保谈判节奏，推动卡瑞利珠单抗、诺西那生钠等一大批独家品种的抗癌药、罕见病用药以适宜价格纳入医保，加上报销后累计为患者减负超5000亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年，国家医保局官网曾刊登胡静林撰写的一篇文章，表示接下来要加强医保基金管理，继续深入开展打击欺诈骗保专项行动，对部分省份“回头看”工作进行抽查复查。此外，发挥举报奖励制度的威力，建立举报线索督办和反馈机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“用好协议管理制度，被解除协议的医药机构3年内不得再纳入医保定点。构建基金监管长效机制，&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;决不让医保基金成为新的&#39;唐僧肉&#39;&lt;/span>;。”胡静林介绍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上述国新办发布会上，胡静林表示医保基金是人民群众的“救命钱”，国家医保局始终将加强医保基金监管、维护基金安全作为首要任务，严厉打击各种违规违法使用医保基金的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“5年来，基本医疗保险基金（含生育保险）年度总收入由2.14万亿元增长至3.09万亿元，年度总支出由1.78万亿元增长至2.46万亿元，基金运行平稳，有所结余。”胡静林谈到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;王军任国家税务总局局长十年&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;中国政府网显示，现任国家税务总局局长王军出生于1958年，毕业于北京大学，获法学博士学位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1987年至2013年间，王军在财政部任职。 2013年3月，时任财政部党组副书记、副部长的王军，升任国家税务总局党组书记、局长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年，国家税务总局局长王军与卡塔尔税务总局局长举行会谈。图片来源：国家税务总局官网&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/0d9b6d6ebb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/0d9b6d6ebb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260049&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年，国家税务总局局长王军与卡塔尔税务总局局长举行会谈。图片来源：国家税务总局官网&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1993年年底，国务院发布文件称，为了适应国家税务工作，将国家税务总局的机构规格从副部级调整为正部级。 1994年1月，中国开始实施以分税制为核心的财税体制改革，中央财政收入得以大幅提升。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;分税制改革以来，国家税务总局历任五位局长，分别是刘仲藜、金人庆、谢旭人、肖捷、王军，其中王军任职时间最长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这五人均在财政部工作过，而且四人担任过财政部部长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘仲藜于1992年至1998年间任财政部部长、兼任税务总局局长，金人庆、谢旭人、肖捷均在国家税务总局局长任后担任了财政部部长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至目前，王军已担任国家税务总局局长十年，年龄达到了65岁。 2023年3月，王军当选第十四届全国政协常委。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾王军与胡静林的履历，两人曾在财政部共事十余年，都担任过财政部办公厅主任、新闻发言人、部长助理、副部长等职务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王军担任国家税务总局局长的十年里，中国税制改革不断深化，包括营改增、个税改革、国地税合并、减税降费等一系列动作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年10月起，个人所得税“起征点”从3500元/月提高到5000元/月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;五个月后，王军在全国两会的“部长通道”上表示，此次个人所得税改革带给工薪阶层的减税面是百分之百，其中约8000万人不用再缴个税，约6500万人减税70%以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同年，十三届全国人大一次会议通过了国务院机构改革方案，国务院将改革国税地税征管体制，将省级和省级以下国税地税机构合并，具体承担所辖区域内各项税收、非税收入征管等职责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1994年分税制改革建立了国税、地税两套税务机构的征管体制。运行24年后，国地税合并，建立了新的税收征管体制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于减税降费的效果，2023年国务院政府工作报告中总结道，“过去五年，累计减税5.4万亿元、降费2.8万亿元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[考公考研人数一升一降：替代还是互补，如何读懂两者间的关系？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261528]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;2023年11月26日，国考公共科目笔试开考。本次国考报名人数首次突破300万，共261.3万考生考前进行了报名确认、225.2万人实际参加考试，可谓空前。 In the vertical comparison, a total of 1.422 million people actually took the exam last year. From 2020 to 2024, the number of recruitments of the national examinations was about 24,100, 25,700, 312,000, 37,100, and 39,600, which rose steadily, but far from meeting everyone&#39;s application needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相形之下，今年是八年来考研人数首度下降，或显示大家的考研热度已完成筑顶。 This shows that the trend of entrance examination and postgraduate entrance examination partnery or probability event. Because for most people, the postgraduate entrance examination is to delay employment and push the employment choice for two or three years, with a view to the graduate degree to make themselves have a certain competitive advantage, but on the one hand, the employment situation is becoming more and more difficult.两三年后的研究生，后者在求职上未必有显著优势，另一方面获取研究生学历的机会成本越来越高，学硕改专硕意味着更高的学费开支。考公就不一样了，把用来考研、读研的时间与金钱用来考公，一年可以考多个地方，直到考上为止，“上岸”的概率会更高。两者此消彼长，显然是越来越多的人认为直接考公性价比更高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，考研与考公之间的关系是复杂的，除了有替代关系，还有互补关系。例如有一些人考研、读研之后，仍是为了考公，这是因为研究生学历能报考的公务员岗位更多，或者本科是双非，想要通过读985甚至更好学校的研究生，让自己的学历变得更高更有吸引力，额外还有一条选调生的从政通道，总之可以扩大自己的考公选择面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从国考岗位的招录要求看，学历的门槛有不断抬高的趋势。今年国考招录要求全部为大专及以上学历。在招录人数连年增加之下，要求大专学历为起点的岗位逐年减少，今年大专生可以报考的岗位有56个，同比减少106个。同时，要求硕博学历的岗位数量和计划人数大幅度增加。据中国青年报统计，今年要求硕士研究生及以上学历的岗位达2046个，同比增加814个；要求博士学历的岗位为24个，同比增加14个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何解释这一现象？一种常见的看法是，机关单位对高学历人才的需求增加了。这其实等于没有解释。难道这些岗位真的只有硕士学历及以上才能干得了吗？恐怕也未必。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在当前的就业环境下，体制内岗位的吸引力进一步增强：有“编制”、薪水体面、福利完备、社会地位高、工作稳定，只要不犯大的原则性错误无失业之虞。因此对这些岗位的竞争也会不断加剧。国考录取/参加考试人数比，去年为1∶38，今年为1∶57，热门岗位比例更夸张。当竞争加剧，筛选人才的一个主要抓手就自然可以是学历了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对体制内用人单位来说，同样招一个人，为什么不选学历更高、学校更好的？基于纯客观指标，这样相当于用同样的编制与成本得到了“更优秀的人才”，领导与公众都挑不出毛病。反而，要是放着学历更高、学校更好的人不招，招了学历与学校一般的，大概率需要向公众解释，为什么不是“萝卜招聘”，所招的人是最适合这个岗位的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放在这种逻辑与心态之下，不难理解下述被公众热议的现象：北大核物理博士获得城管编制，上海交大医学博士成为中学校医，哈佛大学硕士应聘教育部留学服务中心非事业编岗位。也不难理解体制内招录学历门槛为何会不断抬高：去年要求本科，结果招到了几个名校硕士；今年干脆全部要求硕士，人家愿意来，又不用多费钱，何乐不为？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确实，这和自由竞争行业的招聘逻辑很不一样。除非某些头部企业的研发部门，一般企业招人学历只是参考，关键看个人能力与品性同企业岗位需求是否匹配。学历过高，反而有over-qualification（资历过高）的问题。同样一个岗位，本科生可能比硕博干得更好，因为在企业看来，反正谁来都要接受职业培训，年轻是优势，头脑还没有僵化，敢于尝试与接受新鲜事物，上手快。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久前，有本科生吐槽，说以本科生身份求职得不到offer（邀约），伪装成高中生反而得到了很多offer。要高中生，不要“高材生”，是因为在企业看来，这份工作高中生足以完成，只要规规矩矩、老老实实按规程操作、听指令就行了，希望员工定下心来，保持工作稳定；如果找本科生，人家可能觉得自己大材小用，只是暂时将就，或会骑驴找马，不安心工作，何苦慕虚名而自找麻烦？一段时候后“高材生”走了，还得重新招人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，理解了体制内与自由竞争行业招人逻辑与心态的不同，学子们就可以决定到底需不需要读研，是本科就考公争取上岸还是读研让自己有更大的选择面。这些都是事实判断，而非价值判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，从长远看，鼓励最优秀的学子去从事创新、去自由竞争行业创造财富，并为之创造良好的制度环境和动力机制，这自然是社会之福、国家之blessing.一段时间以来，为激励民营经济发展，政府出台了诸多措施，最近就有八部门出台“支持民营经济25条具体举措”，这用力方向是对的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雷军向母校武大捐13亿背后：曾领两千奖学金立志万倍还回来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261522]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 29, Wuhan University celebrated its 130th anniversary.

Nandu reporters learned that when he was studying at Wuhan University more than 30 years ago, Lei Jun received a &quot;huge sum&quot; of 2,000 yuan and was determined to pay it back ten thousand times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7fb2543f6dfa9e1e8eee615866c61337.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;535&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7fb2543f6dfa9e1e8eee615866c61337.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259949&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;捐赠现场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned from Wuhan University that Lei Jun is a 1987 computer science alumnus of Wuhan University and the founder, chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Group. This donation mainly focuses on three directions: supporting research in the six basic disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature, history and philosophy, supporting scientific and technological innovation in the computer field, and supporting the training of college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Jun recalled that more than 30 years ago, as an outstanding student representative, he was awarded the highest scholarship at Wuhan University at that time, which was a full two thousand yuan, sponsored by a company. He said that for a student from an ordinary county family, this is really a huge sum of money. To this day, he still clearly remembers the excitement and pride he felt at that time. At that time, Lei Jun secretly swore in his heart, &quot;No matter how much scholarship I receive today, I will pay it back ten times, a hundred times, or ten thousand times in the future.&quot; In 1997, six years after graduation, Lei Jun started donating to his alma mater. At that time, his salary Only 4,000 yuan. He began his journey to fulfill his vow and donated money to establish the &quot;Lei Jun Scholarship&quot; (then called the &quot;Tengfei Scholarship&quot;) at the School of Computer Science. He has continued to donate for 26 years now. Lei Jun lamented that today he has finally fulfilled his wish to repay 10,000 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 29th, Lei Jun posted on Weibo to congratulate his alma mater on his birthday: Today is the 130th anniversary of Wuhan University. Happy birthday to my alma mater! He said, &quot;Every time I return to my alma mater, I feel very excited.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打造中国版甲骨文：易鲸捷与贵阳银行的双向冒险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261534]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Guiyang Bank Head Office Building.

Zhao Jilin/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the seventh floor of the head office building of Bank of Guiyang (601997.SH), there is a place where outsiders are prohibited from entering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The computer room covering an area of ​​more than 80 square meters is filled with large electronic display screens and computer terminals. All business operations and accounting processing related to deposits and loans need to be completed here. Supporting the operation of the entire set of equipment is the new core business transaction system that was just launched on November 6, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of banking core business transaction systems, foreign companies such as Oracle and IBM were once absolute monopolies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2020, an unknown startup company suddenly broke in. Guizhou Yijingjie Information Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yijingjie), founded in 2015, won the bid for the domestic database application project of Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system with a price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie plays two roles, one is the supplier of database products, and the other is the general contractor of the entire project. Its purpose is to create a full-stack core transaction system for domestic banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After its official launch, this high-profile trading system did not win praise. Instead, it pushed Yijingjie to the forefront. For a time, the Internet was flooded with comments such as &quot;fake domestically produced products&quot; and &quot;shelling Oracle&quot;, and Bank of Guiyang and Yi Jingjie became the target of public criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It may be very difficult for us to build a (database) nuclear weapon for daily use for the country, but we must take this risk.&quot; Li Jing, chairman of Yi Jingjie, spoke quickly He told a reporter from Southern Weekend, his voice was trembling. She looks very capable, with short hair, tattooed eyebrows, and a red coat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the moment, the &quot;nuclear weapons&quot; Li Jing talks about have not yet been put into production. He Xin, general manager of the Information Technology Department of the Bank of Guiyang, revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the current main database of the Bank of Guiyang is Oracle, and Yi Jingjie is used as a follow-up database, which is exactly the opposite of the original plan. &quot;I invested them all at once. To be honest, the risk will be relatively high.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of Guiyang Big Data Bureau, further explained to Southern Weekend reporters that due to the influence of negative public opinion on the Internet, superior supervision Out of the principle of prudent supervision, the department does not agree to the online launch of Yijingjie database for the time being. &quot;As long as the regulatory authorities relent, it can be launched in any minute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Delayed launch&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The biggest doubt from the outside world is whether Yi Wingjie, which started with distributed databases, can build a more technically difficult bank core transaction system database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The databases currently used in the financial industry are still mainly centralized, but distributed is the general trend and has computing advantages under massive data and high concurrency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The branch president of a state-owned commercial bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the difficulty in developing the bank&#39;s core transaction system database lies in the large amount of data that needs to be stored for many years and ensure that the system does not go down. In addition, each bank needs to do some customized development according to the needs of customers. For example, it has to open separate interfaces with the credit reporting system and tax system of the People&#39;s Bank of China, which &quot;has strict requirements for security.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years since Guiyang Bank purchased the Yijingjie database, it has not been able to go online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Wingjie was originally relatively optimistic about the launch time. According to the company&#39;s internal documents, the construction goals are divided into three stages:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of June 2020, achieve an average success rate of 99.999%, and successfully implement the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; plan for Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system in 2021. The main database uses the domestic Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the end of September 2021, the Yijingjie database for typical applications such as banking financial core, graphical front-end, process banking, and credit systems will be transformed and put online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third phase will comprehensively plan and transform the information system of Guiyang Bank, and realize the localization transformation of the full-scenario application system by the end of July 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information can also be seen that the launch time of Yijingjie database has been delayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, the evaluation report of Yijingjie’s shareholder China Software (600536.SH) showed that the core transaction main database purchased by Guiyang Bank is planned to be officially launched in the first half of 2022. Apparently it didn&#39;t happen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already two years later, in May 2023, that there was any further news. When accepting a survey from investors, the Bank of Guiyang stated that the Yijingjie domestic database application project has entered the testing phase and is advancing various testing tasks in an orderly manner. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, another investor asked about the progress of Yijingjie’s domestic database at the Bank of Guiyang’s third quarter performance briefing. Chairman Zhang Zhenghai replied, “The development of the new core business system of Bank of Guiyang has been completed. Testing work, the system has entered the online preparation stage, and the system is expected to be online from 17:00 on November 3, 2023 to 8:00 on November 6.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until November 6, Guiyang Bank issued an announcement stating that &quot;the new system has been successfully launched&quot;, but did not declare what database it adopted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the current situation of Yijingjie as a backup follower library, He Xin explained that for relatively mature bank core trading systems, it usually takes 18-24 months from research and development to launch. However, the Guiyang Bank project has many innovations, such as the full-stack core business system and the first application of eCas4.0 in the banking industry, so it takes a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also added that as early as the beginning of 2021, Guiyang Bank signed a contract with Oracle to allow Oracle and Yijingjie to run parallel databases to back up each other, creating a relatively safe structure. The performance of Yijingjie database is acceptable, but the database does not only rely on performance. &quot;If it is actually put online, we would like to test it more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie is located on the 24th floor of Tower C, No. 1 Gaoke. Zhao Jilin/Photo&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/7d85715829.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7d85715829. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259955&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yijingjie is located on the 24th floor of Tower C, No. 1, Gaoke. Zhao Jilin/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“No city dares to do this”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the top of Building C, No. 1 Gaoke, Changling South Road, High-tech Zone, Guiyang City, the big words “Big Data National Engineering Laboratory” are very Eye-catching, Yi Wingjie is located on the 24th floor of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Yijingjie, Internet companies such as NetEase Haowu and Qilin Software have settled here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of big data in Guizhou Province started in 2012. The development of the big data industry is considered by Guizhou as an excellent opportunity to change lanes and overtake. In 2015, the country established the country&#39;s first comprehensive big data pilot zone in Guizhou. One of its important tasks is to solve the security and independent controllability issues of China&#39;s big data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yi Jingjie, he has never had access to the core transaction system database of a bank before, so he faces great technical challenges. Similarly, for the Guiyang Municipal Government and Guiyang Bank, betting on Yijingjie is also a risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A representative of Guiyang State-owned Assets who once participated in the investment in Yijingjie revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that at the end of 2015, Guiyang State-owned Assets learned about Yijingjie and visited Yijingjie’s technical team, launching a long-term Half a year of due diligence, interviews included Tencent Music (NYSE: TME), the three major telecom operators, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before investing in Yijingjie, Yijingjie signed an agreement with Guiyang State-owned Assets, stipulating that Guizhou Yijingjie would be the headquarters, and Shanghai Yijingjie and American Yijingjie would be the subsidiaries of Guizhou Yijingjie. &quot;When we invested, we promised to invest 20 million yuan first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Guiyang government revealed to a Southern Weekend reporter that although Yi Jingjie is not well-known, it does distributed databases , the leaders at the time also saw it, the technology was relatively new. &quot;The problem with it is that no one uses it, and there is no actual application scenario verification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong said frankly that Guiyang&#39;s big data started slowly, but it can attract a database company and regard it as a treasure, or even treat it as a treasure. Unicorns to breed. &quot;No city in the country dares to do this. We take real application scenarios and let them verify the database.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016-2019, Guiyang Industrial and Information Industry Development Guidance Fund Co., Ltd. , Guiyang Service Outsourcing and Call Industry Venture Capital Fund Co., Ltd., Guizhou Provincial Venture Investment Promotion Center, Guiyang Comprehensive Bonded Zone Development Investment (Group) Co., Ltd., Gui&#39;an New Area Emerging Industry Development Fund (Co., Ltd.) and other state-owned industrial funds , successively became shareholders of Yijingjie by increasing capital, with a cumulative investment of 128 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people from the Guiyang Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the initial investment and introduction of Yijingjie was based on its overseas technology. According to the official website of Yijingjie, the company is &quot;one of the few domestic database manufacturers with independent core technology.&quot; The R&amp;D team originates from Tianteng Company, with 30 years of technology accumulation and a complete team structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie was initially chaired by Chinese-American Li Weichong, and Li Jing, as his Chinese wife, served as the legal representative. Li Weichong has a glorious resume. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and received dual doctorates in finance and computer chemistry. Before founding Yijingjie, Li Weichong served as a senior executive in Lucent, Accenture, HP, China Unicom and other companies. Among them, asking Yao Ming to endorse China Unicom New World has become a classic case of publicity and promotion model, which once caused a sensation in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to Li Weichong and his wife described to Southern Weekend reporters that Li Weichong is personable, has extraordinary conversation, and has a gentle personality. Li Jing is on the strong side and has been in the clothing business in her early years. After the establishment of Yijingjie, Li Jing also participated in the daily management of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The original architecture is basically that of a small multinational company.” A former employee of Yijingjie told Southern Weekend reporters that in the early days, Yijingjie was relatively leading in the field of integrated distributed databases, and many people in the team were Colleagues or students of Turing Award winner Jim Gray have a relatively luxurious technical lineup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American Yijingjie was born first in Guizhou Yijingjie, one was established at the beginning of 2015 and the other at the end of the year. In Li Jing&#39;s own words, he is a &quot;father who has his son first and then looks for him.&quot; &quot;My biggest request for the American team is to pass on the technology of database development to the domestic R&amp;D team. This matter is not a secret among the American team.&quot; Li Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie&#39;s headquarters is located in Guiyang High-tech Zone. Zhao Jilin/Photo&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 29/056f76c471.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/056f76c471.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259957&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yijingjie&#39;s headquarters is located in Guiyang High-tech Zone. Zhao Jilin/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small companies take on big projects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to verify the technical reliability of Yijingjie, the Guiyang government selected Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Behavior as pilot projects, starting with the sandbox project rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called sandbox refers to a virtual database environment used for development, testing and experimental purposes, which is completely isolated from the production environment database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin said that the original core business system of Guiyang Bank was built and launched in 2005, using IBM&#39;s Informix database. Because the system is aging, performance has dropped significantly, and operation and maintenance are worrying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An internal document obtained by Southern Weekend reporters also confirms this. The document mentioned, “In March 2020, the core system mistakenly placed the key synchronization program in the day change process, causing the day to be continuously and incorrectly switched at the end of the day, resulting in a large amount of production data disorder that day. More than a dozen engineers repaired it overnight. It took hours to resolve; a production accident occurred in May 2020, and UnionPay and core logic errors resulted in duplicate entries, resulting in a short payment in the bank.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin further explained that as the customer scale of Guiyang Bank increases, both the database and the application system have obvious deficiencies in business carrying capacity. In addition, in response to the country&#39;s requirements for the development of the credit innovation industry and the self-reliance of the bank&#39;s financial technology system, Guiyang Bank is also making local substitutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jingjie was keenly aware of this opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a work report to Li Zaiyong, the former vice governor of Guizhou Province, on January 14, 2019, Yi Jingjie said that promoting its database has great strategic significance: &quot;Solving the country&#39;s problems in finance and government affairs , communications and other core fields of information security issues; breakthroughs in the core basic technology of the database will drive the efficiency of the entire industry; replace the international database led by Oracle, which accounts for about 90% of the domestic market, and can be exported to the Belt and Road Initiative and even the European and American markets, from These two perspectives can effectively reduce China&#39;s service trade deficit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiyong instructed that from the perspective of institutional support, efforts should be made to build Yijingjie into an innovative platform for the development of Guizhou&#39;s big data industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate on November 21, 2023, Li Zaiyong&#39;s suspected bribery and abuse of power case was concluded by the National Supervisory Commission and transferred to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution. However, the news did not disclose whether Li Zaiyong&#39;s fall was related to Yi Jingjie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee of Yi Jingjie who has worked with Li Weichong and his wife for many years told Southern Weekend reporters that unlike Li Weichong, Li Jing has particularly outstanding planning skills and can grasp the core needs of customers. &quot;She clearly understands what the Bank of Guiyang, Guiyang Municipal Government and participating manufacturers want, and has strong ability to make decisions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 2, 2019, the core business of Guiyang Bank&#39;s domestic database construction The sandbox testing system project was sold, with Yijingjie becoming the sole supplier, and the winning bid price was 43.98 million yuan. According to the announcement, this procurement adopts a single-source procurement method because &quot;according to project construction requirements, procurement can only be from a single supplier.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why use single-source bidding? He Xin said that Guiyang Bank&#39;s procurement is based on the &quot;Interim Provisions on the Management of Centralized Procurement of State-owned Financial Enterprises&quot; implemented by the Ministry of Finance on February 5, 2018. &quot;If we violate the law, I think we can be held accountable according to law. If we comply with the law, I think it will be No problem, no further explanation is needed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the project plan, Guiyang Bank uses the Yijingjie database to build a core business sandbox test application system, using the system as a sandbox for the existing core business system, and using the transactions of the core business system on the sandbox Data, carry out the testing and verification work of Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 8 of the same year, Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank purchased another project of Yijingjie - a domestic database application pilot, with a transaction amount of 123 million yuan. This project adopts the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; solution with mutual backup and free switching, and has been officially accepted in May 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A project leader of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the dual-bank parallel plan has three stages. In the first stage, Oracle is used as the main database, in the second stage, Yi Jingjie is used as the main library, and in the third stage, Oracle is completely excluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge admitted that Yi Jingjie has not yet become the main warehouse. “We must first admit the gap, then push our own things up, and let others stand guard for us for a while. , this is a more cautious approach.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee structure of Yijingjie obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that Yijingjie was still a start-up company with a small scale when it received the bank order. From 2017 to 2019, the number of employees was 69, 100, and 144 respectively. Among them, there are 46, 74 and 105 technical personnel respectively. There are less than 20 people with master&#39;s degrees in the company, and only one with a doctorate. In addition, Yi Jingjie has a team of more than 30 people in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, according to the China Software Shareholders’ Equity Assessment Report, from 2017 to June 2021, Yijingjie’s R&amp;D expenses totaled 62.8922 million yuan, of which the R&amp;D expenses in 2017 were 0, and in 2018 they were only 1.03 million. , it was 19.6471 million yuan in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Most of the revenue is outsourced&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the surface, Yijingjie won large orders from Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank in the early stage. But in fact, Yi Wingjie did not gain much benefit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An insider told Southern Weekend reporters that of the 123 million yuan order signed by Yi Jingjie and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, the self-owned product part was only 25.9709 million yuan, accounting for 21.11%; with Guiyang Bank Among the contract value of 43.98 million yuan signed, the self-owned product part was only 10.9251 million yuan, accounting for 24.84%. Most of its revenue is achieved through outsourcing, and even some of its external procurement revenue costs are inverted, causing the company to suffer heavy losses year after year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the asset appraisal report issued by Zhongrui Shilian Asset Appraisal Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Zhongrui Shilian) in January 2021, from 2017 to 2019, Yijingjie’s operating income (parent company caliber ) were 2.2858 million yuan, 15.0113 million yuan and 91.5668 million yuan respectively; net profits (parent company caliber) were -1.8598 million yuan, 4.0166 million yuan and -49.3269 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it doesn’t make money in the early stage, why does Yijingjie need to develop a more difficult core banking transaction business system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Yijingjie shareholder told Southern Weekend reporters that although Li Jing claimed to have a strong sense of mission for information security, the actual situation was that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to seek transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From October to November 2019, Yi Jingjie’s capital chain was in crisis. The company had no money in its accounts and could not even pay wages for a time. Li Jing and shareholder Peng Yimin also repeatedly offered 6% of their annual income. Lending funds to Yi Jingjie at interest rates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned shareholders revealed that during the early years of Yi Jingjie&#39;s business, although it had customers such as China Unicom and China Mobile, the amount of a single order was not large, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of yuan. Li Jing once said at more than one internal meeting, &quot;When will this end?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side of the Pacific, in the United States, the company&#39;s annual sales revenue is only two to three hundred thousand US dollars, but the team&#39;s annual expenses exceed US$5 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the husband and wife have different positions on the development of the bank&#39;s core transaction system and database. Li Weichong objected many times, and company CEO Ding Hong also firmly opposed it. &quot;But Li Jing saw the market and insisted on doing it.&quot; said the above-mentioned shareholder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to Li Weichong told Southern Weekend reporters that Li Weichong has a very cautious character, and the company&#39;s losses have continued to increase, and he is unwilling to bet on the bank&#39;s core trading system. His differences with Li Jing have become increasingly serious. big. On October 7, 2019, Li Weichong and Li Jing agreed to divorce. Li Weichong stepped down as chairman and handed over all of Yi Jingjie, which he founded, to Li Jing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to Yi Jingjie’s many questions, Southern Weekend reporters contacted Li Weichong many times, but he declined the interview on the grounds of “inconvenience.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, Li Jing held a meeting in the underground conference room of her home in Beijing. A total of more than 20 company backbones and representatives of Guiyang state-owned assets attended, but Li Weichong and Ding Hong, who represented the American team, were excluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A shareholder who attended the meeting told Southern Weekend reporters that at this meeting, Li Jing requested a comprehensive transformation of the company, based on the core banking business, and decided to leave the US team. Li Jing also said at the meeting, &quot;This is the direction of the company and where it makes money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The more you understand technology, the more you know its boundaries. The less you understand technology, the more you dare to rush.” The above-mentioned former employee commented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who has participated in Yijingjie’s financing told Southern Weekend reporters that the divestment of the US team has a lot to do with Encore (safety and reliability). &quot;Later we learned that if you want to build a core business system, you must first pass Encore. If you can&#39;t pass this level, don&#39;t be a bank core.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Yi Jingjie raised $1.92 million for Price achieved full ownership of American Easy Whale Jet. Then, the U.S. team disbanded, clearing the last obstacle to the localization of Yi Jingjie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, 2020, Guizhou Sunshine Equity Exchange announced that the Guiyang Bank’s core business system Yijingjie domestic database application project was completed for a total price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin revealed that the project involves the entire business chain, from front-end and back-end to core, disaster recovery system, network, monitoring and management platform, security and other related projects, involving more than 20 suppliers. Among them, the amount of the Yijingjie database project is only more than 40 million yuan, accounting for more than 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Become a &quot;national team&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For a software startup company, sufficient ammunition is needed to maintain this &quot;money-burning&quot; game. Yi Jingjie&#39;s approach is to marry with Chinese software and become a &quot;national team&quot; in the database field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Software is a large-scale high-tech central enterprise controlled by China Electronics Information Industry Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as China Electronics). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, when Li Jing took over Yi Jingjie, she began to discuss investment matters with China Electronics. In May 2020, China Electronics and Yijingjie reached an exclusive investment intention, and will complete the investment in Yijingjie in two steps: first, acquire part of the original shares of Yijingjie held by Li Jing through China Software, and then complete a further capital increase. Expansion of shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, China Software officially invested in Yijingjie and held 7.6438% of Yijingjie’s equity at a consideration of 56,789,702 yuan. One year later, China Software decided to increase its capital, and planned to adopt the method of direct investment + investment by the newly established holding subsidiary &quot;ChinaSoft Financial Investment&quot;. At the price of 22.91 yuan/1 yuan of registered capital, the total investment will not exceed 389 million yuan (based on equity Calculated, the actual investment does not exceed 181.9213 million yuan), and the subscription for Yijingjie will increase the maximum registered capital by 16.9723 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the evaluation report of Zhongrui Shilian, China Software’s capital increase in Yijingjie is nearly 18 times higher than the book value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 21, 2023, the China Software Board of Directors issued an announcement stating that the company had moderately controlled the actual investment payment progress out of considerations of prudence and investment risk control. As of November 10, 2022, the company paid an additional capital of 17.91 million yuan to Yijingjie, and ChinaSoft Financial Investment paid an additional capital of 47.24 million yuan, and the total shareholding ratio increased to 11.09%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This investment amount is far from the original plan of &quot;the total investment shall not exceed 389 million yuan, and the total holding shall not exceed 25% of the equity of Yijingjie&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 17, the Beijing Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a warning letter to Zhongrui Shilian, stating that Yi Jingjie’s “operating income forecast data is insufficiently based”. In the first assessment project, the feasibility of the profit forecast data provided by the company was not fully analyzed and reviewed, and in the second assessment project, the reasons for the delay of Yijingjie&#39;s large orders and the impact on future earnings were not fully paid attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the warning letter mentioned that &quot;expressions such as &#39;first&#39; were clearly used in the two evaluation reports, but there was insufficient evidence in the manuscript to support the relevant expressions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Yijingjie has had no major financing trends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who has worked for Yijingjie for many years told Southern Weekend reporters that Yijingjie&#39;s early converged distributed databases were relatively advanced, but with the rapid rise of other companies, Yijingjie&#39;s technical advantages have gradually declined. No longer, there are also some problems with the company&#39;s strategy. &quot;In the final analysis, it must be launched quickly, and then attract resources and expand the R&amp;D team. How can a world-class technology rely on a small company of one or two hundred people to gain a leading position?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The competition for domestic databases is intensifying. , now Renmin University Jincang, Dameng, Nanda General Motors and Shenzhou General Motors are known as the &quot;Four Golden Flowers&quot; of domestic databases. New entrants include not only IT giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, but also small entrepreneurial manufacturers targeting market segments, such as Xinghuan and Pingcap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another former employee who was responsible for Yijingjie’s financing pointed out that even if the company wanted to go public, it would be difficult to meet the standards. One is that the income is not up to standard, and the other key problem is a single customer. Apart from the Bank of Guiyang and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, Yijingjie basically has no big customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee of Yijingjie revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that since October, Yijingjie has begun to lay off employees one after another, citing &quot;financing issues and normal personnel optimization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
