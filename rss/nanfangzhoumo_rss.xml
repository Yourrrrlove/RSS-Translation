The witchcraft disaster occurred in the second year of Zhenghe (91 BC). ——Witchcraft was a popular method at that time to use witchcraft to curse others. A common method was to pierce small wooden figures and bury them in the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian stated that the time when this incident occurred was not within the coverage of &quot;Historical Records&quot;. Even Ban Gu, who lived more than a hundred years later, probably because he was too sensitive, deliberately did not speak too clearly. In the biographies of the characters involved, the &quot;Hanshu&quot; talks so much that you can only read it after putting it together. Give a rough idea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was a man named Jiang Chong who frantically framed the prince for using witchcraft to curse Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. The prince had no choice but to rebel. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty asked Prime Minister Liu Quyou to command the army and fight the prince in Chang&#39;an City, and tens of thousands of people died. The prince was defeated and fled, eventually dying outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian had two good friends involved in this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is Ren An, who was the &quot;envoy of the Northern Army&quot; at the time and controlled the largest army in Chang&#39;an City. When the prince rebelled, he sent a military talisman in an attempt to transfer troops to Ren An, but Ren An stayed behind closed doors after receiving the military talisman. This matter was considered by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to be &quot;double-minded&quot;, so Ren An was beheaded by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is Tian Ren, who is the Secretary of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office (an official under the Prime Minister&#39;s Office, responsible for supervising lawlessness, with a rank of two thousand stones, and is a senior official). At that time, he was assigned to guard the easternmost Fu&#39;an in the south of Chang&#39;an City. Door. The prince fled to this door, and he allowed the prince to escape. This crime is of course more serious and is also cut in half. Even the person who initially interceded for Tian Ren was so frightened that he committed suicide when Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sima Guang’s version: A traitor drives a wedge between father and son&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian was working as a secretary to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty at that time, but he could only watch his friend being executed and did not dare to Say more words. In fact, there are also some very fragmentary records of witchcraft cases in &quot;Historical Records&quot;, which basically do not talk about the incident itself, but mainly focus on the ending of the people involved. There are always different opinions on whether these contents were written by Sima Qian or added by later generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Song Dynasty more than a thousand years later, when Sima Guang wrote &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, based on Ban Gu&#39;s outline, he finally provided us with a complete and logical account of the witchcraft incident. A narrative that is rigorous, coherent, with strong conflicts and rich in details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This story tells the story of the conflict between a talented but cruel father and a less talented but kind-hearted prince. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty hoped to finish all the most difficult things during his lifetime, leaving a country in need of rest and recuperation for his son to govern. This just happens to be the perfect combination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, those who specifically helped Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty carry out brutal tasks knew that they would be doomed once the prince ascended the throne. So they tried every possible means to sabotage this plan. The most vicious one among them was Jiang Chong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty hoped to reach an understanding with his son again and again, but treacherous ministers and villains pushed the prince to a dead end while sending the wrong message to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Finally a catastrophe occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After knowing the truth, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty punished the treacherous minister and expressed his longing for the prince in his womb. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very sad, touching and educational story. Imagine that with Ban Gu&#39;s character, if you could read this story a thousand years later, you would probably express your appreciation instead of criticizing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many books and TV programs introducing Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty are based on the story of Sima Guang. Some people even extend it further, such as adding Sima Qian into this story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, this version of a traitor driving a wedge between father and son is cute, but I’m afraid it’s not believable. In the following, we use historical data as a basis, combined with our understanding of the operation of power and human nature, to peel off the cocoons and present the truth of the witchcraft disaster as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Liu Kun: Between Liu Zheng and Liu Fuling&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Let’s start with the son of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. In order to introduce the six sons of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Ban Gu wrote &quot;Biography of the Five Sons of Wu&quot; and Sima Qian wrote &quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Biography of the Five Sons of Wu&quot; writes about the five sons of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, which is natural. Because there is another son, Emperor Zhao of Han, who inherited the throne, naturally he should not be placed with others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot; only writes about three sons, which is a bit strange; and the content of this article is also very abnormal. It only copies the relevant documents when the three princes were canonized as princes and kings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course there is a lot of debate as to why this is the case. But the title &quot;Family of Three Kings&quot; was decided by Sima Qian himself, there is no doubt about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three people mentioned in this article are: the second son of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, King Qi Liu Hong, the third son King Yan Liu Dan, and the fourth son King Guangling Liu Xu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three people not mentioned are: the eldest son Liu Zhi, the crown prince of Wei, the fifth son Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, and the youngest son Liu Fuling, who later became Emperor Zhao of Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A simple explanation is that the first three were crowned kings on the same day in the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC), and no other people were involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can also make more complicated guesses: Ban Gu was from the Eastern Han Dynasty, so he naturally knew who succeeded him as emperor; Sima Qian was a person involved in the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. When he wrote &quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot;, he did not write All three of them have the possibility of inheriting the throne, and it is not appropriate to include them in the family. Even if the three people are included, it is inconvenient to say a lot of things. The only way to be safe is to copy official documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, only Liu Zhi and Liu Fuling are important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eldest son Liu Ju was born in the first year of Yuanshuo (128 BC) and was regarded as the natural heir to the throne for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youngest son Liu Fuling was born in the third year of Taishi (94 BC), and finally won the victory in the competition for the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, was roughly twenty years younger than Liu Ju and more than ten years older than Liu Fuling. The information about him is almost blank even in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. Because of this large blank, some people think that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty never paid attention to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the blank space may also be due to sensitivity. After all, Liu Kun&#39;s mother was Mrs. Li, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s favorite woman, and Liu Kun&#39;s uncle was Li Guangli, who was madly throwing resources and opportunities at him. In addition, the time of Liu Kuang&#39;s death is also very sensitive. Different places in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; have slightly different accounts. Anyway, it was either before Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty died, or when Emperor Zhao of the Han Dynasty just ascended the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The beauty hidden in the golden house” is actually a political marriage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is easy to put aside the folk gossip such as “the beauty hidden in the golden house” and only rely on &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Hanshu&quot; as the basis. We can conclude that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and his first queen, Chen, were completely political marriages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Chen&#39;s mother, Princess Guantao, was the sister of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty and the daughter of Empress Dowager Dou. She had huge political influence. It can be said that among the sons of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, whoever married the daughter of Princess Guantao received important bonus points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty cleverly seized the opportunity and facilitated this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty taking the throne, the power was in the hands of his grandmother, the Queen Mother Dou. Because of a reckless political reform, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was almost deposed. His ability to keep the throne was also related to the eldest princess. Because the old lady&#39;s favorite was this daughter (so she later &quot;leaves all the money and property of the Edom Palace to the eldest princess for prostitution&quot;), she does not need to care about this grandson (there are a lot of them anyway), but she cannot harm her daughter&#39;s son-in-law too much (if the daughter, If the granddaughter is very satisfied with him). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So later Princess Guantao could simply say: &quot;The emperor cannot be established except for me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, for a period of time, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty could be said to be under Empress Chen under the protection of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Qian Gang&#39;s dictatorship, for a talented and arrogant emperor like Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, I am afraid that when he thinks of this past event, he is not grateful, but humiliated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Chen simply did not understand the emperor&#39;s psychology and did not take care of his emotions. &quot;Historical Records&quot; said that she was &quot;arrogant&quot;, and &quot;Hanshu&quot; said that she was &quot;good at pampering and arrogant&quot;. This pampering probably does not mean doting, but means high status. Because the character of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty is obviously that if you are arrogant because of my favor, it doesn&#39;t matter; if you are arrogant because of your status, it will be very serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it is only a matter of time before the queen is deposed. In the case of deposing the queen, cruel officials like Zhang Tang must be sentenced severely and try their best to implicate the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Historical Records&quot;, the queen of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was introduced as Wei Zifu at the beginning, and then used a narrative technique to tell everyone that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty also had an empress Chen. This reflects the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. atmosphere. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; honestly follows the chronological order, and Empress Xiaowu Chen and Empress Xiaowuwei wrote it this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Prince Liu Zhi survived the first round of challenges&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Historical Records&quot;, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty seemed to only be so fond of his second queen, Wei Zifu. I suddenly saw her in a specific environment, liked her very much, and then brought her into the palace. Then I actually forgot about her for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Wei Zifu was undoubtedly the lucky star of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. She brought Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty three daughters and one son, but more importantly, she also brought two dazzling famous generals, Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning, Wei Qing got the opportunity to lead troops in the war because he was the younger brother of Queen Wei Zifu; but within a few years, it probably became that because he was the sister of General Wei Qing, Wei Qing Zihu&#39;s status as queen was not shaken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Qing has great martial arts skills and is irreplaceable; Wei Qing is also gentle and low-key, and is good at getting along well with all parties. In the sixth year of Yuanshuo (123 BC), Wei Qing took advantage of the remaining power of his two major victories over the Huns and humbly took out half of the reward given to him by the emperor to celebrate the birthday of the parents of Mrs. Wang, who was favored by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Obviously, Mrs. Wang has posed a strong challenge to Wei Zifu&#39;s status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the years when Mrs. Wang was favored, Sima Qian was working as a Langguan in the palace. Later, Mrs. Wang passed away, and a young alchemist from Qi called upon Mrs. Wang&#39;s spirit for Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Sima Qian also observed it at close range. He was obviously particularly impressed by how much Mrs. Wang was loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Wang was also born at the wrong time. Her status in the heart of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty may have surpassed that of Wei Zifu, but she was favored at the time when Wei Qing and Huo Qubing were indispensable to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. era. In the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC), before his death, Huo Qubing asked Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to make three princes besides the prince king, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian was known for his &quot;curiosity&quot;, but when it came to writing about the harem of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he was quite strict. Therefore, some details have to be filled in by others: Mrs. Wang was ill at that time, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty asked her, where do you want me to seal your son? Mrs. Wang said about Luoyang, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that Luoyang was really not good, &quot;There is no country in Guandong that is larger than Qi. Qidong faces the sea and has a large city. In ancient times, it was alone in Ganzhong with 100,000 households. There is no country in the world that is richer than Qi.&quot; , let your son be the king of Qi. After Mrs. Wang passed away, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty specially gave her the status of Queen Mother of King Qi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Chu Shaosunbu’s story is to be believed, if Mrs. Wang proposed to grant Luoyang to her son, then if her consciousness was not too low, then it was clearly out of anger; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty seemed to feel a little guilty towards Mrs. Wang. , maybe he promised her something but failed to fulfill it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any case, Wei Zifu and Prince Liu Zhi survived the first round of challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;beautiful city and country&quot; Mrs. Li&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The next few years when Mrs. Li was most favored were roughly the Yuanfeng period (110 BC to 105 BC). During this period, Sima Qian After ending his career as a Langguan, he went to serve as Taishi Ling, and he distanced himself a little from the affairs in the palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extent of Mrs. Li&#39;s favor cannot be seen from &quot;Historical Records&quot;. But when Ban Gu wrote about Mrs. Li, his heart was about to burst with gossip:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, Ban Gu said that the first person whom Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty appreciated was Mrs. Li’s brother Li Yannian. Li Yannian sang such a song: &quot;There is a beautiful woman in the north, peerless and independent. She looks at the Qingren city and then the Qingren country. It is better not to know the Qingcheng and the Qingguo. It is hard to find a beautiful woman again!&quot; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sighed after hearing this and said Is there really such a beautiful person in the world? So Princess Pingyang, the sister of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (wei Zifu was also recommended by her, which was considered her profession) recommended Mrs. Li to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. From then on, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty loved him very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Ban Gu said that Mrs. Li was seriously ill and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty came to see her. Mrs. Li covered herself in the quilt and said that I had been seriously ill for a long time and was &quot;disfigured&quot; and could not see the emperor. My wish was that the emperor could take good care of my son and brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to see Mrs. Li&#39;s face very much, but Mrs. Li refused. In the end, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty left angrily. Mrs. Li&#39;s sisters blamed her, why did she make the emperor so angry? Mrs. Li said, I don&#39;t let the emperor see me as I am now, it is for the sake of my brother. &quot;A husband who treats others with sex will lose his lust and love to relax. If he loves to relax, he will not be kind.&quot; If he can&#39;t see me now, the emperor You will always remember my most beautiful appearance; when you see me now, you will only dislike me from now on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This classic case is often cited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the story about the young man summoning Mrs. Wang’s soul was taken by Ban Gu and placed in Mrs. Li’s body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourthly, Ban Gu said that after seeing Mrs. Li&#39;s soul, &quot;he wrote a poem of his own to mourn Mrs. Li.&quot; This is a very long piece with many difficult words to understand, so I won’t copy it here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone can make up gossip stories. Writing love poems for emperors is also a hobby of many literati. Therefore, the above four points recorded by Ban Gu are all true or false. Very adventurous. But again, there are so many jokes about Mrs. Li, which shows that in people&#39;s minds, Mrs. Li was the most important woman in the eyes of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, if there is any doubt about the authenticity of the above things, then the following two things will never be ignored by a historian of Ban Gu’s level: First, after Mrs. Li’s death, “after the She was buried with the ceremony of a queen; secondly, after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty passed away, Huo Guang knew the emperor&#39;s thoughts and &quot;used Mrs. Li as food, and she was given the honorary title of Queen Xiaowu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Li is treated as a queen, so what should her son be? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, the song &quot;Total Country and City&quot; sounds like a prophecy no matter how you listen to it. As we all know, Chinese history books have a characteristic. Prophecies may be made up, but once the prophecy is written down, it will come true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what kind of disastrous consequences did Mrs. Li cause to deserve such a prophecy that she would conquer the country and conquer the city? Of course, there is only the scourge of witchcraft. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The decline of Wei&#39;s relatives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, Ban Gu left many other clues, and these records happened to be able to compare with Sima Qian&#39;s previous history. Narrative, perfectly connected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let us return to the vulgar palace fight plot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Li has the greatest luck: it is not that Wei Zifu has become older and more beautiful, but that the two obstacles of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing no longer exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huo Qubing died in the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC). Although Wei Qing lived until the fifth year of Yuanfeng (106 BC), he never led an army. Because during the Yuanding and Yuanfeng years, the opponents faced by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty were no longer the Xiongnu at their peak. For enemies like South Vietnam, East Vietnam, and North Korea, other generals are enough to control the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this does not mean that the obstacles have been completely removed. The generals who are now active are also closely related to Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. Wei Qing brought out a dozen generals, and Huo Qubing trained two. General Han Henghai, who played an important role in destroying East Vietnam, said that General Xun Shen, who destroyed North Korea, as well as Gongsun He, Gongsun Ao and others, were all under Wei Qing&#39;s command at that time. Lu Bode, the general who destroyed South Vietnam, and Zhao Ponu, who captured King Loulan alive, came from the Huo Qubing system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the so-called Wei Qing does not support scholar-bureaucrats, mainly refers to the fact that he does not support famous speakers, activists, and knights in Chang&#39;an City. After fighting for so many years and making decisive decisions in the army, of course he still You have to train your own team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also worth noting that the Li Guang family. Although Li Guang’s death is believed to be related to Wei Qing, and Li Guang’s son Li Gan is even believed to have died at the hands of Huo Qubing, the Li and Wei families quickly Relationships repaired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guang&#39;s cousin Li Cai got the title of marquis because he fought with Wei Qing; even Li Gan himself was able to &quot;confer the title of Marquis of Guannei&quot; under Huo Qubing. Then Li Gan&#39;s daughter became the favored woman of Prince Wei, and Li Gan&#39;s son Li Yu was also the favored subordinate of Prince Wei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are these people a political group? When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was around, and the status of the prince remained unshakable, it would not count, because the relationship between them was also complicated and full of contradictions; but if Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty changed the prince, they would be: because the new prince would have a new team, they would have to make room for them. seat. Just like back then, the conflict between Xiao He and Cao Shen was once great, but once Liu Bang wanted to abolish Emperor Hui of Han and replace Emperor Hui of Zhao with Liu Ruyi, they were old brothers in the same trench again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Li family’s relatives did not live up to expectations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The following is a guess I made based on the above historical data:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuan Feng (110 BC ~ 105 BC) In a certain year of , Mrs. Li passed away. From then on, she became the most beautiful image in the heart of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty believed that Mrs. Li was the queen, so he wanted to change Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, to the crown prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was about fifty years old at this time. His energy may not be as good as before, but he was undoubtedly more foresighted and sophisticated. He would not rush to express his position on such an important matter, and would not even reveal much of his thoughts. That would directly lead to the failure of the original military and political system, which is not worth it anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of Taichu (104 BC), Li Guangli was appointed as the general of the Second Division and commanded a war that lasted four years and overloaded the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the war was going to be fought, but Li Guangli was in charge of it. To say that &quot;the noble prince favors his concubine Li&quot; is an understatement. I just want Li Guangli to be made a marquis, and let him cooperate with a general like Zhao Ponu to fight an easy war like the Loulan Conquest. The reason for making him a marquis is enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Li Guangli&#39;s headquarters, although the origins of Zhao Shicheng, Li Duo, and Shangguan Jie are not very clear, there are no veteran generals under Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to cultivate a new military merit group led by Li Guangli and unrelated to Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. In this way, even if the prince changes in the future, it will not cause too much shock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Li Guangli was too unsatisfactory. The conquest of Dayuan was a tragic victory that outweighed the gains, and the defeat of the Huns was a disastrous defeat again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, today&#39;s researchers may think that Li Guangli&#39;s ability is not that bad. The experience of later generations shows that the limit of the Central Plains dynasty&#39;s power to advance westward was the eastern foot of the Pamir Plateau. Li Guangli&#39;s conquest of Dayuan exceeded this limit. When fighting against the Xiongnu, the situation at this time was completely different from that during the Wei Qing and Huo Qubing era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this era, the strategic advantages of the Han Dynasty were incomprehensible to the Huns, so no matter how they won the war, the Huns still sought peace talks with the Han Dynasty; It is almost impossible to explain: after the conquest of Dayuan, the problem of the Han Dynasty&#39;s shortage of horses was not alleviated but greatly intensified. The Huns&#39; mobility advantage became greater, so facing the Han army on the expedition, they only needed to avoid , snooping, tracking... Wait until you have to retreat, are close to home and are most exhausted, then suddenly launch a fatal blow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the wisest choice for the Han Dynasty was to defend and just watch the Central Plains get better day by day and the Xiongnu get worse day by day. But as long as the expedition is far away, replacing other generals will have no good results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not everyone will accept these views today, and people in the Han Dynasty would not think so. It is better to compare Li Guangli with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. It is more in line with human nature to heal the past and harm the present. Even those who looked down on Wei and Huo back then, their current mentality is &quot;There is no need to go back to Wen Jingshi, looking back at Huolin is already a loss&quot;, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was also gradually losing patience. It is a miracle that the emperor&#39;s love for a woman can last for so long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of the fourth year of the Han Dynasty (97 BC), Li Guangli once again conquered the Huns but failed. In the summer, Liu Kun was named the king of Changyi. Although it cannot be said that this is a determined fate, it is not a good sign after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Liu Fuling was born and &quot;Yao&#39;s mother gate&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the third year of Taishi (94 BC), Gou Yi and Zhao Jieyu gave birth to the sixty-three-year-old Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. A little prince Liu Fuling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the story of Lady Gouyi Zhao Jieyu, Ban Gu started to indulge in gossip again: When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was patrolling through Hejian County, it was not the officials but the &quot;spiritual seekers&quot; who discovered this strange thing. woman. Her hands were naturally clenched into fists and could not be opened. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty went up and touched them. Wow, the palms of the beautiful girl were open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are all clearly written by Ban Gu in the &quot;Book of Han·Biography of Wife&#39;s Relatives&quot;, and are almost exactly the same as the relevant content in &quot;The Story of Hanwu&quot;. &quot;The Story of Hanwu&quot; is pretended to be a work by Ban Gu, which is certainly not credible, but it is also unrealistic to think that Ban Gu wrote rigorous and precise history, while the other works are absurd novels. They are completely opposite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, it is said that Zhao Jieyu was pregnant with Liu Fuling for fourteen months. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that he heard that Yao also stayed in his mother&#39;s belly for fourteen months before being born. So the palace gate where Zhao Jieyu lived was named &quot;Yaomu Gate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao was a holy king in ancient times. He governed the world so well. Nowadays, another Yao is born in the world. Don’t you think it’s a pity that he is not allowed to become emperor? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this place, Sima Qian was actually quite cooperative with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. There are many legends about Yao. The version accepted by &quot;Historical Records&quot; is that Yao was the youngest son of Emperor Ku, and he succeeded to the throne of emperor after squeezing out all his brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, although the cinnabar mole in Mrs. Li&#39;s heart has not turned into mosquito blood, it does have a ray of fresh white moonlight shining into the emperor&#39;s life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, it was not only Wei Zifu and the prince who were nervous at this time, but also Li Guangli, whose fate was firmly bound to his nephew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking forward, the prince&#39;s back seems to be getting further and further away. Looking back, the contemporary Tang Yao is quickly approaching. If you don&#39;t want to be caught up by the person behind you, it&#39;s best to catch up with the person in front. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; How close are fellow Zhao people? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Fang Shiming is a senior scholar who is particularly good at discovering political groups based on people&#39;s place of origin. In traditional society, the relationship between people is particularly important except for blood ties. This method is of course not absolutely correct, but it does explain many problems. One of his papers teased out such a clue:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Li and Li Guangli&#39;s family are &quot;Zhongshan old advocates&quot;. Zhongshan is surrounded by Zhao. &quot;Historical Records·Huo Shi Biography&quot; introduces the customs of the world, which is also I put Zhao and Zhongshan together. Therefore, people from Zhongshan and Zhao are both from their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then let’s look at the characters who played an important role in forcing the prince to death in the witchcraft disaster:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is Prime Minister Liu Quya, who is the brother of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty The son of Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan - there are so many &quot;after Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan&quot; in the history books. It is rare that this one is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is actually not easy for the sons of princes and kings to become high officials in the court. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; says that &quot;I don&#39;t know where it started&quot;, but it also tells us that Liu Quya and Li Guangli were not only fellow Zhongshan fellows, but also their sons and daughters. (&quot;The Biography of Liu Quya&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were Hu cavalry stationed in Chang&#39;an City. When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and his son went to war, whoever could get the support of this army would win a key bargaining chip. The person who helped Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty kill the prince&#39;s envoy and take over the command of this army was called Ma Tong, who was the great-grandfather of Ma Yuan, General Fubo of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He had just moved to Maoling from Handan of Zhao State not long ago. living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And on the battlefield against the Huns, Ma Tong and Li Guangli fought together and had a close relationship. (&quot;Book of Han·Biography of the Xiongnu&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Tong&#39;s elder brother Ma Heluo was a good friend of Jiang Chong. (&quot;Book of Han·Jin Rixiu Biography&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jiang Chong bit the prince the hardest and was at the forefront. He was also from Handan, and the characteristics of their family were similar to those of the Zhongshan Li family. Likewise, he is also good at singing and dancing. As we all know, the entertainment industry has its own unique network of relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyway, what is certain is that in the second year of Zhenghe (91 BC), the prince was forced to death. In the third year of Zhenghe (90 BC), Li Guangli led an army to attack the Huns. When they reached Weiqiao, Li Guangli Liu Quyou said to see him off: &quot;I hope that the king will ask the king of Changyi to be the crown prince. If he is established as the emperor, why should the king worry?&quot; They were the beneficiaries of this disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in this year, someone reported to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty that Liu Qumo&#39;s wife was practicing witchcraft and cursing the emperor. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent relevant departments to investigate and interrogate, and believed that &quot;the crime was a serious crime&quot;, so Liu Quyou&#39;s entire family was wiped out. Li Guangli, who was fighting against the Huns at the front, heard the news and knew that returning to the Han Dynasty was also a capital offense, so he surrendered to the Huns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter sounds like Liu Quya’s wife is out of her mind. But the fact may be that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty knew that the prince was framed by them. But there is no problem in blaming Jiang Chong for framing the prince, but blaming it on the prime minister and the general of the second division. A series of intrigues inside the palace will be exposed, and countless rumors will be spawned, so we find another reason to deal with them. Anyway, at this time, the crime of witchcraft is , just like talking about corruption today, it is basically a sure shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not conjecture. In fact, Ban Gu wrote about it again. In the first year of Houyuan (88 BC), Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was about to collapse, and he inadvertently told the truth:&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The report said: &quot;I have been immoral. Since the Prime Minister Zuo (Liu Quyou) and the Second Master (Li Guangli) conspired to rebel, the disaster of witchcraft has spread to the scholar-bureaucrats...&quot; (&quot;Han Shu·Che Qianqiu Biography&quot;)&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;conspiracy to rebel&quot; refers to Liu Quyou&#39;s practice of witchcraft, then the matter did not &quot;reach the scholar-bureaucrats&quot;. It is only reasonable to understand that it means they framed the prince. Yan Shigu also understood it this way when he commented on the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that the mastermind of this catastrophe in which the prince and queen were killed, tens of thousands of people were buried with them (original text of &quot;Han Shu&quot;: &quot;tens of thousands of zombies&quot;), and the capital was bloodied was actually Mrs. Li. Brother Li Guangli. According to the logic of &quot;beauties bring disaster,&quot; of course it is true that Mrs. Li &quot;overwhelms the country and the city&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What kind of person is Prince Wei?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is easier to judge is that the image of Prince Wei in &quot;Hanshu&quot; is indeed different from that in &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot; says that the prince is &quot;benevolent, gentle and cautious&quot;, &quot;honest and quiet&quot;, this image does not exist in the &quot;Han Shu&quot;; &quot;all the ministers are generous and generous&quot; The situation of &quot;Prince&quot; is completely inconsistent with the description in &quot;Hanshu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important introduction to Prince Wei in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; is this sentence:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of establishing Bowang Garden is to allow guests to communicate with each other and follow their preferences, so Most people enter with heresy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of restless people gathered around the prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in fact, the prince&#39;s team action ability is quite strong. If he felt that he was going to be framed by the envoys of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he could react immediately, arresting those who could be caught and killing those who deserved to be killed, without any ambiguity at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then organizing the armed forces was quite efficient: the prince seized the arsenal of Chang&#39;an City and armed his guests; mobilized the power of Changle Palace where Queen Wei Zifu lived; and then released the prisoners of Chang&#39;an City and awarded them arms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, those who almost succeeded in mobilizing include: 1. Changshui Cavalry stationed in the southeast of Chang&#39;an and Xuanqu Cavalry stationed in the southwest of Chang&#39;an; 2. Ren&#39;an&#39;s Northern Army. According to the description in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the battle between Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and Prince Wei for these two teams was a matter of a split second: Ma Tong arrived a little late, and the prince&#39;s subordinates were like Hou (this person&#39;s identity was actually a Prisoners) can mobilize the Hu cavalry; Ren An has served as the prince&#39;s young master, and if he is a little more loyal to the prince, he will not stay out of the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had we not made plans for a rebellion long ago, conducted an in-depth and comprehensive investigation and analysis of the military forces available to Chang&#39;an City, and had detailed and well-planned deployments, it would be difficult to imagine such an action. efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even after losing these two powerful armies, the prince&#39;s army still formed a strong combat effectiveness. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s army to counter the rebellion should be composed of elite doctors and guards, equipped with the most sophisticated crossbows of the Han Dynasty that even frightened the Xiongnu (so Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty emphasized not to engage in close combat), plus three The local troops of the auxiliary army fought like this for five days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, his quick reactions, quick actions, and powerful combat show that Prince Wei is not a character who is easily bullied. Compared with Liu An, the king of Huainan who was said to want to rebel but was helpless, Liu An really should have invented a piece of tofu and killed himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Gu also made some interesting comments about the prince. When the prince was born, &quot;Chiyou&#39;s flag is as long as the sky.&quot; The so-called &quot;Chiyou&#39;s flag&quot; refers to the comet with a long tail in the sky. The ancients believed that this was a symbol of disaster in war. The Han Dynasty&#39;s war against the Xiongnu began, and the prince was born. After that, the war lasted for thirty years, and &quot;the soldiers slaughtered the barbarians and killed countless people.&quot; Then there was the great war and chaos in the capital. Therefore, &quot;The prince grew up with soldiers and ended with them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, reading this sentence just makes people think that Ban Gu is implying that the prince represents the flames of war and murderous intent. A sentence in the published &quot;Tsinghua Bamboo Slips·Five Chronicles&quot; suddenly made people realize: &quot;The Yellow Emperor had a son named Chiyou. When he grew up, he served as a soldier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Gu was clearly saying, The prince is the incarnation of Chi You. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The few words about the prince in &quot;Historical Records&quot; do not indicate that Sima Qian had any closeness to the prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking vulgarly, when the prince and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty were fighting in Chang&#39;an, Sima Qian would probably rather Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty win, even if it was to save his own life. At this time, he was Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s Zhongshu Ling. To put it bluntly, he was a eunuch who helped the emperor handle administrative affairs. If the prince won, everyone around the emperor would be destroyed, and Sima Qian would probably not be able to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian’s friends Ren An and Tian Ren are not princelings in the strict sense. Tian Ren can be considered loyal to the prince, but his position is as an official of the Prime Minister&#39;s Palace (to be understood according to the thinking of spy war dramas, it should be said that the prince is a powerful figure); Ren An is even more suspicious, and he has received the prince&#39;s military talisman. When sending troops, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that he was &quot;double-minded&quot;. In fact, he admitted that he was not a prince, and that he was also the leader of Xiongcai who had high demands on his ministers. According to ordinary people, if he did not move his troops at that time, he would still favor the emperor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other figures related to the prince:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian&#39;s impression of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing is known to be bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi De, the prince&#39;s teacher, is used by some scholars as an argument that &quot;the ministers who are generous and the elders all attach themselves to the prince&quot;. In fact, Sima Qian had some comments about Shi De: The ancestors of the Shi family were talented but not good at learning, but they were very cautious and cautious. After Shi De&#39;s father passed away, their family&#39;s &quot;filial piety and prudence gradually declined.&quot; This is not far from saying that Shi De is useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also Li Guang&#39;s grandson, &quot;Yu dared to be favored by the prince, but he was fond of profit, and Li&#39;s mausoleum has declined slowly.&quot; Li Yu, who was favored by the prince, was a vulgar money addict in the eyes of Sima Qian , and is the unworthy descendant of his beloved flying general Li Guang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conflict between the prince and Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty broke out. To put it bluntly, it was just a struggle between two political forces. There was no &quot;battle between two lines&quot;, and there was no morality or ideal at all. But they have been forced to this point, and no one can retreat. What they are fighting for is not only the supreme imperial power, but also the humblest survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, if Sima Qian did not write about the disaster of witchcraft, he might as well give a literary explanation: his heroic and heroic pen could not face this era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty before Taichu in his works was, of course, full of violence and bloodstains, but there were also numerous heroes and heroes. Even the despicable and shameless characters he hated were still high-spirited and majestic. , this kind of afterglow shone into the Tianhan years, but by Taishi and Zhenghe, there was really only suffocating madness and calculation left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world has changed not because someone died, but because tonight&#39;s cold wind blew down the stars of last night, and the stars in the sky naturally and irrevocably dimmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, I would rather the story told by Sima Guang is true, and it seems to have a bit of idealism and family affection. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2023年1月31日，宣武医院贾建平团队在《阿尔茨海默病杂志》上报道了一位17岁时发生记忆失常，并于19岁诊断为阿尔茨海默病（AD）的病人。这是迄今为止最年轻的患者。这名患者记忆力不断下降、经常丢失个人物品、记不清是否吃过饭，最终无法完成学业，不得不从高中退学。此前，曾有过小于30岁的患者报道，其中最小发病年龄为21岁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究团队在对该患者进行诊治的过程中发现，患者的主要表现为记忆衰退，尤其是情景性记忆衰退，并结合韦氏记忆量表和听觉词语学习测验评估，给出了诊断。不过，该患者没有家族遗传病史，找不到其他引起记忆障碍的病因如遗传、感染和系统性疾病。经过全基因组测序，未发现该患者携带任何风险或致病基因突变，排除了家族性阿尔茨海默病的可能，因此其发病机制尚需进一步研究。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，阿尔茨海默病并非老年人的专利，年轻人也会得。目前，全球至少有5000万失智症（痴呆）患者，预计到2050年，将达1.52亿，其中约60%-70%为阿尔茨海默病患者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对阿尔茨海默病的研究早就有分类，该病有青年型，但这并非是一个独立的疾病，而是按发病时的年龄对阿尔茨海默症分类的一个标准和称谓。阿尔茨海默症分为早发性阿尔茨海默症（又称为青年型阿尔茨海默症）和晚发性阿尔茨海默病。早发性阿尔茨海默病是指18至64岁成人中发生的阿尔茨海默病，而且年龄小于35岁被称为超早期型阿尔茨海默病。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对世界各国阿尔茨海默病患者年龄统计表明，该病平均发病年龄为51岁。青年型阿尔茨海默病占阿尔茨海默病中的4%-6%。不过，多数青年型阿尔茨海默病是在45岁至65岁之间发病。美国的统计表明，40-64岁发病的青年型阿尔茨海默病死亡率为24.2%。现在，中国这例19岁确诊的阿尔茨海默病患者就属于超早期型。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家卫健委于2023年9月20日发布的《阿尔茨海默病患者需求洞察报告》指出，目前中国60岁及以上人群痴呆患者约1507万，其中阿尔茨海默病患者达983万，预计到2050年，阿尔茨海默病患者将超过4000万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着中国阿尔茨海默病患病率不断上升，这种主要是在60岁以上老年人中发病的疾病在中国呈现了一个新的特点，年轻人发病正在日益增多。报告的统计数据显示，阿尔茨海默病的发病率在40岁以下为2.5%；40-49岁为4.1%；50-59岁为14.7%；60-69岁为28.9%；70-79岁为33.2%；80岁及以上为16.6%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由此看出，该病的高发人群是60-79岁，占比62.1%。阿尔茨海默病在60岁以下发生可称早发性发病。在中国，60岁以下的阿尔茨海默病患者占比21.3%，相比国际上该年龄段5%-10%的发病率，中国的早发性发病率显著上升。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论是中国还是联合国的标准，50岁以下都是中年人和年轻人。中国的《中华人民共和国老年人权益保障法》把60周岁以上的公民统称为老年人。但是，按照联合国、世界卫生组织2020年对人生的划分有5个阶段。未成年人：0至17岁；年轻人：18岁至65岁；中年人：66岁至79岁；老年人：80岁至99岁；长寿老人：100岁以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果按照联合国的新标准，18-65岁都是年轻人，那么阿尔茨海默病在中国可能有一半的病人是年轻人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿尔茨海默病的发病有多种因素，但是只需采用一种简单的预防方式，就可减少该病的发病率和发病人数。此前的一些研究发现，午睡与阿尔茨海默病之间存在一定的关联。对超过2万名老年人的休闲活动和睡眠情况进行长期追踪调查，发现那些有午睡习惯的老年人相比于不睡午觉的人，患阿尔茨海默病的风险降低了约37%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，这只是对老年人的研究。而最近的一项对中青年人的研究发现，只要有较好的深度睡眠，就可以有效预防阿尔茨海默病，尤其是预防该病的年轻化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国弗雷明汉心脏研究所、得克萨斯大学等多个中心的研究人员刚刚在《美国医学会杂志》（&amp;nbsp;JAMA）发表的一项研究结果显示，深度睡眠有助于减缓大脑衰老，每年深度睡眠每减少1%，与患痴呆症的风险增加27%相关，表明保持深度睡眠时间可以预防阿尔茨海默病。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这项研究中，研究人员采用了弗雷明汉（Framingham）心脏研究数据，这是一项针对马萨诸塞州弗雷明汉居民的长期、持续的心血管队列研究。研究始于1948 年，对弗雷明汉的5209 名成年人进行研究，至今已延续了七十多年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在该项研究中，研究人员分析了弗雷明汉心脏研究队列中的346名参与者，他们在最初参加研究时（1995-1998年）只有三十多岁，是标准的年轻人。研究的参与者在1995-1998年和2001-2003年期间完成了两项夜间睡眠研究，测量了多导睡眠图（PSG），两项研究之间的平均间隔为5年。研究员在随后的17年中，记录了参与者的阿尔茨海默病状况，分析了深度睡眠与阿尔茨海默病风险之间的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究参与者基线时的深度睡眠的平均百分比为18.1%，在两次夜间睡眠研究之间，参与者深度睡眠时间有所下降，这表明深度睡眠随着年龄的增长而减少。在17年的随访期间，诊断出52例阿尔茨海默病患者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在调整了其他影响因素后，研究人员发现，每年深度睡眠每减少1%，与全因阿尔茨海默病风险增加27%相关，与阿尔茨海默病风险增加32%相关。研究还发现，在阿尔茨海默病遗传风险（APOE4等位基因）的存在下，随着年龄的增长，深度睡眠的减少会加速，但脑容量的变化却不会影响深度睡眠时间。这意味着，人们只要保持正常的深度睡眠时间就会有效预防阿尔茨海默病。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原因在于，深度睡眠对于大脑清除代谢废物至关重要，包括阿尔茨海默病中聚集的主要蛋白质，如β淀粉样蛋白（Aβ）、Tau 蛋白。同时，随着年龄的增长，深度睡眠会越来越少，由此可能会导致类淋巴液清除率持续减弱，增加Aβ、Tau 蛋白形成的风险，并导致神经退行性疾病或阿尔茨海默病。同时，深度睡眠不足还与血管危险因素的发展有关，并可能通过脑血管疾病的积累导致痴呆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然该项研究并没有揭示出深度睡眠不足与阿尔茨海默病之间的确切因果关系，但是保持深度睡眠时间不失为预防阿尔茨海默病的简单办法，而且在年轻时就应当拥有和保持良好的深度睡眠，因为年龄不同，深度睡眠时间是不一样的。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深度睡眠也被称作黄金睡眠，是人睡得最熟、最香的阶段，此时听不到外面的任何吵闹，也很难被别人唤醒。深度睡眠时，人体具有强大的机体修复功能，解除疲劳的作用也最明显。 20-30岁的年轻人，每晚深度睡眠占睡眠时间的20%-25%，70-80岁的老年人，每晚深度睡眠时间只占全部睡眠时间的5%-7%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深度睡眠又与睡眠时长有关，是数量与质量的另一种体现，一般人每晚睡眠少于6小时，深度睡眠就减少。而且，想要拥有较好和较多时间的深度睡眠，首先要在23点前入睡，23点至第二天凌晨3点是进入深度睡眠的最好时间段，一旦错过，无论之后睡多久，都难以补回来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，即便是非常短暂的午睡，下午1-3点是最优的休息时间，也能增强大脑的记忆处理能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在信息时代，为了减少和防止阿尔茨海默病的早发，不要熬夜、保持正常和较好的深度睡眠是上策。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[69个案例，多个政府部门被立案调查背后：反垄断的硬骨头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting in March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a nationwide campaign to curb administrative abuses Powers, special actions to eliminate law enforcement that restricts competition.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On April 7, 2023, the Urban Management Bureau of Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province was placed under investigation for reasons related to the operating rights of shared bicycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau will conduct a public bidding for the shared electric bicycle operating rights project in the main urban area of ​​the county. In the end, two companies obtained the operating rights, and the Urban Management Bureau signed contracts with these two companies, limiting a total of 1,500 vehicles to be put into operation for a period of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After investigation by the Jiangxi Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, it is believed that the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau limited the number of shared electric vehicles in the main urban area through public bidding without any legal and regulatory basis. Operating enterprises excludes or restricts other business entities with qualified qualifications and service capabilities from entering this market, hindering fair market competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was found to have abused administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. This behavior is also called administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing, director of the Competition Law Research Center of Nankai University, explained that administrative monopoly is an administrative monopoly that directly or indirectly interferes with market competition to protect or support certain entities by abusing administrative power. specific operators or commodities to maximize the interests of themselves or others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 is the 15th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law. The &quot;Regulations on Preventing the Abuse of Administrative Power to Eliminate or Restrict Competition&quot; have also been revised. Starting from April 15, 2023 Effective from today. Since March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a nationwide special campaign to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement. From June 2022 to January 2023, a total of 5 batches and 63 administrative monopoly cases were announced. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a special anti-monopoly law enforcement action in the field of people&#39;s livelihood. The two batches of typical cases currently announced include 6 administrative monopoly cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the behavior of the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was reported as a typical case of anti-administrative monopoly. At present, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau has made rectifications, canceled the contract, and issued an announcement to fully open the shared electric vehicle market in the main urban area of ​​the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;With &quot;good intentions&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 2023 On the 18th, relevant staff from the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that they had canceled the bidding. The Harbin Urban Management Bureau, which was put under investigation for the same reason, stated that the shared bicycle bidding business has been handed over to the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in 69 cases, a total of 69 administrative agencies were punished. Generally speaking, the cases involved are mainly concentrated in the fields of people&#39;s livelihood such as urban management, medical care, education, and construction. Chen Bing explained that industry supervision in these fields has obvious characteristics, and administrative agencies can directly allocate resources during the management process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from the typical cases published, the motivations of the units involved are different, and some administrative monopoly behaviors even occur out of &quot;good intentions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2022, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau of Xiangshan County, Ningbo City issued a recommended list of housing safety appraisal institutions, requiring those who carry out housing safety appraisal business in Xiangshan County to obtain the municipal certification After filing the certificate with the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, you should register with the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. In October 2022, the Zhejiang Provincial Market Supervision Bureau determined that this behavior constituted the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that their original intention was to facilitate the masses, “They always ask questions like this when they come to do business. ——We don’t know which housing safety agencies to look for for appraisal, so we put the list of nearly 20 registered agencies on the official account of the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned staff emphasized that house safety appraisal is a bottom-line issue. They need to comprehensively analyze the qualifications, capabilities, and creditworthiness of all appraisal agencies before making it public. Therefore, they A directory of housing safety appraisal agencies registered in Ningbo City will be formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the investigation, the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau has withdrawn the recommended list. However, this staff member believes that if there are only one or two houses, it may be a monopoly. However, their recommended list includes more than a dozen housing safety appraisal agencies from Ningbo and Hangzhou, and &quot;there is none in Xiangshan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, some administrative agencies are not aware that the documents issued constitute an administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2017, the Finance Bureau of Pingluo County, Ningxia designated an insurance company as the underwriting unit for traffic accident insurance for various administrative institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the relevant departments of the Pingluo County Finance Bureau said that because the document was released for so long, the drafter of the document and the person responsible for its preparation and issuance are no longer in the bureau. They had not noticed this document before. It was not until March 2023, when the Market Supervision Bureau came to investigate, that they found the document and invalidated the relevant provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When it comes to the implementation of the document, the person in charge said that it also depends on the budget of each unit. Some units are implementing it, while others have not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin, director of the Competition Law and Policy Research Center of Wuhan University, believes that administrative agencies lack the concept of fair competition in the policy formulation process and often only think about bidding and investment. Introducing investment to stimulate the economy while ignoring the need to maintain the bottom line of fair competition in the market can easily lead to the emergence of administrative monopolies. &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; sp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Antitrust and Anti-Corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Among the reported administrative monopoly cases, the common handling methods are to abrogate the execution of the original documents, terminate the bidding work or cancel the contract, and submit a rectification report. There are also cases where the market supervision and administration administration issues administrative proposals to the local people&#39;s government, and a few supervisors Personnel and those directly responsible were punished, often involving corruption such as power-for-money transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In April 2021, the Chenzhou City Education Bureau of Hunan Province identified 4 school uniform production and supply manufacturers through bidding, and divided the urban area into 4 areas, limiting each area. Regional schools can only purchase uniforms from designated manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Hunan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau believed during its investigation in August 2021 that the above-mentioned behavior deprived the school and the parent committee of the right to make independent choices. As a result, the bidding process was terminated in September 2021. (The special action in 2022 announced 5 batches of 63 typical cases, 23 of which were filed for investigation in 2021.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 18, 2023, A staff member of the Chenzhou City Education Bureau office said that the technical equipment department, a secondary organization under the Education Bureau, is responsible for the primary and secondary school uniform business. Due to disciplinary violations in the public bidding process for the qualification of primary and secondary school uniform manufacturers, this organization was suspended midway. The Administration for Market Regulation called a halt, and the Commission for Discipline Inspection subsequently intervened in the investigation, and the person in charge of the agency was also punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Chenzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection pointed out that from 2013 to 2022, Li Junhong took advantage of his position as deputy director and director of the Technical Equipment Department of the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau to facilitate others. Undertaken primary and secondary schools uniform business, school laboratories, facilities and equipment and installation service procurement projects to provide assistance, illegally receiving other people&#39;s property totaling 2.448 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, Li Junhong was expelled from the party and dismissed from public office. Suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being punished, the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau took rectification measures. The above-mentioned staff stated that the Education Bureau, together with the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and the Municipal Supervision Bureau, issued a notice on further standardizing the management of primary and secondary school uniforms on September 15, 2021, emphasizing that all documents and materials for the selection and purchase of school uniforms should be archived by the school. School uniforms Procurement contracts must be filed with the competent education department, and transactions shall not be interfered with by violating market principles or by fixing trademarks or other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, a monopoly case involving the Health Bureau of Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province is also worthy of attention. At the end of October 2021, relevant companies in the county jointly reported that the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed an agreement with a company to issue mandatory target tasks for drug procurement by county-affiliated public medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An investigation by the Hunan Market Supervision Bureau found that Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed a cooperation agreement with Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., requiring all public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to A certain proportion of the purchase volume of medicines, consumables, equipment, etc. is provided to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., and the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau also issues quotas in the form of documents to public medical institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The agreement also stipulates that from July 2021 to the end of 2022, the total purchase quota from public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd. is 1.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the person in charge of the Essential Drugs Unit of Shuangfeng County Health Bureau who is responsible for drug procurement and asked about the whole story. The other party said, &quot;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, antitrust is often closely related to anti-corruption. Some companies rack their brains to maintain relationships with officials with decision-making power, waiting for the time to mature. , they will require the other party to formulate rules to protect their interests, such as granting exclusive business rights, or giving opportunities in policy preferences, incentives and subsidies, and bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This also means that some market entities will also push administrative agencies to abuse administrative power.&quot; Sun Jin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The harm of administrative monopoly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to the economy Sexual monopoly and administrative monopoly rarely come into public view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing believes that on the one hand, there are indeed fewer cases of administrative monopoly than economic monopoly cases; on the other hand, administrative monopoly is mainly ordered to correct and punished by superior authorities. The focus is on punishing supervisors or other responsible personnel in accordance with the law, and the punishment information does not belong to the content that must be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;But administrative monopoly is more harmful than economic monopoly.&quot; Chen Bing explained that administrative monopoly sets unreasonable entry barriers, causing market Fragmentation and misallocation of resources prevent other operators from making full use of their own advantages to participate in competition. In the long run, this will reduce the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of all enterprises in the market, and at the same time reduce the total social welfare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin believes that for anti-monopoly law enforcement agencies, anti-economic monopoly is mainly a technical issue, and it is not difficult to judge whether it has substantially hindered fair market competition. Not big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He emphasized that the hard nut of anti-monopoly is actually administrative monopoly. At present, abuse of power still occurs from time to time, and it is still very serious in some areas. In addition, in administrative monopolies, there is a large amount of interest transfer, and some companies gain unfair competitive advantages, suppress small and medium-sized enterprises, and compete for their profit opportunities. This is contrary to common prosperity, high-quality development, and the construction of a unified national market. Anti-administrative monopoly has always been the top priority of anti-monopoly work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that on August 1, 2022, the first day the new Anti-Monopoly Law came into effect, Gan Lin, Director of the State Anti-Monopoly Bureau, published an article in the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; The signed article mentioned that &quot;we must insist on equal emphasis on preventing market monopoly and breaking administrative monopoly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the 2023 National Market Supervision System Anti-Monopoly Work Conference, anti-administrative monopoly is also the focus of the 2023 work goals, including strengthening the supply of fair competition review systems , studying and drafting the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations (Draft)&quot;, etc. At present, the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations&quot; have been publicly solicited for opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the 15 years since the Anti-Monopoly Law was implemented, the fair competition review mechanism has been an important part of the anti-administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2016, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System in the Construction of the Market System&quot;, emphasizing standardizing government behavior and establishing a fair competition review system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A landmark node is that the State Administration for Market Regulation was officially listed in April 2018 and began to assume unified anti-monopoly law enforcement responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, the Anti-Monopoly Law was revised for the first time after its promulgation. The chapter involving anti-administrative monopoly added a fair competition review system. &quot;This is equivalent to controlling the situation from the source and reducing the impact of policies formulated by administrative agencies on market competition,&quot; Chen Bing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Breaking down regional barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant regulations and policies are constantly evolving While improving, anti-administrative monopoly law enforcement has also been continuously strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The special anti-administrative monopoly action in 2022 is not the first time. From September 2019 to January 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out special actions nationwide to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement, focusing on transportation, construction, medicine, official seal engraving, bidding and government procurement5 an area where there are many illegal activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the special operation, the market supervision department investigated more than 50 cases in the above five fields and verified more than 80 case clues. However, no typical cases were announced to the public at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the State Administration for Market Regulation has published an annual report on antitrust enforcement every year since its establishment. The report shows that from 2019 to 2022, law enforcement agencies investigated a total of 354 cases of abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition, and concluded 198 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the numbers of such cases investigated from 2019 to 2021 were 84, 98, and 80 respectively, and the numbers settled were 12, 67, and 46 respectively. The State Administration for Market Regulation launched a special law enforcement action on the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition in 2022, investigating a total of 92 cases and settling 73 cases. The number of settlements increased by 59% compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In contrast, in the eleven years from 2008 to 2018, antitrust law enforcement agencies investigated and dealt with a total of 223 such cases, with an average of approximately 20 cases; and in the four years from 2019 to 2022, the average was 88 cases per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fair competition review system is also constantly being implemented and promoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the fair competition review system achieved full coverage of the national, provincial, municipal, and county governments. As of the end of 2020, a total of 857,000 newly issued policies had been reviewed across the country, and more than 4,100 policy measures that violated review standards were discovered and corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022 alone, various regions and departments will review 163,700 newly issued policies and measures, clean up 452,000 existing policies and measures of various types, and abolish, revise, and correct There are more than 20,000 policies and measures to eliminate or restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, these policy documents that may affect fair competition in the market have not been issued because they have not passed the fair competition review, or previously issued documents have been abolished because they have not passed the review. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, the anti-administrative monopoly work has a long way to go, and there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to break down local protection and regional barriers, thoroughly clean up policies and practices that hinder market access and the free circulation of commodity factors, and reduce institutional Transaction costs are the key to breaking down barriers that restrict economic circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, it is necessary to continuously regulate the interference of administrative power in market competition, &quot;especially in the fields of bidding, government procurement, public utilities and other fields, to prevent designated transactions , discriminatory conditions and other unfair behaviors, allowing local governments to effectively form an integrated competition protection mechanism of &#39;pre-examination + in-process and post-event supervision&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, consciousness and concepts are the core issues. He believes that antitrust laws need to be popularized among government officials so that they can make scientific, reasonable and legal decisions based on the provisions of antitrust laws and fair competition review systems. “Consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises also need to be mobilized to supervise the government, and all parties can work together to promote An ecology of fair competition.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[跨国药企扎堆进博会，多款创新药首秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260172]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被传收购碧桂园？中国平安回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260182]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 09:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 8, foreign media reported the news of Ping An’s acquisition of Country Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257517&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ping An issued a statement saying that the company has noticed a news report published by Reuters about the company being required by relevant government departments/institutions to acquire Country Garden Holdings Co., Ltd. and inherit its debts.

On the morning of October 21, 2023, local time in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation watched the Shaolin Kungfu report performance of Bolivian Shaolin disciples and interacted on the spot. While in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation also visited the South American Shaolin Cultural Center, Bolivia Baoen Temple and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, a video on Weibo of a young black monk practicing Shaolin Kung Fu also sparked heated discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the young monk boxing in the video black, but the master is also black. This is a branch of the Shaolin Temple in Africa. Some people say that this is the flowering of Chinese culture within the wall and the loss of culture; the Shaolin Temple is becoming more and more international, making people feel that it has lost its original flavor. This view is of course wrong, and someone has refuted it very well: once it is exported, it will be lost, and if it is not exported, it will be criticized as cultural weakness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shaolin Temple has been engaged in systematic cultural dissemination, forming many practice platforms that influence and disseminate Shaolin Kungfu and its culture, and building a global dissemination mechanism centered on Shaolin culture at home and abroad. It has had a huge social impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2001, Shaolin layman &quot;foreign disciple&quot; Deller opened the Shaolin Cultural Center in Berlin, Germany. This was the first overseas branch directly authorized to cooperate with the Shaolin Temple. Currently, there are nearly 200 overseas Shaolin cultural centers distributed around the world. According to data from relevant institutions, there are no less than 60 million people practicing Shaolin Kung Fu around the world; there are hundreds of Shaolin cultural institutions in more than 100 countries and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was established in Vienna; in 2004, the California House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution and established in law March 21 of each year as &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot;. In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was announced in Vienna, Austria; in 2011, the &quot;Shaolin North American Federation&quot; was established in Los Angeles, the United States. In 2014, the 10th anniversary of the establishment of &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot; in California, the then US President Obama said in his congratulatory message: &quot;Shaolin culture can provide us with spiritual space and help us cultivate a strong sense of social responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shaolin Temple recruits foreign disciples and even goes out to build temples and Kung Fu training classes, which can not only promote Buddhism, but also Shaolin Kung Fu and spread Chinese culture. Shaolin Temple is the place where Patriarch Bodhidharma stayed the longest after he came to China. It is known as the ancestral palace of Zen Buddhism. Zen Buddhism absorbs a large amount of ideological content from Confucianism and Taoism, turning foreign Buddhism into a Chinese Buddhism that corresponds to China&#39;s specific social and historical conditions and ideological and cultural background. Therefore, Zen Buddhism has realized the transformation from the Sinicization of Buddhism to Sinicized Buddhism and is rich in profound Chinese cultural elements. Shaolin Kung Fu and Shaolin Temple have gone global, and Chinese culture has also expanded its influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although black young monks and black abbots seem to be inconsistent, it is just because they are not used to it. It should be pointed out that the process of cultural export, success and acceptance cannot remain unchanged. It will also change and alienate according to local social, cultural, technological, economic, moral, conceptual and other factors, forming new ones to some extent. culture. We must maintain a tolerant attitude toward such changes and mutations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the influence of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is growing, and many countries and regions have designated the Chinese New Year as a legal holiday. There will be a holiday on this day, and national and regional leaders will extend holiday greetings to those celebrating the Spring Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the international context, the Chinese New Year is often written as: Chinese new year. &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot; is translated as &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot;, indicating that this New Year comes from the Chinese calendar. However, with the growing influence of the Spring Festival, there is now a trend to translate the Spring Festival into &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;. Lunar means &quot;moon&quot; and can be understood as &quot;lunar calendar&quot;. Nowadays, many people use it this way. US officials use &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; when issuing New Year greetings. United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also used &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; in his New Year greeting video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that this is an attempt to de-Sinicize the Spring Festival and steal a Chinese festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don’t have to look at it this way. This is the normal state of cultural export. The Romans originally used the Egyptian lunar calendar. In 46 BC, Roman commander Julius Caesar decided to recompile the Julian Calendar based on the Egyptian solar calendar. In 325 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine established the Julian calendar as the Christian calendar. By the 6th century AD, Christians regarded the day when Jesus, the founder of Christian legends, was born more than 500 years ago as the first year of AD. Before the 16th century, most Western countries adopted the Julian calendar. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII, with the assistance of the Neapolitan astronomer and physicist Giraldi and the German mathematician and Jesuit Clavius, corrected the Julian calendar promulgated in 46 BC. Errors formed the Gregorian calendar commonly used in our modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Revolution of 1911, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China legislated to use the Gregorian calendar from January 1, 1912, and stipulated that January 1 of the Gregorian calendar would be the &quot;New Year&quot;. This is now recognized around the world as the starting point of the new year. However, now everyone in the world can only say &quot;Happy New Year&quot; but not &quot;Happy Roman New Year&quot;. This is not stealing a holiday from the Romans or Christians, but a normal process of cultural export. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many countries in Asia also celebrate the Lunar New Year, such as South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, etc. From their perspective, they may not want to use an obviously regional name like &quot;Chinese&quot;, so they will use &quot;Happy Lunar New Year&quot; to express &quot;Happy Spring Festival&quot;, which is just like the Chinese people don&#39;t know how to express &quot;Happy Lunar New Year&quot;. It&#39;s the same as saying &quot;Happy New Year Roman&quot;, but what does it matter? This calendar was passed down from China. Under the tributary system in the traditional era, the Chinese dynasty would issue calendars and allow surrounding vassal states to &quot;honor Shuo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, whether it is African black Shaolin Temple disciples or it is called &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;, it is a real cultural export. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[争论“开门杀”责任与赔偿：为何司机负主责，为何保险要代赔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260160]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Taxi parked on the roadside in Beijing. &quot;Opening the door to kill&quot; has become a hot topic in recent years .

Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Yi Haifei China News Service Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-October 2023, the incident of a child in Tianjin being &quot;killed by opening the door&quot; and then being run over by a bus attracted attention. While riding an electric bicycle to carry her daughter, a woman hit the newly opened door of a passenger bus on the side of the road. The child fell to the ground and was crushed to death by the wheels of a passing bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is another &quot;open door killing&quot; case. Southern Weekend reporters searched the relevant judicial documents website and found that in recent years, &quot;open door killing&quot; accidents have occurred frequently. Dai Xianfeng, secretary-general of the Legal Affairs Committee of the China Communications and Transportation Association, believes that with the substantial growth of private cars and non-motor vehicles, the public generally lacks awareness of the dangers of &quot;opening the door to kill&quot;, resulting in the frequent occurrence of such accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters that door-opening killings are mainly divided into two types: one is when the driver opens the door himself and collides with a non-motorized vehicle, in which case the driver bears full responsibility; If a passenger opens the door and collides with a non-motor vehicle, the passenger will generally constitute a joint tort with the driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation can be subdivided into different accident types, and the final liability for compensation will also be different. Two common situations are: the driver and the passenger have an operational relationship, such as taxis, online ride-hailing and other passenger-carrying activities; the driver and the passenger are friends or relatives, and there is no operational relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&#39;Opening the door to kill&#39; is a hot topic in traffic accidents. It is very lethal and its liability determination has always been controversial.&quot; Zhou Bo, a senior lawyer who has been representing traffic accident cases for many years, added that at present, all over China The traffic control department in China still lacks unified identification standards when determining responsibility for &quot;opening the door to kill&quot; accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What responsibilities does the online ride-hailing platform bear?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 18:00 on November 3, 2020, just after work, 39-year-old Zhang He was riding an electric bicycle on the non-motorized lane on his way home. He collided with an online ride-hailing car that had just opened the door, causing Zhang He to be seriously injured and unconscious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident occurred on Zhongshan 2nd Road, Songjiang District, Shanghai. Relevant judgments show that after completing a trip, the online ride-hailing driver Xia Moulin temporarily stopped the vehicle and did not keep the vehicle close to the right side of the road. He also did not remind passenger Fang Mouxin to observe the traffic coming from behind. Fang Mouxin opened the right door. , resulting in Zhang He’s injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My husband now can’t even remember the names of his father, mother and son, nor his own name.” Zhang He’s wife told Southern Weekend reporters that Zhang He was originally the backbone of the family because The car accident resulted in a craniocerebral injury that constituted a tenth-level disability, and the treatment has not healed yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traffic police detachment of the Songjiang Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau determined that the driver Xia Moulin bore the primary responsibility for the accident, the passenger Fang Mouxin bore the secondary responsibility, and Zhang He was not responsible. The court later ruled that the driver and passenger constituted joint infringement. Among them, the driver&#39;s compensation ratio is 70%, and the compensation is 820,000 yuan; the passenger&#39;s compensation ratio is 30%, and the compensation is 350,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The transportation department will first issue an accident liability determination document to determine the primary and secondary responsibilities of the driver and passengers. Later, the court will make a judgment based on the liability determination document during the trial.&quot; Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters , the responsibility determination letter issued by the transportation department will not clarify the responsibilities of the driver and passengers into specific proportions. As for how the final court divides the proportion of primary and secondary responsibilities, it is within the scope of the people&#39;s court to exercise discretion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the judgment of the above-mentioned case shows that Xia Moulin did not actually have insurance related to operating vehicles when using a private car, and his online ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing Company failed to perform its due review duties. ; And as a platform, Didi and Xia Moulin share profits, bear risks, and ensure operational safety, and they are both considered as the carrier of passengers. Therefore, Didi shall bear joint and several liability with the driver Xia Moulin for the losses suffered by the injured in accordance with the law, and jointly compensate 820,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Regardless of whether the online ride-hailing car has the relevant qualifications to operate a vehicle or not, the driver taking the order is regarded as performing his duties. The driver may not be an employee of Didi, but legally, as long as he performs his work tasks , the platform has the responsibility.&quot; Dai Xianfeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 16 of the &quot;Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Reservation Taxi Operations and Services&quot; stipulates: &quot;Online taxi-hailing platform companies assume the responsibility of the carrier and should ensure operational safety and protect the legitimate rights and interests of passengers.&quot; The Chinese Civil Code also states Relevant regulations require online ride-hailing platforms to assume the responsibilities of the carrier under the transportation contract between the driver and the passenger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that when facing consumers, the carrier’s responsibilities and compensation obligations originally belonging to the driver under the transportation contract may be borne by the online ride-hailing platform to a large extent. The same goes for taxi drivers and taxi companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a passenger pushes the door and causes a &quot;door kill&quot;, but the driver has fulfilled his obligation to remind him, does he still need to bear responsibility? Dai Xianfeng told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Unless the passenger was intentional, the driver still needs to bear certain liability for the accident. There is a platform or insurance company behind the driver, which has a stronger compensation ability. It is the substantive fairness of the law to allow the victim to receive compensation according to the law. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not all situations require the owner of a motor vehicle to be held responsible. Zhou Bo added to Southern Weekend reporters that if a vehicle parked on the roadside and opened its door in compliance with regulations, and a non-motor vehicle drove in the wrong direction or caused an &quot;open door kill&quot; casualty accident due to other reasons, the traffic control department may also determine that the non-motor vehicle bears major or even full responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Should insurance recognize the car or the person?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhou Bo told Southern Weekend reporters that in the case of &quot;open door killing&quot; caused by passengers, there are two main controversial links: one One is how the front-end traffic control department determines the primary and secondary responsibilities of the driver and passengers; the other is the insurance company that insures the vehicle. Should it compensate on behalf of the passengers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most critical link is the identification of front-end responsibilities, under what circumstances passengers should bear responsibility, how to divide primary and secondary responsibilities, and under what circumstances passengers are not required to bear responsibility.” Zhou Bo told Southern Weekend reporters that the traffic control department The methods and standards for determining responsibility are currently not uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in the &quot;open door killing&quot; cases represented by Zhou Bo, the identification standards of traffic police in various places have been different, which also directly affected the final court judgment. For example, when they both open the door for a passenger, some traffic police believe that the passenger and the driver are one and the same tortfeasor; some traffic police believe that the driver should bear full responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a judgment made public in 2020 showed that after a &quot;door-opening killing&quot; accident occurred in Luocheng County, Guangxi, the &quot;Road Traffic Accident Determination&quot; issued by the local traffic police department on the accident involved determined that the passenger If you obstruct the passage of other vehicles when opening and closing the door, you will bear all the responsibility for the traffic accident. The driver is not responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Xianfeng said that under normal circumstances, the court&#39;s judgment will be consistent with the accident liability determination issued by the transportation department, unless there is other direct evidence to the contrary that is sufficient to overturn the liability determination. &quot;On the one hand, from a professional perspective, judges are no better at handling traffic accidents than traffic police; on the other hand, the probative power of evidence issued by state agencies is higher than other general evidence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the driver is responsible If the passenger is fully responsible, there will not be much controversy, because the insurance company will pay in the end. But if the passenger is held responsible, there will be controversy.&quot; Zhou Bo said that when the passenger is found responsible, the main point of dispute will become : Should the insurance company that insures the vehicle bear the liability of the passengers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters checked multiple judicial documents and found that when the driver and the passenger who took the initiative to open the door did not have an operating relationship, but were relatives or friends, many drivers would claim that they were fully responsible. The reason is that drivers, as car owners, have purchased compulsory traffic insurance or commercial third party insurance, and the insurance company can compensate them on their behalf. It is precisely because of this that in such &quot;open door killing&quot; cases, there are endless lawsuits between insurance companies and the infringers of the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, a &quot;door-opening killing&quot; accident occurred in Fengtai District, Beijing. The car driver Zhang Mouyan was friends with the passenger Ma Mou who pushed the door open. After handling by the Fengbei Brigade of Fengtai Traffic Detachment, the car owner and passengers in this case were equally responsible for the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In court, the car advocate Mouyan argued that he failed to fulfill his obligation to remind and should bear full responsibility. Passenger Ma Moushuang also pointed out that if there is no vehicle, there is no act of getting out of the vehicle. Insurance companies should identify the insured vehicle rather than the person who caused the vehicle accident. The insurance company argued that the company was only responsible for the insured car claimant&#39;s compensation amount, that is, compensation at a rate of 50%, and did not recognize that Zhang Mouyan bore full responsibility. It said: &quot;According to the insurance law, Zhang Mouyan violated the principle of good faith and took the initiative to increase her own responsibilities, which may have resulted in excessive compensation for our company. Our company reserves the right to pursue the two of them for insurance fraud.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the end, the court ruled that the insurance company should be liable for the injured person&#39;s various losses within the scope of insurance based on the joint and several liability of the car owner and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in such &quot;open door killing&quot; cases, there were many verdicts in which insurance companies were ultimately responsible for compensation on behalf of passengers. In the aforementioned &quot;open door killing&quot; case in Luocheng County, although the court ruled that the passengers were fully responsible, the final compensation for the injured was paid by the insurance company that insured the vehicle involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Insurance companies generally defend themselves. They believe that insurance compensation is for the insured car owner. Once the driver is not the car owner, no compensation should be paid. However, this defense opinion can only be said to have a certain degree of truth, and the court often does not Adopted.&quot; Zhou Bo said that at present, the exemption clause in this aspect of the insurance contract itself is not clear, and different people will have different understandings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, some online ride-hailing platforms and taxi companies require passengers to open the right door to get in and out of the car as a measure to prevent &quot;open door killing&quot;. Dai Xianfeng believes that it is necessary to strengthen the education and publicity related to &quot;opening the door to kill&quot; for students: &quot;I think that &#39;opening the door to kill&#39; should also be a key part of the training when taking the driver&#39;s license test. We will ask to look at the reflector before starting and after stopping the car. , but there is no direct training for &#39;opening the door to kill&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(Zhou Bo and Zhang He are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[改革开放45周年—建言者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260156]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;45 years ago, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping’s requirement to “turn banks into real banks”, China began a planned and Step-by-step financial system reform. Finance, the core of the modern economy, has been given an extraordinary mission in China&#39;s reform process. 45 years ago, the People&#39;s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance separated, and China&#39;s &quot;unified&quot; financial system reform began. Although it was once trapped in the reform detour of the &quot;Five Major Contracts&quot;, it entered a &quot;big step&quot; process since 1993. 45 years later, &quot;deepening the reform of the financial system&quot; has become the action plan, and the reform and opening up of the financial market has also entered the deep water zone. Taking history as a mirror can help us understand gains and losses. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with the promoters, experiencers and witnesses of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up to provide suggestions for the stable and long-term development of China&#39;s financial industry.</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 23:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中华白海豚“迷路”，广州正在追踪施救]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260218]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清华国家金融研究院张伟：房贷证券化是双刃剑，目前更不宜推出丨首席访谈⑬]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260180]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The much-watched Central Financial Work Conference proposed “&lt;span>;Aiming to accelerate the construction of a financial power&lt;/span >;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;This is the first time that the central government has proposed the goal of “financial power”. Among my country&#39;s major financial fields, the banking industry is the largest and is the main transmission system for macroeconomic control policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the banking industry is facing multiple challenges: under the counter-cyclical trend, the net interest margin of the banking industry has dropped to a historical low; at the same time, as the real estate industry enters a new stage, banks regard it as high-quality assets. The mortgage business is facing difficulties; after testing the waters of equity investment, the investment research capabilities of bank wealth management subsidiaries have also been questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s A-share “profit king”—can the banking industry achieve breakthroughs by leveraging financial technology? Has it reached a critical point in transformation? How do banks shape their core competitiveness? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A researcher from Southern Weekend’s New Finance Research Center interviewed Zhang Wei, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. Zhang Wei focuses on researching monetary policy and financial crisis early warning mechanisms. He also took the lead in compiling the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; and taught more than 300 training courses for the five major state-owned banks and some joint-stock banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/zslPwg6O7gV7qMYCXPkV9k3e0LDmM0nIxuTB425I.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height= &quot;410&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/zslPwg6O7gV7qMYCXPkV9k3e0LDmM0nIxuTB425I.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhang Wei, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mortgage securitization&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;High risk&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our research found that housing mortgage loans in my country basically have floating interest rates. Most foreign bank mortgage loans have fixed interest rates. Why is it different? What is its background? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Most foreign mortgage interest rates are fixed interest rates, while our country’s mortgage loans have quasi-floating interest rates, that is, they are not completely floating. There is an essential difference between the two. In the past, after the central bank adjusted interest rates, existing mortgage interest rates were not adjusted immediately, and were often adjusted accordingly the following year. In other words, the central bank can adjust the interest rate multiple times within a year, but the borrower&#39;s mortgage interest rate remains basically unchanged within a year and can only start to adjust on January 1 of the following year. Therefore, it is not a fully floating interest rate but a quasi-floating interest rate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the development of the banking system, the primary purpose of various policies was to make banks grow and grow, and to reduce bank capital operation risks. The choice of a floating rate form stems from banking tradition. Fixed-rate mortgages are lower risk for the borrower but higher risk for the bank. In the past two years, some reforms have been made to mortgage interest rates. Borrowers can choose fixed interest rates or floating interest rates. However, existing housing loans still account for the majority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We also found through research that the balance of domestic housing mortgage loans is huge, but Mortgage asset securitization (MBS) has developed slowly since its inception in 2006. In the first half of 2023, there will be zero issuance of RMBS. This is also very different from the mortgage business in developed countries. Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four reasons for the slow progress of domestic mortgage asset securitization. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, mortgage asset securitization is an imported product. Mortgage securitization tools such as MBS in the United States have been developed since the 1970s. China&#39;s housing loan market developed relatively late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, domestic mortgage asset securitization started in 2006, just as the U.S. real estate bubble began to burst. The following year, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis triggered a chain reaction of MBS defaults and credit derivatives such as CDO and CDS, which eventually led to the 2008 global financial crisis. The external crisis requires us to re-understand the pros and cons of mortgage securitization. For regulatory agencies, a more cautious approach has been chosen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, mortgage asset securitization is a financial derivative. China has always been cautious about the development of financial derivatives because derivatives are highly leveraged and risky. Domestic laws on futures and derivatives were promulgated many years after the subprime mortgage crisis broke out, and did not include credit derivatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, over the past 20 years, my country’s commercial housing market has experienced a process of development and regulation of relaxation-tightening-relaxation-retightening-relaxation again. Maintain strict control over the financing of the real estate market through asset management products such as credit and trust to prevent the real estate market from overheating. Mortgage asset securitization is an important means of real estate financing and will also be strictly controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think it is possible to accelerate the implementation of asset securitization to activate the market? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Activating the real estate market through MBS is an option. my country&#39;s real estate credit market is an issue and hold model. If mortgage assets are securitized, banks can package the mortgages and sell them through securitization, and brokers can then distribute them to institutional investors including funds. The final investor may be an individual or a business. Mortgage risk is thus dispersed. Banks also receive more liquidity as a result. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mortgage asset securitization is a double-edged sword. Because it has high leverage, if there is any disturbance or unfavorable situation, the impact it will have will be huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, mortgage securitization is indeed a direction. However, I believe that the risks are relatively high, the supporting systems and regulatory measures are still weak, and it should not develop too fast. Especially in the current situation where risk prevention is the keynote, it is even more unsuitable to launch. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Need to shift to intensive&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;development&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Under the counter-cyclical situation, the profits of the banking industry generally increased slightly and even the profits of individual banks dropped sharply, and the provision coverage ratio and capital adequacy ratio both declined. The 2023 interim reports of various banks revealed this group signal. However, under the current capital market conditions, refinancing on the stock market is difficult to achieve. How do you think banks can replenish core capital at this stage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Commercial banks can replenish their first-tier core capital by issuing common shares, increasing capital from existing shareholders, or issuing additional shares. In addition, endogenous funds are also important channels. Such as retained profits, other comprehensive income and risk reserves, etc. This is to make &quot;blood&quot; by oneself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listed banks are the &quot;outstanding elements&quot; among banks. There are more than 4,000 small and medium-sized banks that cannot replenish capital through the stock market and can only increase capital through targeted capital increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks mainly issue subordinated bonds, preferred stocks and perpetual bonds to supplement secondary capital. However, the threshold for issuance of perpetual bonds and subordinated bonds is relatively high, and not all thousands of small and medium-sized banks are eligible. In addition, the issuance of special bonds by local governments is also an important means to supplement the capital of small and medium-sized banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned that endogenous funds are also very important. How do most banks get rid of the predicament of becoming increasingly dependent on external financing as they develop? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the past few decades, the scale of the banking industry has expanded rapidly and interest rates have been earned. In recent years, both the return on assets and the return on capital have been declining, and companies can only &quot;win&quot; by relying on scale. Large scale, low efficiency, and rapid capital consumption. If you cannot support the rapid expansion of asset scale by relying on your own &quot;blood production&quot;, you must rely on more external financing to replenish capital. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To completely get rid of this predicament, banks need to conduct refined operations on existing assets and earn more profits with the same asset scale, rather than simply increasing absolute profits by increasing scale. Extensive way. The core is to shift from the current extensive development model that emphasizes scale to an intensive development model that emphasizes efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, interest rate spreads have fallen to historic lows, and the financial sustainability of bank operations is in doubt. When the current scale remains unchanged or even continues to decline, banks must find ways to be more refined and detailed, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, especially to reduce management fees and other costs. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of fund utilization. For example, adjust the direction of loan investment, make more efforts in the financial market, and do more financial market business. In addition, efforts need to be made to improve risk control levels and reduce bad debt costs and risk losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now digital finance has become the transformation path for banks, and it is also the only way to achieve inclusive finance. You also had similar views in the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; published by &quot;Tsinghua Financial Review&quot;. You also believe that when financial institutions build underlying business logic in accordance with the genetic requirements of the Internet, they need to break the internal data barriers of the institution and make comprehensive adjustments to the working mechanism. In this process, banks are bound to be exposed to many risks. What do you think is the underlying business logic of banks’ Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The core of bank digital transformation lies in data connectivity. At the same time, the organizational structure and top-level design must be reconstructed according to Internet thinking. There will be many challenges and risks involved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there are many obstacles in data connection. A bank is a behemoth that involves many businesses, institutions, personnel, and outlets, and the phenomenon of data islands is serious. The problem is particularly serious for large banks, where it is difficult to integrate data between head offices and branches, between various departments of the head office, and even between departments within the same department. In addition to breaking through internal data barriers and breaking down information islands, it is also necessary to achieve safe and standardized connections with external data such as government data, corporate data, alternative Internet data, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always held the view that the banks of the future will be technology companies with banking licenses. It requires data, scenarios, and technology, that is, &quot;no data, no finance&quot;, &quot;no scenario, no finance&quot;, &quot;no technology, no finance&quot;. This is a trinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, in order to open up external data, banks need to build some scenarios themselves and have the ability to continuously generate new data. Therefore, establishing the scene is particularly important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks need to pay attention to this matter from the top-level design and reconstruct the business logic structure and organizational structure that are different from traditional banks in the past. The difficulty is that traditional genes may eat away at Internet genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the traditional business of banks is still strong - the Internet business is still &quot;Sesame&quot;, and the traditional business is still &quot;Watermelon&quot;. However, in the future, the Internet business will grow into a &quot;watermelon&quot; and the traditional business will gradually shrink into a &quot;sesame&quot;. Due to operating pressure, traditional businesses still have to pay attention. &quot;Sesame&quot; cannot become &quot;watermelon&quot; overnight. It requires a process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform must not only prevent some new businesses from being cannibalized by traditional businesses, but also prevent traditional businesses from simply being moved online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the recruitment situation this autumn, most bank IT R&amp;D positions Hiring is down. This may be related to the rise of large model technology. Some banks’ fintech strategies are shifting from building their own intelligent customer service systems to cooperating with external technology platforms. What do you think of this phenomenon? Will outsourcing financial technology business bring greater risks to banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Outsourcing has advantages and risks, and different organizations should have different choices. Large and medium-sized banks should maintain their core technologies and avoid relying on outsourcing institutions; while small and medium-sized banks can consider outsourcing part of their business or cooperate with other platform companies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on external institutions can quickly solve the bank&#39;s current problems. In the long run, over-reliance on outsourcing institutions and platforms and loss of opportunities to develop internal skills is the biggest risk, followed by the risk of data security. The reason is that relying on outsourcing makes it difficult for banks to establish solid core technical capabilities over time. This is particularly important for large banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the long run, banks, especially large banks, will still have to build their own systems. Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing. It is a long-term solution for large banks to improve their internal capabilities. For some small banks, they can choose to outsource most of their businesses to build their core competitiveness in other aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Test the equity market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Establish a high-level &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;investment research team&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Yes Important matters&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The bank’s financial management subsidiary is testing the waters of equity financial management The product is 3 years old, but generally performs poorly.

It is difficult for wealth management subsidiaries to cooperate with fund companies under the parent bank because competition between the two outweighs cooperation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the incentive mechanism and salary levels of financial management subsidiaries are a major shortcoming. Subject to salary distribution constraints, the salary levels of wealth management subsidiaries of major state-owned banks are significantly lower than those of public funds. This is a great constraint on building a high-level investment research team. A breakthrough is needed in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[串标围标在工程建设等领域多发；招标方设租寻租不容忽视丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260146]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate released a number of typical cases on the official website of punishing the crime of collusive bidding in accordance with the law. The relevant person in charge of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate said that in recent years, problems in the bidding process have become prominent. In many fields such as engineering construction and equipment procurement, illegal and criminal cases such as collusion in bidding, bribery, and bribery have occurred frequently, causing hidden dangers to project quality and safety management and seriously disrupting Market Order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tendering is a procurement method used in some large-scale projects. In theory, tendering is a means to promote competition, especially public tendering. From the perspective of a tenderer, let your procurement needs reach more potential suppliers and promote competition among them as much as possible so that you can buy the best goods, services, etc. with the least money. For bidders, through public bidding channels, they can learn more about business opportunities, participate in competition, and win business through strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, national regulations stipulate that some specific projects must identify suppliers through public bidding. For example, the Government Procurement Law stipulates that government procurement projects of goods and services above a certain amount (the specific amount is uniformly stipulated by the provincial level, and many provinces set it as more than 2 million yuan) must be publicly tendered. Relevant construction law rules stipulate that if the estimated price of a single construction contract for housing construction and municipal infrastructure projects is more than 2 million yuan, or the total project investment is more than 30 million yuan, bidding must be conducted, all of which use state-owned funds or state-owned funds. Those holding a controlling or dominant position must invite public bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if multiple bidders or even tenderers collude with each other and collude in bidding, the bidding will become a cover to hide the public and fail to achieve the purpose of bidding. For example, in a typical case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate this time, there was an information technology project of a certain unit that was openly tendered to the public. Two companies colluded in the bidding. As a result, the winning bid price of the project was more than 35 million yuan, which was far higher than the actual cost. Such a result has caused serious losses to the bidding unit. In addition, collusive bidding by multiple suppliers will also affect market competition. Some bidders even bribe bid evaluation committee members to give their bids high marks in order to win the bid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases of bid-rigging, the tenderer may not know about it, but the bidders collude with each other to raise the price and obtain more benefits. However, there are also many cases of bid-rigging. The staff of the bidding unit are not only informed, but they may even actively collude with the bidders to raise the price, or give the project to a designated bidder to benefit themselves. As for other companies participating in the bidding, they only &quot;accompany the bidding&quot; to meet the requirement of multiple suppliers participating in the bidding. In fact, the contents of their bid documents are worse than those of the designated bidders, and it is impossible to win the bid. They appear just to cooperate in acting and get a little &quot;accompanying the bid fee.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is undoubtedly rent-seeking, bribery and bribery. If the bidding unit is a state-owned enterprise or even a government agency or public institution, it will be suspected of bribery by public officials. Even if the bidding unit is a private enterprise, collusion in bidding will also constitute crimes such as job embezzlement and bribery of non-state personnel. The bidder paid bribes. The corruption behind this rent-seeking is quite astonishing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Zhejiang Daily&quot; once reported that Zhu Zhixiang, the former chairman of Shaoxing Urban Investment Group, as the main person in charge of the bidding unit, colluded with others and the bidders during the bidding process of relevant projects. , the total winning bid amount of the bidders reached more than 4.42 billion yuan. In April 2023, Zhu Zhixiang was sentenced to eleven years and six months in the first instance for bribery and bid collusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in some fields, bid-rigging and collusion have formed a complete industrial chain. Some practitioners do not have relevant qualifications themselves, so they &quot;affiliate&quot; with qualified units. The affiliated units charge a &quot;management fee&quot; that is a certain percentage of the winning bid amount and share the profits from the winning bid. There are also professional scalpers and engineering brokers who specialize in bid-rigging. They have great powers, and some may be related to the tendering party, and some can even obtain the contact information of bid evaluation experts in time and bribe them. There are also &quot;hackers&quot; who can invade the bid evaluation expert database and provide them with expert lists and contact information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang police once uncovered a company with only nine employees and no construction team, but it repeatedly won bids for large engineering projects. In just two years, it participated in a total of 338 bids for engineering projects. The investigation found that this is a professional bid-rigging gang. After winning the bid, they illegally sell the project and profit from it. These engineering projects are stripped down and subcontracted at many levels. Not only will the project cost increase, but the quality of the project will also be difficult to guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the latest criminal prosecution standards formulated by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security in 2022, collusion in bidding, the winning amount of the bid is more than 4 million yuan, the illegal income is more than 200,000 yuan, or threats, deception, bribery By using other means, colluding in bidding multiple times, etc., they are all suspected of committing the crime of colluding in bidding, and a case should be filed and prosecuted. In particular, we must severely crack down on rent-seeking and corruption involving insiders of the tendering party to maintain a fair market order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
