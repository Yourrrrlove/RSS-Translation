Among the more important ones are &quot;Sinan is a fake, so the compass is also a fake&quot; and &quot;Europe invented the compass one step earlier than China in 1190&quot;. These claims are specious. There is indeed a need to re-examine the invention, spread and significance of the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;True and fake compasses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;First of all, the &quot;Sinan&quot; we saw in the history books &quot;puts a magnetic spoon on the plate, and no matter how you turn the handle of the spoon, it always points to the south&quot;, It is constructed, and there is no such thing from documents to physical objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The literature basis for the view that &quot;Si Nan&quot; is a compass mainly comes from &quot;Han Feizi&quot; of the Warring States Period and &quot;Lunheng&quot; by Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty. However, this is a misunderstanding or distortion of the documentary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Han Feizi·Youdu Pian&quot; states: &quot;The invasion of the master by ladies and ministers is like the terrain, and they gradually pass by, causing the master to make mistakes and change faces from east to west without knowing it. Therefore, the king established &quot;Si Nan means day and night.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Si Nan&quot; here is not a compass, but marks the north-south direction on the court. It means that the king sits north and faces south, and uses magical instruments and rituals to consolidate the dignity of the emperor and the inferiority of his ministers. political landscape. It is very easy to find out where the south is when it is stationary. Just identify it according to the direction of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. It does not require high technology or instruments such as a compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lunheng·Shiyingpian&quot; states: &quot;The ancients were simple, and when they saw the movement of grass, they could refer to it, and if they could refer to it, they could refer to the sycophants. When Sinan&#39;s ladle was thrown to the ground, it was &quot;Guide.&quot; Fish and flesh insects gather in the ground and travel north, so the nature of insects is the same. Today&#39;s grass can refer to it, and it is also nature.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chong&#39;s purpose in writing this article is to oppose the influence of heaven and man in the Confucian classics of the Han Dynasty This concept believes that the characteristics of natural things are their own nature and has nothing to do with human affairs. The two examples cited are &quot;Sinan&#39;s Ladle&quot; and &quot;Fish and Flesh Worms&quot;. &quot;Lao&quot; refers to the Big Dipper, not a spoon. The meaning of the sentence &quot;Sinan&#39;s ladle, thrown to the ground, is a guide&quot; means that the Big Dipper (like a spoon shape) with guiding properties is projected to the ground, and the handle of the spoon is The direction it points to is south, but this is just a characteristic of the Big Dipper itself and has nothing to do with personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that whether it is &quot;Han Feizi&quot; or &quot;Lunheng&quot;, the &quot;Si Nan&quot; mentioned has nothing to do with the compass. So, why can the &quot;Sinan&quot; with a spoon on the plate, which was constructed due to misinterpretation of the literature, really be a guide? Because this thing is artificially magnetized using modern technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, Wang Zhenduo made the so-called &quot;Sinan&quot; with a spoon on the plate based on the record of &quot;Sinan&#39;s ladle, throw it on the ground, and guide it&quot;. He claimed that no matter how the magnet rotates on the plate, it will It will eventually point to the south, so I successfully copied &quot;Sinan&quot;. The truth is that because the spoon is too big, the friction when rotating on the plate is too great. The magnetism of the natural magnet cannot restrain the friction. Wang Zhenduo put the natural magnet into the magnetic field to magnetize it to achieve the effect of always guiding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancients did not have magnetization technology, so it was impossible to make &quot;Si Nan&quot; that did not exist in the literature. It is untenable to regard &quot;Si Nan&quot; as a compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people also believe that based on the records of magnets in the ancient Chinese books &quot;Lu Shi Chun Qiu&quot; and &quot;Huainan Zi&quot;, China has recognized the magnetism of magnets in ancient times and was able to create compasses at that time. This statement is also specious. Recognizing that magnets have magnetism to attract iron does not mean that they also recognize that magnets naturally have the characteristic of pointing to the South Pole. The polarity of magnets was not recorded until the Song Dynasty, so it is impossible to have invented it in the Warring States, Qin and Han Dynasties. Compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Heng of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ma Jun of the Cao Wei Dynasty, and Zu Chongzhi of the Southern Dynasty invented the compass car. However, the compass car did not use magnetism to indicate the direction, but used gear friction to keep the wooden figure on the car pointing in one direction. Although this invention has its value, factors such as wheel size errors and uneven road surfaces will cause deviations in the direction of the wooden man. Secondly, it cannot be used for navigation, so it is of little use. Therefore, it will be lost and reinvented many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The controversy between water compass and dry compass&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, although Sinan was constructed and the compass is not that amazing, the compass was indeed invented by the Chinese first. The evidence is strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, Yang Weide, an official of Sitiantai, mentioned in the &quot;Fuyuan Zonglu&quot; that the &quot;Bingwu needle&quot; pointed at a constant point was used to survey Feng Shui, and the &quot;Wu Jing Zong Yao&quot; mentioned that giving iron pieces a certain Magnetism made a &quot;guide fish&quot;, which floated in the water bowl and used the guide method. This was about the 1040s AD. In the Song Shenzong era that followed, the compass had achieved greater development. Shen Kuo&#39;s &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot; mentioned four forms of compasses, including the water float method, the bowl-lip spiral method, the nail spiral method, and the thread-suspended method. And think that the wisp method is the best. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest record of the use of compasses in navigation can be found in Zhu Yu&#39;s &quot;Pingzhou Ke Tan&quot; in the late Northern Song Dynasty. It is said that &quot;the boat master knows the geography, observes the stars at night, observes the sun during the day, and observes the sun when it is dark.&quot; Observe the Compass” (1120s AD). The &quot;earth snail&quot; mentioned in Zeng Sanyi&#39;s &quot;Yin Hua Lu&quot; in the early Southern Song Dynasty (1170s) was a compass designed by Feng Shui masters to improve the equipment for observing Feng Shui. The compass still used a floating needle guide with water, but Subdividing the azimuth scale allows people to grasp the direction more accurately. This is also the earliest recorded compass in the world, but there is no evidence that the compass was used for navigation at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is some controversy as to whether the dry compass was invented in China or Europe. Because according to existing documents, Europe may have mastered the dry compass before the Arabs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1190, the British theologian Alexander Nicham mentioned in &quot;On the Nature of Nature&quot; that &quot;a needle placed on a fulcrum will point out the direction of navigation after the rotation stops&quot;, which is very descriptive. It&#39;s like a dry compass, and the earliest Arab document recording a compass was Muhammad Ofi&#39;s &quot;Collection of Stories&quot; in 1232, after the Europeans, and it recorded a water compass rather than a dry compass. Some foreign scholars believe that the Chinese invented the water compass and influenced the Islamic world, but the Europeans independently invented the dry compass and were the first to use it for navigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the earliest Chinese classic that clearly records the dry compass is the &quot;Yin Hua Lu&quot; in the 1170s. In 1985, it was discovered in the tomb of Zhu Jinan, the military commander of Song Shaowu in Linchuan, Jiangxi (buried in 1198). The &quot;Zhang Xianren&quot; pottery figurine holding a dry compass indicates that the dry compass should have been born in China first. However, its age is too close to the year 1190 when the dry compass was recorded in Europe. It is difficult to determine that the dry compass was spread from China to Europe based on these alone. It is still very possible that China and Europe independently invented the dry compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there were some vague records of suspected dry compasses in China before this. The &quot;Jiutian Xuannv Qingnang Haijiao Jing&quot; written by Guo Pu of the Eastern Jin Dynasty is believed to be a Tang Dynasty classic, which records that it was used as a guide. Regarding the heaven and earth, Wang Ji&#39;s Feng Shui work &quot;Compass Yijing&quot; in the early Northern Song Dynasty also used the phrase &quot;the needle is clear between virtual dangers and dangers, and the three-way south is open; it is difficult for people to distinguish the right position, but it is indistinguishable.&quot; A poem like &quot;Spirit&quot; records a compass-like device. It is very likely that China invented the dry compass much earlier than the Southern Song Dynasty, so it had time to spread westward to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in China, the dry compass has been used in geomantic omen, and in Europe it was quickly used for navigation. By the Jiajing period of the 16th century, the Chinese were inspired by the Europeans coming from the East and used it to The dry compass, which has been used for navigation for hundreds of years, has been used to read Feng Shui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the ancient people who believed deeply in religion, new inventions were often religious items first and then put into practical use. The evolution of the function of the dry compass also conforms to this law. However, Europe was the first to put the newly acquired dry compass into practical use, and its technology was converted into productivity faster than China. This also shows that the social vitality of Europe in the High Middle Ages was even better than that of the Song Dynasty, the most dynamic dynasty in Chinese history. At this time, it is no longer important to argue about who invented the dry compass first. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The compass is one of the important navigation technologies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Song Dynasty was a rare era in which China allowed its own merchant ships to operate at sea. Therefore, after the invention of the compass and the water compass, within a few decades, 12 It was passed to the Islamic world in the late 13th century. In the 13th century Muhammad Offi&#39;s collection of Persian anecdotes, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Stories,&quot; records the story of using iron pieces similar to Chinese guide fish to find paths, which is enough to prove that the technology was passed from China. Europeans were the first to put dry compasses into navigation, but their ability to use the compass&#39;s guiding properties was probably also influenced by China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compasses are indeed a great help to world navigation technology, especially in the Mediterranean region. There are many cloudy days in the Mediterranean. The traditional navigation technology of positioning oneself based on the sun, moon and stars will be greatly reduced or even completely ineffective on cloudy and rainy days. At this time, the role of the compass is extremely precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the long run, the compass is only one of many important navigation technologies and should not be overly deified. The statement that &quot;without the compass, there would be no Age of Discovery&quot; is even more inconsistent with the facts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Neolithic Age, the primitive people of Oceania already had very outstanding navigation technology through the observation of ocean currents, celestial bodies, animals, and clouds, so they only used simple canoes, or at most they had outboards. The pallets were used to load supplies and transport people, but they were able to colonize the Pacific islands from Southeast Asia all the way east to Easter Island, which is not far from South America. To the west, they crossed the Indian Ocean to the African island of Madagascar. Such a magnificent ancient &quot;Age of Discovery&quot; did not require a compass to be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1st century, the Greek Hipparus discovered the pattern of the Indian Ocean monsoon. From then on, the ships of the Roman Empire could take advantage of the monsoon to reach India directly without having to detour along the coast, which greatly shortened the voyage. The connection between the Eurasian continent has been significantly strengthened, and the technological content is only above the compass, not below it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 8th century, the Vikings have used simple segmented wooden sticks or even raised an arm or a finger to observe the declination with the corresponding celestial body to determine their position. There was no compass when sailing from Scandinavia to Iceland, Greenland and even the Americas. From this we can see that even without a compass, Columbus could still have discovered the New World, but it was just more difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, before and after the compass, other civilizations also possessed many important navigation technologies, but these technologies did not promote navigation under the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the astrolabe of ancient Greece, sailors could arrange the relative positions of celestial bodies in the sky at a specific time. If the sailor could determine the date and time, he could adjust the copper rings representing different latitudes. When the aligned celestial bodies are aligned with the projection position of the celestial body you are currently seeing, you can determine your latitude. This position indication function for sailors is still better than that of a compass, but observing celestial objects requires clear weather and is subject to climate restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is the quadrant invented in the 17th century and the sextant invented in the 18th century. You can determine your latitude by measuring the height of celestial bodies, and the operation is easier than an astrolabe. During the day, measure the angle between the sun and the horizon. At night, measure the angle between Polaris and the horizon in the northern hemisphere, and measure the angle between the Southern Cross and the horizon in the southern hemisphere. Just move the indicator arm to align the sun, Polaris or the Southern Cross with the horizon. You can get your latitude on the indicator arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Determining the longitude of a sailor is much more difficult than the latitude, but by 1736, the British carpenter John Harrison invented the sea clock, which solved this century-old problem. As long as the sea clock is set to Greenwich Mean Time in the UK, no matter where the sailor is sailing, as long as he looks at the time on the sea clock at noon when the sun is highest, he can deduce how far he is from Greenwich and thus determine his longitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of the above important inventions have any impact on navigation. The progress of world navigation technology is the result of the joint efforts of various civilizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The compass stagnated in China but progressed in Europe&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Whether or not the European dry compass navigation was influenced by the Chinese compass, the compass is undoubtedly a Chinese invention. But it is a pity that China invented the compass and that was it. Europe continued to improve the dry compass, and through the study of the compass, it inspired the development of cartography and magnetism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 13th-century French scholar Peregrinus, based on his research on compasses, wanted to use magnetism as a power device for weapons. In a letter to a friend, he talked about a more comprehensive understanding of magnetism. Zhi, pioneered the study of magnetism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the 14th century, the Italian Amalfitani invented the &quot;compass card&quot;, a land compass that rotates with the needle, making the direction of the magnetic needle clearer. At the same time, the Italians also used compass bearing lines to draw nautical charts, making the nautical charts much more accurate than the TO world maps of the European Middle Ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the age of iron ships, European and American sailors realized that the magnetic force of the iron ship itself would interfere with the compass. They installed a piece of Flinderston iron on the compass to offset the compass error caused by the iron ship&#39;s magnetic field. , which became a common practice for iron ships in the 19th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1906, the German H. Anhuiz invented the gyrocompass. The rapidly rotating gyroscope will use the rotation of the earth to find the true north direction of the area, and will not be affected by the geomagnetic field and nearby metals. Impact, ideal for use inside metal carriers. Gyroscopic wheels were quickly adopted by European and American navies, and were later used more extensively in the aerospace field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1932, the radio compass was put into practical use in the Air Force. The radio compass determines the direction of the aircraft by calculating the angle between the aircraft and the released radio waves, providing the pilot with clear directions, which is another big step forward in compass technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology can only develop through continuous use. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the country was generally closed to the outside world, and no one was allowed to enter the sea. Although the private smuggling industry was quite prosperous, under the attack of the imperial court, the navigation industry in East Asia was still greatly affected, and it was natural for science and technology to stagnate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, China has had the idea of ​​​​&quot;celestial empire&quot;. It regards its neighboring countries as barbarians and has little enthusiasm for exchanges. The Song and Yuan dynasties were rare exceptions, so the compass was invented. However, in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, along with the ban on sea policy and the decrease in exchanges with overseas countries, the arrogance and arrogance became even stronger, which also prevented the people from spontaneously improving the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the Song and Yuan dynasties, which were relatively loose and socially dynamic, there was still an upper limit under the control of the Qin system. With the freight volume at that time, there may not be an urgent need to improve the compass, so although the Song Dynasty The compass was a rare invention, but there were not many further improvements. Therefore, only in a society with relaxed systems, open ideas, and active society can science and technology flourish. This is what the history of Compass has taught us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被检出兽药残存，明治召回4.4万瓶牛奶！客服回应了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260470]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 16:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Remnants of veterinary drugs were detected in Meiji milk, a well-known Japanese dairy brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 11, according to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the famous Japanese dairy brand Meiji Milk announced the recall of 44,000 bottles of bottled milk that have been on the market due to the detection of veterinary drug residues in the products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258011&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that this veterinary drug residue is called sulfamethoxazole, which is commonly used to prevent or treat infectious diseases in cattle or pigs. Since this substance will remain in the milk and have adverse effects on the human body, in accordance with production safety regulations, this drug must not be used on animals within 72 hours before milking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the milk with residual residue was produced by Meiji Dairy&#39;s Kansai factory in Kaizuka City, Osaka Prefecture, and is mainly 180 ml bottles for home delivery. On the 6th, the local government discovered veterinary drug residues during an inspection of the factory and ordered Meiji to recall the problematic products in accordance with relevant food safety regulations. So far, about 44,000 bottles of the product have been recalled. However, since the shelf life of this batch of problematic products ends on November 13, the products have been sold in many regions such as western and central Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Meiji Dairy Group issued a product recall announcement and stated that it would conduct a thorough investigation of the raw milk and production process to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The company argued in the announcement that there is currently no evidence to prove that residual sulfamethoxazole is obviously harmful to the human body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding this matter, a reporter from Nandu Wancaishe asked the customer service of the Meiji flagship store on major e-commerce platforms. The Meiji customer service on the JD.com platform stated that the milk and other products sold by the store in China, except for the use of Except for the raw milk raw materials produced in China, all dairy products are made from dairy products other than Japan.

It is said that if you have never used or even heard a term starting with &quot;Princess please&quot;, then you are already behind the Internet trend. This new &quot;meme&quot; on the Internet is not only used as a joke between parents, children and spouses, but also used by some businesses for &quot;Double Eleven&quot; promotions and live broadcasts to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prototype of the line &quot;Princess please&quot; comes from the classic old movie &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. The reporter played by Gregory Peck said &quot;Princess please&quot; to the princess played by Audrey Hepburn. &quot;Get in the car&quot;; and &quot;Princess please&quot; became an Internet meme, which originated from a funny video on Douyin: a father picked up his daughter on a bicycle, but the daughter said &quot;You said &#39;Princess please get in the car&#39;&quot;. Unexpectedly, the father did not continue riding away, leaving his daughter behind to chase him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this funny video became popular on the short video platform, it immediately brought about a wave of imitation and secondary creation. The main promoters were short video bloggers and e-commerce platform merchants, which gave rise to &quot; More hot memes like &quot;Princess please drink tea&quot;, &quot;Princess please dine&quot;, &quot;Princess please sign for receipt&quot; and &quot;Princess please place order&quot; can be described as a victory of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the carnival of &quot;Princess Please&quot; has gradually emerged with some new &quot;games&quot;, and its negative externalities are worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is the &quot;identity&quot; issue of the &quot;Princess Please&quot; short video on the Internet platform. A careful review of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos on the short video platform can be roughly divided into three types: one is completely staged and belongs to situational skits; the other is a real shot on the spot, with immediate reactions to the real shot; the third is difficult to distinguish between true and false. It’s not marked and can’t be seen, which is problematic in itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These short videos are common on social media platforms: bloggers find the takeaway guy and ask him to say &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the boss at the restaurant to cooperate in filming &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the bus and An online ride-hailing driver said &quot;Princess, please get out of the car&quot;; he asked security guards at the school gate to say &quot;Princess, please go back to school&quot;; recently in Nanjing, Jiangsu, a woman who fell asked an ambulance doctor to say &quot;Princess, please get in the car&quot;; and even in Yunnan Province In a certain hospital, a surgeon appeared in the process of operating on a patient and said &quot;Please princess, please remove the electric knife&quot; and &quot;Please say thank you princess&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is obvious at a glance that most of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; short videos are fictitious and staged, but the result is that they appear to be &quot;real-looking&quot;. Such an unlabeled operation is inevitable Non-compliant. Disguising it as news to mislead the public is not without the suspicion of guiding public opinion. I would like to ask, will the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos create the illusion that &quot;all walks of life say &quot;Princess Please&quot; is a reality, and in turn &quot;force&quot; all walks of life to &quot;must say Princess please&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Notice on Strengthening the Management of &quot;We-Media&quot;&quot;, which is commonly known as the &quot;Thirteen Articles&quot;, including &quot;annotation of fictitious content or controversial information&quot; Requirements for &quot;label&quot; (Article 5): When &quot;self-media&quot; publishes content that contains fictional plots and plot interpretations, the website platform should require it to mark the fiction or interpretation label in a conspicuous manner. If the staged &quot;Princess Please&quot; is not marked and deliberately makes it difficult to distinguish the authenticity, it will inevitably be suspected of violating this law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether staged or real, the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos has brought about problems of blurred boundaries and emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents, children and spouses say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is an emotional interaction between close relatives; when e-commerce platform customer service personnel say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is to use emotional marketing to promote actual transactions. Follow It is also the market principle of voluntary transactions; and if strangers who are neither relatives nor friends must be forced to say &quot;Princess please&quot; in front of the camera, and even public authorities follow the &quot;playful joke&quot;, this will cause a problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to those &quot;princess please&quot; short videos that are obviously staged, there is also a type of &quot;princess please&quot; that is real and even more worrying: the head teacher takes advantage of his position to ask a whole room of primary school students to shout &quot; Princess, please leave the get out of class.&quot; &quot;Beautiful princess, please leave the class.&quot; Children don&#39;t quite understand what posing is, so teaching them to cooperate in a performance only requires &quot;coercion and inducement.&quot; This approach is tantamount to using one&#39;s position to coerce children to satisfy their own emotional values ​​and help them harvest traffic. It is not compliant with the procedures and unfair in the results. It is not the way to teach and educate people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Official accounts of government departments also use &quot;Princess Please&quot; to promote laws and regulations. It seems to be a closer relationship and facilitates dissemination, but it can easily give people the impression of not being serious in the long run. It is also detrimental to popularize legal knowledge and promote citizens to abide by the law: what public authorities need is to perform their statutory duties, strictly abide by the law and strictly enforce the law. How can they show such a humble attitude of &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot; and &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the popular &quot;Princess Please&quot; is just another &quot;Internet meme&quot; destined to have a short life cycle, but it has characteristics that are different from previous &quot;Internet memes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Princess Please&quot; is not the first-generation Internet meme of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. Memes such as &quot;kiss&quot; and &quot;little fairy&quot; have been circulated for several times. Online language ebbs and flows, coming and going quickly. This is what is commonly known as &quot;language inflation&quot; (referred to as &quot;call inflation&quot;): just like currency, the &quot;face value&quot; of language is getting larger and larger, and the value it expresses is getting bigger and bigger. However, its &quot;value&quot; is getting smaller and smaller, and the thoughts and feelings it can carry are becoming increasingly poor. All kinds of &quot;internet memes&quot; are overused but internally poor, and have become quickly decaying words instead of meaningful idioms, which is the natural ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how you play &quot;Princess Please&quot;, it should still follow the principle of voluntariness, there must be boundaries, public power should not be involved, and teachers should not engage in emotional blackmail from students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[涉嫌贩卖出生医学证明，广西南宁相关医院责任人已被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260468]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 15:14:51&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Nanning Municipal Health Commission in Guangxi that people reported that a hospital in Nanning was suspected of selling medical birth certificates , the obstetrics and gynecology department of the hospital involved has been suspended for rectification, and criminal coercive measures have been taken against the relevant responsible persons of the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a joint investigation by the health, public security and other departments, it was found that the hospital involved was Nanning Chenghe Hospital, and relevant work such as investigation and evidence collection is being further carried out.

The earliest screen known today appeared in the late Zhou Dynasty. Initially, they were used to help the owner abandon distracting thoughts and focus on contemplation and meditation. Later, they gradually became one of the living furnishings of nobles and literati, used to isolate space, block sight, and increase the sense of privacy. As the Tang Dynasty spread eastward, screens were introduced to Japan. The Japanese often placed them at the door of their homes to block the sneaky atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/PAzTf0V0D61jhUAk8q0ZEIGxbcxPmV5dD99omqKG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/PAzTf0V0D61jhUAk8q0ZEIGxbcxPmV5dD99omqKG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hide Both architecture and storage are oriental. Whether it is architecture, gardens or homes, Eastern aesthetics are most afraid of &quot;getting straight to the point&quot;. Direct access is ultimately vulgar. &quot;Shadow walls&quot; and &quot;stone screens&quot; must be built to block the line of sight. This is also in another sense. Screen - In &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, in order to welcome Concubine Yuan to the royal family, a lot of effort was put into building a luxurious Grand View Garden. As soon as he entered the garden, he first built a rockery with green peaks to block all the scenery. Jia Zheng explained, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for this mountain, what would be the point of seeing all the scenery in the garden when you enter?&quot; One sentence broke through the screen. The psychological motivation of existence: to welcome but also to reject, the winding path leads to the secluded place, &quot;the more you explore the scenery, the better you will get&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When screens were introduced to the West, their shapes and techniques had become diverse. People in the Baroque period even used them as props in dramas and operas, whether to beautify the stage, indicate scenery, or isolate narrative space. The performance capabilities of the screens are all top-notch. By the 19th century, many artists, architects and designers had widely adopted this form, giving screens more artistic expression. The screen therefore also has multiple identities: is it a painting or a sculpture? Is it art or furniture? Is it a practical object or a decorative item? Is it a prop or a device? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Zv6COcmOL4pHzHQDlEu5BM8Rw5PaeU8ZZx5zVuCu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Zv6COcmOL4pHzHQDlEu5BM8Rw5PaeU8ZZx5zVuCu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257468&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None The standard answer is that the screen answers this unsolvable proposition with its complex and diverse attitude. In modern society, &quot;screen&quot; has also been given more and more meanings. We are surrounded by various &quot;screens&quot;, isolating and attracting us. This was the inspiration for the exhibition Paraventi: Screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a comprehensive exhibition that shuttles between many cultures. This one located in PRADA Rongzhai in Shanghai is a branch of its global exhibitions, and therefore has more Chinese colors. .一幅来自18世纪的皇室紫檀屏风传递出中式屏风最经典、最风雅的样貌，这是古代文人雅士常用的画屏，12扇围屏互相铰连，彼此可以犬牙交互地排开，亦可一字或弧形排列，每个扇板上方都留着张贴画作的位置，一般主人会委托画家定制12幅一组的画作，画于宣纸或绢上，再贴于画屏之上，有时候主人自己亦精通画术，画屏就成了展示作品和清供赏玩的风雅道具。古代屏风常被移动，画作易损，因此主人们常常将喜爱的作品从屏风上取下，装裱成卷轴保存，画屏上的画作也因此可以常常替换。也正因此，目前大多数存世的古代屏风上都没有张贴绘画作品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一种常见的中式屏风，是在中国已有两千多年历史的单扇竖屏，这类屏风通常为石制或砖制，荣宅展出的是其中一种小型石屏，往往供于案头，上面镶嵌的石壁带有仿若山水的纹路，也寄寓文士高山流水的胸中沟壑。这种小型案头石屏并非只用来观赏，它有着非常实际的功能性，在主人写书和绘画时，案头屏风可以防止穿堂风快速吹干墨汁，是重要的文房之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在展厅内诸多当代创作的屏风作品中，最令我惊艳的是影像艺术家曹斐的作品，她把荣宅的一号圆厅彻底变成了一个绿幕之境。蓝色和绿色的幕布勾勒出一个个椭圆的屏，跟老洋房窗棂间的蓝绿彩色玻璃呼应。展厅里陈列着许多影像，皆与“绿幕”相关，众所周知，绿幕和蓝幕是影像工业中的重要道具，常用来制作虚拟场景。曹斐拍摄了许多现代生活中的场景：扛着绿幕猛踩单车的壮汉，在公共健身器械上疯狂转动绿幕的男女，在沙滩上凝视着一方绿幕的丽人，分别置身于蓝、绿色垃圾桶里的蓝幕和绿幕，在电梯间里把绿幕作为靶子猛练搏击的悍女，似乎就是曹斐本人……在所有这些影像之中，那些绿幕上都会间歇地出现影像，但片刻之后又会恢复成绿幕，循环往复，仿佛一段亦真亦假的寓言，不断提醒我们：在一个被视频充斥的时代，我们目之所及，看到的影像都可能是虚拟的，不真实的，不值得信任的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nKn2fq2DqnXA4To94A6o5CmsM5655OqlEN17GRnm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nKn2fq2DqnXA4To94A6o5CmsM5655OqlEN17GRnm.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;但绿幕上出现的那些画面，却恰恰是来自前互联网时代的影像，大多数是怀旧的1980年代：春晚、新闻联播、怀旧金曲、流水线上的女工等等。这种巨大的差异，造成了令人啼笑皆非的视觉张力。绿幕存在的环境异常荒诞，但当绿幕上出现图景时，又出现了一个我们依然信任影像的时代，在那个时代，影像是一言九鼎的，是说话算话的。而今天，这些影像像幽灵一样，断续地闪跳在绿幕之上，而绿幕充斥在最匪夷所思之处，在展场中也铺天盖地，绿幕之中甚至精心布置了许多直播台，美颜灯下一坐，观展者已经化身为素人主播！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曹斐说，她小时候在故宫里看到令人望而却步的豪华屏风，在她生长的南中国，各种雕龙画凤的旧式屏风也并不稀见，总是有充足空间的大户人家才配使用屏风。但让她感到亲切的反倒是那些简易的、有温度的、普通人也能够使用的屏风，淡绿色的棉布帘子绷在架子上，提供最简单的遮挡。需要打针的人就躲进这屏风后面，脱出半个屁股供护士扎针……但站在影像的角度，她眼中的“屏”，意味着另一种隔绝和遮挡。 “随着直播文化的盛行，绿幕技术赋予了屏幕新的流动性、不确定性和虚构性，重塑了我们所看到的世界……它就像直播视频背后的现实：除了一块光秃秃的&#39;绿幕&#39;之外，什么都没有。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“作为一个影像艺术家，我早就已经不信任图像了。”曹斐说，这也正是她这组作品想要表达的，“我们正真实地生活在这样一个图像不可信、现实无法确定、每一帧都不相同的时代。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖北襄阳“健桥医院贩卖出生证”最新通报 叶某芝等6名犯罪嫌疑人被批捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260463]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 13:26:22&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;11月12日，湖北襄阳市人民政府发布通报，11月6日，网民举报襄阳健桥医院（襄城区陈侯巷169号，民营，法定代表人叶某芝，女，55岁）贩卖出生医学证明等问题后，襄阳市立即成立由市委、市政府主要领导任组长、相关市领导为各工作组负责人，市公安、卫健、纪检监察等部门组成的工作专班，从严从快、依法依规开展问题调查、案件侦办和追责问责等工作。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;如去年一样，不止一支表演队伍踩高跷，穿着戏服，从昭明书院的堂内缓缓出发巡游。但今年，窄窄的西栅大街（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;一条通常只容三人并行的石板路&lt;/span>;）竟然塞了六排观众。踩高跷的演员向西行去，一拨人跟着，一拨人趁着交通拥堵缓解，往反方向走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/KErtoyLZGqm2nn09wInla1PNLXgX2A4inb3N8rs0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;762&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/KErtoyLZGqm2nn09wInla1PNLXgX2A4inb3N8rs0.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;今年许多人喜穿古装悠游拍照，乌镇也是，我更恍惚，古时人们逛庙会是否也如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/S1c7XN0lLP0OauLPRUnpMnZp1BN4gXOWsF1qikSc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;饰演诡计多端小丑的演员&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乌镇戏剧节总策划丁乃竺推介古镇嘉年华时说，“人生百态，戏剧百态，你可以是观众，你也可以融入其中。”去年乌镇戏剧节11月底举办，在新冠疫情防疫政策最严格的时候，而今年，至少四倍于去年的游客进入西栅，观众与嘉年华演出的联结更加紧密。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;算上这对英豪在内，雨读桥下，连着就有三个演戏点。每个点外观众都围成圈，三个圈子挤在一起，几乎要产生交集了，我站在桥上看，比武的英豪不远处在演肢体剧，两三把椅子、一块白布、若干玫瑰花瓣，构成整个表演场域。男女演员用白布盖上椅子，撒玫瑰花瓣，转圈、对视，推倒椅子，不讲话，用这些动作来表达他们的情感变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/LeiTvAm2ANJ6J6jZbHNhS0X3FbRmTtHMDj3UsYoE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;701&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/LeiTvAm2ANJ6J6jZbHNhS0X3FbRmTtHMDj3UsYoE.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“杀手！”有人声音最大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好，演杀手。接下来是癖好。 “跳女团舞！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这时，猜谜的演员被叫回来，他的同伴表演一名跳女团舞的杀手，他来猜。猜不中，观众可以发出嘘声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sE2zbaL4adSbK90lNB3fPWBzo03qQKVh0kzXK6Ng.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桥边的环境实验戏剧《半人马2023》，后半段有些冷场&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这类注重互动的嘉年华演出今年非常多。比如有两个小丑发红白两色的气球棒，将上前参与的观众分成红白两队，小孩子很踊跃。白队的小丑夸张地偷换掉红队小丑的气球。小小的男孩女孩（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;家长给他们扮成古时的少爷小姐&lt;/span>;）并不怯场，跟着白小丑逗红小丑玩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天我赶往日月广场采访准备彩排的戏剧导演，广场被三个高大的俄罗斯表演者及几排观众占据，好像很精彩。采访时，我还能听到风琴声和游客的鼓掌欢呼。第二天同一时间我又过此处，果然捕到三个东欧人，蒸汽朋克打扮，一人拉风琴，一人吹黑管，一人打鼓，每人头顶各一盏灵活转动的灯，可以拉亮（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我并不懂这个设计的意义所在&lt;/span>;）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;演出有二十来分钟，中间几度，三个人或自我介绍，或与观众交流，没有翻译，在场应该也没有人听懂，但大家很有默契，东欧人话语一停，纷纷欢呼鼓掌，毫不吝惜热情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有的很古典。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7zigEVt8BqTYVKmW1vdEhjI9kAsVpA5VcC6lWNQh.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;灵水居外的河边，停着夜晚会发光的嘉年华装置&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两次在昭明书院的古戏台，我都驻足听了海丰县西秦戏艺术传承中心的《连环计·小宴》。天色将暗之时，昭明书院一侧的戏台，在司徒王允的介绍下，吕布结识了年方十八的貂蝉。吕布问貂蝉，为何还不婚配？貂蝉挥动水袖，吕布轻轻搭住水袖一角，用手假作酒杯，在水袖上来回一划，将杯中物一饮而尽。是为上钩，手、眼、身、步都有看头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;昭明书院是为纪念南朝梁太子萧统而建，内院扩大，成为乌镇嘉年华许多演出的表演地点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巧合之下，我有一天就在昭明书院看了两次《知己》，都只看到了后一半，伯牙的独角戏：那是改编的伯牙子期的故事，书院空地处，有古琴一张、颂钵一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GO7Nowll01yN3UFYlGRCbFTdZXL2HpbHv6He1ygC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;下午我转场想休息，在河边咖啡馆坐下，抬头，桥上竟然又是子期，白袍红绸很抢眼。编辑和我讨论工作，过了十几分钟我抬头，子期还在桥上，有人在拍他。这时我身边坐下两个游客，一个说，“我在桥下看风景，看风景的人在桥上看你，是不是？”“什么？”另一个回。先前说话的人指指子期，“我记得有句这个话，是不是？”这时子期下桥，仿佛去看河对岸的演出了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;折扣牛创始人马昕彤在抖音发布视频称，根据公开的折扣MAMA创始人自述，这个品牌在今年9月份的时候，应该是20家至30家店，年流水应该是不过亿的。还有网友在留言中质疑道，“17个亿，2500家店，平均每个店一年就卖68万左右吗？还有这2500家店都主要开在哪里了呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘润反复解释，称“演讲里和全文稿里都有解释”“这2500家店，包括自营的店、联名的店和供应链支撑的店”“这个数字，经过邢云飞本人确认”。MAMA创始人邢云飞也回应称，折扣MAMA全国直营、联营、供应链托管支撑的门店4000+云云。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘润甚至发表题为《刘润：2700家店，17亿，折扣MAMA的数据，到底是不是臆想的？》的文章，“蹭我的流量没有关系，但是，你误导了很多真诚的创业者”引发了更多的不满。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;左支右绌一番后，刘润终于在11月2日在微博发布致歉信，承认几处错误。风波告一段落。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，刘润在年度演讲中的错误是很明显的，正如他自己最后承认的，所谓“2500家店”并不是MAMA开设的，绝大部分都是MAMA“服务”的商业伙伴。如果把供应链上下游、联名之类的商业合作伙伴都算到品牌开的店，中国要增加多少“独角兽”企业？更为讽刺的是，按照合作都算的注水口径，邢云飞给出的数据是4000家以上，说明刘润演讲中提到的“2500家”也很不准确，莫不是折中的“模糊处理”？商业咨询专业人士的年度演讲，不应该出现这样低级的数据错误。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;低级错误不应该，错了还不及时承认更不应该了。人非圣贤，孰能无过。过而能改，善莫大焉。错了就大大方方承认，再作出合理的解释，这是危机公关最基本的处理原则。刘润却没有这样做，应该不是不懂，而是立人设、做流量的“网红”商业模式导致动作变形。商业咨询的生意不能这样做，但是“网红”的流量生意就得这么做。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;互联网兴起以来，涌现了一批网红“商业咨询师”，或所谓“商业战略大师”。他们的履历光鲜，大串头衔如过江之鲫。刘润就是其中的代表人物。但是，这些“商业咨询师”的经营模式和传统商业咨询行业大相径庭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;活跃在网上的“商业咨询师”IP化、媒体化，热衷于大众传播的“to C”生意，而不是传统商业咨询机构服务企业的“to B”业务。比如刘润的头衔里有多家大型企业的战略顾问，但是公众很难了解他对这些企业的战略优化有多大贡献，也很难了解他和他的商业团队从这些企业咨询业务中获得了多少营收。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘润最为引人瞩目的商业成就是昂贵的线上课程、更昂贵的线下课程，给他带来的巨额收入。刘润售课的主力平台“得到”的母公司思维造物招股书显示，从2017年开始，刘润连续四年出现在“得到”的重大采购合同中。2017至2020年，刘润获得总计5800万的线上线下课程收益。刘润的IP已经成了“得到”的优质资产。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很难用传统商业咨询业务的标准评价刘润的事业，可以肯定的是，刘润是非常成功的互联网内容生产者，IP价值很高的“网红”。今天互联网上活跃的“商业咨询师”基本上都是这样的情形，很难看到他们的咨询业务多么成功，知识付费的内容传播渠道才是主要营收来源。传统商业咨询当然也赚培训费，但是课不是这么卖的，受众也不是这样“有教无类”的有教无类。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;传统商业咨询机构的服务对象是很有限的，中小型机构通常只对几家长期客户负责，大型机构也不过数十上百家的长期客户。他们的服务需要不断接受客户的绩效考核，每一个“金点子”、每一份专题报告、每一堂培训课，都要对企业经营有切实的帮助。而“商业咨询师”以十万、百万计的流量，意味着受众群体巨大，实际绩效难以统计。“商业咨询师”妙语连珠的金句中，到底让多少买课的“学生”获得商业收益，无人统计，也无从统计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果一定要把这种内容创作和传播归类为商业咨询业的话，那只能说是商业咨询业的培训分支走向“下沉市场”。受众庞大、良莠不齐，具体场景千差万别，不可能提供传统商业咨询业的定制化服务，传播效果就是这个下沉市场的追逐目标。这个“下沉市场”竞争的是流量，而不是服务绩效。因此，主要竞争手段是表达技巧，而不是促进受众商业利益的实际绩效。宏观叙事华丽，微观多灌心灵鸡汤，新概念和金句齐飞，语不惊人死不休都是为了吸引更多的粉丝、收获更多的流量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“商业咨询师”“商业战略大师”的行为模式更接近其他做流量生意的“网红”，而不是传统商业咨询机构。他们要和所有网红一样，永远以维护人设和流量基本盘为最高优先级。传统商业咨询机构既没有这样的“流量压力”，也不存在搪塞、糊弄的空间——客户都是内行，不好糊弄。即使糊弄一时，最终绩效出问题也是枉然。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，互联网活跃的“商业咨询师”不是商业咨询业的网络化，而是商业文化传播的网红化。“网红化”本身并非贬义。用对了，可以提高信息传播效率，有利于知识和观点的普及。但是，用错了，却会成为行业水平下降、职业道德滑坡的起点。刘润低级错误在前、不肯认错在后，可以归类为后者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“商业咨询师”作为互联网时代的新兴行业，要有乐见其成的宽容，但也需要吃一堑长一智的警觉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一事件对“商业咨询师”行业是个警示。传播商业文化没有错，但是不要过度拔高行业定位。大部分都是面向大众传播商业知识的内容生产者，何必挂“商业咨询”的“羊头”？微观的商业场景千差万别，细分市场五花八门，纵有通天彻地之能，能给多少用户提供咨询服务？强行造IP、卖人设的虚张声势，有违商业精神。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对知识付费的消费者而言，这次事件也是个提醒。两三百块钱的买课钱要是能买到改变命运的发财秘籍，这世上哪里还有穷人？理性消费，谨慎选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有那些“战略顾问”多到记不住的大企业，自家的名器应该珍惜。不想被人忽悠，也不要随便让人家拿出去忽悠别人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;国家邮政局市场监管司副司长边作栋说，今年的快递业务旺季主要呈现出两个高峰更加平稳，支撑消费复苏、经济向好作用更加明显，用户体验更加便捷三大特点。今年的快递业务旺季继续在11月1日和11月11日形成两波高峰，分摊了行业在单个高峰的压力，运行更加平稳。邮政快递与电子商务、现代农业、现代制造业等深度融合，“双11”期间全网揽收量再创历史新高，折射出我国消费市场的蓬勃活力，是经济恢复向好的生动写照。邮政快递深度融入电商产业链，大量预售商品前置存储至快递云仓，寄递服务更加快速准确。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他表示，今年的快递业务旺季从11月1日开始，到2024年春节前夕结束。为做好旺季服务保障工作，国家邮政局在与各主要电商平台及寄递企业进行充分形势研判和服务能力评估的基础上，制定保障方案，全面部署落实，协调电商平台与寄递企业继续发挥“错峰发货、均衡推进”的核心机制作用。同时，深入开展安全隐患排查整治，全方位确保生产安全、寄递安全、信息安全，防范行业伤亡事故发生；坚持快递包装标准化、循环化、减量化、无害化，鼓励电商快件原装直发，减少前端过度包装。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在业务旺季和低温雨雪天气条件下，一线快递员作业时间长、负荷重、压力大。为此，邮政管理部门持续加强基层从业人员队伍关心关爱工作，维护快递员群体合法权益，并发布消费提示，吁请广大用户给予快递员群体更多包容和理解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[圣药丨本草物色]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260208]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/2fb4OeDpmkRFUzm2iHSIuYWuvkT2mgksjEEbRgMo.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;熬好的阿胶。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与人参、鹿茸并称“三宝”的阿胶，拥有毋庸置疑的披靡知名度。坊间盛传曾用梧桐叶作药引子的名医叶天士，称阿胶为血肉有情之品，滋补最甚。所谓血肉有情之品，即动物药，叶氏于此，颇为推重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿胶即阿地出产的胶，而冠名地域则是道地药材的经典标签。陶弘景破题：出东阿，故名阿胶。李时珍细化延展：阿井，在今山东兖州府阳谷县东北六十里，即古之东阿县。有官舍禁之。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;才子曹植生前曾多次迁徙封地，东阿是其终于陈王前的一站，死后遵其遗愿也葬于本地鱼山。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓有官舍禁之，透露出阿胶的官控贡品资质。有《水经注》可为背书：（东阿）大城北门内西侧，皋上有大井，其巨若轮，深六七丈，岁尝煮胶，以贡天府。 《本草》所谓阿胶也。故世俗有阿井之名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;煮胶的阿井水依李时珍所述，乃济水所注，用它煮胶，用搅浊水则清。所以如此，盖济水清而重，其性趋下。所谓重，在于其所含矿物质的丰富，据说每担阿井水比普通井水和河水重3斤左右。看来煮胶一如酿酒，禀赋质地的活水占有相当权重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郦道元提及的《本草》，即《神农本草经》，《本草》类著作的滥觞，载记于它，足见阿胶出品的古早。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而煮胶的原料，《名医别录》说是煮牛皮作之。也就是说，本经时代的阿胶，原是牛皮。李时珍指出，用母牛水牛皮、驴皮者为上，猪、马、骡、鸵皮者次之，各种旧皮、鞋履等物者为下。大抵古方所用多是牛皮，后世乃贵驴皮。至于何以有此变更，陈藏器解释说，诸胶皆主风、止泻、补虚，而驴皮主风为最。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，牛驴之替换，其中应当也与牛乃农耕主要畜力乃至军资因而为官厅严控有关。秦法有杀牛杀马者死的严酷律条，后世王朝虽然不再至于杀头，但也须负刑事责任，譬如唐律便规定，即便杀掉自家的牛，也要判一年的徒刑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而修尾后垂，巨耳双磔，被中原人视为匈奴奇畜的驴，据顾炎武《日知录》，自秦以上，驴不见于文字记载，即便有也当非寻常人家所常畜。 “尝考驴之为物，至汉而名，至孝武而得充上林，至孝灵而贵幸。然其种大抵出于塞外。”大略在汉武时期，驴“衔尾入塞”“尽为我畜”，由上林奇兽的观赏进而充运输之畜力，其耐粗放易驱使抗病力强较早熟寿命长等生命元素，也在性价比的权衡上胜出，赢得官私两造的青睐，而诗人“细雨骑驴入剑门”“天海诗情驴背得”的描摹，又影影绰绰流露驴之于文人墨客的某种瓜葛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;论到驴皮的入药，自当在其大量繁育之后。驴之役用之外，食肉寝皮自是题中应有之义，制革造胶亦连类而及。而胶之致用，陶弘景指出，胶有三种：清而薄者画家用；清而厚者名盆覆胶，入药用；浊而黑者不入药，但可胶物尔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓驴皮主风为最，是唐人的论断，而至迟在北宋时期，乌驴皮得阿井水煎成的阿胶，已是公认的最佳。在法度森严的医家看来，东阿之外，只有驴胶而无阿胶。但鉴于贡品的独占，阿井官禁，天花板级的真胶极为难得，民间货卖，多是马皮、旧革、鞍靴之类伪造，气味浊臭，不堪入药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;假药虽然向遭声讨，但却从未绝迹。秉医者仁心，李时珍贴心起底，当以黄透如琥珀色，或光黑如瑿漆者为真。真者不作皮臭，夏月亦不湿软。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;神剧《大宅门》中被陈宝国老师演嗨了的白七爷，其原型乃同仁堂少东家乐镜宇。乐老先生当年至济南，创宏济堂，出品的阿胶有九提九炙之称：冬至剥毛，惊蛰起灶，铜锅银铲，桑柴火烧，九提九灸，九昼取膏，工序九九，繁而不少，春分阴曝，立夏成胶。这是贡胶的路径。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李时珍的阐释则更其简要：凡造诸胶，自十月至二、三月间……俱取生皮，水浸四五日，洗刮极净。熬煮，时时搅之，恒添水。至烂，滤汁再熬成胶，倾盆内待凝，近盆底者名坌胶，煎胶水以咸苦者为妙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于造胶的时间线，《齐民要术》也说煮胶要用二月、三月、九月、十月，余月则不成。而不成的道理，在于热则不凝，无作饼；寒则冻瘃，合胶不黏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不但炮制繁复，用药时的修治也颇有不易。陶弘景曰：凡用皆火炙之。号称雷公的雷敩云：凡用，先以猪脂浸一夜，取出，柳木火炙燥研用。李时珍则分而治之：今方法或炒成珠，或以面炒，或以酥炙，或以蛤粉炒，或以草灰炒，或以酒化成膏，或水化膏，当各从本方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿胶最负盛名的功效，自是和血滋阴，除风润燥。如李时珍所言，阿胶大要只是补血与液，故能清肺益阴而治诸证。此外他又着意提到，痢疾多因伤暑伏热而成，阿胶乃大肠之要药。有热毒留滞者，则能疏导；无热毒留滞者，则能平安。由此他老人家以圣药也的定评，予阿胶封神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本经将阿胶归为上品，也即“主养命以应天，无毒，久服不伤人”的君药。虽然上品中未必都是极品，但阿胶果然堪与人参甘草比肩，不愧其神一样的存在。 &lt;/p>;
