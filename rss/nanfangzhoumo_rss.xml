(People’s Vision/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 27, 1983, 17 students walked into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. They received 200 yuan in clothing fees in advance. One of them bought a suit specially, but he couldn&#39;t tie it, so he had to ask his instructor for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are the first batch of Ph.D.s in New China. Except for one who was doing postdoctoral research in the United States and did not attend, these 17 people received the &quot;Doctorate Degree Certificate&quot; with the golden national emblem at the Great Hall of the People. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reform and opening up, doctoral training started in a hurry, and the research fields of the first batch of 18 PhDs also highlighted a country&#39;s yearning for modernization. 17 of them were PhDs in science and 1 was a PhD in engineering. . &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;40 years later, the questions that confused Su Buqing are also asking more people. According to the &quot;2022 National Education Development Statistical Bulletin&quot;, 82,300 doctoral students will graduate in 2022, and 556,100 doctoral students will be studying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the 40th anniversary of the graduation of the first batch of doctoral students in New China. The birth of the first batch of Ph.D.s witnessed the development of China’s degree system from scratch. Nowadays, facing the huge group of doctoral students, further improving the quality of training has become a new development focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang, a professor at the School of Education of Central China Normal University, believes that doctoral education should not only expand quantity, but &quot;quality must be the lifeline of doctoral training.&quot; In his view, China has spent 40 years going through the path of exploration that other countries have taken for hundreds of years, and has formed a doctoral education system that is in line with China’s reality and is still gradually improving. “The 40-year development history of doctoral education is also a doctoral education system. A History of Educational Reform.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Twisted Exploration&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The establishment of China’s doctoral system has been full of twists and turns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, although there was a degree system covering bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees, no doctorate was awarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang explained that although the system had been established, the country was poor and weak at that time, and the number of undergraduate and master&#39;s students was limited, which &quot;was not enough to support the development of doctoral education.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1956, the seventh year after the founding of New China, the &quot;Degree Regulations of the People&#39;s Republic of China (Draft)&quot; were submitted to the central government for approval, dividing degrees into master&#39;s and doctoral levels. However, due to various reasons, the regulations were not formally promulgated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the exploration of the associate doctorate system is also underway. In 1955, the Chinese Academy of Sciences officially proposed to learn from the Soviet Union and establish an associate doctorate system, and announced the first batch of 65 admissions the following year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Soviet Union, an associate doctorate was second only to a doctorate, and was also called a &quot;candidate doctor.&quot; A doctorate was not obtained through postgraduate education, but was applied for after accumulating many years of work experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the &quot;First Five-Year Plan&quot; had been implemented, which clearly proposed the establishment of a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. Zheng Gang told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an urgent need for high-level talents in both industry and higher education. Under the background of learning from the Soviet Union, associate doctoral students came into being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this exploration also failed to continue. Soon after, the former Ministry of Higher Education issued a notice, &quot;It was decided not to use the name &#39;associate doctoral students&#39;. All associate doctoral students recruited last year (1956) will be called graduate students.&quot; More than a month later, it was decided not to award an associate doctorate. Zheng Gang learned that &quot;the vast majority of associate doctoral students who had enrolled at that time only received graduation certificates and no degree certificates.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this are not only the influence of international politics, but also the difficulty of connecting the associate doctorate system with the mainstream international degree system. In addition, some universities recruit associate doctoral candidates who are not part-time workers, causing many university teachers and hospital doctors to have their work affected in order to obtain a degree. Ai Zhisheng, then deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, once described him as &quot;ignoring what is going on outside the window and focusing on getting a doctorate degree.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the establishment of China’s degree system ushered in another opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 12, 1961, Nie Rongzhen, then Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, proposed to the central government “suggestions on establishing a system for degrees, academic titles, engineering and technical titles, etc.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He elaborated on four reasons in his suggestions, including urging intellectuals to march towards the peak of science and culture, encouraging and promoting the rapid growth of a large number of young intellectuals, and accelerating the formation of China&#39;s strong scientific and cultural team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also believes that the implementation of the degree system is also an effective way to directly promote the development of science and technology, &quot;Because in order to give degrees, it is necessary to make academic evaluations of the research work of relevant scientific and technical personnel. Through this Academic evaluation can promote academic prosperity and improve the level of science and technology in our country.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eleven days later, in his speech on &quot;Promoting a Large Number of Young Technical Cadres&quot;, Deng Xiaoping proposed, &quot;It seems that we can&#39;t do it without a degree. You can make a plan first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Benxia, ​​former director of the Office of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, once wrote an article recalling that at the end of 1963, the Ministry of Education received a call from the responsible comrade of the Science and Technology Cadres Bureau of the State Council. Deng Xiaoping had reviewed and approved the &quot;Degree Regulations (Draft)&quot; and reported Other leading comrades of the Central Committee circulated it and &quot;everyone felt very excited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The excitement did not last long. Due to various reasons, the draft failed to enter the national legislative process and was once again shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to determine the award criteria? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, postgraduate enrollment resumed. Although the degree system has not yet been established, some schools have begun to train doctoral students with good foundation before admission and outstanding achievements after admission according to the requirements of doctoral students. Zheng Gang told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The practice of doctoral training is earlier than the system, which reflects society&#39;s eager need for doctors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of students are taking the lead in pursuing doctoral degrees? Among the first batch of 18 doctoral degree recipients, 7 are from the University of Science and Technology of China. The article &quot;Some Experiences of the First Batch of Doctoral Training in Our School&quot; published by the Graduate School of the school in &quot;Degrees and Graduate Education&quot; provides more details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the seven graduate students at the University of Science and Technology of China as an example. Their average age is 34 years old, they have family burdens, some have not completed formal university courses, and their studies were useless after graduation, but their basic qualities are very good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The University of Science and Technology of China realized that the seven graduate students were not admitted according to degree standards. &quot;Are they supporting and encouraging them to become doctoral students, or are they all indiscriminately restricted to the master&#39;s degree? This is a test of our Can we adhere to the principle of starting from reality?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While exploring doctoral training, the establishment of a degree system has once again been put on the agenda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 24, 1979, Hu Qiaomu reported to Deng Xiaoping on the issue of establishing a degree system, &quot;It would be a great good thing if the decision can be announced soon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Benxia participated in the drafting work. He wrote that the drafting team collected archival materials from the previous two Degree Regulations (Draft) and investigated the development of foreign degree systems since the mid-1960s. A symposium was held to conduct on-site research on the current situation of higher education, and it took nearly 7 months to complete the first draft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 1980, the State Council submitted the &quot;Degree Regulations (Draft)&quot; to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress for review. Wu Benxia attended the meeting as a non-voting delegate. &quot;Everyone unanimously raised their hands and applauded warmly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Degree Regulations&quot; are scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 1981. This is the first law in the field of education in New China, clarifying that degrees are divided into three levels: bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree, and doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the State Council approved the first batch of 151 doctoral degree-granting units, 812 disciplines and majors, and 1,155 instructors. Among the disciplines and majors, there are 265 engineering, 233 science, and 153 medicine. Shen Wenqin, deputy director of the China Doctoral Education Research Center at Peking University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the first batch of disciplines and majors are concentrated in basic fields and are urgently needed by the country. &quot;The selection of doctoral supervisors is also very strict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming the first batch of doctoral degree-granting units, the University of Science and Technology of China wants to take another step forward and award doctoral degrees to graduate students recruited in 1978 who have reached the academic level of a doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 5, 1982, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council responded to the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, agreeing to provide doctoral degree course education and thesis defense for individual graduate students with higher academic levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, 8 units including the University of Science and Technology of China, Fudan University, and East China Normal University were approved for pilot testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the real problem for these schools is how to judge the criteria for awarding a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to make the opinions more representative, the University of Science and Technology of China hires up to 9 experts at a time when reviewing graduation thesis. When reviewing Li Shangzhi&#39;s paper, the opinions of experts were not unanimous. Three people believed that it had reached a doctoral level, and another one believed that it had reached a &quot;master&#39;s degree or above.&quot; Li Shangzhi then wrote two more papers, which finally passed the review smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/jJQqzvhOzZtwDScsCXl9N0nfnrzijZCdTBzvPhhZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;643&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/jJQqzvhOzZtwDScsCXl9N0nfnrzijZCdTBzvPhhZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Among the first batch of 18 Ph.D.s in New China, 7 are from the University of Science and Technology of China. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Who will train doctors? &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Who trained the first batch of PhDs? Since the establishment of the degree system in 1981, a method has been formulated and implemented for the unified review of doctoral supervisors (hereinafter referred to as &quot;doctoral supervisors&quot;) by a national organization. After five batches of reviews, 8,043 doctoral supervisors were approved nationwide, and by the end of 1993, a total of more than 14,000 doctoral supervisors had been trained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a doctoral supervisor qualification review process was once helpful in ensuring the quality of doctoral training, but it has gradually exposed problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhanjun, former deputy director of the Degree and Graduate Education Development Center of the Ministry of Education, once analyzed that with the increase in doctoral authorization units and doctoral authorization points, the scale of doctoral student enrollment has gradually expanded, and the doctoral supervisor review cycle is long, the procedures are cumbersome, and the positions are Shortcomings such as alienation are increasingly mismatched with the development situation of higher education, and &quot;the enthusiasm of higher education institutions cannot be fully mobilized.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corresponding change is that in the 1990s, several batches of Ph.D.s mainly stayed in universities after graduation. Shen Wenqin told Southern Weekend reporters that they were already equipped to take over the academic field. Developing the capabilities of the next generation of Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Underlying the discussion on the qualification review of doctoral supervisors is the issue of &quot;unity over control&quot; of universities, which is directly related to the autonomy of universities in running schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1993, the &quot;Opinions on Further Reforming the Examination Methods for Degree Authorization&quot; reviewed and approved by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council stated that doctoral supervisors should be determined by the degree-granting units themselves in accordance with the basic standards and conditions established by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, the power to approve doctoral supervisors will be delegated to all doctoral granting units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To solve the problem of who should train doctors, we must also solve the problem of positioning of doctorate training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A typical case is that because the medical doctors trained in China focus on experiments and scientific research training, there is a phenomenon that graduated clinical medical doctors are not qualified for clinical medical work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Gang said that society has diverse needs for talents. In addition to people who specialize in academic research, there is also a need for people to solve practical problems raised by society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, doctoral education ushered in another important change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of this year, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council reviewed and approved the &quot;Several Opinions on Adjusting the Type of Medical Schools and Establishing Medical Professional Degrees&quot;, establishing a professional doctorate in clinical medicine for the first time, requiring a focus on engaging in a specific occupation. Practical work ability, with the goal of cultivating applied talents for senior clinicians, stomatologists, health and epidemic prevention, and new drug research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above opinions point out that this &quot;is conducive to the targeted training of various specialized talents with different natures and different professional backgrounds, and is conducive to the society&#39;s selection and use of various types of specialized talents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Fengliang, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Tsinghua University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the landmark significance of this move is that &quot;doctoral education is developing in a diversified direction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, China has established six professional doctorate types: engineering, stomatology, education, veterinary medicine, clinical medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, as of 2019, China has awarded a total of 48,000 doctoral professional degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There is a long way to go”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a doctor at the highest level of academic education, he must be able to deal with the practical problems that the country needs to solve most. “If a doctor can’t solve it, Who else can solve it?&quot; In Zheng Gang&#39;s view, the baton has been passed to the new generation of doctors. &quot;The burdens on them are no lighter than those of their predecessors, or even heavier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the number of doctors continues to increase, Against the background of growth, in 2007, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, the Ministry of Education, and the former Ministry of Personnel jointly launched a systematic investigation of doctoral training. As of that year, a total of 240,000 people in China had been awarded doctorates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After going deep into 289 doctoral training units across the country, 69,133 questionnaires were collected, and after interviewing more than 400 people, the investigation team recommended that the development scale of academic doctoral education be controlled and that academic doctoral education should shift from focusing on scale to Shifts that focus on quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this survey, new policies that focused on quality had already appeared in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1999, the then Minister of Education Chen Zhili proposed that not only outstanding doctoral theses should be selected, but also other theses should be randomly checked to ensure that the overall quality of Chinese doctoral degrees continues to improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2000, the Department of Degree Management and Graduate Education of the Ministry of Education has been responsible for conducting random inspections of doctoral theses. The evaluation content includes the innovativeness of the paper, the theoretical basis and expertise embodied in the paper, and scientific research capabilities. Since then, the number of random inspections has been increased. In order to achieve &quot;zero interference&quot; with the inspected units, degree-granting units are no longer required to submit thesis materials, but will be retrieved directly from the National Library after extraction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it is stipulated that degree authorization sites with a high proportion of &quot;problematic theses&quot; or a large number of papers will be ordered to make rectifications within a time limit. If the requirements are still not met after rectification, the degree authorization will be revoked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council issued the &quot;Some Opinions on Carrying out Periodic Evaluation of Doctoral and Master&#39;s Degree Authorization Points&quot; and decided that starting from that year, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council would conduct regular evaluations of doctoral and master&#39;s degree authorization points every six years. Regular evaluation, the main content of the evaluation includes &quot;talent training situation, especially the quality of talent training.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Improving the quality of doctoral training is also reflected in the selection of students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, examinations were an important way to select doctors. Shen Wenqin told a reporter from Southern Weekend that candidates with scientific research talents or abilities are not necessarily good at taking exams. If standardized tests are used to screen talents at the doctoral level, &quot;the effect is not so ideal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Notice on Recruiting Doctoral Graduate Students in 2017&quot;, proposing to promote and improve the &quot;application-assessment&quot; enrollment and selection mechanism, and strengthen the professional quality and academic level. , comprehensive evaluation of scientific research capabilities, innovation potential and overall quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;application-assessment&quot; system means that candidates no longer take the entrance examination uniformly organized by the school, but review materials such as academic transcripts, proposed scientific research ideas, and original research results. Afterwards, each department will assess the application through written examinations, experiments, interviews, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, many universities such as Nankai University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications implemented this system. Starting from the 2023 academic year, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences will fully implement the “application-assessment” system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the 40 years of doctoral education in China, from scratch to excellence, &quot;doctoral education has a long way to go&quot; and there are different problems and challenges at each stage. Zheng Gang said that these 40 years of exploration It proves that only &quot;reform can solve problems in the development process.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;Reference books:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&quot;History of Graduate Education and Degree System of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&quot;40 Years of Implementation of China&#39;s Degree System&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[轻松筹回应“女童被咬”善款：未使用的所有善款全额原路退回]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259300]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 19:24:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 25, @easilychouweibo issued refund instructions stating that on October 23, the injured girl After being transferred out of the ICU, the situation is relatively stable.

Among them, 6 are from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 6 are from the University of Science and Technology of China, 4 are from Fudan University, and two are from East China Normal University and Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“One of the obvious characteristics of the first batch of graduate students who obtained doctorate degrees is that they are older, generally around forty years old.” In his speech at the scene, Ma Zhongqi mentioned age. At that time, Ma Zhongqi was 43 years old. It took him 16 years from his first graduate school to graduating with a doctorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1956, 16-year-old Ma Zhongqi entered the physics department of Lanzhou University and stayed at the school to teach after graduation. In 1964, the state mobilized on-the-job cadres to take postgraduate examinations. Ma Zhongqi was admitted to the Department of Physics of Peking University and studied under Hu Ning, a theoretical physicist and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. His studies were interrupted a year later during the political movement. In 1967, Ma Zhongqi returned to Lanzhou University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until 10 years later, in 1977, that the State Council approved the Ministry of Education&#39;s &quot;Opinions on the Recruitment of Postgraduate Students in Colleges and Universities&quot; and postgraduate education was resumed. In 1978, 38-year-old Ma Zhongqi was admitted to Hu Ning&#39;s graduate school again and entered the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Institute of High Energy&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have been holding back for ten years and cannot do scientific research. I am very anxious.” Ma Zhongqi said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. Due to his previous academic accumulation, this time he became the &quot;big brother&quot; of his classmates in the Institute of High Energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 1980, at the 13th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People&#39;s Congress, the &quot;Degree Regulations of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; was reviewed and approved, and three-level degrees including bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees were established. The regulations have been implemented since 1981. The Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Science and Technology of China, Fudan University, Shandong University, and East China Normal University became the first batch of pilot units and began to train doctoral students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Zhongqi recalled that in August of this year, the organization talked with him and decided to select a group of graduate students with good foundations to become doctoral students directly. He was selected as a &quot;pilot&quot; and asked to &quot;write a high-level doctoral thesis as soon as possible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In four months, Ma Zhongqi completed writing his graduation thesis. On February 6, 1982, Ma Zhongqi defended his thesis in a classroom of the Institute of High Energy. The defense committee has a luxurious lineup, consisting of 7 top experts in the field of physics: the chairman is Peng Huanwu, the father of the &quot;two bombs and one satellite&quot;, and there are also 4 members of the academic department: Hu Ning, Zhu Hongyuan, Dai Yuanben, and Gu Chaohao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduation, Ma Zhongqi stayed at the Institute of High Energy and was engaged in theoretical physics research, focusing on group theory methods and their physical applications, until his retirement in 2005. In 1991, he was awarded the title of &quot;Chinese Doctorate Recipient with Outstanding Contributions&quot;. He has enjoyed special government subsidies since October 1992, and has won the second prize of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Scientific and Technological Progress Award three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physicist and Nobel Prize winner Yang Zhenning commented that Ma Zhongqi&#39;s research results are &quot;work that can be retained.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s great to leave a hilltop like Mr. Yang did.&quot; Ma Zhongqi said that his work is like &quot;little bricks.&quot; &quot;When the flood comes, the sediment is washed away, but the &#39;little bricks&#39; can stay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Assigned&quot; to study physics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you were an undergraduate student at Lanzhou University, your chosen major was physics. How did you become interested in physics? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1956, the central government issued a policy on developing the northwest and authorized Lanzhou University to go to Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin before the college entrance examination. Each high school selects students. I went to high school in Shanghai Shidong Middle School. Before the college entrance examination, the principal talked to me and asked me to apply for the Physics Department of Lanzhou University. At that time, the party&#39;s needs were my wishes. If I was asked to go to Lanzhou, I went without any objection. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The major was also decided, and I was asked to choose physics. When I was in high school, I heard from my relatives who were in college that the physics department was the best and I could learn a lot. At that time, I wanted to study physics myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A total of 60 students went to Shanghai in that session. We took the train to Xi&#39;an, and then chartered a &quot;stuffy truck&quot;. We got on the train in the morning and arrived in Lanzhou the next evening. As soon as I got off the car, I was hit by a gust of wind carrying loess. At that time, tap water was not yet widely available in Lanzhou, and there were still water trucks on the road, clanging and clanking to deliver water. At school, we lived in a bungalow with no glass, just paper windows. At that time, living conditions were very difficult, but the enthusiasm was very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How is it going in school? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1956, I studied hard in school for a year. It is a pity that since 1957, with the &quot;Ming Fang&quot; movement, anti-rightist movement, and then the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;, people basically stopped studying. I also saw wood, made steel, and carried loads at the waterworks. I didn&#39;t have enough to eat at that time, and I was reluctant to leave the canteen every day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the school would show movies every night, telling everyone not to study and to rest. But everyone finally got the opportunity to go to school, and they all studied hard. Many people fell ill due to swelling from studying, and even after being admitted to the hospital, they continued to study. It was really hard to study at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What did you do after graduating from Lanzhou University in 1961? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduation, the school assigned me to stay at Lanzhou University as a teaching assistant, and the teaching task was very heavy. I taught 3 courses: mathematical methods, theoretical mechanics and electrodynamics, each of which required very high mathematics. There are a total of 240 students. I will correct every assignment. A pile of exercises is handed in every two weeks. When the assignments are handed in, I basically don’t leave the office for two whole days. I also have Q&amp;A classes 4 times a week, once every two hours, and I can’t stop talking. Before I even went to the classroom, students began to line up and surrounded me from all directions to ask questions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for doing laundry on Saturday night, there is no extra time left, not even time for watching movies. We were already &quot;996&quot; at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, I didn’t study well in my own classes, so I just got through in college. The three years I spent as a teaching assistant gave me time to learn the basics of physics in a down-to-earth manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1964, the state mobilized serving cadres to take the postgraduate entrance examination, and you went Graduate student at Peking University. Can you tell us about your experience preparing for graduate school? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The condition for in-service cadres to take the postgraduate examination was that they must return to their original units after graduation. When I took the postgraduate examination in 1964, my employer decided to let me take the exam. Each teaching and research section of the school sent a teacher to take the exam, and the theoretical physics department chose me. I decided which school I should go to, and I chose the Department of Physics of Peking University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our theoretical physics exams are quantum field theory, electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics. You choose two of the three professional courses, as well as politics, Chinese, and English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the three years of teaching, I happened to have learned the physics department courses by heart. Basic knowledge can withstand the test, and when it is familiar enough, students will not be afraid to ask any questions. Therefore, sometimes good things turn into bad things, and bad things turn into good things. It’s hard to explain. When I took on the teaching task at that time, I had no idea that I would still have the opportunity to take the postgraduate entrance examination in 1964. When the opportunity came, I immediately went to graduate school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Learn to &quot;do scientific research&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;How is life as a graduate student at Peking University? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My tutor is Hu Ning, who is very good at teaching students. His training method is that he specifies the research direction, and the students find and read the literature themselves. Group meetings are held twice a week, and all students come. Anyone who has read the literature and is willing to report can report it - what new ideas does this literature have, what makes sense, what is wrong, and where should we start? Go ahead and develop your own ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the report, Mr. Hu will discuss it on the spot. If he thinks what you said is reasonable, he will organize a few people to study the issue in depth. Mr. Hu is very democratic, he will listen to our different opinions, and his discussion method is very free. I have been a graduate student for one year and have already published two papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What influence did Mr. Hu have on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have never done scientific research before, and I learned what it means to do scientific research from Mr. Hu. To engage in scientific research, you just have to have an idea, come up with something, and it is valuable. From then on, I also learned to do scientific research myself. At that time, our students were very conscious and fully unleashed their originality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned that you studied for one year As a graduate student, what was the situation like at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After studying at Peking University for one year, he was sent to the countryside to carry out the &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot;. In 1967, when the fighting began at Peking University, I returned to Lanzhou University. At that time, the school&#39;s theoretical physics laboratory had been disbanded, the library was closed, and there was nothing left. The students are still there, but they are no longer studying. I give lectures to students at the Workers&#39;, Peasants and Soldiers&#39; College, starting from the most basic middle school mathematics of making negatives plus plus, one course a week, all the way to calculus. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Cultural Revolution, I was not involved in politics and never participated in it. I didn’t even write a single big-character poster. I study when I have time, and work the rest of the time. I am tall and in good health, and I am among the first to work. I&#39;m kidding. I am neither a driving force for revolution nor an object of revolution. I am just a commodity for labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Graduate student enrollment resumed in 1978. You were 38 years old at that time. How did you resume your studies? What about those who went back to school? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1977, everything began to return to normal. For the first time in my life, I took a train to Dalian to attend a semiconductor research conference. On the way, I ran to Beijing to visit my mentor Hu Ning. Mr. Hu is very anxious. He is engaged in particle physics, but there are no students left and no one is engaged in it. He asked me if I still wanted to engage in particle physics. I said that the school’s theoretical physics department had been disbanded and I couldn’t do it if I wanted to. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the central government had a red-headed document supporting &quot;returning college students.&quot; College students who enrolled in 1964 and 1965 only went to college for one or two years. The central government paid for them to return to school. Tuition for a year or two. Mr. Hu suddenly had a sudden idea and asked me if I would like to be a &quot;returning graduate student.&quot; Of course I do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1978, graduate students began to enroll students. The enrollment plan stipulates that the upper age limit is 35 years old. I was 38 years old at the time and could not take the exam. Mr. Hu contacted a group of old faculty members and proposed at the National Science Conference held that year that the graduate students admitted in 1964 and 1965 were of good quality but had not completed their studies, and they should be recalled as graduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, about 50 days before the exam, I saw a notice in a newspaper advertisement: graduate students admitted in 1964 and 1965 are not subject to age restrictions. After seeing this, I quickly signed up and chose the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where Mr. Hu also had an enrollment quota. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are only 50 days left, how to prepare for the exam? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ma Zhongqi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The difference between taking the postgraduate entrance examination in 1978 and 1964 was huge. It was very difficult to take the postgraduate entrance examination in 1964, but when I took the postgraduate entrance examination in 1978, my opponents were far behind. I was a serious college student, and I had also gone to graduate school, and I had never given up my business. Of course, 38 years old is a bit older, but I am still in my prime, and my brain is still very responsive, so there will be no problem in taking the exam. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这次读研，正好赶上是改革开放。你觉得当时社会环境的变化对你有什么影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;1978年,启动恢复研究生招生，这是邓小平主持的，就要广集人才嘛。从新中国成立到当时，组织的意见跟个人意见有矛盾的时候，我从来是以组织意见为准。唯一的例外就是1978年考研究生。如果个人要考，单位不放，以个人为准，这是以前从来没有过的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我憋了十年不能搞科研，急得很。有了这个机会，当然要拼命干。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;4个月完成博士论文&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;第二次读研，和第一次有什么不一样？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;感觉完全不一样。都40岁了，还自己不会搞科研，还能干嘛？因为自己基本掌握了科研的方法，就自己选题自己做，每两个礼拜骑车到北大给胡先生汇报一次。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时别人都要上专业课，就我可以不上。我只用上政治课、英文课，还有我自己选的微分几何，胡先生给我课程成绩。他跟我说，“赶紧搞科研，学什么基础课？早就会了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在研究生期间是很特殊的研究生，大家都知道我以前当过研究生，而且我能够搞科研。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980年，广东举办了一场粒子物理理论讨论会，有四五十位在国外当教授的华人参加，李政道、杨振宁都来了，在国内谁能提出学术报告，并且在大会上发言？我那时候有论文，交了论文后获得批准，可以参加。上台发言的基本上都是老师，学生很少的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;什么时候知道你要从研究生直接成为博士？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;1981年，学位条例实施。 8月，组织上跟我谈话，要从研究生里找一批人直接当博士生。学校决定把我作为“试点”，要我抓紧写篇高水平博士论文出来。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1981年，磁单极研究是个热门选题，杨振宁先生就在做这方面的研究。正好我在《复旦大学学报》上看到了谷超豪先生（数学家，中科院学部委员）发表的文章，他提出怎么用数学方法去研究磁单极理论。我一下子感觉到这是个可以选的方向。高能所专门派我去上海出差找谷先生。他审查后觉得我选题的想法、原则都很好。回到北京，我就用群论的方法，花了大概两个半月完成了计算。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;算好后，高能所又派我出差，去上海找谷先生审查我算的结果合不合理，水平够不够，能不能当博士论文。他一点头，我就赶紧回来写论文了。 1981年11月交稿，12月，学校就把这篇论文送给全国各地研究磁单极理论的教授审查，没有收到否定意见后，就通知我准备答辩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;还记得博士答辩的情况吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;1982年2月6日，在高能所的一个教室里举行的博士论文答辩，也是第一场博士论文答辩。我的答辩委员会是最盛大的了。答辩委员会主席是“两弹一星”元勋彭桓武，答辩委员有我的导师胡宁，还有谷超豪、高能所粒子物理的权威朱洪元，理论物理所粒子物理的权威戴元本，他们都是中科院学部委员。另外，还有西北大学教授侯伯宇和中山大学教授李华钟，他们是当时粒子物理和磁单极领域最出色的专家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;基本的工作就是重要的工作&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我注意到你的屋子里放了不少杨振宁的书籍、照片。他对你的学术生涯有什么影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;杨先生给我的影响太大了。 1984年，他邀请我到纽约州立大学石溪分校做访问学者。第一天见面，我给他汇报工作计划，我说还想继续在磁单极方面做研究，另外我提前做了准备，知道杨先生对量子力学很基本的一个定理——Levinson定理在做研究，我说我也想在Levinson定理上做工作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨先生给我说，磁单极跟着别人后面做做可以，但Levinson定理就不一样了，这是基本的工作。他说，基本的工作就是重要的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，他把他的文章和133页的计算稿给我，我花了两个月时间把那个稿子彻彻底底弄懂了。掌握了这个方法，我再去研究Levinson定理，把它的适用条件作了修改，并把定理推广到相对论情况。后来我就变成Levinson定理的权威了，回国后这方面的文章都叫我审。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时我就想，Levinson定理是杨先生给我的题目，我只是重新做了计算，写文章时我就打算跟杨先生合作，杨先生不干，还是让我一个人写。后来我才明白，他是爱护年轻人，如果这篇文章是我们合作发表，那人家肯定认为这是杨先生的文章，跟我就没关系了。他考虑得非常周到，给了年轻人很多机会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;杨振宁曾评价你的研究成果是“能留得下来的工作”，怎么看这个评价？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;“基本的工作就是重要的工作。”这句话是杨先生跟我说的，也是我的座右铭。我这辈子的科研都比较重视抓基本的工作。基本的工作，只要没算错，它就留下来了。像Levinson定理，我算得对就站住了，这个东西是我的，清清楚楚，上了教科书，这叫留得住的工作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果是赶时髦的工作，整个方向就错了，过段时间就没有了。就像磁单极，最后证明磁单极没有发现，所有磁单极的工作就报废了，这就叫作留不住的工作。现在文章99%都是留不住的工作，留下来的工作是很少的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为杨先生的教导，我就比较重视找基本的工作。有这样的工作我就非常兴奋，而且花大力气去做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;近些年还在做什么研究吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;住进养老院后，我出了三本书，有一本《Group Theory For Physicsts（物理学中的群论）》是关于群论的，是我年轻时想解决的问题，但上班时比较忙，没时间做。现在我花时间把它彻底证明、推广了。今年2月份，我收到出版社寄来的账单，有人一下买了100本。这说明把它选成教材了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在1993年出版了一本《Yang-baxter Equation And Quantum Enveloping Algebras(杨-巴克斯特方程与量子包络代数)》，出版社每年给我发账单，每年都有人买。虽然数量不多，但是有。有跟没有是不一样的，说明这东西站住脚了，30年过去，还有人看这本书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你觉得对现在的大学生来说，什么是最重要的？有什么建议吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;马中骐：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我很幸运，我喜欢研究物理。别人开玩笑说，不给我发工资我都想搞，何况还有工资（笑）。我真喜欢物理，而且我只会干这个。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大学生应该多听一听，看一看，搞清楚自己喜欢什么，然后在这上面独立地钻研，不能光是玩游戏或者光是找工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

What is the purpose of issuing additional national bonds in 2023? Where will the additional national debt be used? How to manage trillions of yuan in national debt funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why additional issuance: A necessary move to support post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and improve disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since this year, many places in our country have suffered from heavy rains, floods, Disasters such as typhoons have severely affected some areas and caused heavy losses, and local post-disaster recovery and reconstruction tasks are relatively heavy. At the same time, various types of extreme natural disasters have occurred frequently in recent years, placing higher demands on my country&#39;s disaster prevention, reduction, and relief capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting on August 17 to study and deploy flood prevention and disaster relief and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction work. The meeting proposed &quot;accelerating recovery and reconstruction&quot; and &quot;further improving my country&#39;s disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These key tasks cannot be separated from the guarantee of &quot;real money&quot;. The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that although the budget at the beginning of the year had arranged relevant regular disaster relief and disaster prevention and reduction funds, it was difficult to meet the needs of improving disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Liu Yi, director of the Department of Finance at Peking University School of Economics, by combining factors such as resolving local government debt risks and ensuring &quot;three guarantees&quot; expenditures, local governments have more room to significantly increase funding arrangements in related fields through their own financial resources. Small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The issuance of additional treasury bonds in 2023 is a major decision-making arrangement made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and an important measure to implement the people-centered development idea.” The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that with strong funds Ensure the implementation of relevant work, focus on supporting post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and make up for shortcomings in disaster prevention, reduction, and relief, and overall improve our country&#39;s ability to withstand natural disasters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“From an international perspective, many countries will also make some budget adjustments in the middle of the year based on the actual situation of economic and social development.” Shi Yinghua, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences, said that based on the disaster situation in our country this year, the central government The government&#39;s issuance of additional national debt and budget adjustments are pragmatic moves that reflect the guidance of the government&#39;s efforts to ensure key expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to use: All funds from the additional treasury bonds issued in the fourth quarter will be allocated to local governments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is understood that combined with the needs of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and disaster prevention, reduction and relief work , and to coordinate fiscal affordability, the central government will issue an additional 1,000 billion yuan in 2023 national debt in the fourth quarter, and arrange all of it to local governments through transfer payments. Among them, 500 billion yuan is planned to be used this year and 500 billion yuan will be carried forward for use next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The central government issued additional treasury bonds, but all the specific funds were used locally. This helped ease the pressure on local fiscal revenue and expenditure, further optimized the fiscal expenditure structure, and further optimized the debt structure.” Shi Yinghua explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of use of funds, according to the Ministry of Finance, the funds will be used in eight major areas: post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, key flood control projects, natural disaster emergency response capacity improvement projects, other key flood control projects, irrigation area construction and renovation, and key water and soil projects. Loss control projects, urban drainage and flood prevention capacity improvement actions, key natural disaster comprehensive prevention and control system construction projects, and high-standard farmland construction in Northeast China and disaster-stricken areas in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This fund use arrangement spans this year and next, reflecting the continuity of the policy. The direction of fund use takes into account both the present and the long term. While supporting post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and ensuring people&#39;s livelihood, it also focuses on making up for shortcomings. , strengths and weaknesses, and strengthen long-term capacity building to resist natural disasters, which is conducive to promoting high-quality development.&quot; Shi Yinghua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The additional treasury bonds will be issued in the fourth quarter of this year. &quot;We will start the issuance of treasury bonds in a timely manner. At present, the Ministry of Finance has made adjustments to the treasury bond issuance plan for the fourth quarter to leave room for additional issuance of treasury bonds.&quot; The official said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next step, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance will work with relevant departments to strengthen project review and control and allocate funds to specific projects as soon as possible. The Ministry of Finance will also issue budgets for national debt projects in a timely manner to accelerate the formation of physical workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the national debt funds are put into use, it will also help drive domestic demand and further consolidate the economic recovery.” Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to manage: The central budget will be adjusted accordingly and funds from the additional issuance of government bonds will be included in the direct mechanism&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the issuance of additional government bonds, the central budget in 2023 will also be adjusted accordingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that central government expenditures at the same level will remain unchanged in 2023, and transfer payments from the central government to local governments will increase by 500 billion yuan compared with the budget at the beginning of the year; local general public budget expenditures will increase by 500 billion yuan accordingly, and the expenditure growth rate will increase from 5.2%. to 7.4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the fiscal deficit has also increased accordingly. In 2023, the national fiscal deficit will increase from 3.88 trillion yuan to 4.88 trillion yuan, the central fiscal deficit will increase from 3.16 trillion yuan to 4.16 trillion yuan, and the fiscal deficit rate is expected to increase from 3% to about 3.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, China’s government debt ratio has been lower than that of other major world economies. In Liu Yi&#39;s view, the Chinese government currently has room for additional issuance of treasury bonds, and the overall risk after this additional issuance is controllable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to manage and use trillions of yuan in national debt funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that in the next step, the direct mechanism will be fully utilized, all government bond expenditure funds will be included in the scope of direct fiscal funds, and the whole process tracking and monitoring will be implemented to ensure that the funds are used according to the prescribed purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We will also organize the local supervision bureaus of the Ministry of Finance to establish a normalized supervision mechanism, keep a close eye on the use of government bond funds, strictly investigate illegal activities such as misappropriation of government bond funds, and effectively prevent government debt risks.&quot; This said the person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北京市委常委、副市长靳伟因北京长峰医院重大火灾事故被问责]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259288]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 17:49:40&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;A few days ago, with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission issued a Member and Vice Mayor Jin Wei initiated a case review and investigation into the issue of dereliction of duty and dereliction of duty during the &quot;4·18&quot; major fire accident at Changfeng Hospital in Fengtai, Beijing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After investigation, Comrade Jin Wei, as a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and deputy mayor in charge of health work, has gaps in the implementation of the Party Central Committee’s instructions and requirements on production safety, which has a negative impact on Beijing.

Because there is his wife and 4 children there—— The oldest is 13 years old and the youngest is only 1 year old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 23, 2023, Sharif, a Palestinian young man working in Guangzhou, sent his brother to the airport. His brother will fly directly from Guangzhou to Egypt and look for an opportunity to return to his hometown of Gaza when the port opens. There, the Israeli army, which has superior military strength, is launching a fierce attack. In live video footage, bombs fell from the sky and many houses were reduced to fragments and rubble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharif told Southern Weekend reporters that it was his brother&#39;s own decision to go back and &quot;he had no choice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalates, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip. As of October 24, this round of conflict between Palestine and Israel has killed more than 7,200 people on both sides. According to UNICEF news on the 24th, 2,360 children were killed in the Gaza Strip and another 5,364 children were injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the conflict broke out, the Israeli military has required residents of northern Gaza to move to the south within a time limit, otherwise they will be regarded as &quot;accomplices of terrorists.&quot; However, many Palestinians, including Sharif&#39;s family, remain in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to disclosures from multiple international rescue organizations, a total of 57 rescue trucks entered Gaza from October 21st to 23rd. But for the more than 2 million Gazans, this is undoubtedly a drop in the bucket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are blockades everywhere, how do we leave? Even if someone evacuates, they will be killed by air strikes on the road. More importantly, we don&#39;t want to leave our own land.&quot; Sharifou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In Sharif&#39;s hometown of Beit Hanoun, residents&#39; houses were reduced to ruins after the bombing.

He then contacted his family many times, but the other party&#39;s mobile phone always reminded him that he was &quot;not in the service area.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It wasn’t until 6 hours later that Sharifu contacted them again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to get in touch better, Sharifou bought an ESIM card for his parents. &quot;Just like an international roaming card, you can also use Israeli or Egyptian network services in Gaza.&quot; Sharifou added that such a card would not receive a signal all the time. When using it, people must stand at a high place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharif comes from a merchant family in Gaza. For many years, he and his family traveled to Yiwu, Guangzhou and Gaza to trade in general merchandise such as candy, motorcycle parts, and home appliances. He and his brother have lived and worked in Guangzhou for many years, and his brother&#39;s two children also studied in Baiyun District. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after arriving in China, Salifu told his parents that they must come to China one day. &quot;My father was originally going to attend the Canton Fair this year. However, the war changed everything.&quot; Sharifou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week after the war broke out, Sharifo lost many relatives - &quot;My uncles and aunts passed away, their sons and grandchildren are gone, and the whole family disappeared together.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A week after the conflict began, Sharif lost his family, and his uncle&#39;s family was killed.

This is the only way to save them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Also in Gaza, 26-year-old Ismail is worried about his family&#39;s food rations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Late at night on October 23, Ismail sent a message for help to Annie, a Chinese friend who cared about him. He wanted to borrow $1,000 from Anne and promised to &quot;pay it back to you after the war is over.&quot; He and his family are currently in a settlement in a school in Gaza, but aid agencies have provided limited help. Food on the market is scarce and expensive, and must be traded in U.S. dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Annie told Southern Weekend reporters that Ismail studied abroad in a university in Zhejiang and understands Chinese. The two met by chance at a party. Not long before the conflict, Ismail had consulted her on how to handle the procedures for his brother, who had graduated from high school, to study in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Annie said that Ismail uses two mobile phone numbers on a daily basis, belonging to operators in Gaza and Israel. After the conflict broke out, communication facilities in Gaza were extensively damaged. Ismail barely got in touch with Anne through an Israeli mobile phone number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I was contacted, his family was preparing to go to an evacuation site near their home. Because his family did not have a car, it was not practical for the whole family to evacuate on foot,&quot; said Anne. When asked how he was doing, Ismail replied in Chinese, &quot;Not dead yet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the day on October 24, Anne, who had raised the US dollars, contacted Ismail again, but received no reply. On the morning of October 25, I finally received news that Ismail was safe. According to his description, the fighting there was &quot;very, very severe&quot; and &quot;the sound of bombings and explosions did not stop.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have seen three wars in Gaza before, and this is the hardest.&quot; He wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rescue is hampered at every turn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“In Gaza, we never imagined such a scenario: 2 million civilians would live under heavy bombing and face interruptions in water, food, electricity and medicine. . We should take all measures immediately to avoid this situation from happening.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, local time, Fabrizio Carboni, Regional Director of the Near and Middle East of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on social media Platform to speak out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After two weeks of Israel&#39;s sweeping siege, limited aid has finally arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public disclosures, three batches of humanitarian relief supplies entered the Gaza Strip from October 21st to 23rd local time, with a total of 57 trucks shipped. These include medical supplies, disinfectant chlorine tablets for water treatment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, these supplies are really a drop in the bucket for the more than 2 million people in the Gaza Strip. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a speech in Luxembourg on October 23 that under normal circumstances, if there is no war, 100 trucks enter Gaza every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Obviously, 20 (trucks) are not enough.&quot; Borrell called for more humanitarian support to be provided. In particular, fuel support will be provided so that power stations and desalination stations can be operated to &quot;restore water and electricity supplies&quot; as quickly as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tamara Alifa&#39;i, spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), also said that Gaza&#39;s need for fuel is &quot;as urgent as its need for water and food.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite repeated warnings from international relief agencies, the Israeli side still puts the fuel on the embargo list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mark Regev, a senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister, publicly stated in an interview on October 23 that Israel would not allow fuel to enter the Gaza Strip even if all hostages were released. Regev explained the reason for the embargo, &quot;These fuels may be stolen by Hamas and used to power rockets.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the conflicts between the parties difficult to reconcile, the operation of hospitals in Gaza is in trouble. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The level of death, destruction and displacement is shocking.” On October 24, Christoph Hanger, public relations officer of the International Committee of the Red Cross, gave a written interview to a reporter from Southern Weekend The agency’s team in Gaza visited hospitals in the northern region on the ground, it said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People sleep in hospital stairwells. Thousands of people, with nowhere to go, seek shelter in hospitals. Building walls shake from nearby explosions. If the situation does not improve, there is no clean drinking water and crowded shelters, the potential for disease outbreaks increases dramatically,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shortages of electricity and fuel have put hospitals in Gaza in dire straits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Without electricity, the hospital will become a morgue.” Christopher said that after the power outage in Gaza, the hospital also stopped supplying power. Newborns in incubators and elderly patients who require oxygen are at risk. Kidney dialysis was interrupted and X-rays could not be taken. He pointed out that most hospitals in Gaza are no longer functioning and they need electricity to maintain their services. The hospital&#39;s situation has become even more difficult as insufficient fuel supplies have affected power generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A report from surgeons at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza showed that they worked 24 hours a day to care for the wounded; when they tried to triage patients, they found that they could not cope with the large number of casualties, and &quot;the entire system was saturated.&quot; All operating theaters are occupied”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doctors report that there is no precedent for such large-scale casualties in previous escalations of conflict.&quot; Christopher said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 17, a hospital in northern Gaza was bombed, causing some casualties. Gaza&#39;s health authorities and the Israeli Defense Ministry called each other the attackers. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres later strongly condemned the deadly attacks on Gaza hospitals and said hospitals and medical personnel should be protected by international humanitarian law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society&#39;s disclosure on October 22, the area near the Holy City Hospital was heavily shelled that day. In the video released by it, at the moment of the attack, staff wearing Red Crescent uniforms rushed to find refuge on walls, pillars, ambulances and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;35 employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East have been killed since the conflict broke out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are speechless.” UNRWA posted on social platforms on October 23, “We pay tribute to the 35 colleagues who were killed in Gaza since October 7. They Not just numbers. They are our friends and colleagues. Many are teachers in our schools.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Win or die&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After conflict breaks out, Israel cuts off Water and electricity supply to the Gaza Strip. On October 9, Israel announced a &quot;total blockade&quot; of the Gaza Strip controlled by Hamas and mobilized 300,000 reservists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the war imminent, Israel issued an &quot;expulsion order&quot; to the people of northern Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israel Defense Forces informed the United Nations in the early morning of October 13 that it had notified approximately 1.1 million Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip and required them to evacuate to southern Gaza within 24 hours. On the morning of the 14th, the Israel Defense Forces issued another notice, requiring residents in the northern Gaza Strip to evacuate through the &quot;evacuation corridor&quot; between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an orange paper leaflet printed with the IDF logo, the Israeli army issued a warning to the Gaza people. It read: &quot;Anyone who does not evacuate from the northern valley of Gaza to the south may be considered a member of a terrorist organization.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multiple Palestinians interviewed confirmed this to Southern Weekend reporters information. But they believe that not everyone will have convenient transportation to leave in a very short period of time. At the same time, the evacuation route is not safe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the video sent by Sharif, people evacuating in large tractor-trailer trucks were attacked on the way. On the open-air compartment that was originally filled with women, children, and children, only stumps and blood were left. In another video, in front of the evacuation road with cars, motorcycles, and donkey carts, yellow flames from bombs suddenly rose, and the vehicles turned around one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, both the south and north of Gaza were bombed.&quot; Sharifou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guterres said before the Security Council’s closed-door consultation on the Palestinian-Israeli situation held on the 13th that more than 1 million residents would be moved from a completely besieged and densely populated war zone to an area without food, drinking water and Housing areas, which are &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; and in some cases &quot;impossible&quot;. He called for the cancellation of the deportation order and hoped that all parties would avoid further escalation and spread of the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharifou told Southern Weekend reporters that his family will not leave Gaza even if the border is reopened. &quot;If we leave, we will lose our home forever. Like 1948 and 1967, we will not repeat the same mistakes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the people evacuated, the livestock that could not be taken away Stay in the ruins.

They achieve their goals step by step, “first by closing the border and sending us from the north to the south, and then Tell us to leave Gaza and go to Egypt.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharif&#39;s worries are not groundless. After the Palestinian-Israeli conflict escalated, when US President Biden visited Israel, the United States and Israel jointly proposed a proposal to transfer Gazans to Egypt, but Egypt clearly opposed this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They (Israel) thought that by blowing up all the bakeries, hospitals and houses, people would leave Gaza and run away. But they are wrong, people here will never leave, win or die .&quot; Sharifu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rasha.G lives in the Palestinian area of ​​the West Bank and runs a chocolate business with her husband and children. Affected by the war in Gaza, the atmosphere here has also become tense. &quot;Business is very deserted and people have nothing to celebrate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As she said, to a certain extent, the West Bank is safer than Gaza because there are &quot;no bombs and no air strikes&quot; for the time being. But Resha felt a deep sense of crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resa told Southern Weekend reporters that in the conflicts between Palestine and Israel, many Palestinians evacuated elsewhere, or moved to neighboring countries, such as Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, or moved to the Jordan River west coast. But most of them live in refugee camps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can’t imagine how difficult life is in the refugee camps. There are many people living in a small space and the environment is very poor.” Resha said that in Palestine, many refugees can only rely on the United Nations Near East for their education. Relief and Works Agency. Refugees can find jobs in Palestine, and a small number can do business, but in other countries, these refugees are &quot;not even treated as citizens.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resa is well-educated, fluent in English, and has lived in Europe for two years. But she returned to Palestine. &quot;I never thought about evacuating. I would not leave my home and become a refugee. I would rather die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;DIVISION&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is imminent, but All parties still have differences on whether to cease fire and carry out rescue operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Slovenia and Luxembourg have publicly supported the humanitarian ceasefire. Irish Foreign Minister Michael Martin said that &quot;Gaza urgently needs access to water, food and medical supplies.&quot; &quot;The human suffering is enormous. We must distinguish between Gazan civilians and Hamas civilians.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the leaders of the European Union, Germany did not respond to calls for a ceasefire. German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that providing aid to Gaza was important, but large-scale rocket attacks against Israel were taking place. &quot;We cannot end the humanitarian catastrophe while terrorism in Gaza persists.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told the media on October 23 that the ceasefire will &quot;give Hamas the ability to rest, reorganize and prepare to continue launching terrorist attacks against Israel.&quot; U.S. President Biden also said on the same day that a ceasefire in Gaza would be possible only after Hamas releases all hostages it has held. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the Israeli government, the purpose of this operation was demonstrated as early as the beginning of the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This should be our last ground offensive in Gaza, for the simple reason that Hamas will cease to exist after this.” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant publicly stated that Israel A ground offensive will be launched in the Gaza Strip that will last for several months, aiming to completely eliminate Hamas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the latest statement from the Israeli army, the Israel Defense Forces air raided more than 400 targets of the Hamas organization in the Gaza Strip on October 23, including its armed personnel assembly areas, command centers and a road leading to the seaside. underground tunnels and killed dozens of Hamas commanders and their armed men. The Israeli army also dispatched tanks, artillery and helicopters to attack Hamas military posts and anti-tank missile launch sites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 23, in response to a reporter’s question, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China is very saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the sharp deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Responding to violence with violence will only lead to a vicious cycle. The top priority is to cease fire and end the war as soon as possible. All parties should earnestly abide by international law and international humanitarian law, protect civilians, and make every effort to avoid serious humanitarian disasters. The international community should provide more humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza to alleviate the humanitarian disaster they have suffered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, China will continue to support all efforts that are conducive to promoting dialogue and restoring peace, and make efforts to implement the &quot;two-state solution&quot; and promote a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Gu Yuebing and Southern Weekend intern Zhai Huan also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[温州实现数据资产“入表”第一单，万亿市场仍藏水面下]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259268]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/dhrnvgaSoWKV9eICfGEagpNKL5CAyvz5SdzrTtK2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/dhrnvgaSoWKV9eICfGEagpNKL5CAyvz5SdzrT tK2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255346&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Data exchanges are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Shi Xuan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The capitalization of data is ushering in new progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, the data product &quot;Credit Data Treasure&quot; of Wenzhou Big Data Operation Co., Ltd. completed the data asset confirmation registration. The Wenzhou Municipal Finance Bureau stated in the announcement that this is the first order to confirm the registration of data assets in Wenzhou, and it is also the first order to list the data assets of a financial guidance enterprise in China that has been publicly reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Incorporating data resources into the balance sheet refers to recognizing data resources as an &quot;asset&quot; in the company&#39;s balance sheet, and reflecting its value in financial statements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Credit Data Treasure is developed based on the Wenzhou Government Blockchain &quot;Data Asset Cloud Voucher&quot; system. After authorization by individuals or enterprises, it provides financial institutions with data services related to credit business, simplifying loan application materials and process to improve credit approval efficiency and bank verification accuracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2020, data was upgraded to the fifth major factor of production alongside land, labor, capital and technology, and a series of policies related to the capitalization of data were closely introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If you had asked me two years ago, I would have told you that most enterprises knew nothing about data capitalization.” Today, data capitalization has become a hot topic, but according to UFIDA Group Data Governance Expert Shi Xiufeng observed that most companies have not yet truly touched upon their essence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the difficulties in capitalizing data? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The trillion-dollar market under the water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“First of all, it must be clear that not all data is data assets.” Deputy Director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission Director Wang Jiandong told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the definition of China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (hereinafter referred to as the Academy of Information and Communications Technology), data assets refer to data legally owned or controlled by organizations (government agencies, enterprises and institutions, etc.), recorded electronically or by other means , such as structured or unstructured data such as texts, videos, databases, and sensor signals, can be measured or traded, and can directly or indirectly bring economic and social benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, only data that can bring value to the organization is a data asset, and its formation requires active management and effective control of data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tang Hanlin, chairman of Guizhou Databao Network Technology Co., Ltd. and general manager of East China Jiangsu Big Data Trading Center, explained to Southern Weekend reporters that data capitalization is to transform data resources into data assets, and its core is to fully release data value of resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the development, use and market operation of public data are still being explored. In December 2022, the &quot;Opinions on Building a Data Basic System to Better Play the Role of Data Elements&quot; (also known as the Twenty Data Articles) was issued and proposed to &quot;promote the paid use of public data used for digital development in accordance with government guidance and pricing, and enterprises and A price formation mechanism that combines independent pricing in the personal information data market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Xiufeng analyzed from the perspective of enterprise development that enterprises have accumulated a large amount of data in the informatization process over the past 20 years. Nowadays, these data can generate greater value, thus pushing enterprises to start data governance, realize the utilization and value maximization of data assets, and ultimately realize the digital transformation of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Informatization refers to the realization of enterprise business process management and data recording through network, computer, database and other information technologies, such as financial computerization, OA collaborative office, etc. Digitalization is the use of digital technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain to achieve innovation in enterprise business and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Xiufeng has more than 16 years of working experience in the data field. His business involves consulting and delivery in the fields of enterprise data governance, data asset management, data applications and other fields. He has led many companies in traditional manufacturing, energy and other industries. Planning and implementation of large-scale data projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Xiufeng believes that currently 80% of companies are still in the process of forming data assets. Wang Jiandong said that in the short term, the data infrastructure system will give rise to a data trading market of 300 billion to 500 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This 100-billion-dollar transaction will leverage the trillion-level market behind it.” Wang Jiandong said that by further considering the derivative markets such as the evaluation, pledge, and financing of data assets, the potential scale of the entire data asset market will be More than 10 trillion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that, like production factors such as land, data elements can also be explored using hierarchical governance. The primary data market is the transfer of ownership rights and open usage rights of data resources, while the secondary data market is the market for data products and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The main part of enterprise data capitalization is still hidden under the water.” Wang Jiandong explained that currently, only a small part of the data owned by social institutions has entered the circulation and transaction process, and most of the other data They are all circulated in the zero-level market in various forms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The zero-level data market refers to the market behavior that does not enter the transaction link, but data sharing, exchange and equity transfer occur, such as within an enterprise and between enterprises with certain business or equity relationships. Another example is that data sharing and exchange occurs every moment within Internet companies, but no external transactions are conducted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiandong said that according to preliminary calculations, the potential scale of data assets and their pledge, financing and other derivative markets in the current zero-level data market is 30 times to 60 times that of the primary and secondary markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Obtain a position first&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“It’s hot at the top and cold at the bottom.” Senior data Industry insider Cheng Guo described the current data capitalization process to Southern Weekend reporters. He has participated in corporate research and the formulation of industry rules for many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cheng Guo’s view, the only newly established deputy ministerial-level national bureau in this round of institutional reform of the State Council is the National Data Bureau. The bureau is affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, alongside the National Grain Administration and the National Energy Administration, which shows that senior officials regard data as a core strategic resource. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 25, 2023, the National Data Administration was officially launched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The introduction of a number of relevant policies has also prompted a new wave of enthusiasm in the preparation and construction of data exchanges. After the fourth quarter of 2020, data exchanges have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, including Shanxi, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Fujian and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;White Paper on Data Elements&quot; released by the Academy of Information and Communications Technology shows that as of August 2023, 53 data trading institutions have been established across the country. From January to August 2023 alone, 5 new data trading institutions have been established in the country. Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, generally speaking, most of the data trading institutions established in the early stage have not found successful business models. Most of them have stopped operations or changed their business direction, and their development has not been as expected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The East China Jiangsu Big Data Trading Center (hereinafter referred to as the East China Data Trading Center) where Tang Hanlin works was established in 2015 and is one of the earliest data trading institutions in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said frankly that in the past, there was no clear requirement that data transactions must be conducted on exchanges. The East China Digital Exchange serves more as an announcement platform - allowing both supply and demand parties to better understand each other, in order to promote Both parties mainly conduct offline transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cheng Guo’s view, the importance of data capitalization has been emphasized at the national level, but local governments are still relatively confused. &quot;Their (local government) idea is that although I can&#39;t understand this new thing yet, I will take a position first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, Shenzhen Data Trading Co., Ltd. was established, and then based on The Shenzhen Data Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the Shenzhen Data Exchange) was established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“深数所前几年的工作重点都不是提高交易额，而是培育市场生态。”2022年9月底，深数所副总经理王冠在一次会议中透露，深圳数据交易市场无论是在交易额还是在交易活跃度上，都已领跑全国。但市场供需不太平衡，供给方相对较少，需求方又很多，同时第三方服务机构和数据商的数量也不丰富。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“高质量的数据产品供给是最关键的。”上海数据交易所（下称上数所）副总经理韦志林向南方周末记者强调。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年11月底，上数所几乎与深数所同时成立。其目标明确，以“构建数据要素市场、推进数据资产化进程”为使命。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韦志林透露，截至目前，上数所挂牌超1600个数据产品，月交易额已超一亿元，预计2023年全年交易额突破10亿元。上数所目前重点提供金融、航运交通和贸易等领域的数据产品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，金融业数据交易市场存在时间较长，交付产品和金融方式更加成熟，是数据密集型行业。近五年来，金融业数据要素采购项目数量复合年增长率达40%，远超金融业采购总项目数量复合年增长率26%，显示出金融业数据交易市场规模发展迅速。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但韦志林也坦陈，当前整个数据要素市场场内交易的规模占比相对较小。 “场内交易的建设至关重要，其在合规、可信、效率和资产化方面的作用不可替代。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/PFsqMbL5vp0h984ZrkC24QdhDi3uzJfkpiLUxnNx.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2022年5月6日，天津滨海新区，一名行人从筹备中的北方大数据交易中心前走过。视觉中国/图&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王建冬表示，数据资产化未来的发力方向之一是鼓励企业尽可能多地进场交易，通过场内交易实现对其数据资产价值的确认，让交易所内形成的价格成为对数据资产估价的“锚”，这样交易所也会活跃起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“相当于企业入场不是只为了挣交易那笔钱，而是通过交易得到资产增值的机会。”王建冬解释，企业数据资产价值得到市场认可，在后续实现资本化操作，企业才有更大积极性参与场内交易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汤寒林相信，对企业数据资产入表的要求，会推动数据交易市场发生很大改善，今后供需双方会更希望通过场内交易对数据资产形成一套公允的价格体系，这样才便于估价并入表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;确权难题&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年8月和9月，财政部和中评协先后就数据资源入表和数据资产的评估发布相关文件，分别为《企业数据资源相关会计处理暂行规定》（下称《暂行规定》）和《数据资产评估指导意见》（下称《指导意见》）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两套文件一出，竞天公诚律师事务所合伙人、数据法律专家袁立志立刻接到了客户的咨询。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“会计师、审计师和评估师都希望我们律师能先出一份法律意见，作为企业数据资产入表或资产评估的基础。”袁立志对南方周末记者说，他们担心的根本原因在于数据资产的权属无法得到确认。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;业内普遍认为，实现数据资产化有三大环节也是三大挑战，分别为法律角度的数据资产确权、市场角度的数据资产估值与交易和会计角度的数据资产入表。其中，数据资产的确权是一切的前提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在数据生产、流通、使用等过程中，个人、企业、社会、国家等相关主体对数据有着不同利益诉求，且呈现复杂共生、相互依存、动态变化等特点，传统权利制度框架难以突破数据产权困境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数据二十条提出，建立数据资源持有权、数据加工使用权、数据产品经营权“三权分置”的数据产权制度框架，淡化所有权、强调使用权。在一定程度上破解了数据资产确权难题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王建冬表示，“三权分置”提供了一条解决问题的基本思路。目前在技术上对数据资产登记确权已无根本性障碍，而具体实施中的难点在于缺乏上位法的支持。如证券法之于证券登记，物权法之于不动产登记。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国民法典》第一百二十七条规定，“法律对数据、网络虚拟财产的保护有规定的，依照其规定”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前与之相关的法律法规，如个人信息保护法、数据安全法和网络安全法等，更多从数据安全和隐私保护的角度入手，均未对数据确权作出明确规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;袁立志介绍，在实际案例中，由于涉及的利益相关方较多，企业在开发及利用数据资产时或会碰到从各种角度提出的利益诉求，如个人信息保护、不正当竞争、商业秘密、知识产权、合同债权等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程果在调研时发现，在此情况下，一些企业对于其数据资产入表也显现出顾虑。入表，意味着企业要接受严格审计，但目前许多企业很难说清其数据真正的权属。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，上述《暂行规定》和《指导意见》只是对现存相关规则的细化规范，“并没有突破现有的财务会计制度”。在袁立志看来，产权制度是市场交易的前提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;袁立志表示，在出正式的法律文件时，律师们对数据资产合法性的判断已相对成熟，对其权属的认定则会比较谨慎。 “尤其在涉及第三方权益时，我们会根据一般的法律原理作出判断，但会保留意见”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关部门在出台规定时显然也意识到了其中难点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程果将《暂行规定》称为对数据资产的“小入表”。原因在于该文件并未针对所有数据资产，而是根据数据资源是否符合《企业会计准则——基本准则》中资产的确认条件，将其分为满足条件可“入表”的数据资源和不满足条件的“不入表”的数据资源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，《暂行规定》是未来适用法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程果表示，一些企业在数据资产化的投入主要在前期，之后每年仅进行规律性的小部分投入，其入表的数据资产仅以新增投入为基础计算，不会对企业的资产规模产生太大影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;另辟蹊径&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;短时间内，确权难题无法解决，市场主体也开始另辟蹊径。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在韦志林看来，数据产权“三权”中数据产品的经营权，解决的便是所谓的确权难、定价难，包括数据的监管问题。在此基础上，上数所提出“数据产品”的概念。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韦志林称，只有将数据按照一定的需求和应用场景组织加工成数据产品，才能形成有需求和供应关联的市场。这样，才能建立起相应的交易规则、标准制度、技术、生态和监管等流通交易体系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他解释，如果流通交易的是原始数据，将会涉及数据的安全和确权等目前难以破解的问题，而“数据产品”概念的提出，很好地解决了数据的权属问题。将企业持有的原始数据加工形成的数据产品，赋予企业确定数据产品的权利，基于数据产品，企业可以享受该数据产品的经营权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前有媒体报道，在建设具体的数据产权制度方面，知识产权制度是唯一正在试点实践中的制度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海对外经贸大学法学院讲师高阳曾公开表示，知识产权作为保护无形资产财产权的制度，适用于数据具有正当性。数据经过人类创造性智力劳动方能获得较高经济价值，符合知识产权保护智力成果的范畴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高阳在上述采访中说，通过对满足条件的数据授予知识产权，为数据交易主体提供明确指引，提高了数据交易的安全性及效率，进而激励企业数据产品创新，以解决市场中数据产品供给不足的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汤寒林同样认可知识产权制度在数据确权中的应用。 2023年4月，江苏省知识产权局出台《江苏省数据知识产权登记管理规则（试行）》，华东数交是江苏省数据知识产权试点单位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据他透露，华东数交已经和江苏省知识产权局直接打通。 “我们的数据交易商在交易所提交数据产品后，可以直接经由江苏省知产局审核，进行在线确权，由此完成一个确权的闭环服务。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《新华日报》报道，2023年10月中旬，江苏省联合征信有限公司（下称联合征信）研发的一款数据产品“企业批量查询”，在交通银行江苏省分行获得质押融资1200万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联合征信是经江苏省政府批准设立的金融科技公司，是获得了央行备案的征信机构。 “企业批量查询”是联合征信在对数据清理加工的基础上，通过四十多个维度指标建构模型，最终形成的企业信息查询类数据产品，主要用于反映企业信用状况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述报道称，作为全国数据知识产权工作地方试点，江苏省于2023年5月颁发第一批数据知识产权登记证书。截至10月11日，江苏省已有125笔数据知识产权登记，已实现数据知识产权质押融资额五千余万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在数据资产的价值评估方面，王建冬一直呼吁，在国家未来的数据资产登记平台中，应该包含数据溯源功能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这意味着企业需说明其数据资产在形成过程中每一个环节上的数据来源。通过这样的方式，可以更加公正地评估该数据资产未来的价值潜力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“随着数据资产入表和实现有效评估，企业在会计报表上有了表达，就有了实体经济活动的支撑。”韦志林认为，数据资产化的进程在入表的基础上，一定会取得更大的突破和创新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他总结，数据资产创新应用主要有六大方向，包括数据资产入表、数据资产增信、数据资产质押融资、数据资产保理、数据资产作价入股以及数据资产证券化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者通过电话约访温州市财政局并发送采访函，对方婉拒了采访。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;事故调查组对起火原因、火灾蔓延原因、人员伤亡原因进行了逐一分析。起火原因方面，北京长峰医院南配楼三层ICU改造工程施工现场，作业人员开展自流平地面施工和净化门门框安装切割动火时，违规交叉作业；自流平地面施工涂刷的环氧树脂底涂材料中易燃易爆成分挥发，加之现场未保持有效通风，形成爆炸性气体混合物，且浓度达到爆炸下限；角磨机切割金属净化板产生的火花，遇爆炸性气体混合物引起爆燃，并引燃西北门外坡道下方堆放的可燃物。火灾蔓延原因方面，爆燃发生后，作业人员未将现场形成的多处火点全部扑灭且未第一时间报警，事发医院工作人员发现火情后也未第一时间报警，未有效组织初期火灾扑救，固定消防设施失效，自动喷水灭火系统和消火栓系统管网无水，未能有效控制火势；坡道和医院通道墙面采用木质装修材料、施工区域与非施工区域未按规定采用不燃材料进行防火分隔，导致明火蔓延至东楼主体建筑内；部分管道竖井未进行防火封堵且未设置防火门，部分楼梯间防火门闭门器损坏无法正常关闭，北通道五层东侧楼梯间常闭式防火门未保持关闭状态，南通道六层西侧楼梯间防火门上方石膏板隔墙被烧穿，导致烟气蔓延扩散。人员伤亡原因方面，未能及时转移疏散、吸入含一氧化碳的烟气是造成大量人员伤亡的主要原因。火灾初期事发医院未启动应急预案，未有效组织疏散转移被困人员；病区设置不合理，事发医院将行动不能自理或行动不便的患者集中安置在七层、八层等高楼层，大部分患者无自主逃生能力；危重病患者移动难度大，楼内通道狭窄、转移条件差，救援转移困难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;记者：涉事医院及相关单位存在哪些违法违规行为？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;答：&lt;/strong>;调查发现，涉事医院、施工单位存在诸多违法违规行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主要有以下方面：一是医院主体责任严重不落实。长峰医院公司违反医疗机构管理规定，未按照要求进行床位数变更登记、医护配比不符合规定，住院部公共走道宽度1.4米，明显小于规范要求的至少2.1米；未履行建筑施工法定义务和施工现场安全管理职责，2017年以来陆续进行的38个装修改造类施工项目均未按规定向相关部门申请办理施工许可或向街道乡镇申请办理开工登记手续，未发现并制止ICU改造工程现场违规动火、交叉作业行为；未按规定履行消防安全主体责任，符合界定标准但未进行消防安全重点单位申报，未对消防设施、器材定期组织维修，火灾自动报警系统、自动喷水灭火系统、室内消火栓系统未保持完好有效。二是施工单位违规动火交叉作业。中源信诚公司施工现场安全管理缺失，作业人员在未办理动火审批手续违规进行明火作业、现场无人监护、未对现场可燃物进行清理的情况下，使用角磨机进行切割作业；未针对易燃易爆物品制定防火安全措施，违规在作业场所调料；环氧树脂自流平地面施工与净化门安装交叉作业；未保持建筑业企业资质许可条件，且未按规定设立安全生产管理机构并配备专职安全生产管理人员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;记者：这起事故中地方党委政府和有关部门存在哪些问题？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;答：&lt;/strong>;事故调查组查明了地方党委政府和有关部门职责落实方面存在的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是地方党委政府防范化解重大风险意识薄弱。北京市丰台区未认真履行安全生产属地管理责任，对街道乡镇基层安全监管能力建设重视不够，2022年全市安全生产和消防工作考核排名倒数第一，未有效组织开展建设工程施工现场消防安全专项检查，事故信息报送不及时、伤亡人员情况报告迟缓。北京市安全发展理念不够牢固，对相关部门未认真落实属地医疗机构、施工现场等重点场所安全生产和消防安全管理职责的问题失察，未有效督促指导丰台区委、区政府严格落实属地安全生产管理责任。二是医疗卫生机构行政审批和安全管理短板明显。丰台区卫生健康委未严格履行医疗机构校验管理职责，对北京长峰医院长期未按规定申请床位数变更登记、人员配备不符合要求等问题监管不力，未履行对北京长峰医院ICU改造工程无施工许可的行业监督管理职责，未检查发现工程存在的消防问题隐患，未通过正式渠道向丰台区委、区政府和区应急办报告事故伤亡人员信息。北京市卫生健康委未认真履行“管行业必须管安全”安全监管职责，对丰台区卫生健康委履行行业安全监管职责不力等问题失察失管；指导落实北京市医疗机构消防安全组团体检式检查、建设工程施工现场消防安全专项检查要求不力，未有效推进隐患整改工作。三是建设工程安全监督管理存在漏洞。丰台区住房城乡建设委未认真履行行业安全监管职责，对不具备取得施工许可的建设工程监管不力；未对移交街道乡镇管理的限额以下建设工程进行有效业务指导和服务配合；对限额以上的北京长峰医院ICU改造工程未取得施工许可证的行为，未依法依规予以查处。北京市住房城乡建设委落实建设工程施工现场消防安全专项检查要求不力；未按要求对建筑业企业资质进行动态监管，对施工单位未保持建筑业二级资质许可条件的问题失察失管。四是消防安全风险防控网不严密。当地消防部门未认真履行消防监督管理职责，日常消防监督检查和消防安全专项整治不扎实。丰台区消防救援支队（原丰台区公安消防支队）2012年对北京长峰医院东楼内部装修工程进行消防验收时，在未检查管道竖井封堵完整性、未对建筑内部装修防火等进行评定，以及在消防用电设备未采用专用供电回路的情况下，违规出具验收合格评定结论；长期以来未将北京长峰医院确定为消防安全重点单位。北京市消防救援总队指导落实北京市医疗机构消防安全组团体检式检查、建设工程施工现场消防安全专项检查工作不力，未有效推进隐患整改工作。此外，国务院事故调查组还查明，北京市规划和自然资源委员会丰台分局未认真履行制止和查处违法建设职责，未及时发现并查处北京长峰医院部分建筑未办理建设工程规划许可证违法行为；丰台区应急办在首次获知事故信息后4小时24分才正式报告，违反北京市应急值守工作有关规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;记者：这起事故暴露出哪些深层次的教训？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;答：&lt;/strong>;这起事故教训十分深刻，暴露出当地消防安全存在诸多突出问题和明显短板。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是防范化解重大风险意识薄弱。一些领导干部对本地区存在的重大风险认识不足，没有及时发现并有效防控重大风险，也没有把他人的教训当作自己的教训，对相关重特大火灾事故暴露出的违规动火或电焊作业问题没有引起足够重视。这些问题根本原因在于，学习贯彻习近平总书记关于防范化解重大风险的重要论述不认真不深刻，没有结合实际认真研究和排查本地区风险隐患。二是医疗卫生行业行政审批和安全管理不严格。丰台区卫生健康部门工作作风不实不细，审批许可流于形式，1998年以来先后对事发医院校验18次，在病床数量成倍增加却未变更登记、医护配比不符合要求等情况下，每次校验结果均为合格；对安全生产工作面上重视，实际却撤销安全生产科；没有定期开展医疗卫生机构消防安全检查，也没有对事发医院近3年消防检测发现的重大问题进行督促整改。三是建设工程规划、施工安全监管存在短板漏洞。北京市住房城乡建设部门对建筑业企业资质条件保持情况疏于监管，动态排查清理不符合条件企业工作滞后。北京市建设工程施工管理自我设“限”，对限额以上未办理施工许可证的建设工程未主动开展监督管理，把不具备申请办理施工许可条件的建设工程排除在监管范围外，“只管合法、不管非法”；对限额以下工程施工安全疏于管理，对属地培训指导、协调督促又没跟上，导致基层接不住、管不好。北京市城乡规划部门履行制止和查处违法建设职责不到位，未能有效指导属地政府及其相关部门违法建设查处工作，对辖区内无规划手续即新建、扩建的行为查不出、管不住。四是消防监督检查和专项整治不深入。当地消防部门未认真履行消防安全监管职责，2009年事发医院已符合消防安全重点单位界定标准，至2022年才将其确定为重点单位进行监管；确定为重点单位后，消防监督检查质效依然不高，未及时发现和督促整改消防设施、消防供电等问题隐患。北京市消防救援总队在全市部署开展的建设工程施工现场消防安全专项检查中，未能有效指导丰台区消防救援支队严格落实消防监督检查职责。五是初期应急处置能力不足。这次事故中，自流平地面和净化工程作业人员均为临时雇佣人员，未经任何施工交底和安全教育培训直接上岗，违规交叉作业导致发生火灾，之后作业人员均未第一时间报警。医院值班人员、管理人员和医护人员，在发现火情后均未第一时间报警，医院未有效组织初期火灾扑救和人员疏散。同时，这次事故也暴露出一些政府部门和单位存在事故信息报送特别是伤亡人员信息报送不及时不规范等问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;记者：这起事故性质严重、影响恶劣，为进一步汲取教训，防止此类事故再次发生，有哪些整改和防范措施建议？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;答：&lt;/strong>;为深刻汲取事故教训，举一反三，坚决防范遏制重特大事故发生，事故调查组提出了五个方面的整改和防范措施建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是切实扛起防范化解重大风险政治责任。各级领导干部要结合学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育，全面深入学习领会习近平总书记关于安全生产重要论述，坚持人民至上、生命至上，牢固树立安全发展理念，进一步增强防范化解重大风险的政治自觉、思想自觉和行动自觉。各地区、各部门、各单位要切实提高风险隐患排查整改质量，切实提升发现问题解决问题的强烈意愿和能力水平，进一步压紧压实企业主体责任、部门监管责任、地方领导责任，建立安全风险防范长效机制，坚决守牢安全红线底线。二是着力补齐医疗卫生机构安全管理短板。各级卫生健康部门要加强医疗卫生行业安全管理，督促各类医疗卫生机构严格执行安全生产和消防安全管理规定，加强安全风险分级管控和隐患排查治理，组织开展医疗卫生机构安全生产和消防安全专项排查整治。严格医疗卫生机构登记校验、行政审批等，组织开展医疗卫生机构依法执业情况核查，严查不如实申报情况、超许可范围执业、违规开展医养结合服务等行为。督促医疗卫生机构统筹考虑院感防治和病患应急疏散转移，指导各类医疗卫生机构制定专项灭火预案和应急疏散预案。三是坚决堵塞建设工程安全监督管理漏洞。各级住房城乡建设部门要加大资质审批后动态监管力度，严格建设工程施工许可管理，加强施工现场特别是施工动火作业安全管理，及时发现并消除事故隐患。城乡规划等部门要加大对违法建设的巡查和处置力度，对新增违建实行“零容忍”。四是全面织牢织密消防安全风险防控网。各地区要按照“三管三必须”要求，进一步压实行业部门消防安全管理责任，推行行业消防安全标准化管理；对职能交叉和新业态新风险，及时明确监管责任。推动街道乡镇建设应急站、消防所，发挥公安派出所、社区、网格等群防群治力量，切实加强对小场所小单位的消防安全管理。各级消防部门要严格履行消防监督管理职责，推动公共消防安全治理模式向事前预防转型，切实提升消防监督检查质效。五是加快提升基层一线应急处置能力和水平。各地区要进一步强化对各类企事业单位应急预案、演练、培训等应急准备的组织指导、监督检查。加强基层一线作业人员安全教育和应急培训，深入开展实操实训应急演练，确保熟悉作业场所现场处置方案。加强应急文化建设，强化应急科普宣传，切实增强社会公众安全意识，做到人人讲安全、个个会应急。 &lt;/p>;

On the morning of October 24, 2023, Jingdong Procurement and Sales publicly called Li Jiaqi to &quot;choose one of the two&quot; in the circle of friends. The staff member said that JD.com received a lawyer&#39;s letter from the brand owner Hai&#39;s. The brand complained that because the price of a certain Hai&#39;s oven on JD.com was lower than the price of Li Jiaqi&#39;s live broadcast, it violated the &quot;reserve price agreement&quot; signed between them and Li Jiaqi, which would lead to a claim for compensation. Huge liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, Li Jiaqi’s company, MeiONE, responded: Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room and Hai’s did not sign a so-called “reserve price agreement”; Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room has never asked the brand to make any choice; Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room has never asked the brand to make any choice; The pricing power of goods lies in the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hi&#39;s issued a statement saying: The Hai&#39;s brand has not signed any &quot;reserve price agreement&quot; and the information released by JD.com is untrue. Hai&#39;s stated that the price guarantee was to bring the lowest sales price to the same level across the entire network. JD.com did not have the right to modify the price without authorization. After its own refusal, JD.com still chose to lower the price. Moreover, the losses of each oven sold by JD.com at a lower price will be borne by the Hai&#39;s brand, instead of being subsidized by the platform as JD.com claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you view the confrontation between e-commerce platforms and e-commerce live broadcasts this time? What is the essence of the debate between the two parties and even the three parties (plus the brand)? It deserves detailed analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there is a factual question that cannot be avoided: Did Hai&#39;s and Li Jiaqi or his company sign a &quot;reserve price agreement&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a &quot;Mei ONE Live Broadcasting Promotion Service Contract&quot; disclosed by Sina Technology, the contract states: ... The brand must ensure that the value of the gift is the highest value under the same conditions within the guarantee range within the guarantee period; During the guarantee period, the brand needs to ensure that the promotional intensity provided by the designated experts under all promotional services agreed by both parties under the framework of this contract is the maximum intensity under the same conditions within the scope of the guarantee during the guarantee period. In the event of a breach of contract, the brand needs to refund five times the price difference to consumers, compensate ONE with liquidated damages of RMB 2 million, and bear all expenses and losses incurred due to the refund of the price difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Attachment 3 of the contract is the special guarantee clause. The scope of the best price is specified to be the Taobao platform controlled by Party A (brand party) (including but not limited to Taobao/Tmall stores, anchor live broadcasts and other Taobao content channels), other e-commerce platforms and offline channels. The best price guarantee period is 60 days before and after the actual date of the live broadcast promotion service (121 days in total). There are three special guarantee contents. The first one is: within the guarantee period, the brand also needs to ensure that the final transaction price of the promotional objects within the corresponding planned sales volume under all the promotion services provided by the designated experts is within the guarantee range within the guarantee period. lowest price within. Articles 2 and 3 are the same as the provisions on gifts and promotion intensity in the main body of the contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, comparing the text of the contract with Attachment 3, the requirements of the US ONE Live Broadcast for the brand are: within a total of four months, the final transaction price of the live broadcast promotion object must be relative to all e-commerce platforms and The lowest price for offline channels, and the value of gifts and promotion intensity are also stipulated to prevent brands and other platforms from circumventing the minimum price clause through these two methods. This is the &quot;lowest price agreement in the entire network&quot; that is comprehensively stipulated from the price of genuine products, the value of gifts and the intensity of promotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question now becomes whether Hai&#39;s and Li Jiaqi signed a contract with a &quot;reservoir price agreement&quot;. If what JD.com said is true, then it is signed. Of course, between JD.com and Haishi and US ONE, we can see which side is telling the truth. We can see further disclosure of hard evidence by both parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, JD.com Publicly accused Li Jiaqi of &quot;choosing one of two&quot; and engaging in a &quot;low-price agreement&quot; in WeChat Moments. Li Jiaqi&#39;s company denied this. Obviously, the former may be summoning the Sword of Damocles: the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Anti-Monopoly Law&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Anti-Monopoly Law has provisions against &quot;abuse of dominant market position&quot; (Article 22). The 2021 &quot;Anti-Monopoly Guidelines of the State Council Anti-Monopoly Commission on the Platform Economy&quot; stipulates: Operators in the platform economy with a dominant market position may abuse their market dominance, restrict transactions with counterparties without legitimate reasons, and exclude or restrict the market. compete. To analyze whether it constitutes restricted trading behavior, the following factors can be considered: requiring operators within the platform to &quot;choose one&quot; between competing platforms, or other behavior that restricts trading counterparties to conduct exclusive transactions with them...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In other words, the platform&#39;s requirement for merchants to &quot;choose one of two&quot; may be regarded as &quot;abusing market dominance&quot; and &quot;eliminating or restricting market competition&quot;, thus triggering an antitrust investigation. This is why Li Jiaqi&#39;s company denies &quot;choose one of two&quot;. But now who can deny that Li Jiaqi is a platform? “Choose one from two” essentially forces businesses to choose only themselves. As for why Heidegger stood up to the &quot;strong&quot; Li Jiaqi this time, it should be the result of weighing his own pros and cons. Therefore, it is also worthy of concern whether this confrontation will lead to consequences for regulatory agencies and antitrust law enforcement agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, it is still an industry practice for leading anchors to require merchants to sign the &quot;lowest price agreement in the entire network.&quot; The so-called &quot;the pricing power of Li Jiaqi&#39;s live broadcast products lies in the brand&quot; is obviously unconvincing and is just a rhetoric or a rhetoric to avoid legal risks. There are two further points to interpret this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, as the economy enters the era of medium-low growth and stock market, the involution among all platforms is intensifying. From e-commerce platforms to top anchors, in fact, the game methods of all Internet platforms are being simplified, and winning with price has become a trend, because now consumers are most concerned about price. Your head anchor wants to offer the lowest price on the entire network. Why can’t my e-commerce platform offer a lower price than yours? In other words, this is a competition for the title and persona of &quot;lowest price on the entire network&quot;. The goal of many e-commerce platforms is to take back this title and persona and establish a &quot;mental footprint&quot; among consumers. This is the business logic and essence behind this matchup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the &quot;Anti-Monopoly Law&quot; revised in mid-2022 does not clearly include provisions for the &quot;lowest price on the entire network&quot; for leading anchors. However, according to the logic of the Anti-Monopoly Law, merchants must guarantee to the live broadcast platform within a few months that it must be the lowest price in the entire network relative to all other platforms and channels. This may be regarded as an abuse of market dominance. Article 22 of this requirement is clear. Clause: &quot;Other abuse of market dominance determined by the anti-monopoly law enforcement agency of the State Council.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, regarding this alignment, we must also pay close attention to the regulator’s attitude and views on the long-term “floor price agreement” in all fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
