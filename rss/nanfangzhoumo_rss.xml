The figures running freely and the laughter from time to time are the vibrant scenery of the campus. However, &quot;Xinhua Viewpoint&quot; reporters recently investigated in some places and found that some primary and secondary school students were restrained for 10 minutes between classes. Except for drinking water and going to the toilet, they were not allowed to leave the classroom or even leave their seats at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Education clearly requires that no unnecessary restrictions shall be placed on students&#39; freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom during recess and other non-teaching time. . So, why do some schools strictly control students’ 10-minute recess activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The campus becomes quiet during the break&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10-minute break between classes is commonly known as the break. It is an important time for primary school students to adjust their learning status, relieve fatigue and communicate with each other. The reporter recently visited many primary and secondary schools and saw that the campus became quiet because students were required not to leave the classroom at will during elementary classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that this phenomenon has been around for a long time. A 2019 survey of more than 1,900 parents showed that 75.2% of parents believed that the phenomenon of &quot;quiet recess&quot; is common in primary and secondary schools around them, and is most prominent in primary schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Parents of students from many primary schools in Changchun City reported that the school requires their children not to play on the playground during recess and can only go to the toilet or move quietly in the corridor. One parent said that the child&#39;s class teacher stipulated that the child should stay in his seat except when going to the toilet during class breaks. &quot;Some students were punished for fighting in the classroom during recess. Since then, they no longer dare to run around after class.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many schools in Haikou City The primary school arranges for teachers on duty to patrol each floor and strictly prohibits students from chasing and playing in the corridors. Some schools also select young pioneers to form a duty team, which scores and assesses the behavior of students in each class during class. Once chasing and fighting are found, points will be deducted from the class. The assessment is directly linked to the selection of civilized classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar phenomena also exist in some primary and secondary schools in Hebei, Guizhou and other places. The reporter saw in a primary school in Langfang City, Hebei Province, that except for some students going to the toilet, most of the children were sitting in the classroom chatting after class. Zhang Xu (pseudonym), a primary school teacher in Zunyi, Guizhou, said that some class teachers do not allow students to play on the playground during recess. &quot;This is too depressing for children&#39;s nature.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents of primary school students in Haikou City said that only a few teachers attach importance to students’ physical exercise between classes, and most teachers will try their best to make active primary school students more active in the name of emphasizing discipline. Be quiet, euphemistically called &quot;civilized rest.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Over-restraint&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;is not good for&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;children Healthy Growth&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are students frequently over-restrained during primary school breaks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some teachers interviewed said that mainly because of the limited space and dense crowds, accidents such as collisions often occur when students play on the playground. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A teacher from a primary school in a county in Hebei Province said that once a student encounters an accident such as a collision during recess activities, the school not only needs to apologize to the parents, but may also involve financial compensation. For this reason, the school simply emphasizes discipline between classes and reduces children&#39;s outing activities. &quot;It is better to do less than to do more.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the objective conditions of the site are also an important reason. Many teachers interviewed reported that many urban school teaching buildings are built relatively high, with only 10-minute breaks between classes. The elevators are not enough for students to run up and down, and the narrow corridors easily create the risk of crowding and stampedes. Moreover, the playgrounds of urban schools are small and often have too many children to move around. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents believe that restricting children’s recess activities is mainly for schools and teachers to facilitate management and reduce trouble. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some grassroots educators interviewed also believe that excessive restrictions during small classes violate the regulations of the Ministry of Education and are also a manifestation of extensive and lazy school management. Strictly limiting the scope and intensity of activities for primary and secondary school students during recess can reduce the chance of accidents, but it is not conducive to the healthy growth of children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This approach will suppress the child&#39;s nature and is not conducive to physical development. Psychologists believe that walking out of the classroom and exercising properly during recess can relieve study pressure and promote interpersonal communication. Yin Ruofeng, deputy chief physician of the Spine Surgery Department of the Third Hospital of Jilin University, said that heavy academic load and decreasing physical activities are important factors affecting the body posture and spinal health of primary and secondary school students. Going out of the classroom to move your limbs during small classes is beneficial to students&#39; health. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Data from the National Health Commission show that the overall myopia rate among children and adolescents in my country in 2022 is 53.6%. According to the interviewed ophthalmology experts, participating in outdoor sports is an important means to prevent and control myopia. Being &quot;crowded&quot; during primary school hours will lead to a reduction in the time for outdoor sports among primary and middle school students and an increase in the probability of myopia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, this approach can easily make students feel tired of studying. Shen Wei, vice principal of the primary school of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School, pointed out that staying in the classroom for a long time may cause students to be mentally burned out; students use recess to adjust and relax their bodies and minds, which can help them concentrate on the next class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Resolutely implement national protection regulations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Relevant regulations for minors&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Regulations on the Protection of Minors in Schools&quot; officially implemented on September 1, 2021 requires that schools shall not set up management measures that infringe on students&#39; personal freedom, and shall not punish students during breaks and other non-teaching time There are unnecessary restrictions on the freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom; schools should improve the management system to ensure that students can use the school&#39;s sports venues and facilities for physical exercise during and after class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot; data-key=&quot;256262 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Primary school students of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School skip rope on the playground during recess&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter learned from the interview that some schools use small classes to carry out a variety of outdoor activities. For example, the elementary school of Changchun Foreign Language Experimental School has opened basketball, volleyball and other activity areas, and students can choose according to their personal interests. At the same time, with the support of the school, the head teacher also encourages students to go out and do activities as much as possible. Liancheng Primary School in Congtai District, Handan City, Hebei Province is not only equipped with sports equipment such as basketball, football and badminton, but also equipped with books, chess, backgammon and other items in the classroom for students to use during class. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The teachers and parents interviewed believe that returning small classes to children requires comprehensive measures. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As an important part of campus safety management, schools must carry out campus safety hazard inspections on a regular basis and make campus safety work detailed and solid. Shen Wei introduced that there are 1,980 students in the primary school of Changchun Foreign Languages ​​Experimental School in grades one to six. In order to ensure the safety and order of students’ recess activities, the school dispatched 6 physical education teachers, 6 teachers of all grades and student cadres to monitor the corridors, stairs, The playground is inspected and on duty, and most students can go up and down the stairs in an orderly manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Experts suggest that the education authorities should issue guidance, strengthen the supervision and management of schools through supervision, and return recess time to students as much as possible. Schools should also strengthen skills guidance and safety education for students in sports and games to reduce the probability of accidents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Interviewees believe that when campus management is standardized and school facilities are safe, society and parents cannot simply pass the responsibility to schools and teachers when campus safety problems arise. . A working mechanism for government departments or third-party agencies to standardize the handling of campus safety incidents can be established to reduce the probability of direct conflicts between schools and parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“年纪大了，玩芭比有点幼稚”：棉花娃娃寄托的情感生意]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259679]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On April 30, 2023, Kunming, citizens brought cotton dolls to the Jacaranda Taking photos on the avenue.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the news came that &quot;Haidilao refused to celebrate the birthday of Cotton Doll&quot;, Zhitao (screen name) quickly cleared all his posts on Photos from QQ space. It was a commemorative photo she took of her cotton doll &quot;Luffy&quot; on her birthday a few months ago - slightly different from ordinary dolls, this character from the anime &quot;One Piece&quot; has a disproportionately large head. Her eyes were bright and she had a silly grin, completely covered by her iconic crescent moon bangs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I saw Luffy sitting upright, with a row of small cakes in front of him. Under the photo, Zhi Tao typed out a line of words sincerely: He is one year older. Happy birthday! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Because of the incident (Haidilao), I was afraid of being criticized by others.&quot; Zhi Tao is a cotton doll lover. According to the popular gameplay in this circle, Players are like raising children, buying clothes and accessories for their dolls, and taking them on trips, parties, and even birthdays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, because the outside world does not understand these behaviors, the players who call each other &quot;baby friends&quot; have been criticized a lot. &quot;Netizens said it was a mental illness, and the words were unpleasant.&quot; Zhitao has just entered her junior year. Like many children, she is introverted and sensitive, and is troubled by poor interpersonal communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton doll is a trendy doll that has quietly become popular among young people recently. On October 16, 2023, when a consumer brought his cotton doll to Haidilao for dinner, the waiter refused to serve the doll for his birthday. This matter became a hot topic on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What kind of charm does cotton doll have that can make young consumers generous? Why do people born in the 1990s and 2000s place their emotional needs on a stuffed toy? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kid friend: &quot;I have never seen such a nice boy in real life&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Celebrating Luffy’s birthday, it was Shitao who suddenly appeared come up with ideas. That day was the end of the May Day holiday, and my roommate had not returned to school yet. During the day, she had a quarrel with her mother, and was asked repeatedly on the phone why she didn&#39;t go home during the holidays. &lt;p>; &quot;Get up and go to the store to buy a few cakes to celebrate the birthday of this &quot;little friend&quot; who has grown up with you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Usually, comic book authors announce character birthdays on the company website. Luffy is the protagonist of the popular Japanese anime &quot;One Piece&quot;. His brave, fearless, persistent and optimistic character, as well as his pure, kind, affectionate and righteousness towards his friends, made Shitao fall in love with him. &quot;Maybe, I have also wished that I was such a person, or that I had such friends.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She is the only one in the dormitory, and she has been used to it since she was a child. Zhi Tao, who lives alone, puts the cotton doll Luffy on the bedside on the table, and then puts a small cake on it, and instantly seems to have an emotional connection with this little friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao explained that when it comes to cotton dolls, she actually belongs to a typical &quot;poor family&quot; model. Even so, she can&#39;t help but see beautiful accessories occasionally. Bought to match Luffy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I am considered a wealthy child.&quot; 19-year-old Zhou Zhou is also a child lover. She raises a cotton doll named Wanzi. When I first got it, Wanzi was just a &quot;naked baby&quot; - no decoration. Seeing the beautiful hairpins, hats and scarves, Zhou Zhou wanted to buy them for his doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She also buys clothes for Wanzi. At first, she just bought some baby clothes, but she felt that the sizes were always a bit off. Later, I simply went to customize some clothes like I did with the &quot;group purchase&quot; dolls, but the price was slightly more expensive and the cycle would be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Zhou said that in addition to dressing up dolls, she sometimes also &quot;makes things happen&quot;. For example, when doing homework, let Wanzi accompany you, and then record the conversation as a video and upload it to the Internet platform. &quot;While doing homework, I asked Wanzi, isn&#39;t your father a doctor? Can you know this question?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the circle, those dolls with character prototypes are called &quot;dolls with attributes&quot;. The character prototype of Wanzi comes from a female-oriented online game. In the game, a female character played by Zhou Zhou falls in love with a doctor named Charlie Su, and Wanzi is the fruit of love. &quot;The Maruko doll is a baby in the three-dimensional world. This kind of companionship and sustenance has a sense of reality and makes me feel very happy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In real life, I have never seen a boy as good as Charlie Sue.&quot; The character setting of Charlie Sue is romance, kindness, and respect for women. Zhou Zhou said that there are five male protagonists in the game. She didn&#39;t pay attention to Charlie Su at first, but she was gradually attracted by his attentiveness, especially when she saw a book &quot;Fang Siqi&#39;s First Love Paradise&quot; hidden in Charlie Su&#39;s study. 》, I was instantly moved by this detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Zhou is a &quot;science and engineering girl&quot; majoring in biology. She is a sophomore in Hefei, Anhui and has never been in a relationship in real life. &quot;Every day when I open Weibo and Tik Tok, there are warnings of &#39;marriage fear&#39;.&quot; She said that as a woman, she often senses unfriendly behavior from the outside world, which makes her cautious about entering a relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cotton dolls often play a role in expressing emotions for children, and these emotions have a wide range of aspects. &quot;I have lacked companionship since I was a child.&quot; Zhitao explained that she grew up in a single-parent family. Her mother ran a factory by herself. She was usually very busy and had to go home very late every day. During her long teenage years, she spent her time alone at home watching TV, scrolling through her cell phone, and reading comic books. &quot;On May Day, I actually wanted to go back, but when I went back, I would be alone at home. It would be better to stay alone in the dormitory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Except for the road Fei, Shibatao also ordered a prototype doll named Kageyama Shigeo, the male protagonist of the Japanese anime &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;. Kageyama Shigeo has super powers and can help many people, but he feels inferior and depressed because he is not good at dealing with people. Through painful growth, he slowly accepts his imperfect self. &quot;Luffy and Kageyama Shigeo are two sides of my personality.&quot; Shibato said, putting the two dolls of Luffy and Kageyama Shigeo on the bedside, and she felt very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Some doll friends will decorate doll houses for cotton dolls.

(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Baby’s mother: “If no one sells it, I will make it myself”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao’s memories, give After Luffy&#39;s birthday, she secretly posted the photo on QQ space, which few people paid attention to, and occasionally looked through it herself, &quot;mainly because I was afraid that others wouldn&#39;t understand and would criticize you.&quot; Therefore, when the controversy over the Haidilao incident came out, she was so sensitive that she quickly deleted this trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She is grateful for the appearance of Cotton Doll, allowing her to find similar people who can understand each other&#39;s behavior. Zhitao explained that the most popular cotton doll is the most popular animation, game, drama series or &quot;idol&quot; at the moment. Because it has just become popular, the peripheral products are not perfect enough. If fans want to express their love, they need to DIY. Make emotional cotton dolls. &quot;There are few ways to express emotions, so just make it yourself.&quot; Among them, they are divided into nurturing dolls and idol dolls, which are to raise the dolls like children, or to pursue them like celebrities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Slightly different from the outside world’s perception, anime “popular idols” like Luffy have many fans, but they are not actually the most popular dolls. &quot;Because &quot;One Piece&quot; has been popular for a long time, there are so many peripherals, and there are many choices.&quot; Shigeo Kageyama, who Shimomo also likes, is not a popular doll either, because this anime is a little old, but it is relatively unpopular. I know it and like it. There are not many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, when Zhitao sees posts or merchandise about her favorite characters on social media, she will feel very happy, &quot;Ah, I didn&#39;t expect such unpopularity.&quot; characters, but also dolls.” She introduced that there will be like-minded people on social platforms who post posts to solicit fans and buy cotton dolls together in groups. If fans are interested, they take the initiative to contact the poster, and then they are pulled into a group buying group on an e-commerce platform to communicate. &quot;At least 50 people can be recruited to form a group.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This sponsor is called &quot;baby mother&quot; by children&#39;s friends. &quot;Baby mothers are like fans in the rice circle, and they are actually fans.&quot; She explained that usually cotton dolls are usually designed by the mother in advance by someone or herself. The pattern and size of the doll will be announced in advance and everyone&#39;s opinions will be solicited. , if you are dissatisfied with the design, you can make suggestions for modifications. After the final draft is finalized, the baby&#39;s mother will go to the factory to make a sample. Once the sample is satisfactory, it can be shipped. This cycle usually takes several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Usually more than 900 yuan for a sample.&quot; Tongmian (online name) is the legendary baby mother. She said that before starting a group, she must first Draw sketches, because I have some basic drawing skills, so I make my own design draft. After finishing the painting, I post it to social platforms to find people. The jargon is called &quot;squatting&quot;. We will see if there are many interested people. If we can find some people, we will start to form a group. After joining the group for discussion one after another, we will go to the factory to make prototypes. &quot;If you are satisfied, we will make the goods. If you are not satisfied, we will continue to make samples. You can make samples up to three times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tong Mian said that she does this job part-time, which is equivalent to generating electricity for love. At first, she liked the character Qi Sili in the game &quot;Love of Light and Night&quot; very much, so she wanted to own a doll, but she searched all major e-commerce platforms and found nothing. &quot;No one sold it, so I decided to make it myself.&quot; After the doll is ready, the total cost of the doll plus postage is 70 yuan, and the co-sleeper will also give you some trinkets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the communication group, in addition to exchanging opinions on drawings and samples, the baby&#39;s mother will also announce the production progress, communication details with the factory owner, and cost details. The whole process is more like DIY for fans. Mothers will gain a sense of accomplishment when they see their ideas turn into reality little by little. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enterprise: “Niche, too small batch size”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhitao discovered that a mother with a baby clearly stated in the group announcement that she refused to Adults &quot;start a group&quot;. &quot;A doll costs tens of dollars, which is quite expensive. I&#39;m afraid that it has already left the factory, and parents find it too expensive to return it.&quot; She explained that the number of doll friends who like a specific character is already small. As far as the factory is concerned, Their order quantity is too small, which is the minimum limit that can be started for production. &quot;Baby mothers use love to generate electricity. If they return the goods, they have to pay for it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, although a doll costs fifty or sixty yuan, It&#39;s not cheap, but Zhitao thinks it&#39;s reasonable. &quot;After all, there are too few people who like this.&quot; She said that some big IPs have very rich derivatives and a wide range of choices, while peripherals for niche hobbies can only be obtained through DIY methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The entrepreneur Feng He (pseudonym) is not an animation fan or a fan. He noticed that the cotton doll was not a hobby, but an instinctive business sense. However, after entering this track, he gradually realized why this new thing appeared in the form of fan groups. &quot;It is mainly a niche, quite special, and not as easy to do as imagined.&quot; Feng He is the founder of a cotton doll company in Zhongshan, Guangdong. At first, he found a factory to make the dolls, but later he purchased a machine to make the dolls himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The main difficulty is that the batch size is too small.&quot; Feng He said that there are many categories of cotton dolls, but the production quantity of a single category is very limited. There are a large number of toy OEM factories in the Pearl River Delta, but for them, the number of each order is too small. &quot;They mainly take orders from foreign countries, mainly exporting.&quot; When he first got involved in this industry, he had to communicate frequently with factories, which consumed a lot of time and energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Feng He was still unwilling to miss this emerging market, so he established a company, bought machines, and decided to open a factory and do it himself. “The most important costs are personnel and management costs.” He said that a mature sample maker’s monthly salary is at least 8,000 yuan, a machine tool master needs 6,800 yuan, and embroidery workers and handymen’s monthly salary is more than 6,000 yuan. A mature embroiderer can sew up to 40 dolls a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if the factory has been opened, the way they receive orders is still to post posts and gather enough people before starting a group. Depending on the size of the doll and the quantity of the group, the pricing will be different, with the range mostly fluctuating by tens of yuan. &quot;Although it is very popular now, in the big market of dolls, it is a very small segment.&quot; He said that cotton dolls are actually an upgrade of the manufacturing industry. After the growth of large-volume export trade slowed down, only There is a way out to undertake this type of small batch and multi-batch demand, which puts forward higher requirements for corporate management and cost control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if external entrepreneurs gradually intervene, flexibility and smallness are still the characteristics of this industry. Data from an e-commerce platform shows that the number of cotton doll merchants with transaction records has increased from less than 400 in 2017 to nearly 10,000 by the end of 2020, an increase of more than 20 times in three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Brand&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The first question is&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Copyright&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xiao Qi (screen name) is also a cotton doll lover. I work in a small cotton doll company near the water and have collected more than 20 dolls. As a serious gamer, she would change the doll&#39;s bangs and clothes, put blush on her face, and check in and take photos at Internet celebrity coffee shops. She also made space on the wardrobe and built a &quot;baby house&quot;. She followed the tutorials on social media to hang hooks, pictures and other props to decorate the doll&#39;s room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the development of the industry, the cotton doll accessories industry chain has developed. On the e-commerce platform, there are all kinds of jewelry, baby clothes, shoes, blush, as well as baby bags, baby houses, furniture and other peripheral accessories for cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Limited by the exclusivity of the audience for attribute dolls, many cotton dolls cannot be mass-produced, but many accessories can be used universally without copyright risk. , on the contrary, mass production will be realized earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;As I get older, playing with Barbie is a bit childish, and Cotton Doll is just right.&quot; Xiaoqi is not a fan of fans or animation, she mainly likes Cotton Doll It was to fulfill my childhood dream of being a princess. Her more than 20 cotton dolls are all non-attributed dolls, with no corresponding IP prototypes and no copyright authorization issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;To take the branding route, the first problem to solve is copyright.&quot; Rua Baby Bar founder Ye Yingdan was the first to notice that cotton dolls could grow into an industry one of the people. Ye Yingdan was originally a marketing director of an e-commerce platform. As early as 2019, she monitored in the background data that &quot;cotton doll&quot; became a hot-searched product as a keyword. After careful study, we found that cotton dolls are a very interesting category. The products are soft and cute. No matter the designers, manufacturers or the audience, they are all very young, mostly middle school and college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The cotton dolls purchased in 2018 are based on a Korean boy band.

Of course, the quantity of a single category is also very limited, and the production cycle is very long. Even a few months after the group was launched, the product has not yet been released. Some baby friends have even forgotten about it. There have been cases where the baby&#39;s mother &quot;ran away with the money.&quot; Condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The supply chain ecology is very backward, and the upstream cannot solve the problem of genuine authorization, and the development of the entire market is very restricted.&quot; Ye Yingdan explained that despite the many problems, she Still see the vigorous development. That year, Cotton Doll’s GMV (total transaction volume within a period of time) on their platform grew by more than 300% in one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the star-chasing culture that originated in South Korea to quietly becoming popular in China, it quickly expanded to various circles of animation, film and television, and games, and developed its own Circle culture. Ye Yingdan feels that this industry has great potential and she wants to create a brand of cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ye Yingdan found that a major difficulty in the early stages of starting a business was how to accurately select IP with sustainable commercial value, &quot;Because the cotton doll itself has a prototype, and the product is not It is not the brand that takes the lead, but the product that is created by the fans of the character.” After exploration, we found that compared to idols and animation, the IP of film and television dramas is more suitable for brand operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We go to the market to check the hot dramas that are waiting to be broadcast, and try our best to &#39;sign all the ones that should be signed&#39; to ensure that we continue to produce peripherals for popular characters in TV dramas. .&quot; Ye Yingdan said that branded cotton dolls can only cover the characters that are popular and highly recognized by the public, while many unpopular IPs still require hobbyists to DIY them. Therefore, in the future, the group-style small workshop model will still exist for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“直博生主动选择博转硕”背后：博士过剩正在愈演愈烈丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259693]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; report, &quot;direct doctoral students actively choose to convert from Ph.D. to master&#39;s degree&quot; has become a new phenomenon in colleges and universities. The reporter interviewed several direct doctoral students. Their reasons for choosing to &quot;transfer to a master&#39;s degree&quot; vary: some are not suitable for PhD life, some are because the subject is too difficult, and some are worried about their employment after graduation. For them, changing to a master&#39;s degree or simply entering the workplace is an &quot;active diversion.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these doctoral students choose to quit is naturally due to rational considerations of cost-benefit ratio. If the subject is too difficult and they cannot get a degree even after studying for several years, the resulting sunk cost will be staggering; even if they go through all the hard work to get a doctorate, if they cannot find a job after graduation, the opportunity cost they will pay will be astonishing. It is bound to be too big to bear; even if they work hard to get a teaching position, many &quot;green peppers&quot; still have to fight hard to escape from the various &quot;promote or leave&quot; assessment quagmire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that a doctoral student spends several years studying for a degree, and then tries his best to find a stable scientific research and teaching position. This is an out-and-out &quot;adventure&quot;, while his peers I&#39;m afraid I have spent the past few years getting married and starting a business. In comparison, studying for a Ph.D. is indeed like a &quot;gamble&quot;. It was based on these considerations that several parties involved in the report decisively chose to &quot;stop losses&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this phenomenon is the problem of &quot;mismatch&quot; and &quot;excess&quot; in the selection and training of domestic doctoral students. The so-called &quot;mismatch&quot; means that many students who are not suitable for Ph.D. study mistakenly enter the path of Ph.D., and after enrolling, they are shocked to realize that they are not the material; the so-called &quot;surplus&quot; means that there are too many doctoral students trained by universities, showing an oversupply situation. The society cannot provide enough jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the first batch of doctoral students independently trained in China received their degrees in 1983, the number of doctoral students recruited and graduated every year in the country has been growing rapidly for the past 40 years. According to the Ministry of Education&#39;s &quot;2022 National Education Development Statistical Bulletin&quot;, a total of 82,300 doctoral students will graduate in 2022. This year, the number of doctoral student enrollment exceeded the 130,000 mark, and the number of doctoral students reached 556,100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a vertical perspective, China&#39;s doctoral student enrollment exceeded 10,000 in 1995, reached 60,000 in 2009, and reached 130,000 in 2022. In less than thirty years, the number has surged by more than a dozen. times; horizontally, China surpassed the United States as the world&#39;s largest doctorate-granting country as early as 2008, and currently the number of new doctorates awarded each year exceeds that of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the number of people enrolling and graduating with doctoral degrees in China reaches new highs every year; on the other hand, the “superfluity of doctoral students” is becoming more and more serious. News about &quot;PhDs in nuclear physics becoming urban managers&quot;, &quot;Doctors in medicine applying for school doctors&quot; and &quot;PhD students vying for primary and secondary school teachers&quot; appear frequently. The dilemma of &quot;green pepper collective anxiety&quot; often shows the embarrassment of doctoral students being &quot;overqualified for their talents&quot; in the job market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is there a surplus of doctoral students? This is related to social needs, traditional concepts, and policy guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Society’s demand for doctoral students often changes with the economic situation and industrial structure. Once the &quot;demand side&quot; of society cannot create enough scientific research and teaching positions, it will not be able to accommodate enough PhD employment. If PhDs in science and engineering can still find use in corporate R&amp;D departments, PhDs in humanities and social sciences may only have public and teaching positions left to fight for, and these positions are one carrot after another, and the growth rate is limited after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traditional Chinese concept is that &quot;those who excel in learning will become officials&quot;. It seems that contemporary Ph.D.s, like the ancient scholars, belong to the reserve army of public officials. Standing at the entrance of the ivory tower, the first-year Ph.D. students regard &quot;Doctor&quot; as a status and even a talisman, and are &quot;on the waiting list&quot; like &quot;passing the Jinshi examination&quot;. In reality, the &quot;grading advantage&quot; of doctoral students joining civil servants is also reinforcing this concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, modern society is not ancient times after all. The rapidly growing number of doctoral students far exceeds the imperial examination quota of only a few hundred people a year in the past. The number of public positions that the society can accommodate may not keep up with the excess number of doctoral graduates. . If the relationship between &quot;social demand&quot; and &quot;doctoral supply&quot; cannot be realized, then the starting point of students&#39; doctoral studies will inevitably be out of touch with the connotation of a doctoral degree, and they will become farther and farther away from the &quot;original intention&quot; of a doctoral degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ph.D. degrees, from the outset, are different from other degrees in the education system. Pursuing a doctorate is known as an arduous journey of &quot;studying alone at the farthest edge of knowledge&quot;. Those who obtain a doctorate are also hailed as &quot;creating new knowledge for mankind&quot;, which means that they can independently complete research and expand humankind. cognitive boundaries. A vivid description is that if the human knowledge system is regarded as a concentric circle with a radius that is constantly expanding outward, then a doctor is someone who touches the outermost circle and makes a breakthrough outward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for doctoral students in modern society often changes with the economic situation and industrial structure. Changes on the demand side should naturally force adjustments on the supply side. In the face of changes in social needs, universities should proactively adjust their doctoral training plans. Public universities must make good use of taxpayers&#39; higher education funds, and private universities must be worthy of large donations from alumni. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the United States as an example. The financial pressure brought about by the COVID-19 impact has caused many prestigious universities in the United States to reduce enrollment or even suspend enrollment in many doctoral programs. Doctorates in liberal arts who do not make money are the first to bear the brunt. According to U.S. media statistics, in 2021 alone, dozens of elite universities in the United States have suspended enrollment in more than 140 doctoral programs in the humanities and social sciences. After the emergence of the large language model ChatGPT, doctoral majors in the field of artificial intelligence have won a new round of favor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are you suitable for a PhD? Does the doctoral team need you? Does society need you as a doctoral student? If you answer these questions carefully, pursuing a doctorate can be called a &quot;two-way journey.&quot; At the same time, universities should also think deeply about how to proactively adjust the enrollment and training plans for doctoral students in response to social needs, instead of &quot;cultivating PhDs like mushrooms&quot;, which will lead to the problems of degree involution and a surplus of PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[京津冀及周边地区多城市启动重污染天气预警]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259698]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 07:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since October 22, a PM2.5 pollution process has occurred in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas.

Experts pointed out that since October 22, regional meteorological conditions have turned unfavorable and PM2.5 pollution has gradually accumulated. As of 8:00 on October 30, a total of 32 days of moderate or above PM2.5 pollution occurred in 16 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Expert analysis shows that from the perspective of meteorological conditions, the recent meteorological conditions in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas have been relatively unfavorable, which can easily lead to the accumulation and transformation of pollution. Since October 22, the cold air activity in the region has been weak, and the surface temperature and lower atmospheric relative humidity have been higher than normal, which can easily cause regional pollution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of regional pollution emissions, the activity levels of regional industrial enterprises, heavy trucks and the number of straw fire points have increased month-on-month, and pollution emissions are showing an increasing trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of industrial sources, since late October, regional industrial electricity consumption has increased significantly compared with the previous period. Among them, the increase in electricity consumption in cement, brick and tile industries has been more obvious, and the electricity consumption in steel, coking, petrochemical and other industries has increased significantly. The battery capacity is basically the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of mobile sources, the recent traffic flow of heavy trucks in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas has been at a high level since autumn and winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of non-point sources, a total of 325 fire points were discovered in the area from October 21 to 28, of which the number was larger in Tianjin, Hebei (Cangzhou, Zhangjiakou), Henan (Zhoukou, Zhumadian, Luohe) and other places. many. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter learned that many cities in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas have initiated heavy pollution weather warnings.

BMI refers to weight (kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters). BMI less than 18.5 is considered thin, 18.5 to 24.9 is normal, 25 or more is overweight, and 30 or more is obese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a recent article in Nature magazine stated that this standard for diagnosing obesity is flawed. First of all, obesity is considered obese when the total amount of fat accumulated in the human body and the amount distributed in different parts exceeds a certain amount. However, BMI does not measure the amount of fat in the human body and the amount distributed in various parts, so it cannot reflect whether people are really obese. , how serious the degree of obesity is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, even if the BMI is the same, people of different ages and genders have different fats. For example, older people generally have more fat and less muscle than young people, and women tend to have more fat than men. body fat. Furthermore, even if adults of similar age and sex have the same BMI, they may have different amounts of body fat and the amount of fat distributed in different body parts and organs. Studies have found that fat accumulated in internal organs, such as the liver and heart, is more harmful, while fat accumulated in the waist is more harmful than fat accumulated in the buttocks and legs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are racial differences in BMI. BMI is a standard based on measurements of white people and does not apply to other races. Asians with a lower BMI are at greater risk for diseases such as heart disease than white people, possibly due to differences in body fat percentage and distribution in different parts of the body. Therefore, the World Health Organization recommends that Asians use a lower BMI to measure overweight and obesity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to some drawbacks of the BMI index, the current obesity standards based on the BMI index may overestimate the global obesity situation. On August 17, 2023, the journal &quot;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&quot; published an article titled &quot;Prevalence of Obesity and Related Complications in China: A Cross-Sectional Real-World Study of 15.8 Million Adults&quot;, depicting the obesity map of China. , among the 15.8 million adult subjects, 34.8% were overweight and 14.1% were obese. In addition, the &quot;2023 World Obesity Atlas&quot; released by the World Obesity Federation draws an obesity map for the world, predicting that 400 million people will be overweight or obese in the next 12 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, both articles use BMI as a measure of obesity to estimate the number of obese people. Obviously, such a judgment may not be accurate. Moreover, some people have long expressed different opinions on using BMI to measure obesity, and have proposed supplementary and improved standards, which can measure body fat rate and use this together with BMI to measure obesity. However, because measuring body fat percentage is cumbersome, it has not been widely promoted and applied so far. It is relatively simple to use BMI. At the same time, some people simply judge whether they are obese based on their appearance, so losing weight on their own may have some consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest consequences is the widespread use and abuse of weight-loss drugs, which has brought about a series of problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, new weight loss drugs have been launched one after another, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), semaglutide and tirzepatide. Some have produced good results, with significant weight loss, some can reduce body weight by 21%, and semaglutide has also been shown to reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular problems. However, this type of drug was not originally developed to lose weight, but to treat diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latest generation of anti-obesity drugs mimic a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is involved in appetite regulation. Since then, semaglutide, which is similar to GLP-1, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 (trade name Ozempic) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and was later approved for the treatment of obesity in 2021 disease (trade name: Wegovy). Since then, the FDA approved the sale of tisiparatide (trade name Mounjaro) in 2022 for the treatment of diabetes, but it was also later used to treat obesity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the increasing number of adverse effects has begun to raise concerns about the side effects of these obesity drugs on people. The main hazards now identified are gastrointestinal problems and loss of muscle mass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada published an article online in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (JAMA) on October 5, 2023, pointing out that drugs currently used to treat obesity have great potential. harmfulness. Researchers surveyed a large health insurance database of obese patients. 4,144 people took liraglutide (also a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity), 613 654 people took semaglutide and 654 people took bupropion-naltrexone (another weight loss drug). The incidence of biliary tract disease (per 1,000 person-years) was 11.7 for semaglutide, 18.6 for liraglutide, and 12.6 for bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence rates of inflammation were 4.6, 7.9 and 1.0 people respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conclusion was that taking glucagon-like peptide-1 was associated with a lower risk of pancreatitis, intestinal obstruction, and gastroparesis (gastroparesis is a Conditions that slow or prevent the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines are associated with an increased risk, but not biliary tract disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previous clinical trials have shown a link between GLP-1 drugs and gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, constipation and rare cases of pancreatitis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For tilsiparatide, the more obvious side effect is muscle loss, leading to muscle weakness. But this situation still requires long-term monitoring and research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 23:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[个人信息泄露是电诈产业链一环：了解套路，提高警惕丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259685]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens reported that they received fraudulent calls after searching for flight information and booking tickets on a map app. In the name of the airline&#39;s customer service, the other party claimed that the flight was canceled due to mechanical failure and asked him to provide his Alipay account for compensation. The caller can report the netizen&#39;s name, phone number, ID number, flight information, etc. Netizens believe that their personal information has been leaked and used for telecommunications fraud, and hope that relevant departments will investigate strictly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, the Civil Aviation Administration of China responded that it is preparing relevant documents to further strengthen the protection of important data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flight cancellation compensation&quot; has recently become a popular means of telecommunications fraud, with some passengers losing even more than 2 million yuan. Fraudsters can accurately report the passenger&#39;s name, ID number, and flight information, which undoubtedly means that the information related to the ticket purchased has been leaked. However, the ticket booking process is cumbersome and involves many parties. Online travel platforms, airlines, ticket agents, as well as intermediaries and terminal systems such as TravelSky and operators, there is a risk of data leakage in any link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of fraud has become a popular electronic fraud method recently, and passengers can receive fraudulent calls soon after booking a ticket, which shows that the leakage of passenger flight information has become large-scale. Leaking passenger flight information is not only an illegal and criminal act in itself, but also provides a target for electronic fraud crimes. It is the upstream of the black industry chain of telecommunications fraud. Timely crackdown on flight information leakage is of great significance to cutting off the upstream of the industry chain and reducing telecommunications fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people think of telecom fraud, the first thing that often comes to mind is fraud crimes such as &quot;pig killing&quot;, &quot;online gambling&quot;, and &quot;rebate fraud&quot;, as well as popular news such as the proliferation of telecom fraud parks in northern Myanmar. Especially after thousands of people involved in fraud in northern Myanmar were recently handed over to the Chinese police, many people thought that the electronic fraudsters had been caught in one fell swoop, and that electronic fraud would be greatly reduced in the future. But this is a misunderstanding, or just a good wish. Telecom fraud has become a huge industry, not only overseas, but also within China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The telecommunications frauds people see are actually just one part of this huge criminal industry chain, and upstream and downstream there are also illegal crimes such as theft of personal information and money laundering. Fraud groups also have data processing departments. After collecting huge amounts of personal information, they analyze and process it to find &quot;high-value&quot; targets. They use different fraud scripts for different fraud targets, and finally execute the script to make you fall for the scam. . The source of all this is personal information. The more detailed and specific the information, the easier it is to apply personalized scripts to conduct &quot;precise fraud.&quot; The script for flight cancellation compensation is this kind of precise fraud, which takes advantage of passengers&#39; anxiety about flight cancellations and blocked itineraries, and the fraud has a higher success rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, the possibility of information leakage is almost everywhere. The flight information leak mentioned above is just one of them. Large-ticket consumption areas such as buying houses and cars are also the hardest hit areas for information leakage. After many people buy a house, they will receive sales calls for decoration, furniture and appliances, etc. After buying a car, they will receive sales calls for insurance, car products, etc. It&#39;s just for sales, so it&#39;s not bad, but since this personal information can be sold to people who sell furniture, home appliances, and insurance, of course it can also be sold to telecom fraudsters, and this information containing real estate and vehicle-related content can easily be used. Carry out &quot;precision fraud&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, a more serious information leak may be a large-scale data leak of some websites. The popularization of Internet applications, while bringing great convenience, has also sharply increased the risk of personal information leakage. Whether it&#39;s sending express delivery, ordering takeout, taking online ride-hailing, or registering as a member, each platform has a massive amount of users&#39; personal information. Once these platforms fail to provide adequate security protection and are breached by hackers, a large amount of user information may be leaked. Previously, a user data leak occurred on a certain short video platform, with the total amount of information reaching 2 billion. After this information is leaked, it will exist permanently on the dark web, cannot be eliminated, and is constantly being sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Personal Information Protection Law has very specific provisions on preventing the leakage of personal information. Major websites should strictly abide by the &quot;minimum enough&quot; principle and only collect and store necessary user personal information to reduce the damage caused to users by possible information leakage. After all, no matter how you protect it, it is difficult to guarantee that it will be foolproof and never leak. Even if safety is technically guaranteed, there may still be situations where it is difficult to prevent house thieves. The police have uncovered more than one case in which telecom company employees provided user phone numbers and other information to fraud groups, and even provided phone lines to fraud groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The criminal law clearly stipulates that selling or providing citizens’ personal information to others, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes a crime. According to relevant judicial interpretations, selling or providing whereabouts information is used by others to commit crimes, or knowing that others are using citizens&#39; personal information to commit crimes and still selling or providing personal information to them are considered &quot;serious circumstances.&quot; Therefore, if passenger flight information is leaked, no matter where it occurs, it is suspected of a crime, and the police should open a case for investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public should also increase their awareness of personal information protection and try not to provide personal information on the Internet. In particular, they should not be greedy for petty gains and provide personal information to unknown websites, and should not scan unknown QR codes casually. Secondly, we must improve our awareness and ability to prevent e-mail fraud. It is necessary to learn more about telecommunications fraud routines, be more vigilant against common fraud scripts such as online gambling and bill fraud, and verify information such as flight delays and refunds through official websites, social accounts, customer service telephone numbers, etc. Telecommunications fraud is difficult to guard against, and the routines are updated very quickly. Even if you encounter a scam script that is enough to disturb your mind, such as &quot;family members are in hospital&quot;, you must increase your concentration, don&#39;t be gullible, and try to contact your family members first. Many people&#39;s personal information may have been circulated on the dark web. It may be difficult to avoid telecom fraud in the future.

The large-scale amusement facility safety accident that occurred at the Happy Valley Tourism Company in Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town caused many injuries and exposed problems such as insufficient implementation of safety subject responsibilities, poor safety management, ineffective risk prevention and control, and inaccurate reporting of accident information, resulting in adverse social impacts. The lesson is extremely profound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview requested that OCT Group Co., Ltd. urge Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company to do its best to treat the injured, cooperate with the accident investigation, learn lessons from the accident, and fully implement the company&#39;s main responsibility for safety. It is necessary to draw inferences from one example and carry out comprehensive hidden danger inspections and rectifications in subordinate amusement parks, effectively strengthen the safety management of special equipment such as large-scale amusement facilities, resolutely prevent major accidents, keep the bottom line of special equipment safety, and ensure the safety of people&#39;s lives and property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant personnel from Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipal Market Supervision Bureau attended the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[他们眼中的吴尊友：“疫”线三载，抗“艾”一生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259691]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/31/7438acad8d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 31/7438acad8d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256289&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Wu Zunyou’s work did not decrease significantly. Just because of chemotherapy and surgery, the office location was changed from the new site of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Changping, Beijing, to the old office building near the Temple of Heaven.

Some netizens even put together a group picture of his photogenic scenes - from 2020 to 2022, he gradually lost weight, &quot;like green silk in the morning and snow in the evening.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people have much whiter hair than me. I just feel my work experience through media publicity.&quot; At the beginning of 2023, on CCTV News In the interview, he responded, &quot;Many people have paid more than me. They are working on the front line, and some have paid with their lives, so my investment is really nothing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He did pay the price with his life. At 12:56 on October 27, 2023, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and former director of the Center for STD and AIDS Prevention and Control, who had long worked on the front line of public health, died of illness in Beijing at the age of 60. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is less known is that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago. &quot;When we learned that Teacher Wu was ill, the first thing he said was that he was too tired.&quot; In Guo Wei&#39;s impression, Wu Zunyou rested for less than four hours a day. &quot;We sent him an email at two o&#39;clock in the morning, and at four o&#39;clock I received a reply.&quot; Guo Wei was a student of Wu Zunyou. He later worked at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and became colleagues with Wu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;People who know Wu Zunyou well recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that although Wu was not tall, he was very energetic and always had a slight smile on his lips when he spoke. He usually likes sports, and a pair of running shoes is a frequent item in his luggage. When he travels on business, he always gets up early for a morning run. He also loves badminton. Wu Chang jokes that his right arm is stronger than his left arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the National Two Sessions in 2023, he also prepared a proposal on strengthening the training of public health talents as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference: &quot;We must train more Experts in the field of public health...should have successors in the field of infectious disease prevention and control, so cultivating talents and having a strong team is very important for the future of China&#39;s public health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Requirements for makeup &quot;Block the haggard face&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Wei discovered that the teacher had changed. In December 2021, Wu Zunyou was awarded the &quot;Most Beautiful Technology Worker&quot; &quot;——Wu Zunyou on TV is much thinner than before. &quot;I asked him how much you weigh now, and he said it&#39;s only eighty pounds.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the operation, Wu Zunyou recovered well at first. His weight gradually increased from 80 kilograms to 90 kilograms, and his physical strength slowly recovered. However, a review a few months later found that Cancer lesions also appeared in other organs. Pancreatic cancer is known as the &quot;king of cancers&quot;, with a five-year survival rate of less than one-tenth. Wu Zunyou, a medical student, knows very well what kind of disease pancreatic cancer is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, Guo Wei went to Wu Zunyou’s home to pick him up to record a video for World AIDS Day on December 1, and found that his “hair was all white, and his clothes were He&#39;s going to be a whole lot bigger.&quot; When putting on makeup, he specifically asked to &quot;block the haggard face.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His voice is completely different from before. It has no power at all. During the filming of the video, it took a lot of effort to speak out. He told Guo Wei that he did not dare to take off his clothes casually because he was too weak and he might catch a cold quickly if he took off his clothes. He had to hide away from air conditioners and fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, his work did not decrease significantly. He only changed his office location from the new site of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Changping, Beijing, due to chemotherapy and surgery. An old office building near the Temple of Heaven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The website of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that on February 27, 2023, Wu Zunyou also attended a high-level expert seminar on the prevention and treatment of AIDS and hepatitis C. His last Weibo Stay at 21:22 on April 2, 2023, and advocate &quot;scientific wearing of masks&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Wei recalled that on May 28, 2023, Wu Zunyou and some relevant leaders and experts met at the Oriental Hotel in Beijing to discuss the methadone maintenance treatment plan. Later Guo Wei realized When I arrived, the Oriental Hotel was near the Friendship Hospital where Wu Zunyou was hospitalized and the old CDC office, making it convenient for him to rush from the hospital to meetings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fighting AIDS under pressure&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If the epidemic made the public aware of Wu Zunyou, the public health system knew about Wu Zunyou from AIDS prevention and treatment began. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 1994, the plasma of a 41-year-old woman in Anhui was tested positive for HIV. However, she lived in a remote rural area with little contact with the outside world and denied it. There is a history of drug abuse, extramarital sexual relations, etc., which almost cuts off all channels of transmission. When he was at a loss, the Anhui Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention called Wu Zunyou, who was studying for a PhD in epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wu Zunyou&#39;s research, a new route of AIDS transmission has surfaced - this woman often sells plasma, and 40% of samples from the local plasma bank are HIV positive , and the equipment is not disinfected, leaving a lot of opportunities for infection. His discovery prevented many people from contracting AIDS through apheresis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Zunyou’s research direction as a mentor at UCLA is the prevention and treatment of AIDS. After returning to China after graduating with a Ph.D. in 1995, he joined the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;now the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span>;) and became the then academic director of the Academy of Preventive Medicine. He is a postdoctoral fellow of Zeng Yi, the president and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on behavioral intervention for HIV/AIDS. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;As for the epidemiology of AIDS, many people in China are already doing it, and they are doing it very well. And the prevention of the spread of AIDS for high-risk groups is Almost no one cares about behavioral intervention work.&quot; Wu Zunyou later explained his choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, most of the people at high risk of AIDS were hidden special groups, such as blood sellers, sex workers, drug addicts, etc. Intervention services were provided for special groups. , reducing their risky behaviors was beyond the acceptance of the general public at the time. &quot;I also faced a certain amount of pressure to deal with this difficult bone.&quot; Wu Zunyou once said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On a trip to Yunnan to investigate the spread of AIDS among female sex workers, Wu Zunyou hoped that the local epidemic prevention stationmaster would take them to the &quot;red light district.&quot; Wu Zunyou and his party visited hair salons one by one. &quot;A &#39;lady&#39; from the hair salon slammed the door and left after learning our true purpose.&quot; Later, they found another one and talked for 45 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At a seminar held on the beach in Beihai, Guangxi, Wu Zunyou and the organizers of the meeting gave each of the AIDS prevention and control personnel in each province 50 yuan to spend money Talk to the sex worker on the beach. &quot;They found it incredible that the conference organizers actually wanted to push them into the arms of sex workers. China has never had such training.&quot; Wu Zunyou later recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, these surveys have become the basis for distributing free condoms, promoting the correct use of condoms, providing clinic consultation services, and formulating AIDS intervention methods that are consistent with national conditions. They have also been It has been incorporated into the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations and the Five-Year Action Plan for AIDS Control as a national strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another contribution of Wu Zunyou is the promotion of methadone maintenance therapy among drug addicts to control the AIDS epidemic. &quot;During this period, the health department had to deal with a lot of work with the public security and judicial departments, including national plans, drug collection, policy revision, on-site pilots and experimental work, all carried out by him and a small number of people.&quot; Guo Wei recalled. As of the end of 2015, there were 785 methadone clinics operating across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This approach has been recognized by the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, which has promoted it globally as a model for AIDS prevention and treatment. In 2022, the World Health Organization awarded Wu Zunyou the Mandela Health Promotion Award. The award citation stated: &quot;He is a pioneer in designing, piloting and expanding service promotion programs among sex workers. He established China&#39;s first needle exchange project and the first large-scale opioid substitution treatment program.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10 /31/45bc2dbd3e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/45bc2dbd3e.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;256290&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 1, 2021, an AIDS prevention and treatment propaganda was posted at a bus station in Fengtai District, Beijing advertise.

He often interacts with netizens and responds to requests for help and questions. On June 4, 2014, he said, &quot;Yesterday, a netizen in Fuzhou reported that the first month of AIDS treatment in Fuzhou requires self-pay. Today I arranged for colleagues to contact the local area.&quot; Faced with a netizen&#39;s criticism of AIDS prevention propaganda, he responded modestly: &quot;Your criticism is true. AIDS propaganda and education need to be strengthened and more targeted. Many people will say this, but almost no one knows how to do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He and I met at a meeting, and he knew all about Beijing&#39;s AIDS organizations in advance.&quot; Kong Lingkun still remembers the scene when they met more than ten years ago. . Kong Lingkun is the chairman of the Beijing Charity Without Borders Charity Foundation and has been committed to eliminating discrimination and supporting AIDS patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Kong Lingkun’s recollection, in 2015, the Beijing Charity Without Borders Charity Foundation settled in the Fifth Medical Center of the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital and set up a charity clinic. Wu Zunyou even made a special trip to the center Visit social workers and patients, and pay attention to the testing work of key groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For disease control personnel, the better you do your job, the less you can see your results. In clinical terms, the more patients you treat, the less likely they are to see your results. The more we do, the greater the sense of accomplishment. But if you look at us (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;CDC staff&lt;/span>;), when we do a better job, the patients The fewer there are; the fewer patients you have, the less you will be seen by society and invisible (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;invisible&lt;/span>;).&quot; 2022 In 2016, Wu Zunyou said this in an interview with &quot;Chinese Philanthropist&quot; magazine&#39;s Person of the Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s hard to say what his greatest contribution is. As long as it talks about all aspects and every field of AIDS in China, he has left a mark.&quot; Now at the United Nations Guo Wei, a strategic information consultant at the UNAIDS Representative Office in China, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the COVID-19 epidemic, Wu Zunyou posted on Weibo more frequently and with more words. Southern Weekend reporters found that since 2022, he has posted 23 original Weibo posts, covering the new crown, monkeypox, influenza epidemics, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The increase in exposure has also led to more controversy. In January 2022, Omicron virus first appeared in China and spread locally. Wu Zunyou said that Omicron virus is &quot;taking all&quot; and the vaccine has a very limited effect in preventing Omicron virus. People can be infected regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. . His remarks brought him controversy. On January 30, he apologized on Weibo for &quot;not fully telling the truth&quot;, emphasizing that &quot;although there have been a certain number of breakthrough cases among vaccine recipients, many people have been prevented from getting infected.&quot; Eleven months later, on December 7, he revised his view on Weibo: &quot;The new crown vaccine has a certain effect in preventing infection, and its effect is more significant in reducing the incidence of severe illness and reducing deaths.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Faced with doubts, in an interview with CCTV News in March 2023, he said, &quot;As a professional, sometimes you have to have the courage or courage to make such a decision. , such research and judgment can inform the people of the correct information in a timely manner.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/31/5c6b301bff.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/5c6b301bff. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In July 2012, Wu Zunyou posted his first Weibo post.

Guo Wei recalled that during his Ph.D. study, he needed to “negate and then deny” all the time - Wu Zunyou asked his students that papers can only be accepted if the conclusion cannot be denied. “Everyone who works with him can feel that he is right.” The job is very demanding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is related to Wu&#39;s study when he was young. While studying for a doctoral degree in epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), his thesis strived to simplify the complex and find the most effective data in the complex data. He used the simplest method to draw clear conclusions. A conclusion that can withstand scrutiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the eyes of students, Wu is sometimes rigorous to the point of harshness. &quot;Every punctuation point in the documents we sent to Teacher Wu must be considered, and he would never allow flaws to appear.&quot; Guo Wei recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In her acknowledgments for her thesis, Wu Peili, a master&#39;s student at Anhui Medical University, described Wu Zunyou this way: &quot;He always keeps the students&#39; affairs in mind, and never fails to study. He will personally guide you through topic selection, topic development, on-site investigation, data analysis, and article revision, and he will even go as far as to help you change the format of your references.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;This rigor also extends to epidemic prevention and control. Starting in 2020, Wu Zunyou rushed to many places to conduct epidemic investigations. According to statistics from the State Council website, Southern Weekend reporters have attended 25 press conferences since 2020, the last one on February 9, 2023. Wu Zunyou is responsible for the joint prevention and control data team. After 12 o&#39;clock every night, the data from each province are reported and compiled into a report, which is then submitted to Wu Zunyou for review and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2020, during the epidemic in Xinfadi, Beijing, Wu Zunyou led multiple teams to conduct on-site investigations, and Guo Wei also participated. &quot;Which batch of goods and where they are placed, he always finds clues through these particularly small contents. This is the accumulation of long-term epidemiology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, although Wu Zunyou&#39;s spirit was as good as before, the signs of the disease had begun to appear. He felt stomach pain and often had a bad appetite. It was not until February 2021 that I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Southern Weekend reporters discovered that from January 11 to February 4, 2021, he also went to Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province to carry out work on the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, Wu Zunyou came to the office of the United Nations Program on AIDS in China and brought his book &quot;HIV/AIDS in China&quot; ：Beyond the Numbers》. The book concludes by writing that HIV has taught China many lessons over the past 30 years, but as long as it responds to HIV in a pragmatic and flexible manner, works together to limit the number of new infections and improve the well-being of AIDS patients, China will continue to be in a We are well positioned to face the next decade with confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Part of the content refers to the following books:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; &quot;>;&quot;HIV/AIDS in China: Beyond the Numbers&quot; Wu Zunyou/Editor, People&#39;s Medical Publishing House&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&quot;China&#39;s road to fighting AIDS: Says from those who have experienced it&quot; 》Zhang Wenkang/Author, People&#39;s Medical Publishing House&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲突中的文学家，是不是妇人之仁？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259657]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/31/4DiV8CP08EvSVrGViGjFEJqtNSR6F4Ha5aSyjAJI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;905&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/4DiV8CP08EvSVrGViGjFEJqtNSR6F4Ha5 aSyjAJI. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Colen McCain and his novel &quot;The Promise&quot; (translated by Fang Berlin , People&#39;s Literature Publishing House, 2021). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Colen McCain&#39;s novel &quot;Apeirogon&quot; is set against the backdrop of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . The narrative method of the story is novel, unique and groundbreaking, and the author had high hopes for it. The winner of the National Book Award in the United States was also invited to give lectures all over the world. However, due to the epidemic, all these conferences were cancelled, and the book did not become as popular as expected. The rights to adapt this book were bought by the great director Spielberg, but there has been no movement so far. I wonder if these directors buying the adaptation rights are like real estate developers buying land, hoping to increase the value of the film. Sometimes when the market is not going well, I will be choked to death by covering myself up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this time the renewed war between Palestine and Israel has drawn attention to this book again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of McCain&#39;s novels combine fiction and non-fiction, and the combination of fiction and reality is effective. Sometimes he uses a real historical time and person as the main line, and the beads on it are fictitious. Sometimes the beads are real and the main line is fictitious; sometimes the main line and the beads are real and the color of the beads is fictitious. He is sometimes real and sometimes weak, and he is just playing with a heartbeat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the novel &quot;The Promise&quot;, the Israeli girl Smadar is killed by a Palestinian terrorist suicide bomb. Abel, a Palestinian girl, was hit in the back of the head by a rubber bullet fired by an 18-year-old Israeli soldier. These two events were ten years apart and both are true. Abir&#39;s father, Bassam, was a Fatah fighter who spent many years in an Israeli prison for attacking Israel with grenades. Smadar&#39;s father, Rami, is an Israeli graphic designer. The two fathers, who had lost their daughters in different ways, eventually came together through the Circle of Lost Parents to tell stories, preach peace and dialogue, and use stories as a means of healing. The magical thing is that before and after the novel was published, the father of the two girls also did some online activities with the author. There are not many novels in which the characters step out of the picture and join hands with the author to preach. This style is a bit sci-fi when I think about it, a bit like &quot;The Painter of Time and Space&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/YcGiCfgg7wiF4Zpm2eMIjFzG4uFP1zv9blUnWyiD.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1035&quot; height= &quot;578&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/YcGiCfgg7wiF4Zpm2eMIjFzG4uFP1zv9blUnWyiD.png&quot; data-key=&quot;256196&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A critical article written by Naftali Moshe on the blog of The Times of Israel after the publication of The Promise. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, both protagonists said that they were deeply shocked. The development of the situation is obviously contrary to their vision of pursuing peace. In the novel, McCain seems to be more sympathetic to Palestine and opposes Israel&#39;s bullying of Palestine. Naftali Moses, author of The Times of Israel, wrote that McCain ostensibly wrote about an Arab and an Israeli, but subtly expressed his dislike of Israel. The author labeled McCain an &quot;anti-Semite.&quot; He quickly attributed this anti-Semitic accusation to the &quot;Jewish original sin theory&quot;, that is, the Jews were the murderers of Jesus - this was Hitler&#39;s accusation against the Jews back then. But World War II has been over for many years. Except for the notorious Ku Klux Klan, few people dare to openly express their dissatisfaction with Israel and the United States’ Israeli policies. Otherwise, the anti-Semitic label will be firmly slapped on your head. This trend of public opinion is obviously very scary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Hamas launched brutal attacks and kidnappings, most of the world&#39;s public opinion condemned Hamas. However, gradually, when Israel shifted from &quot;legitimate defense&quot; to &quot;excessive defense&quot;, millions of Palestinians were When there was no way out, causing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster, public opinion quietly reversed. Protests broke out across the United States in response to Israel&#39;s counterattack against Palestine. Not to mention places like Northeastern Schools and California Berkeley where student activities are active, the atmosphere at the University of Texas, which has always been very hands-off and close to my home, is very tense: students sympathetic to Palestine are handing out leaflets to promote the &quot;genocide&quot; facing Gaza. &quot; and &quot;blockade&quot;, there was a fierce argument with other students, and later the situation became tense and the police were dispatched. Several student groups at Harvard University expressed dissatisfaction with Israel&#39;s actions and were doxxed by multiple employers with Jewish backgrounds, saying they were permanently banned from hiring. The &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; label is so scary, why does McCain still write about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Of course, writers have feelings. If you don’t have feelings, what kind of writer can you be? Naturally, they hope to turn swords into plowshares and solve problems with pen and ink instead of swords and guns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lami in the book once participated in the Middle East war, but later became a pacifist, especially after the death of his daughter. His wife was Netanyahu’s classmate. After his daughter died, Netanyahu wanted to visit, but she flatly refused. When reporters came for an interview, she said: &quot;The killings were not the bomb&#39;s fault. The bomb was also a victim. Israel is guilty. It has blood on its hands. She is not immune to this. Everyone is complicit. Oppression. Tyranny. . Arrogant.&quot; The Israeli Ministry of Defense sent a glass bowl to the couple, with the name of their dead daughter engraved on it. The couple did not give Netanyahu any face, and felt that this was not a &quot;sorrow&quot; but a &quot;honor&quot;. Hammered the bowl to pieces, &quot;wrote a note and sent it to Netanyahu: Dear Bibi (Editor&#39;s note: Netanyahu&#39;s nickname), something is broken.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And in Bassam, who was on the other side of the conversation, also got out of his past thinking. He tried his best to study in England and studied the history of the Jewish Holocaust. After that, he also became a pacifist. It is not easy to take this step. His daughter could have been saved after being hit in the head by a rubber bullet. Unfortunately, due to the queues and long wait at the sentry post on the way to the hospital, Abir missed the opportunity for rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/ZJxXmoLBeGvgQGleVy40XRCPVY1NvB4P4SuvZH5p.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;914&quot; height= &quot;514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/ZJxXmoLBeGvgQGleVy40XRCPVY1NvB4P4SuvZH5p.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256195&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the American TV series &quot;Billions&quot;, the actor and financial tycoon Bobby Axelrod is shown eating a banquet dinner. It is customary to cover your head with a towel. Some people say that this can ensure that the aroma does not escape. Others say that it is because the scene of spitting out bones is indecent, so it is necessary to cover up. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has accumulated thousands of years of retribution and is an endless cycle of oppression, resistance, and counterattack. . McCain cannot be said to be partial to Palestine. He was also wondering what was going on in this place. He has an overall reflection on human cruelty, which is not only cruel to each other, but also to the natural world. The book writes about the feast of buntings that Mitterrand ate before his death: &quot;The little birds will be fed for two weeks until they are about to burst. Then the chef picks up their feet and immerses them in a large vat of pure water. Boiled with Armagnac, soaked from scratch and left to drown. Next, the chef dehairs them, sprinkles them with salt and pepper and cooks them in their own fat for seven minutes before tossing them in just In the heated white stew pot.&quot; Finally, Mitterrand covered his head with a scarf and chewed the bird until the bones made a crisp sound. After reading this description, do you still have such high regard for &quot;French cuisine&quot;? Why write about Mitterrand eating birds? Later in the book, he writes: &quot;During François Mitterrand&#39;s tenure, France sold thousands of Milan missiles to Syria. They then entered the black market and were bought by Hezbollah guerrillas. .&quot; This kind of cruelty to birds is easily transferred to humans. After all, there is a terrible darkness in human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Birds are constantly written about in the book. &quot;Hoopoe, thrush, flycatcher, warbler, cuckoo, myna, warbler, shrike, sandpiper, boreal, plover, sunbird, swift, sparrow, nightjar, owl, gull, hawk, eagle , kite, crane, vulture, sandpiper, pelican, flamingo, stork, white-spotted blackbird, Eurasian vulture, blue-breasted Buddha, &lt;span>;Arabian thrush&lt;/span>;, bee-eater, turtle dove, white-throated, Yellow Wagtail, Black-capped Warbler, Red-throated Pipit, Lesser Reed Pipit.&quot; Why? Birds can migrate and are free. Israel and Palestine, on the other hand, are intertwined and difficult to access. “Area A is patrolled by multiple Palestinian security forces, but Israeli troops can march in at any time. Area B is under Palestinian civil jurisdiction, and Israel controls its security with the cooperation of the Palestinian security authority police. Palestinian security forces can only operate with Israel’s permission. … In addition, the H1 and H2 districts of the West Bank city of Hebron, 80% administered by the Palestinian Authority and 20% controlled by Israel, include so-called sterile streets open only to Israelis and those holding international passports .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the map, this area is so intricate that it looks like an improperly used, overly fragmented hard drive. The large and small sentry posts and high walls have turned the Gaza Strip into an open-air prison. It&#39;s also like being blocked all year round, with soldiers armed with live ammunition always blocking intersections, making it difficult to go out and look for opportunities to make a living. This kind of &quot;you in me&quot;, &quot;I in you&quot; situation, even if mother-in-law, daughter-in-law and brother are usually together, they can&#39;t deal with each other, not to mention the constant new and old hatreds between the two parties? The Israelis are still bulldozing their homes, shooting into their water tanks, and breaking the bones of children who throw stones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s social public opinion is very black and white. Many relatives and friends have conflicts because of whether they support Israel or Pakistan. In fact, have you ever considered that these divisions have entangled the two sides? Dividing it into so many areas, setting up sentries, and adopting different management methods seems very smart, but the human brain cannot handle such complexity. In the past, two sects were at loggerheads in India, but things got better after the partition of India and Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I admire McCain&#39;s moral courage, the courage to write about such a complex subject, and the courage to face the most difficult conflicts of mankind. Cangjie created characters, and ghosts and gods cried at night. There are a lot of troubles caused by words: Rushdie was sentenced to death in Iran and was recently stabbed blind in one eye. If you write about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will easily be labeled as anti-Semitic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On such a complex issue as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, there are now countless discussions from macro perspectives such as politics, religion, and geography. But don’t forget that for the Israelis and Palestinians involved, this is not just a national matter, but a family matter and a matter around us. The conflict is concrete rather than abstract, a man&#39;s child was killed by a bomb, a man&#39;s child was beaten to death by a guard. Such individual matters and family matters are so entangled and involve other backgrounds of history, culture, and war that it is difficult to write in one line and two lines. McCain then wrote 1,001 long and short chapters, just like &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, like a diary and a puzzle, making different themes and multiple narratives echo and set off each other. It seems to be a show of skill, but in fact it is a last resort to provide a literary treatment of this complicated situation. Writing this way also allows us readers to deeply understand the complexity of the Palestinian-Israeli issue from multiple dimensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But novels often describe problems. Where are the answers? McCain repeatedly mentioned the term &quot;extreme empathy&quot; and hoped that both parties in the conflict would understand each other&#39;s thoughts and stories. He believes that dialogue can solve problems. At the beginning of the novel, there is a sticker on the left front of the motorcycle that the Israeli Rami rides, which reads: &quot;If we don&#39;t start a dialogue, this will not end.&quot; So these two suffering fathers join hands to travel to various places to preach peace with sincerity. So can the kind of dialogue advocated by McCain really solve the problem, or is it just the wishful thinking of a litterateur and the benevolence of a woman? I don&#39;t know where the answer lies. What do you think? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[随国，从编钟出发]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Big Tomb&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Soft light spreads over, falling in men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man&#39;s face was slightly raised, and under his thick black eyebrows, his small eyes were deep and lively. The bridge of the nose is straight, the lips are pressed tightly, with a faint smile. The man&#39;s expression was three parts confident, three parts complacent, and four parts complacent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man stands in a corner of the Suizhou Museum, a bronze statue. The text under the statue states that it was reconstructed based on the skull of the tomb owner by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Ancient Anthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In other words, it is highly similar to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The remains of the tomb owner have been sleeping on a small hill only a few hundred meters away from the Suizhou Museum since they were buried in the loess more than 2,000 years ago. I walked out of the museum and walked for 5 minutes along a quiet road behind the museum. I turned a corner in front of a unit called Ouyang Xiu Kindergarten, crossed a stone bridge, and entered the Leigudun Archaeological Site Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The green forest directly in front of the park is the lush city that men have dreamed of for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man’s name is Ji Yi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Ji Yi&#39;s name is not well known, then his other title is famous: Zeng Hou Yi. Zeng Hou is the king of Zeng State. Yi is his name. As for why it was asserted that his surname was Ji, there was a tortuous process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/Z6uN2lbCzmre7fP9VjTeOY6HJKemMDswziE55oxF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;619&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/Z6uN2lbCzmre7fP9VjTeOY6HJKemMDswziE55oxF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256120&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Statue of Zeng Houyi in Suizhou Museum&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, beating drums A huge park has been built at the Dun site. According to the scenic spot information, its &quot;protection scope and construction control zone reaches 12 square kilometers.&quot; Around the park and outside the Suizhou Museum, there are also some residential buildings scattered here and there. However, judging from old photos, more than 40 years ago in the 1970s, there were still lush rice fields here. In the middle of the crop fields, there stood two isolated houses, which belonged to a radar repair station of the Air Force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, archaeological discoveries are like a saying: When a mouse pulls a shovel, the big head is behind. For example, the Terracotta Warriors and Horses of Qin Shihuang and the Leigudun ruins were discovered due to the expansion of the radar repair shop&#39;s workshop. During the construction process, the workers discovered that there was some white plaster mud and a piece of artificially paved stone slab under the loess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said with certainty that although archaeologists have confirmed that there is a large ancient tomb under the wilderness, they were still deeply shocked when the details of the ancient tomb were revealed. I found an aerial panorama taken during the excavation. In the black and white photo, a large pit was dug out of the gray earth, showing that the tomb entrance was composed of three rectangles. Comparing the crowds around the pit as dense as ants, you can see how big and deep the entrance to the tomb is. Tan Weisi, the head of the archaeological team at that time, recalled, &quot;The entrance to the tomb is in the shape of an irregular polygon, with the widest point from east to west being 21 meters, and the widest point from north to south being 16.5 square meters, with a total area of ​​more than 200 square meters.&quot; As for the coffin that gradually revealed the true face of Lushan Mountain in the pit, It is 6 times larger than the Mawangdui Tomb and 8 times larger than the Wangshan No. 1 Chu Tomb where the sword of Yue King Goujian was unearthed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a conspicuous place in the exhibition hall of Hubei Provincial Museum, on the thick red carpet, two copper-wood structure brackets, one long and one short, are arranged in an L shape. One of them is more than 7 meters long, and the other is 3 meters long. Many, the height is more than 2.5 meters. On the top of the bracket, there are 64 chimes hanging in 8 groups on 3 levels. The total weight of the bronze chimes weighs 5,000 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This set of chimes, which can be called the treasure of the town hall, comes from Leigudun. Its owner is none other than Zeng Houyi. According to custom, it is named Zenghou Yi Chime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the shape, chime bells are divided into button bells, Yong bells and tungsten bells. The bell is the largest, placed on the lower floor, and its sound is rich and distant; the Yong bell is the second, placed on the middle floor, and its sound is mellow and beautiful; the button bell is the smallest, placed on the upper floor, and its sound is clear and melodious. What is amazing is that each bell can strike two different tones, which is called a double-tone bell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its reappearance in 1978, the bell of Zeng Houyi has rung three times in the past few decades. One time was when the bell was rang for the first time in the local garrison auditorium when it was unearthed. Contemporary ears were fortunate enough to listen to the pre-Qin music that traveled two thousand years. One time was the National Day in 1979, when the bells were transported to Beijing for performance. The first time was in 1997, when the bells rang in Hubei Province to welcome the return of Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/MND1ZV7ty87AJFnQDS3S5uumhlpMKKangDVsfoZQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/MND1ZV7ty87AJFnQDS3S5uumhlpMKKangDVsfoZQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256125&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The treasure of the Hubei Provincial Museum - Zenghou Yi Chime&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Compared with its own artistic value and cultural relic value, the inscriptions on the chimes may be more precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tombs in the pre-Qin period did not have tombstones and epitaphs like those in later generations. To determine who the owner of the tomb is, we can only rely on the inscriptions on the burial objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many cultural relics unearthed from the Leigudun site, including weapons such as Ge and Shu, as well as daily utensils such as bronze plates and beans, all have the word &quot;Zeng Hou Yi&quot; appearing. One of the bells has a 31-character inscription on it, which not only proves that the owner of the tomb is Zeng Hou Yi, but also provides coordinates for the general era of Zeng Hou Yi&#39;s life. These 31 characters are: The fifty and six sacrifices of the king of Kun returned from Xiyang. Xiong Zhang, the king of Chu, became the Yi Zonghou of Zenghou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general idea is that in the fifty-sixth year of King Xiong Zhang of Chu, when he learned that Zeng Houyi had passed away, he specially made this set of Zongyi and sent it to Xiyang to commemorate him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiong Zhang is King Hui of Chu. He is the only monarch of Chu who has reigned for more than 56 years. In the 56th year of King Hui of Chu, that is, 433 BC. According to the determination of the bones in the coffin, the tomb owner was approximately 42 to 45 years old when he died. Based on this, Zeng Hou Yi was born between 475 and 478 BC. If he was born in 475 BC, that year was the beginning of the Warring States Period. The life of Zeng Houyi roughly spans nearly half a century in the early Warring States period - at that time, although the wars among the princes continued, they were not as violent as the mergers and acquisitions in the middle and late Warring States periods, where they &quot;led the land and ate human flesh&quot;. As the king of a small country, he lived a stable and happy life on earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When archaeologists opened the heavy main coffin, they saw scattered skeletons and many exquisite burial objects. Yes, more than two thousand years later, Zeng Houyi&#39;s body had rotted away, and only the burial objects remained. Most of these funerary objects are jade. The ancients believed that if jade objects were inserted into the ears, nose, mouth and anus of the deceased, the deceased would become immortal. As the saying goes, &quot;If gold and jade are in the nine orifices, the deceased will be immortal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, all attempts and efforts for eternity are destined to be in vain. Not only will the corpses rot, but the names and deeds will also be forgotten. The traces of the vast majority of people’s existence on this blue planet will be wiped away by the waters of the River of Forgetfulness, as if they had never been there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/gNZDmcannHVo1VFFjEPalgPWQHvMAiBi5j4GuD7o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/gNZDmcannHVo1VFFjEPalgPWQHvMAiBi5j4GuD7o.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A corner of Leigudun ruins&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Bronze&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The discovery of the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi has once again brought to the surface a long-standing question: According to the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi and previous archaeological discoveries, in today’s Suizhou area, there were once There once existed a country called Zeng. Strangely, there is not a single word about Zeng Guo in the historical documents. What is particularly strange is that historical data show that during the same time period, there was a country called &quot;Sui&quot; in the region, but cultural relics related to &quot;Sui&quot; have never been found before. So, what is the relationship between Zeng and Sui? Some people think that Zeng Tunsui; some people think that Zeng Sui was the successor; some people think that Chu destroyed Sui and established Zeng Sui anywhere; still others think that Zeng Sui was the same country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, 35 years after the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi was excavated, another tomb group from the Spring and Autumn Period was discovered in Wenfeng Pagoda, only four or five kilometers away from the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi. There are more than 50 tombs in the tomb group, and thousands of cultural relics were unearthed, more than half of which are bronzes, and most of them have inscriptions. The words Zeng, Zeng Zi, Zeng Gongzi, Zeng Sun, Zeng Da Sima, etc. in the inscription indicate that it is a cemetery for high-level nobles of Zeng State. In addition to a batch of bronzes with the inscription &quot;Zeng&quot; unearthed from the tomb numbered M21, what is even more eye-catching is a bronze dagger. The inscription on the bronze dagger is: Follow Da Sima Xianyou on his journey of fighting. This is the first Suiguo cultural relic unearthed in many years. Moreover, the cultural relics of Sui State appeared in the tombs of nobles of Zeng State, providing important evidence that Zeng Sui was one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most direct, or the most conclusive evidence comes from the tomb numbered M1 in the Wenfeng Pagoda Tomb Group. A chime was unearthed from the tomb. The inscription on the chime records the Battle of Wu and Chu in 506 BC. After the defeat of Chu State, he recovered the country with the help of Zeng State. The inscription names the three parties involved as Wu, Chu and Zeng. When &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; recorded this incident, the three parties involved were called Wu, Chu, and Sui. It can be seen that Zeng and Sui are different names for the same country. ——It was not uncommon in the pre-Qin period for a country to have two names. For example, Wei was also called Liang because its capital was in Daliang, Han was also called Zheng because its capital was in Xinzheng, and Zhou was also called Chunyu because its capital was Chunyu. To be specific, it may also be called Sui because it is all about Sui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the origin of Zeng State, or Sui State, the answer was also obtained in the Wenfeng Pagoda Tombs - two chimes unearthed in Cemetery No. It is said, &quot;After Yu Ji&quot;, Ji is Hou Ji, the ancestor of the Zhou people. This shows that the king of Zeng State was derived from the surname Ji and was a descendant of the Zhou royal family. Therefore, Zeng Hou Yi was named Ji Yi. Another record is more detailed, and an expert interprets it as: &quot;On the auspicious day of the first month of the first lunar month, Marquis Zeng said to him: Bo Shi was superior to Yong, and he assisted the civil and military forces. He fulfilled the orders of Yin and pacified the world. The king ordered Nan Gong. Camping in Ruitu, the king is better than Huaiyi, and Jiangxia is close to him.&quot; The general idea is that Bo Shi superiorly assisted King Wen and King Wu of Zhou to overthrow the Yin Shang Dynasty and pacify the world. Later, King Wu of Zhou sent him to the south to build a city and establish a country. He was responsible for monitoring Huaiyi and defending Jiangxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is Bo Shi Shangyong? Bo Shi, also known as Bo Kuo, is Nangong Kuo. Yongtongrong, Shangyong means Shangrong, is the name of Nangong, and Bo Shi is his character. Historical records record that after Nangong Shi followed King Wu to conquer Zhou, King Wu ordered him to demolish King Zhou&#39;s deer platform and open a warehouse to store grain to help the people. According to the inscription, during the Great Enfeoffment in the early Zhou Dynasty, as a meritorious official, Nangong Shi was transferred to the south, which is today&#39;s Suizao area, to establish the Zeng Kingdom. Zeng Guo&#39;s duty was to defend against Huaiyi in the southeast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called Huaiyi are originally a branch of Dongyi. During the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, they lived in the Jianghuai area and established a number of countries, such as Liao, Liu, Shu, Shuyong and Shujiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to their roots, Huaiyi and merchants have a close blood relationship, and the Zhou people were the end of the Shang Dynasty. Therefore, in order to guard against Huaiyi and manage the south, Emperor Zhou enfeoffed many princes in today&#39;s Henan, Hubei and Anhui areas. These princes were generally located north of the Han River and were called Hanyang Zhuji, including Tang, Ying, and Xi. , E, Deng, Chiang, Cai, Shen, Sui and other countries. In the middle, there is the leading big country. It is said that &quot;the princes from the east of Han Dynasty are all big.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/SlSta4V8DgSE6wHmaQ4pe6eNraYMf1lg34RJxea5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/SlSta4V8DgSE6wHmaQ4pe6eNraYMf1lg34RJxea5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256123&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hubei Provincial Museum Zeng Hou Yi Bronze Drum Base&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;After the Huaiyi rebellion was gradually eliminated, the tasks of the concubines of Hanyang turned to guarding against the rising Chu State while maintaining the smooth flow of an important transportation line. This transportation line is the copper-tin road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Pre-Qin Dynasty was the Bronze Age. Bronze was not only the raw material for casting weapons, but also the raw material for casting ritual vessels. In the context of &quot;the major affairs of the country lie in sacrifice and military service&quot;, bronze can be said to be the foundation of a country. However, the area directly under the jurisdiction of Emperor Zhou of Guanzhong, the capital of Guanzhong, does not produce copper. The large amount of copper required can only be transported thousands of miles from the south - Daye, Hubei, and Ruichang, Jiangxi, which is only more than 100 kilometers away. A huge copper mine with extremely rich reserves. Their mining began more than 2,000 years ago and continues to the present day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copper from the south has to be transported to Guanzhong, a distance of more than 1,000 kilometers. Long transportation lines mean more risks and more uncertainties. The concubines of Hanyang, headed by Sui Guo, have the important task of ensuring the smooth flow of the copper and tin roads and ensuring that the metals mined from the south reach Haojing smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the National Museum of China, there is a bronze vessel named Zeng Boyun. The 簠 is a utensil used to serve rice during sacrifices or banquets. It is also called the 簋, the square one is called 簠 and the round one is called 簋. Zeng Boyun was used by the king of Zeng State. The inscription on it has the following sentences: &quot;... Ke Di Huai Yi, suppress Xie Fan Tang, gold road and tin travel, tools are ready for use.&quot; It means: &lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Uncle Zeng)&lt;/span>; Punished Huaiyi, stabilized the transportation hub Fantang, and restored the copper and tin channels to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first to come to the moon near the water tower is not only the boss of the Hanyang concubines, but also controls the most important Suizao Corridor on the road of copper and tin. It is easier for Sui to obtain a large amount of copper than other princes. In a sense, this small country - although it is the largest among the concubines of Hanyang, it is still a small country compared with the real big country - is the real Bronze Kingdom. A total of 6,239 pieces of various bronze vessels were unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Houyi, and together they weighed a total of 10,498.6 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/LNiEDBxEMDwAkGBduZHlMHEcVKecAt4EeE4WezfR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/LNiEDBxEMDwAkGBduZHlMHEcVKecAt4EeE4WezfR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the bronze plate of Marquis Zeng Yi of Hubei Provincial Museum&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In the Zhou Dynasty, under the background of Zhou Gong making rituals and music, bronzes not only had practical functions, but also had spiritual value, and were integrated with the rituals and music system. It is a musical instrument for formal music, a ritual vessel for hiding rituals, and a magical instrument for communication between humans and gods. Duke Zhou&#39;s thoughts of respecting virtue and protecting the people were passed down from generation to generation through materialized bronze vessels. The developed bronze culture should have had a profound impact on Sui State - unfortunately, due to the lack of historical data, we cannot learn more details. Judging from the few records about Sui Guo, a clan named Ji Liang is a representative example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 706 BC, King Wu of Chu attacked Sui and deliberately showed weakness. Sui&#39;s young division fell into the trap and asked Sui to fight with all his strength. Ji Liang reminded Sui Hou that the powerful Chu State suddenly became weak. This was &quot;tempting me, why are you so anxious?&quot; He further gave advice to Sui Hou, and the content of the advice fully reflected Ji Liang&#39;s people-oriented thinking. He said that if a small country wants to confront a big country, it depends on having the Tao; &quot;The so-called Tao means being loyal to the people and trusting in God. Loyalty means to think above the people and benefit the people; trust can also be used to wish the history a correct speech.&quot; - To have the Tao means that those in power must Be loyal to the people and gain trust from the gods. The monarch always thinks about how to benefit the people, which is loyalty; the historian who represents the monarch in sacrifice is truthful, which is faith. Sui Hou was dissatisfied. He said that when he offered sacrifices to the gods, he always chose fat and unvaried sacrifices. The millet and millet used as sacrifices were also abundant and complete, so he had enough faith in the gods. Ji Liang told him, &quot;The people are the masters of the gods. Therefore, the sage kings first became the people and then devoted themselves to the gods.&quot; The people are the foundation of the gods. Therefore, the sage kings of all ages first united the people and then devoted themselves to worshiping the gods. . Ji Liang asserted that Sui Hou thought that the sacrifices he offered to the gods were fat and unmotivated, and the millet and millet were abundant and complete. In fact, they were useless and would not receive the blessings of the gods. Only &quot;serve the three seasons, cultivate the five religions, and be close to the nine tribes&quot; - serve the three seasons, which means to let the people concentrate on farming in spring, summer, and autumn; cultivate the five religions, which means advocating father&#39;s righteousness, mother&#39;s kindness, brotherhood, and brotherhood. The social customs of friends, brothers being respectful, and sons being filial; kissing one&#39;s nine clans refers to harmonizing the relationship between relatives and making them harmonious - using these behaviors to sacrifice to the gods, the gods will bless you, the society will be harmonious, and the country will be strong. Therefore, Ji Liang unceremoniously asked his followers: &quot;If you cultivate political affairs and are close to the country of brothers, you may be able to survive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ji Liang&#39;s words made Suihou frightened and he had to accept the suggestion. After the Chu State heard about it, they had to temporarily give up the invasion plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Suihou followed Ji Liang&#39;s advice, his most favored one was actually the unnamed young master. When Ji Liang gradually fell out of favor with Sui Hou, Chu State saw hope again. King Wu of Chu personally led an army to the Chu Sui border for the second time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chu was strong and weak, so Ji Liang suggested negotiating peace with Chu. He said that if Chu is unwilling to negotiate peace, it will anger our soldiers and make the enemy&#39;s army slack. The young master was unwilling to negotiate peace. He believed that a quick attack was necessary to demonstrate Sui Guo&#39;s strength. Before the war, Ji Liang reminded the princes that the Chu people&#39;s custom is to respect the left, and the left army must be the elite of the King of Chu. When fighting, we attack the weak right army of Chu first. Once the right army is defeated, the Chu army will collapse. The young master objected that not fighting the King of Chu head-on would mean that we dare not confront him head-on, which would damage the dignity of the country. So, Sui Hou ordered to attack the Chu army&#39;s left army. As a result, Sui&#39;s army was defeated, Suihou fled, and Suihou&#39;s chariot was also captured by the Chu army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/ZPHmYjSkKJEzurgoS5Z1pmscMF07q5xTap5K3uEg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/ZPHmYjSkKJEzurgoS5Z1pmscMF07q5xTap5K3uEg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256121&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Statue of Ji Liang in Suizhou Cultural Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Attached&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A batch of 240 bamboo slips were unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi, with nearly 7,000 characters on them. According to expert interpretation, the bamboo slips are a list of the chariots, horses, and armor that were buried with Zeng Hou Yi. The list shows that after Zeng Houyi&#39;s death, the king of Chu, the prince of Chu, Ling Yin of Chu, and several princes of Chu, such as Duke Yang of Lu, Duke Yangcheng, and Lord Pingye, presented chariots and horses to him. In short, almost all the important figures in the Chu State expressed condolences for the death of Zeng Hou Yi and presented him with carriages, horses or other gifts. The names given to the King of Chu by the people of Sui in this list confirm that Sui at this time had become a vassal of Chu - only because of this, the kings and ministers of Chu were so close to Zeng Houyi and treated him with courtesy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the rise of Chu State, it has been trying to develop eastward. There are three goals in developing eastward. The first goal is to occupy the Jianghan Plain, which is suitable for farming; the second goal is to capture the copper mines in Daye; the third goal is to control the Suizao Corridor and the Nanxiang Pass, and then go north to compete for hegemony. . Of course, the three goals are step-by-step. Only by achieving the first goal can the second and third goals be achieved. No matter which goal it wants to achieve, what Chu must do is defeat its eastern neighbor Sui. Sui Guo was not only tasked by Emperor Zhou to monitor and defend Chu State, but also had a very important geographical location. &quot;It is bordered by Lian&#39;e to the north, Hanmiang to the east, and between Xiang, Ying, Shen, and An. It is actually an important place. The keys to Yiyang and Nanyang are actually used.&quot; It can be said that from the day the Chu State rose, the life-and-death war between Chu State and Sui State was destined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 800-year history of Chu State, King Xiong Tong of Chu Wu was a strong-armed figure. He stepped on the corpse of his nephew in a pool of blood and ascended to the throne by regicide. For more than half a century, King Wu of Chu focused on developing eastward and northward. Sui Guo, the eldest among the concubines in Hanyang, was the number one enemy that King Wu of Chu wanted to destroy quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In more than ten years, King Wu of Chu attacked his followers three times. In 706 BC, the Suihou listened to Ji Liang&#39;s advice, and the Chu army returned without success; in 704 BC, the Suihou listened to the advice of the young master, and the Sui army was defeated; in 690 BC, King Wu of Chu, who was over seventy years old, died of illness while attacking the Sui. journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although King Wu of Chu failed to annex Sui State as he wished, he greatly weakened Sui State&#39;s power and successively destroyed Quan State, Zhou State, Liao State, Lu State and Yan State, almost all of which occupied the fertile land. Jianghan Plain, and control the Tonglushan Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50 years later, King Chu Cheng, the grandson of King Wu of Chu, successively annexed more than a dozen small countries such as Er, Gu, Huang, Ying, Jiang, and Fang, thus realizing his grandfather&#39;s dream for many years - to control Sui. The country became a vassal of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 640 BC, Sui Guo united with a group of small countries east of the Han River to raise troops to fight against Chu. The Chu State&#39;s order Yin Dougu Yu Tu led his army to attack, and his country and allied forces were severely defeated. He was forced to enter into a city-wide alliance with the Chu State and became a vassal of the Chu State. At this time, it was already the twenty-fifth year of King Hui of Zhou Dynasty. The originally powerful Western Zhou Dynasty had to move its capital to Luoyang more than 100 years ago. The strength of Emperor Zhou was greatly reduced, and he was at most equal to a medium-sized prince. Ji, Emperor Zhou already has too much time to take care of himself. From then on, Sui Guo &quot;subjected himself to Chu and had no access to China.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After vassaling the Chu State, Sui State, although its territory was reduced, the wars with Chu State were almost extinct. Sui State survived the wave of annexation that caused a large number of princes to perish and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/uFxHxiBjqtNLcxgtCb5LCVA9YjrAYrvYBz4iwOQ3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;615&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/uFxHxiBjqtNLcxgtCb5LCVA9YjrAYrvYBz4iwOQ3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256126&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Suizhou is located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The drama of history lies in the fact that, both for Chu and Sui, the monarchs and subjects of the two countries What no one expected was that one day, Sui Guo, as a vassal, would be the final savior of the suzerain state Chu. Without Sui Guo, Chu State would probably have perished in the late Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 506 BC, the Great War between Wu and Chu broke out. King Helu of Wu personally led an army up the Huaihe River, and landed in the Huangchuan area of ​​present-day Henan Province. After being led by the troops of Cai and Tang, the Wu army moved south from the north of Chu to the Han River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu State was originally located in the eastern part of Chu State, and Chu State’s defensive focus has been in Yuzhang, which is now the Nanchang area of ​​Jiangxi Province. Unexpectedly, the Wu army avoided its main force and attacked its weak points, catching the Chu army by surprise. The two armies of Wu and Chu fought at Baiju &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Macheng, Hubei, also known as Hanchuan, Hubei)&lt;/span>;. The Wu army won five battles and five victories, and the Chu army was defeated. Ten days later, the Wu army captured Ying, the capital of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the entire Spring and Autumn Period, Wu Jun&#39;s victory over Ying was the first and only battle to capture the capital of a major country. When the news came out, the princes were shocked and couldn&#39;t help but look at Wu State, which was originally regarded as a barbarian, with admiration. The main credit for the Wu State&#39;s creation of such a miracle should be attributed to Wu Zixu and Sun Wu. Just as the &quot;Book of Han&quot; said: Helu appointed Wu Zixu and Sun Wu as generals, defeated and captured them, and became famous among the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the capital of Chu was captured by the Wu army, King Zhao of Chu fled to Sui. At this time, this small country, which was almost the only remaining one among the concubines of Hanyang, became the last hope for the survival of Chu State. Wu State sent envoys to Sui State, hoping that Suihou would hand over King Zhao of Chu, and reminded Suihou, &quot;If the descendants of Zhou are in Hanchuan, Chu will be completely destroyed.&quot; - You Hanyang concubines are all about to be annexed by Chu State. . Now, God wants to punish Chu State, why did you hide the King of Chu? If he is handed over, the land of Hanyang will belong to Sui Guo. Suihou refused. He said that Sui Guo and Chu State had an alliance for generations, and he could not hand over the King of Chu. The army of Wu State penetrated deeply and its rear was unstable. It did not want to fight with Sui State anymore, so it had to retreat. Later, there was a story about Shen Baoxu crying to the Qin court and begging for the master of Qin, so that King Zhao of Chu could be revived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of Sui&#39;s protection of King Chu Zhao, after King Chu Zhao returned to the country, the relationship between Chu and Sui began an unprecedented honeymoon period. Originally, after becoming a vassal of the Chu State, even though the Sui State was a prince originally enfeoffed by the Emperor of Zhou, it was already &quot;a private vassal of Chu, not connected with the princes, and conquered the alliance, and was disdained by others.&quot; Out of gratitude to the vassals, &quot;the people of Chu felt his virtue and made the vassals follow him.&quot; In other words, although Sui Guo was still a vassal of Chu State, Chu State allowed it to participate in international activities like a prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two pieces of sacrificial vessels from the Spring and Autumn Period collected in the Xiangyang Museum are witnesses of the friendship between Chu and Sui. In the pre-Qin period, when princes and nobles married their daughters, they usually made bronze vessels as dowries, which were called nunnery vessels. The two pieces of nurturing vessels in the Xiangyang Museum are called Zeng Hou Zuo Ji Tang Mi Ding, and the other is called Zeng Meng Mi Jian copper basin. The inscriptions on the two nunnery vessels indicate that a woman named Mi Tang and a woman named Mi Jian from Chu State were married to Sui State one after another. The surname Mi is the surname of the king of Chu State, and is the ancestor of the eighteen surnames of Jingchu. It was once widely known through the TV series &quot;Mi Yue Biography&quot;. Therefore, in the history of the relationship between Chu and Sui, there was a period of mutual intermarriage between Qin and Jin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;63 years after King Zhao of Chu came to Sui, the king of Sui, Zeng Houyi, passed away. At this time, the king of Chu was King Chu Hui, the son of King Zhao of Chu. Also out of gratitude for Sui Guo&#39;s righteous deeds, King Hui of Chu specially made ritual vessels to commemorate. In addition to King Hui of Chu, there were also a large group of Chu kings, princes, and ministers who commemorated Zeng Hou Yi. The originally unknown king of a small country unexpectedly gained honor because of his ancestor&#39;s political stance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/D58Kf2X0gt938eSSt2wEeryVCtZ4tdS5SO6aAcuY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/D58Kf2X0gt938eSSt2wEeryVCtZ4tdS5SO6aAcuY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256127&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The chimes under the night sky, the eternity left by the king of a small country unintentionally by chance. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time is the enemy of emotion. If feelings are like wine, then time is the water that keeps seeping into the wine. The longer the time goes by, the more water penetrates into the wine, and the taste of the wine becomes lighter, so that in the end it is only the taste of water without the sweetness of wine. The feelings between people are like this, and the feelings between countries are like this. Especially in the face of interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Zeng Houyi and King Hui of Chu Jiuquan knew better, they would definitely regret the choice of their descendants: Sui Guo, who was kind to the Chu State, was eventually annexed by the Chu State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no historical record of when the Chu State was destroyed and it can only be inferred indirectly through unearthed cultural relics. Several hundred meters south of the tomb of Zeng Houyi, archaeologists excavated more than 30 tombs in 1983. These tombs were named Suizhou Leigudun Tomb No. 2. Archaeologists concluded that the artifacts unearthed from the tomb &quot;not only have strong Zeng cultural characteristics, but also have typical Chu cultural elements.&quot; Therefore, it is inferred that &quot;the tombs of Zeng people after the Zeng State was about to perish or was destroyed by the Chu State.&quot; The age of these tombs is roughly late in the early Warring States Period to early in the middle Warring States Period. Therefore, the demise of Sui State should be in The middle period of the Warring States Period. Support for this can also be found in the literature. For example, when Chun Shenjun advised Qin not to attack Chu in 272 BC, he mentioned that &quot;the soil on the right side of the river&quot; was the territory of Chu. Suishui is Guangshui, and the soil on the right side of Suishui is to the west of Guangshui, which is the area under the jurisdiction of Sui State at that time. That is to say, by 272 BC at the latest, Sui State had been merged into Chu State. At this time, a century and a half had passed since the honeymoon period between Zeng Hou Yi and King Hui of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/TIe7DGLaYio4GfVpDTfq4zKoVn9Jexr648fKGk1g.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/TIe7DGLaYio4GfVpDTfq4zKoVn9Jexr648fKGk1g.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Suizhou Guangshui hilly landform&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The long history of Suizhou In history, except for a few people such as Ji Liang, most princes, nobles and even monarchs have vague faces. Even Zeng Hou Yi, who is famous for his chimes, is unknown to future generations about his life. When I inspected the tomb of Marquis Zeng Yi in Leigudun, what moved me the most was neither the chimes nor the jades, but the 21 young women whose names I will never know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides the main coffin where Zeng Houyi rests, there are 8 auxiliary coffins. Inside the coffins, there is a human skeleton, each of which is a woman between 19 and 26 years old. They may be concubines or attendants of Zeng Houyi. In the west room near the main room, there are another 13 slave coffins. Inside the coffins, there is also a human skeleton, which is a woman between 13 and 24 years old. They are both burial objects, but have different identities and titles. The former is called human sacrifice. Most of the human sacrifices are the wives, concubines and attendants of the deceased, who have a higher status, while the human sacrifices are prisoners of war or slaves. People are buried in the tomb of the deceased, with their bodies intact and with fine burial tools, so that they can continue to serve the deceased in the other world. Human sacrifices were buried in special sacrificial pits, with mostly incomplete bodies and rough burial tools, in order to sacrifice them to the gods of heaven and earth and ancestors. Of course, some people were forced to die, but there were also those who volunteered to be buried with them. As for human sacrifices, it can almost be concluded that none of them were voluntary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A king of a small country who has become a vassal still has to be buried with 21 young and fresh lives after his death. Apart from the splendid splendor of chimes and jades, I vaguely saw that long-gone era. Bloody, ignorant and barbaric. In this context, Ji Liang&#39;s statement that &quot;the husband and the people are the lords of the gods&quot;, although it is difficult for the monarchs to truly put it into practice, is still like a firefly flickering in the distance in the dark night, weak but precious. Because of this firefly, the cold history has a little bit of human warmth. &lt;p>; &quot;Yi Tomb&quot; &quot;Exploring the Origin of Suizhou Culture&quot; &quot;Research on the History of Zeng Guo and Sui Guo&quot; &quot;An Examination of the Destruction of the Chu State&quot;]&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[微信抖音等多家平台将引导“自媒体”账号对外实名丨滚动]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259677]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 18:39:31&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;October 2023 18:00 on the 31st&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;WeChat’s announcement on the display of real-name information by “self-media” accounts in the header&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to maintain good network communication order, promote the construction of a healthy and orderly cyberspace, enhance the credibility of top &quot;self-media&quot; accounts, and facilitate public supervision for the public interest.
