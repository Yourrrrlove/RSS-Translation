The emotional world of over 100 million elderly netizens lacks attention. (Visual China Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At three o&#39;clock in the morning, Ruidi had insomnia again. He sent greetings to his sister on the other side of the network, just like the &quot;good morning&quot; and &quot;good evening&quot; repeated almost every day, waiting for his sister&#39;s greetings. comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ruidi said that the encounter between him and his sister was arranged by fate. He reminded his sister to wear more clothes in the cold weather and take good care of her body. After exchanging heart-to-hearts with his sister day after day, his thoughts were &quot;a ray of sunshine&quot; and &quot;I want to turn into the moonlight in front of the window to accompany her forever.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video sent by Ruidi shows that he is a man in his thirties or forties with a gentle voice and a back that looks like Jin Dong. Recently, his parents suddenly fell ill. In order to win the prize, he decided to participate in a singing competition. Just the night before the competition, he told his dilemma:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are thresholds for participating in this competition. The popularity on the day of registration must be Only those who meet the requirements can be shortlisted... If you support your brother, can you help him increase his popularity data?... Sister, please give your brother some likes and praise for the author. 188 or 256 praises can help him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;At the end of 2020, the &quot;fake Jin Dong&quot; phenomenon surfaced. A large number of fake accounts pretending to be actor Jin Dong used short videos and live broadcasts to make money from middle-aged and elderly fans. Two years have passed, and the aftermath of the &quot;fake Jin Dong&quot; incident continues. In September 2023, &quot;Xiucai&quot;, an Internet celebrity with tens of millions of fans who specifically targets middle-aged and elderly people, was reported for tax evasion and defrauding fans, and his account was banned. In October 2023, the Shanghai Jing&#39;an District Procuratorate prosecuted eight people who committed fraud under the false identity of Jin Dong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the position of &quot;Fake Jin Dong&quot; has moved from short videos to public accounts. These accounts calling themselves &quot;Dongdi&quot; and &quot;Ruidi&quot; first used video accounts to attract traffic and induce fans to pay attention to the subscription accounts, and then continued to make up stories in the public accounts to gain fans&#39; sympathy and rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new round of emotional harvesting is more private. After adding fans to WeChat on a large scale through public accounts, the interaction is transferred to private chats or circles of friends. The emotional hollowness of over 100 million elderly people has led them to fall into the trap. Is it not just a scholar or Jin Dong? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835012371236170&quot; data-media=&quot;video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Public account &quot;Eastern Sound Accompanying&quot; &quot;The latest video released tells the story of a younger brother who encountered setbacks in a singing competition and asked his older sister for help.

I have nothing to do, sleep, watch videos, and that&#39;s it. Of course I want to see you, why do I want to see you? You miss me, and I do too. I miss you.&quot; My grandma said to a person on WeChat who had a note called &quot;The Love of My Life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru looked through his grandma’s watch list and found a large number of public accounts and video accounts with similar names - &quot;Brother Ruidong accompanies you&quot;, &quot;Brother Dong accompanies sister&quot;, &quot;Ruidi warmly accompanies me&quot;, &quot;Ruirui Always with you&quot; etc. The titles of public account articles are very long, for example, &quot;Sister, I am really anxious. If I can&#39;t even seize this opportunity, I will be sad for a long time.&quot; The accompanying picture is usually a photo of a man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the official account of &quot;Rui Dongdi Lives Together&quot;, he claimed that he would participate in the top 20 of the singing competition, and Dong Xueru&#39;s grandmother encouraged him to work hard. Then the official account sent a payment QR code with the following sentence: &quot;After my brother is done with work, he will accompany his sister to chat about daily life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking through these push notifications, you will find that this Rui Dongdi is really Very busy: one moment I have to help promote the competition, another moment I was successfully promoted, and now I am on TV. &quot;I am in a hurry. If I don&#39;t see my sister at this time, my brother&#39;s future will be gone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This handsome and caring fake brother occupies an important position in some people&#39;s lives. From the comments, you can get a glimpse of the passionate hearts of fans. They are &quot;Lotus&quot;, &quot;Caiying&quot;, &quot;Peace and happiness&quot; or &quot;Tomorrow will be better&quot;. They say, &quot;Sister knows, I know you in my life, I am the happiest sister&quot;, &quot;Thank you for caring about me&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In their minds, the brother who spoke to them could be anyone. Dong Xueru discovered that her grandma regarded the other party as her crush in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My grandma is from Sichuan and lives in Beijing with few friends. For more than ten years, a man has regularly organized square dances for two to three hundred people near her residence. This teacher Tie often wears floral clothes with English letters printed on them, dyes her blond hair, and wears a little makeup. She becomes the idol of middle-aged and elderly people and calls them &quot;sister&quot;. Later, my grandma moved and could no longer dance in the square. Instead, she took online dance classes and could only watch videos in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma firmly believed that these messages were sent by Teacher Tie, because only Teacher Tie, who was eight years younger than her, would treat her like a sibling. &quot;These (public accounts) different names are all the pseudonyms of Teacher Tie, and they are all his online names... All these articles are written for her.&quot; Dong Xueru told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma sends a lot of messages every day. &quot;I feel like I have so much to say. As long as I sit down, I will hide in the room with my mobile phone and send voice messages.&quot; Once, my younger brother sent a message saying that he came to his sister&#39;s city and saw a figure that looked like his sister. He was very disappointed to find that it was not the same. Grandma comforted, &quot;Fool, why are you disappointed? I&#39;m thinking of you too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru and his family tried to persuade him many times but to no avail, and his grandmother felt bored. They took grandma to the local public security bureau to receive Internet security education, but grandma wouldn&#39;t listen and just asked the police if they could find people online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru’s mother and uncle had no choice but to ask Teacher Tie himself for clarification. Teacher Tie denied that it was him and made it clear that he had no time for a relationship and would not like her. The family played the recording to grandma, but she decided that the children were hindering her and pushing Teacher Tie too hard. &quot;He is immature and childish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After speaking out online, Dong Xueru’s post received nearly 4,000 replies. Many netizens said that their family members have encountered similar situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A girl sent a private message to Dong Xueru, saying that her grandmother was also obsessed with such public accounts and corporate WeChat. In addition to giving rewards, she would also buy high-priced goods sold by them. When the mother found out, she deleted the accounts in anger. Soon, the grandmother added them back, accusing her daughter of blocking her pursuit of happiness. The relationship between mother and daughter is still at a stalemate. The girl said to Dong Xueru, I really don’t know what to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A large number of younger brother accounts use subscription accounts, corporate and personal WeChat and Moments to conduct false emotional exchanges with the elderly, thereby inducing rewards.

(Screenshot by Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The fake younger brother is back&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After Dong Xueru’s post attracted attention, the platform successively banned some younger brother accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kai got angry when talking about these Dongdi and Ruidi numbers. Ma Kai runs a number of emotional public accounts and has been implicated recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kai’s public account is similar to an emotional radio station. The largest account has 34 million followers. It posts a six- to seven-minute emotional chicken soup every day, “What should you do if you feel tired, etc.” Emotional words.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kai emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that his account is different from the scam account. Accounts like Dongdi and Ruidi &quot;won&#39;t tell you any emotional quotes or send you any songs, they will just kill pigs&quot;; while my own &quot;di&quot; account relies on emotional copywriting to seek rewards. There will be no false identities, false stories, or emotional deception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has been paying attention to these younger brother public accounts for a long time. They all speak in the same way and can be roughly divided into two categories: one is for younger brothers to participate in concerts and needs support from popularity; the other is for younger brothers who are sick and hospitalized and need support. Medical expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Diverting traffic from video accounts to public accounts is the beginning of harvesting. Operators leave links to public accounts in the comment area of ​​video accounts, place payment codes in articles on public accounts, or leave corporate WeChat or private accounts. WeChat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the registered entities of these public accounts are enterprises. Southern Weekend reporters found that a large number of similar accounts were registered by several department stores in Haikou, with names such as &quot;Xiu Cai Singing Department Store&quot; and &quot;Rui Rui&#39;s Department Store&quot;. According to industrial and commercial information, many department stores have different operators, but use the same mobile phone number when registering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted one of the operators Y. There are four Hainan department stores under Y&#39;s name, which are specially used to register younger brother&#39;s public accounts. WeChat stipulates that an individual business owner can register two public accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Y told Southern Weekend reporters that his team of three people has registered a total of 12 individual businesses. He has been working in this industry for nearly a year, and the largest public account has 70,000 to 80,000 followers, all of whom are Drain and accumulate traffic through video accounts. He refused to disclose his income, saying only that he &quot;doesn&#39;t make much.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the e-commerce platform, for only 100 yuan, some merchants provide individual business license agency services, upload ID card information and mobile phone number, and perform remote real-name authentication. The store said that there is no limit to the number of registrations per person, and there is no need to pay money to continue after applying, and there is no need to worry about inspections by the industrial and commercial authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using false individual business registrations to increase the number of WeChat public accounts is no longer a secret in the industry. These public accounts have become a powerful tool for batch release of information and batch operations. Y proved this. He is in Guangzhou, but his registered store is in Hainan. Ma Kai added that compared with the complicated materials that ordinary companies need to submit, individual industrial and commercial households only need to spend tens of yuan a year to prepare an annual report, and the above-mentioned merchants also provide agency services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A small program called &quot;Praise&quot; provides praise services for younger brother accounts. Unlike WeChat&#39;s direct rewards, third-party programs reward through jump links, which can avoid the risk of having your account frozen after being reported by users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comment area of ​​this mini program, there are still a lot of messages from sisters, &quot;Hello, dear baby brother! Good afternoon! Sister gives you some love for the author. How is your brother? I miss you so much. You, my sister has had trouble at home these days, so she hasn’t sent many messages to my brother. I hope my brother will understand and forgive my sister. My sister really likes you and loves you. She loves you and will never leave you and will always be with you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 14, &quot;Praise&quot; issued an announcement stating that the platform had no way of knowing whether users who received praise were committing fraud, and revealed that from October 9 to November 4, 2023, A user who was complained received a total of more than 250,000 yuan in praise. &lt;/span>;The amount of money defrauded can be staggering. In the early days, these accounts used WeChat to reward, and the number of rewards was publicly visible. Ma Kai observed that a Ruidongdi subscription account team from Fujian received at least 400 rewards a day at its peak, and it was estimated that the daily income could be as high as two or three dollars. Ten thousand yuan; another subscription account from Hebei has about 7,000 to 8,000 reads per day. The official account has not many fans. Before being blocked, it had accumulated more than 3,000 likes. According to his understanding, this type of account first started in Fujian and spread to Guangdong, Jiangxi, Chongqing and other places, and lasted for about a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After these public accounts were banned by WeChat, they had to start looking for new methods. Their corporate WeChat account is still functioning. The original link to the official account was changed to a link to the &quot;Tencent Content Creation Platform&quot;. The payment code can still be placed on the content interface. Moreover, if users have previously added their business WeChat accounts, they will still receive push messages every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ma Kai has been reporting on these corporate WeChat accounts, but with poor results. He dug up the historical records and said, “What you see is just the chatting and tipping on the surface. It is conceivable whether there are chats and transfers behind the scenes, right?” He believes that Enterprise WeChat is the real concentration of traffic. “Enterprises WeChat is originally a marketing tool and can add more people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Y told Southern Weekend reporters that two-thirds of the accounts on the market are no longer there. He no longer has a similar account and plans to prepare live broadcasts to bring goods out of town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/GLkoxSPeP2ndaFoKiXmqdVIyfZ8gE8uzlQcsfO82.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;2078&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/GLkoxSPeP2ndaFoKiXmqdVIyfZ8gE8uzlQcsfO82.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 1, the public account &quot;Dongyinxianban&quot; published a new article, continuing the false younger brother persona and telling stories in the video to induce rewards. As of 10 o&#39;clock that night, 38 people had tipped. The author of this article has posted similar content many times before, but has deleted it and canceled his account. Now it appears in a new public account. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;She needs love, she is truly not alone&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Xiao Lin runs an emotional public account for young people. Recently, she often receives some strange messages in the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to changes in the push mechanism of WeChat public accounts, the platform will recommend content that may be of interest to non-followers. As a result, her public account was accidentally seen by some middle-aged and elderly people and became a favorite of some people. Emotional tree hole. Most of their messages are scattered and unclear, and they seem to express their feelings to someone:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Do you know? I have forgiven you a long time ago, and I am waiting for your sincerity to pick me up, you know?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have been away from me for more than three years. It is normal to get married, start a family and start a business, but you are still in my heart.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A woman from the Northeast has been sending voice messages almost every day since September. At first it was a long string of scoldings, but later her tone became gentle. She seems to have fallen in love with a man and regarded his official account as his. Sometimes, she speaks quickly and in a crying tone, always starting with &quot;Dear baby&quot; and repeating: Why don&#39;t you come back? Why don&#39;t you reply to my message? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Lin did not dare to reply, for fear of breaking her confession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru only realized the delicate side of her heart from her grandma&#39;s love. My grandma lost her first husband more than 20 years ago and experienced two failed relationships. She followed her children to Beijing and barely attended school. She became literate through the Internet and likes to watch video accounts and public accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Xueru grew up with his grandma. When his grandma first fell in love, she couldn’t type. She read a sentence and Dong Xueru typed: &quot;Dear husband, I miss you so much. I love you. When will you come back to see me?&quot; .&quot; Sometimes, my grandma didn&#39;t know how to express it in words, so Dong Xueru helped her write some templates - &quot;Dear, eat more and take care of your health&quot; and &quot;Dear, go to bed early&quot;, and grandma passed it on to the other party as needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No matter how old a man or a woman is, they will be lonely, especially if they are single. As a relative, the care you can give him is only part of it. She needs love to truly not be alone.&quot; Dong Xueru said that grandma was avoiding them more and more, and was still obsessed with the conversation with the teacher Tie in her mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Wenhan’s grandma is also addicted to short videos. In her description, her grandma was a simple and compassionate person who had been deceived many times in her eighty years of life and always believed those stories about poverty and misery. After my grandfather passed away five years ago, my grandma suddenly became free and her life revolved around her children. After moving to a big city, she lost contact with her friends and seldom socialized. Soon, she started to watch short videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She often sees her grandma falling asleep while watching short videos, and then continues after waking up, muttering to herself in conjunction with the AI ​​dubbing in the short videos. The short video said, &quot;Can I call you mom?&quot; and grandma murmured, &quot;Of course, kid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Wenhan majored in gerontology when he was studying abroad. According to her observation, many elderly people abroad live in retirement communities and have their own social circles, but the elderly in China seem to need more emotion and sustenance. &quot;They need to be provided with some emotional value, that is, they are needed, or they still have charm.&quot; Wang Wenhan said. For a while, her grandma told her that she always dreamed that she was leaving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;Research Report on Emotional Care for the Elderly and the Use Value of Short Videos&quot;, Peng Huamao, a professor at the Department of Psychology at Beijing Normal University, conducted a survey of 2,000 elderly people across the country. The research team found that the elderly who chase Internet celebrities on the Internet are still &quot;too lonely and lack attention&quot; in their offline lives. During the survey, Peng Huamao asked the elderly people interviewed whether they still need love. The vast majority of the answers are need, mostly the love of children, and of course the love of the opposite sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao told Southern Weekend reporters that when the elderly and short videos are mentioned on the Internet, they are always about addiction, earthiness, etc., and most of them have negative impressions. An old man who travels thousands of miles to chase celebrities or give rewards in a live broadcast room will always be considered to be cheated. &quot;The advanced psychological needs of the elderly are always ignored, such as the need for love, respect, and self-realization.&quot; One of the results of the survey is that the vast majority of elderly people have the ability to control and understand that this compensation is not actually true satisfaction, but a diversion of attention or the passing of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Dong Xueru’s online post, a user left a message saying that her aunt encountered the same situation and fell into a brother-like public account and secretly rewarded her. After her wife discovered something was wrong with the money, she confiscated her mobile phone and called her relatives to persuade her. My aunt, who had been in charge of housework all her life, became almost crazy and cried loudly, not believing that this was a scam. The policeman called by her family was determined by her to be an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final solution was that the family registered a fake WeChat account for the younger brother and chatted with the aunt in a way that &quot;destroyed the personality&quot;. The younger brother ceased to be perfect and decent and became rude, shattering his aunt&#39;s fantasy. Finally, my aunt blocked this younger brother’s account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Dong Xueru, Ma Kai, Xiao Lin, Wang Wenhan are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子编排“老头强奸孙女致怀孕”被拘留：可比照“老夫少妻”造谣案入刑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261716]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Let me tell you a story.

The older one was only twelve years old and was three months pregnant, and was finally discovered by the teacher.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 27, a video was circulated on the Douyin platform, attracting public attention. On November 29, Chongqing Hechuan Police issued a notice: This video is a rumor. Liu (female, 46 years old), a criminal, posted unverified rumors through Douyin in order to earn gold coins on the Douyin platform. Faced with doubts from netizens about the unverified rumors. To refute the rumors, it was clarified that as of the time the information was deleted, it had been commented and shared nearly 700 times by netizens, causing adverse effects. At present, the police have imposed administrative penalties on the woman involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the police report, the woman involved should have committed an act that constituted &quot;publicly insulting others or fabricating facts to slander others&quot; in paragraph 2 of Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. She accepted the &quot; shall be detained for not more than five days or fined not more than five hundred yuan.&quot; Judging from the behavior of the woman involved, her alleged illegal and criminal behavior may not be just &quot;fabricating facts to slander others&quot;, and there is still room for continued discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the timeline of this case, the video uploaded by the woman involved can be said to be completely unrelated to pictures and texts. It only excerpted the video picture of the victim old man and his granddaughter, and then started to show the video to the wall. The fiction &quot;played its best&quot; and weaved an &quot;incest tragedy&quot;. Its frivolous tone, bad nature, and clumsy techniques all made netizens look at it. When netizens questioned it, the woman involved did not delete it immediately, nor did she clarify or apologize. As a result, the video continued to spread. At the time of the incident, it had accumulated 700 comments and shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not yet clear what channel or method the woman involved used to obtain the information of the old man and his granddaughter, but this first violated the personality rights of the victim’s grandparents and was a blatant violation. Their right to image and reputation. The particularity of this case is that the woman in question misappropriated the victim’s information, in addition to seeking the benefits of the Douyin platform gold coins. From the perspective of the result, it was a brutal trampling on the personal reputation of the victim’s grandparents and grandchildren. The severity of the crime was far beyond a simple &quot;Making pornographic rumors&quot; or &quot;slandering&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Douyin platform can be regarded as a public place. If the woman in question makes such a specific and &quot;below the lower limit&quot; accusation in a public place, she has an obligation to ensure the authenticity of the accusation and at the same time defend her remarks. Responsible. Therefore, in addition to violating the Public Security Administration Punishment Law, the woman involved is also suspected of other illegal and criminal acts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Article 1 of the &quot;Interpretations of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Handling of Criminal Cases Using Information Networks to Commit Defamation&quot; by the two top governments, &quot;tampering with the original information content involving others on the information network into facts that damage the reputation of others&quot; , disseminate on information networks, or organize or instigate people to disseminate on information networks&quot; shall be deemed as &quot;fabricating facts to slander others&quot; as stipulated in Article 246, paragraph 1, of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The behavior of the woman involved in this case has obviously met this requirement, and the video comments she posted on Douyin have been shared 700 times, which is in line with Article 2 of the judicial interpretations of the two Supreme Courts that &quot;the number of reposts reaches More than 500 times&quot; standard for &quot;serious circumstances&quot;. According to Article 246 of the Criminal Law, the woman involved is guilty of defamation and the circumstances are serious, and she should be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance, or deprivation of political rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, compared with similar previous cases, the woman involved may deserve criminal punishment for her illegal and criminal behavior, rather than just administrative punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of &quot;a woman was rumored to be an old husband and a young wife&quot; in 2021, the man involved, Wu Moumou, took a photo of the woman with her grandfather&#39;s grandparents and rumored to be an &quot;old husband and a young wife&quot;, and also issued a sensational content of rumors. After the incident, the People&#39;s Procuratorate of the First District of Dongguan City prosecuted him for defamation. In September 2023, the court ruled that Wu Moumou fabricated facts to slander others on the information network. The circumstances were serious and seriously endangered social order. Based on the circumstances of the defendant&#39;s crime and his confession and punishment, the defendant Wu Moumou was sentenced to one year in prison for defamation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Moumou’s behavior constituted the crime of defamation. The court adopted the relevant definitions in the judicial interpretations of the two Supreme Courts and determined that Wu Moumou had tampered with “original information content involving others on the Internet to damage the reputation of others.” Facts, disseminated on information networks”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, even if &quot;old husband and young wife&quot; is true, it does not violate any law in the marriage and family section of the &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, and it does not even touch upon the so-called moral and ethical issues. This kind of news can at most arouse the curiosity and onlookers of netizens. In comparison, the rumor-mongering behavior of the woman involved in this case is even more outrageous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that if the accusation of the woman involved is true, then such a despicable &quot;grandfather-grandson incest&quot; has violated the criminal law and constitutes the crime of rape, and it meets the requirements of &quot;under the age of fourteen, a severe punishment&quot; &quot;The standard is also in line with the standard in the &quot;Opinions on Punishing the Crime of Sexual Assault on Minors According to the Law&quot; that &quot;persons who have a common family relationship with minors must be severely punished in accordance with the law.&quot; The &quot;old man&quot; involved may face severe punishments of more than ten years in prison, life imprisonment or death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the woman involved made such a serious public false accusation, she was suspected of false accusation and frame-up in addition to defamation. Article 243 of the Criminal Law also stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution constitutes the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, if the life of the victim’s grandfather and grandson is greatly affected and causes bad consequences, the woman involved should bear greater responsibility. Therefore, this case is not in compliance with the principle of proportionality. The woman involved is suspected of a criminal offense. The public authorities can continue to pursue her criminal responsibility, require her to apologize, eliminate the impact, and provide civil compensation. The three victims of the crime will also be given justice to their grandfather and grandson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[婚礼上听“常识课”：“互免模式”下，老家变时尚了丨回乡偶书]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261680]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-02 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My old friend, Brother Chunqiu, invited me back to my hometown for a wedding banquet on WeChat. His son-in-law is getting married and he will be back from abroad at the end of the month. wedding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Putting down the phone, I suddenly remembered how young and shy Brother Chunqiu was when he got married, and how busy Brother Chunqiu was when I was organizing the wedding banquet. At that time, he was still a newspaper reporter and made a cameo appearance in wedding photography. In the blink of an eye, our children also entered the palace of love one after another, and they &quot;swore&quot; like a couple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about the routine of the wedding dinner in my hometown, it’s actually a bit boring: first, it’s late and the endless waiting; second, it’s noisy and the endless routine. However, when I went back several times recently, I found that my hometown was also changing, becoming younger and more fashionable. When there is a happy event in the family, it is now fashionable not to be a part of it or give red envelopes. The &quot;mutual exemption model&quot; allows ordinary people to &quot;joy&quot; easily and &quot;love&quot; without worries, and also makes the hometown one of the first batch to be selected as an experimental area for national marriage custom reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wedding of Chunqiu Brother and Young Master was simple and cheerful. The subtleties are eye-catching and full of surprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight was the thank you session for the parents of the new couple. Dear Brother Chunqiu, hold your breath in Mandarin and write the first paragraph &quot;thank you&quot;, the second paragraph &quot;gratitude&quot;, and the third paragraph are two sentences of &quot;remarks&quot;, specially given to your son and daughter-in-law: In a sea of ​​more than one billion people, you meet and get to know each other. Meet and fall in love. I hope you will cherish the fate of thousands of miles and thousands of years, and respect, understand and help each other. As parents of newlyweds, I would also like to remind you: First, always be kind and help those in need around you in a timely manner; second, always be grateful and never forget to care about those who help us... The true marriage between a Jiangsu boy and a Hunan girl is For the love of &quot;rivers and lakes&quot;, I look forward to you riding the wind and waves and being proud of the &quot;rivers and lakes&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These golden expressions are enough to be provocative. At the wedding scene, the parents of the newlyweds simultaneously hung up the red couplets of &quot;Always Be Kind&quot; and &quot;Always Be Grateful&quot;. The eight big characters attracted the attention of the entire audience. , the banner of &quot;Swordsman Jiangsu and Hunan&quot; was unfolded, which pushed the atmosphere of the night to a new climax. In an instant, many people switched to &quot;hilarious mode.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most ceremonial part was the &quot;tribute moment&quot;, the high-profile appearance of the groom&#39;s 99-year-old grandmother. The old man came from out of town, more than 4 hours&#39; drive away, to wish the newlyweds a long and happy life. The bride and groom made a special trip to hand over red envelopes and shouted in the old man’s ears: Grandma, may you be healthy for a long time! Happy for a long time! ! This was the fourth time the old lady attended her grandson&#39;s wedding, but it was the first time she received a blessing red envelope from the couple. She smiled like a child. According to reports, the red envelope is a lucky number: 999 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is interesting is the on-site blessing from Professor Zhu of Shanghai University Hospital: I am a cardiologist and have been dealing with the &quot;heart&quot; all my life. On this special day, I returned to my hometown and said a few words from my heart: First, in a small family, new people must be loyal to each other and care for each other. Entering the marriage hall today means the beginning of firewood, rice, oil, salt, pots and pans. In the future, small families will inevitably encounter small difficulties and setbacks. You must be patient! Second, in the workplace, you must be open-minded when it comes to professional matters, have perseverance in sticking to your post, and be enthusiastic about your colleagues! The third is to be kind and filial to your relatives, friends, parents, and elders in your hometown, and pay more attention to the details - your parents do not ask you to make much contribution, but there are overseas video calls every now and then, and they are sent to the family group every day. A smiling face is enough! As long as you have love, we can rest assured in our hometown! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wedding is the highlight moment for the newlyweds. The protagonists of the wedding are the groom and the bride, their growth background, love story, and future vision. However, the protagonists are not necessarily the highlights of the scene. The family or friends of the newcomers, those characters who appear in supporting roles, can sometimes surprise and win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This wedding is full of positive energy, without clichés, not preachy, and down to earth. The only bad thing was that people ended up forgetting a few dishes and a few glasses of wine. Some people say that marriage is a school that teaches people to tolerate, understand, and share. Then, the wedding may be the &quot;first lesson of school&quot;, a lesson in life, life, and respect for the elderly. At the end of the day, it&#39;s all common sense lessons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a Jiangsu media person)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;span>; Share what you see, hear and think about the countryside.

Lawrence was immersed in writing his war memoirs. After being expelled from the Paris Peace Conference a year ago, this famous World War I hero was struggling with persistent depression. Only writing could temporarily pull him out of the swamp of despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The silence was broken by a ringing sound. It was a call from Whitehall in London - the other party was Winston Churchill, who was to be the Colonial Secretary. He wanted to invite Lawrence to assist him in handling Middle Eastern affairs. This controversial figure who was reduced to a &quot;political pariah&quot; five years ago due to his defeat in the Middle East battlefield has made a comeback and is trying to figure out how to deal with the mess of the British Empire in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;World War I&quot; has ended, the Ottoman Empire has been dismembered, and peace has not come: In Palestine, conflicts between the Zionists supported by the British and the local Arabs quickly intensified, and eventually escalated to Bloody conflicts; even more serious was the outbreak of a full-scale anti-British uprising in Iraq, an oil-producing area controlled by the British, and tens of thousands of people died in bloodshed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The allies are not having a good time either - in the desert of Transjordan, Prince Abdullah from the Hashemite family has been ferociously attacking the French who control the Syrian region. A few months ago, the French had just used force to seize this territory from Faisal, another prince of the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1919, the Paris Peace Conference, which had been wrangling for half a year, came to an end. The Middle East, divided among the victors, is filled with hatred, bloodshed and conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite Lawrence&#39;s rejection, Churchill had no intention of giving up. This extraordinary man, who would go on to become one of the most important statesmen of the 20th century, knew that Lawrence of Arabia was the key to unraveling this mess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two unconventional &quot;political pariahs&quot; are about to work together to shape the history of the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/JQGwRMz0I9faA6cyJmqWkJTwlimow6j76NZC5o42.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/JQGwRMz0I9faA6cyJmqWkJTwlimow6j76NZC5o42.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1913, Lawrence (second from right) and British archaeologist Leonard Woolley participated in archaeological operations at the ancient Hittite city Carchemish in the Ottoman Empire. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Smart &quot;illegitimate son&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He is an Irish nobleman who eloped with his mistress crystallization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid social pressure, Lawrence&#39;s parents lived in the countryside anonymously, moving frequently and barely interacting with their neighbors. It was not until for the education and future of his five sons that he boldly moved to the bustling Oxfordshire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the teacher, this boy is very smart, has a quiet personality, loves books, but is also fond of playing pranks. He especially likes to play various games that test his extreme survival endurance, such as not drinking water, not eating, and not sleeping. He can always persist until he faints and collapses by relying on his willpower. The principal of Oxford Public School recalled that Lawrence was very different from boys of the same age. He was somewhat like the Stoics of ancient Greece. He &quot;didn&#39;t care about physical pleasure or pain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young Lawrence had excellent academic performance. , is particularly obsessed with medieval knight literature, and is interested in military history and archeology. Every holiday, he would ride a bicycle with his friends to explore England&#39;s ancient monuments, and also work as an assistant at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He was later admitted to Jesus College, Oxford University, where he majored in history. During his college years, he cycled 2,400 miles to inspect ancient castles and military ruins in Europe, dining and sleeping all the way to the Mediterranean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1909, in order to clarify an academic case in medieval military history, he went to Syria alone to investigate. Under the scorching sun, he set out from Beirut, passed through the mountains of Lebanon, and reached northern Palestine; three weeks later, he returned to Beirut and went north to continue more arduous archaeology. After returning, he wrote a paper &quot;The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture in the 12th Century&quot; and won Oxford&#39;s highest first-class excellence award. In addition, a scholarship for postgraduate studies was awarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1910, the British Museum launched archaeological excavations at the ruins of the ancient city of Carchemish on the border between Turkey and Syria today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence served as a junior assistant and soon became the excavation site superintendent, supervising more than two hundred locally hired workers. He did an outstanding job. He often chatted with workers in Arabic, visited their homes, and recorded their folklore, structural relationships within families and between tribes, and their views on politics. The workers also had a good impression of this young European because he truly respected their customs and culture and was willing to accept hospitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that at that time, no Westerner knew more about Syria than Lawrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Carchemish, Lawrence and a 13-year-old Syrian boy were inseparable and very close. The boy whom he calls Dahom in his memoirs, his real name is Selim Ahmed, the “SA” to whom Lawrence dedicated his war memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Dahom is smart and handsome, with two deep dimples on his face and an innocent and bright smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the curiosity of a scholar, Lawrence developed a true appreciation and respect for Near Eastern culture through his contact and study with local society. He began to reflect on the arrogant imperialist consciousness of the West regarding &quot;Western enlightenment and civilization of backward nations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a scholar who has truly penetrated into the hinterland of Syria, Lawrence has clearly seen the general trend of the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled the Arabian Peninsula for more than four centuries and spanned Asia, Africa and Europe, had entered its twilight and was known as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. With the rise of nationalism and the development of international commerce around the world, the Ottomans faced more and more challenges at home and abroad. Externally, European powers undergoing industrialization are constantly encroaching on its territory and sovereignty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/EA0uVznH9pUk8pS2iktOaARUYAcUBK0W02Ldofh1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/EA0uVznH9pUk8pS2iktOaARUYAcUBK0W02Ldofh1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In November 1917, the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force broke through the Ottoman army&#39;s defense lines and captured Palestine; in December, the British army entered Jerusalem&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the empire, forces promoting reform and demanding modernization have always existed. In 1908, a group of young military officers known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot; launched a coup and forced Hamid II to restore the parliamentary constitution. In 1913, the nationalist radical wing of the party came to power and established a centralized authoritarian system with the &quot;Three Oligarchs&quot; as the core. They adjusted the reform plan to promote modernization, defend Islam and pan-Turkism in order to unite the people within the empire&#39;s borders. every group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in a huge empire with multiple languages, multi-ethnic groups, and extremely complex social composition, no reform program can appease all groups: secularization efforts have greatly angered the large number of traditional Muslims. ; Advocating Pan-Turkism also makes other non-Turkish ethnic groups, such as Arabs and Armenians, feel resentful...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this moment, what the young archaeologist is obsessed with is the land, work, and friendship under his feet. And love. When he was determined to devote the next four to five years to the excavation and research of the ancient city ruins, bad news came: the British Museum project funds had been exhausted, and the excavation work had to be suspended until new funds were available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is another job opportunity: funded by a foundation, a contingent of the British Royal Engineers is going to conduct an archaeological expedition to the desert area in southern Palestine and needs to recruit two archaeologists. Ask them if they are interested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence and his companions readily accepted. &quot;Xunmo&quot; is in the southern part of Israel today. According to the Old Testament, it was the last place where the ancient Jews, led by the prophet Moses, left Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As smart as Lawrence, he quickly guessed that this expedition in the name of the foundation was actually a secret military geographical survey. At that time, Britain sent troops to occupy the buffer zone of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula, and relations with the Ottoman Empire had always been tense. When the &quot;World War I&quot; broke out, because they were worried that the Ottomans would attack Egypt and seize the canal once they allied with Germany, the British wanted to find out the other side of the buffer zone on the east side of the Suez Canal - from the southeastern part of the Palestinian coast to the Gulf of Aqaba. conditions in the desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of this operation was British Captain Stuart Newcomb. He developed a liking for this Oxford scholar who didn&#39;t care about enjoyment and had amazing endurance even to the point of masochism. He was particularly impressed by his eccentricities - in general, Lawrence was an extremely shy person by nature, but once someone tried to Hinder or fool him, and he will become determined and bold. During his adventure in the desert, he was constantly monitored and obstructed by the Ottoman military police. Lawrence fully demonstrated his ability to break through like a child&#39;s mischievous child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the outbreak of World War I, he brought Lawrence into the British military intelligence agency in Cairo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 28, 1914, Archduke Ferdinand, the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, and World War I broke out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October, Lawrence, who had just turned 26, was sent to the Geography Section of the British General Staff as a cartographer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the high-ranking military and political officials of the empire, this conceited young man still looks slovenly and carefree, indifferent to all kinds of rules and regulations. In his eyes, these pretentious high-ranking officials are all empty-minded fools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because a general wanted a distinguished officer to report to him, Lawrence was dramatically promoted to second lieutenant. But what he longs for is to go to the front line and show off his skills. Lawrence is less than 1.65 meters tall, below the minimum standard of the British Army, so the only opportunity to go to the front line is where his special talents are needed - the Middle East battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, 1914, the Ottoman Empire finally joined the Allies and officially entered the war. On December 15, Lawrence arrived in Cairo on a French motorboat and reported to the military intelligence unit led by Newcomb. At this time, Cairo was noisy and noisy. It was already an important transit hub for personnel and materials in the &quot;World War I&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of British colonial troops from India, Australia and New Zealand traveled from here to the European battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Of9gtmLeIhFGX1qVqGIyxmTuHCLtIjZQWHSZct3r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;632&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Of9gtmLeIhFGX1qVqGIyxmTuHCLtIjZQWHSZct3r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1918, Lawrence led and launched the most ferocious attack on the Hejaz Railway in the Daraa area. The picture shows Lawrence inspecting the destroyed train &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Million Cracks of &quot;The Sick Man of Europe&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In the British intelligence agency in Cairo, one of Lawrence&#39;s jobs was to write reports describing the topography, culture and ethnic composition of the Ottoman Empire for senior officials in London. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years of experience in Syrian society have allowed Lawrence to see the countless cracks within this old empire. In the huge territory that the Turks put together by force during their heyday, there are many people who have no intention of fighting this war. ethnic groups related to the war; they were already full of resentment against the Turkish rulers, and the war made this hatred deeper and deeper. The largest population in this empire was the Arabs who believed in Islam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1908, the modernization and secular reforms implemented by the Young Turks after coming to power angered Hussein ibn Ali, the religious political leader who controlled the Hijaz region of the Arabian Peninsula. He is the head of the famous Hashemite family, a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, and has guarded the Holy Land of Mecca for generations. As a &quot;holy descendant&quot;, Hussein is one of the most respected religious leaders in the Islamic world and has strong influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Ottoman Empire joined the &quot;World War I&quot;, relations between the two sides worsened. As a religious leader, Hussein remained silent regarding the official propaganda of the so-called &quot;holy war&quot;; the Ottoman Empire asked him to send troops to assist in seizing the Suez Canal, but he only sent his second son Abdullah to lead a small team to perfunctory the task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in February 1914, before the outbreak of World War I, Abdullah took the opportunity of visiting Cairo to visit Lord Kitchener, then the Governor of British Egypt. Sexually asked: How would Britain react if an Arab uprising broke out in the Hijaz region? Kitchener carefully avoided it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Ottoman Empire officially entered the war in November 1914, Kitchener, who became the British Minister of War, immediately sent a coded message to Cairo, asking his old subordinate Stowers to send someone to secretly tell Abdullah Contact to find out Hussein&#39;s true attitude. This time, Hussein cautiously replied that he would remain neutral, but at the same time hinted that if the British provided external assistance and promised not to interfere in Arab internal affairs, he might lead his followers in an uprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This made Kitchener very happy. He wrote in a letter to Hussein - &quot;From today on, we will be friends with the noble Arabs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Learned After receiving these secret letters, Lawrence felt like a &quot;divine revelation&quot; - after arriving in Cairo, he had been studying the possibility of launching an Arab uprising in Syria. The battlefield in the Middle East was far away from Europe and resources were relatively scarce. Therefore, Lawrence believed that Britain needed to adopt an unconventional war, that is, to use the social and national contradictions and divisions within the Ottoman Empire to join forces with the dissatisfied elements and help them launch an uprising. overthrow Turkish rule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5TneGpF03MprbuQRXwbRsHtN9q7Q15l7j7YPZAYv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;743&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5TneGpF03MprbuQRXwbRsHtN9q7Q15l7j7YPZAYv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Faisal (front row) and Lawrence (second row, second from right) during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The uprising in a secret agreement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From July 1915 to January 1916, Hussein and the British High Commissioner to Egypt Henry Mack Mahon exchanged letters secretly to negotiate cooperation. Several Arab nationalist secret societies in Syria were also secretly contacting Hussein, hoping to join forces to launch an uprising against the Turks, with support from the British and using him as the spiritual leader of the uprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what made Hussein finally decide to turn to the British was a rumor - it was rumored that Constantinople intended to depose him and replace him with the leader of the Zaid family. On May 6, 1916, Gemal Pasha, one of the Ottoman &quot;Three Oligarchs&quot;, publicly executed 21 Arab nationalists in Damascus. Hussein sent his son Faisal to intercede, but was rejected and intimidated. , which made him even more uneasy about his future destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these secret communications, the British assured Hussein that if he led his troops to assist the British army in the Middle East war, the British would assist him in establishing a kingdom between Egypt and Persia after the war, but Excludes Kuwait, Aden and the Arab Empire along the Syrian coast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, MacMahon also inserted an obscure condition in the letter: these commitments would only take effect &quot;so long as Britain is free to decide without endangering the interests of its ally France&quot;. Among them, the part about Palestine was not mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When France learned that Britain and Hussein were negotiating a secret agreement, it immediately made a claim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1916, an &quot;amateur politician&quot; named Mark Sykes, an aristocrat, and the French diplomat François Georges-Picot reached an agreement on war in London. The draft of the post-Middle East vision was later formally signed in Petrograd, Russia, known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this secret agreement: the independent Arab countries were roughly restricted to the desert of the Arabian Peninsula, France directly controlled Greater Syria, and the United Kingdom occupied the entire oil-producing Iraq; there were also two enclaves, Hou All the areas north of the Hijaz Kingdom and the remaining inland areas governed by Sain are &quot;semi-independent areas&quot;, which are indirectly controlled by Britain and France; while Palestine is an &quot;international condominium area&quot;, which will be jointly controlled by Britain, France and Russia. manage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historians are still debating how this series of &quot;oolong&quot; incidents gradually became a fait accompli with tacit approval. In short, these two conflicting commitment documents signed by the British government with the Arabs and the French respectively will lay the foundation for future turmoil in the Middle East, and thus push Lawrence to a classical tragic personal destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 5, 1915, in the Holy Land of Mecca, Hussein ibn Ali climbed a tower in the palace and fired an old musket at the Turkish fortress in the city . On that day, his two sons Ali and Faisal took the lead, and 1,500 Arab knights fired into the air in Medina. Later, Hussein&#39;s followers launched an attack on Turkish garrison positions in the Hijaz. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hussein issued a declaration to Muslims around the world: publicly condemning the Turkish authorities for &quot;persecuting and massacring Arab nationalists and deviating from the spirit of Islam&quot; and declaring Arab independence from the Ottoman Empire. He proclaimed himself king of the Hijaz kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous &quot;Arab Revolt&quot; in the modern history of the Middle East broke out, and the stage with Lawrence as the protagonist officially opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;rabbit&quot; looking for a prophet and a king&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The heat of the Arabian Peninsula is like an unsheathed sword, leaving us speechless.&quot; October 16, 1916 In the early morning light of the day, when Lawrence accompanied the British Oriental Culture Secretary in Egypt to Jeddah, an important port controlled by Hussein after the uprising, he recorded his feelings at this moment in his diary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before setting foot in Hijaz, he had already designed a new course for the Arab uprising and defined his role - &quot;to find the unknown master soul for the uprising and measure him.&quot; The ability to advance the uprising to the goals I envisioned.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Hussein fired the first shot, the rebels and the Ottoman army entered a stalemate after a month of bloody street fighting. Moreover, the overarching mission of the Holy Guardian of Mecca did not go as expected - sparking a broader national uprising in the Arabian Peninsula, with no response in Syria or other regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence believes that the core of the problem is the lack of a leader. Unlike Western political culture, what the Arab uprisings needed was not a brilliant politician, but a prophet, &quot;not intelligence, not judgment, not political wisdom, but the flame of passion that can ignite the desert.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While his superiors were discussing the details of cooperation with the rebel leaders, Lawrence took the opportunity to carefully observe Hussein&#39;s four sons: the eldest son Ali, the second son Abdullah, and the third son Feisal. Er and their youngest son Zaire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He first met the three princes except Faisal: Abdullah was cheerful by nature, gained weight early because of his greed for pleasure, and his personality was &quot;too cautious, too calm, and too humorous&quot;; the eldest son Ali saw He looks sad and tired, has no obvious ambitions, and is easily influenced by the people around him; as for Zaire, he is only 20 years old and likes to ride horses, wander around and play pranks. In addition, he is of Turkish descent and his appearance is different from Arabs. people. Lawrence concluded that it was difficult for them to become the kind of &quot;armed prophets who triumphed in revolutions in history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until Lawrence rode a camel 100 miles through areas controlled by multiple hostile tribes, he met Faisal who was stationed in a desert oasis with another tribe of tribesmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The first time I saw him, I felt that this was the man I came to the Arabian Peninsula to look for, the man who would bring all the glory to the Arab uprising.&quot; Faisal is thin and tall, with a This strange calmness, the passion when speaking and the iron determination behind the words deeply attracted Lawrence. This was something he had not found in the other three princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence also wandered around his camp for a long time, chatting with the soldiers in fluent Arabic. He found that the more than 6,000 people summoned by Faisal included almost all the tribes in the western Hejaz. Although they had just experienced a defeat, their morale was high and they had unwavering confidence in victory. What united them and inspired them all the time was Faisal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He became more and more determined that Faisal was the &quot;prophet&quot; he was looking for - &quot;Better than we hoped, my goal for this trip has been achieved.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hijaz This trip made Lawrence the first foreigner to go deep into the interior of the Arabian Peninsula to observe the battlefield. When he returned to Yanbu and waited for the ship to return to Cairo, he wrote a 15,000-word report in five days, making two important judgments: first, the British only sent a small number of troops to the Hijaz area; second, the real &quot;prophet&quot; who led the uprising was Fei Sal, not Abdullah as the British were familiar with him. He also pointed out: The only way to cooperate is that the British must accept the Arab way of fighting and adjust their strategies and expectations accordingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence&#39;s report fundamentally changed British policy towards the Arabian Peninsula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the huge bureaucracy of the British Empire, many smart ideas are buried every day. After writing reports in the Cairo office for nearly two years, Lawrence slowly discovered the rules of the game. He was very good at using bureaucracy and factional infighting to achieve his own goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning from Hijaz, under Lawrence&#39;s dazzling operations, he deliberately guided, bypassed and even destroyed &quot;obstacles&quot; through memos, reports, and reports. In the end, his strategic vision for the Middle East battlefield was realized. It was adopted by all, and received the green light all the way from the top military and political leaders from Egypt to London. Soon, Clayton, director of the British Arab Bureau, informed Lawrence that he would be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to serve as a temporary liaison officer around Faisal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The superiors and colleagues happily sent away this &quot;arrogant, inexperienced brat who pissed off everyone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/eV9ShS7BygqFQ730yztxT16FkKgaDyLvqICW4kpj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;704&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/eV9ShS7BygqFQ730yztxT16FkKgaDyLvqICW4kpj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1921, Churchill (front row, center) and Lawrence (second row, fourth from right) during the Cairo Conference&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Becoming a &quot;Son of the Desert&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In December 1916, when Lawrence came to Faisal&#39;s camp again as a British liaison officer, in Faisal At the suggestion of Faisal himself, he put on a pure white silk robe. Throughout the war he lived as much as possible with the warriors of the Arab tribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A typical day in an Arab tribal camp goes like this: An imam wakes the camp with prayers in the early morning, followed by a long breakfast. Every morning, anyone could come to Faisal to complain, petition, or settle disputes. He spent most of the day eating, drinking tea, and chatting with his staff and tribal leaders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence himself had always had a reputation for being impatient and disciplinarian, but he realized that these long, aimless chats were exactly how Arabs dealt with war and peace. Faisal used this as a glue to unite and maintain these loose tribes and clans around him. During the entire battle, he also served as a mediator between the various tribes, listening, making suggestions, cajoling when necessary, and often spending his own money to reconcile the two parties with interest disputes as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly all British military advisers sent to the Hijaz since the uprising had expressed contempt for the Arabs&#39; fighting prowess. Lawrence agreed, but after fighting with them, he came to an important point: the Arabs cannot be measured by European war standards, and it is also difficult to organize and train them into European-style combat forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What they are really good at is guerrilla warfare. In addition, they have a good understanding of the geographical environment and are very mobile. In war, when the strength and weapons and equipment are obviously inferior to that of the enemy, the weaker party should not engage the opponent head-on, but should &quot;float around like air.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first day of the uprising, both Hussein and his followers, and the British, had made capturing Medina, the second holiest city in Islam, their main goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Lawrence believed that the correct strategy was to abandon the heavily fortified Medina and let the Ottoman army stay there almost indefinitely. Let them barely maintain their supply lines and be unable to retreat or attack. This was equivalent to The rebels were captured. Eventually, he convinced the rebels to shift their strategic focus to harassing and destroying areas along the Hejaz Railway. This forced the Turkish army to send heavy troops to defend the railway and at the same time undertake ongoing maintenance work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Arab Revolt, the new goals and new strategies formulated by Lawrence reversed the situation, made the strikes more effective, and significantly reduced casualties. During the entire &quot;World War I&quot;, the Arab rebel forces continued to launch guerrilla warfare, which effectively delayed the actions of the Ottoman army and helped the Allies finally defeat the Ottoman Empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/RU2VlcM0z8CZJ9I6semM5HpKZiTMLQynW01DmZsl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;769&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/RU2VlcM0z8CZJ9I6semM5HpKZiTMLQynW01DmZsl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259976&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lawrence (left) and American traveler and journalist Lowell Thomas in Arabia&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Become a legend - capture Aqaba&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Gulf of Aqaba is located east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian continent. It is a bay in the northern part of the Red Sea. The port of Aqaba is at its northern end. Judging from the plan map, it is an ideal staging area for attacking southern Palestine from Egypt. Sixty miles to the east is the lifeline of the Ottoman army on the Arabian Peninsula - the Hejaz Railway. In all future Middle East wars, this place will be a strategic location for offensive and defensive operations between Afghanistan and Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1914, when Lawrence was an archaeologist at the British Museum, he conducted an expedition in the Gulf of Aqaba. From the port of Aqaba to the interior, there are steep mountains that rise all the way, and then there is the inland desert. The only access inland from the port of Aqaba was through a canyon, along which the Ottomans built a network of blockhouses and trenches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Britain and France have their own calculations on how to deal with this obviously strategically important Red Sea port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of January 1917, with Lawrence&#39;s contact and the cooperation of the British army, Faisal led his tribal army to seize Vodikh, an important port located in the north-central part of the Red Sea. French representatives began to lobby the British to send troops to attack and control Aqaba, so that the right wing could protect the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Palestinian campaign launched in January of that year. Another more secret motive was to suppress the raging Arab uprising within the Hijaz territory, command them to coordinate actions as needed, and threaten them with a withdrawal of arms and gold support if they dissatisfied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence had always opposed Faisal&#39;s plan to attack Aqaba. He knew the Allied Powers&#39; calculations: if the Arabs only cooperated with the British and French troops&#39; offensive, Aqaba would become their &quot;death trap&quot; and they would end up empty-handed. For this reason, he did not hesitate to risk &quot;treason&quot; and revealed the British-French secret agreement to Faisal in February 1917. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if the Arabs themselves control this northernmost port on the Red Sea, once the rebels move north to fight in Syria, the supply line can be greatly shortened from the original 300 miles to 60 miles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1917, his boss Clayton sent Lawrence a secret order from Cairo: Do ​​not let Arabs appear in Aqaba. He understood the subtext - Clayton was even more explicit in a letter to a general: given the importance of Aqaba to Egypt&#39;s defense, the British must firmly control the seaport city after the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of that year, when Lawrence was interrogating a dozen Turkish prisoners of war sent by the British army, he received new information: The garrison in Aqaba had just changed, and the number rarely exceeded 100, and the number of prisoners from Aqaba was small. There are only 200 Turkish troops stationed on the road between Kaba and Ma&#39;an Town, the Hejaz railway hub in the interior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence quickly made a bold and risky decision - before the British and French troops invaded Aqaba, he united various desert tribes to convene an Arab armed force, and then crossed the mountains and ridges at lightning speed, and started from the inland highway. The last town of Ma&#39;an captured the port of Aqaba. Through this victory fought for by the Arabs themselves, the influence of European powers in the region was minimized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was also Lawrence&#39;s boldest and most famous military action in the &quot;World War I&quot;. He used understatement to excuse other British officers around him and his superiors in Cairo, &quot;So, regardless of orders or not, I went my own way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 7, 1917, Lawrence and 45 desert warriors set out from Vodijh, carrying gold coins worth 20,000 pounds and some rifles, riding camels into the Huer Desert in the northeastern interior, planning to recruit troops from the Hovitat tribe deep in the desert. He also encouraged the Syrian tribes to serve as a frontline for the rebels to move north and liberate Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They stopped at the Wadi Sirhan oasis as they entered Syria. More and more tribal representatives came to discuss alliances with the rebels and join the Arab independence cause. As Lawrence was entertained with round after round of tribal feasts, his guilt grew. He knew he was deceiving—after victory, the Allies would inevitably betray the Arabs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an extremely complex and painful state of mind, he made a suicidal adventure - traveling north to Syria alone, detouring 400 miles through enemy territory, reaching as far north as Lebanon and the suburbs of Damascus, where he secretly met and fought for Potential allies of the uprising include tribal leaders and urban Arab nationalists. At that time, Damascus was the seat of the joint headquarters of the Ottoman and German armies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a desert oasis, he met the highly prestigious Emir (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Script_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A title of nobility in the Arab world&lt;/span >;) Nuri Sharaang. When the old chief living deep in the desert took out a bunch of copies of conflicting documents and asked him which British promise he should believe, Lawrence had no choice but to suggest choosing the one with the closest date. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old chief was persuaded, and Lawrence felt ashamed. &quot;I used lies to gain a reputation for myself and became the undisputed leader of the fraud group.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence said that he had truly woken up. , with the motivation to live. &quot;I vow to spare no effort until we bring the final victory to the Arabs, respect the demands of the Arabs, and negotiate a fair and reasonable solution. Only by saving our lives in the troubled times in front of us can we compete with others at the future negotiation table. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The swamp-like situation often inspires Lawrence&#39;s most incredible courage, resourcefulness and endurance. The legendary battle during World War I - the capture of Aqaba - took place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 1917, Lawrence and the &quot;Legendary Desert Warrior&quot; Oda Abu Tai set out from Wadi Sirhan with 500 camel cavalry recruited and headed southwest. When they arrived at Bell, they found the footprints traced by the Ottoman army - all the most important water wells in the desert march had been blown up, and they had guessed that the rebel army&#39;s goal was Aqaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence then commanded and led the Arabs to set up a divine formation. As early as more than ten days ago, he had laid the groundwork when he went north to Syria, leading a local squad to bomb the Destroyed a small bridge on the Hejaz Railway north of Damascus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 21, he led 100 soldiers 150 miles north to Amman on the railway, quickly destroyed a railway culvert, and then quickly returned. In Syria&#39;s southern border, the rebels launched a series of hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. This made the Turkish army completely unable to find any pattern, and had to disperse its forces and rush around to track them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A piece of good news came: a team they sent a few days ago had just captured and destroyed the Turkish military stronghold of Fulila, and the road from the interior to Aqaba was basically wide open. When they hurriedly bypassed the town of Ma&#39;an and rushed to Aqaba, bad news came again: that morning, about five hundred Ottoman soldiers rushed to Fuwela to reinforce their reinforcements. at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After some thinking, Lawrence made a decision: he must take the initiative to find and annihilate the Ottoman reinforcements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn on July 2, they found the enemy sleeping soundly in a narrow mountain pass south of Fuvilla. After a brutal fight, they killed 300 people and captured 160 people. . However, when the prisoners of war revealed that the defense of Ma&#39;an Town was empty, the tribal warriors with banditry background screamed with joy and wanted to take the opportunity to loot this rich transportation hub. Lawrence tried his best to persuade them and promised them more compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As they moved quickly westward along the highway, they passed through empty Turkish forts and trench lines one after another - this proved the brilliance of Lawrence&#39;s plan that had not been recognized by his superiors. &quot;The enemy never thought , we will launch an attack from inland. Among all their large defenses, not a single trench or a single outpost faces inland.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After two days of stalemate, the troops led by Lawrence were almost exhausted. The ground captured the port of Aqaba. The next day, he set off for Egypt, rode a camel across 150 miles of desert to the Suez Canal, and notified the British army to quickly send reinforcements and transport food and other supplies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 10, 1917, Lawrence, who had been &quot;missing&quot; for more than two months, suddenly appeared in the Cairo office of the British intelligence agency, wearing a sloppy Arab robe. Within days, word of his heroic deeds spread among military brass in Egypt and London. At a time when the war on the Western Front was unfavorable and the French army mutinied, this British victory in the Middle East battlefield seemed particularly exciting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the general public, this is a legend of a lonely hero that can arouse endless romantic imagination-a young, blue-eyed British officer dressed in alien robes, riding a camel, single-handedly went deep into the In the hinterland of the enemy&#39;s territory, secretly meeting and winning over potential conspirators, wandering among profit-minded people, and may be betrayed and executed at any time. Then, this hero led the tribal warriors to use ingenious tactics to win a series of incredible victories with less. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Commander-in-Chief of the British Egyptian Army, Wingate, proposed to senior officials in London that Captain Lawrence be awarded the British highest military honor, the Victoria Cross. Soon, he was promoted to colonel and nominated for the knighthood of the third class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the rebellious Lawrence accepted it humbly - official recognition and honors can also be a powerful tool to influence the decision-making of high-level military officials to achieve his goals. The oath made in the desert: break through the &quot;red line&quot; set by the French, burn the war all the way to Syria, and let the British help the Arabs liberate Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing in front of the new Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force in Egypt, Edmund Allenby, he described an exciting battle situation and future prospects. Immediately, Allenby sent an optimistic telegram to William Robertson, the Imperial Chief of Staff. In the end, the general coordinator, who regarded the Western Front as his top priority, promised to send an additional 50,000 troops to the Middle East for the offensive in the Palestinian battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was a key turning point in the Arab Revolts. The person who levered the gears was Lawrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the request of high-level officials, this &quot;popular fried chicken&quot; wrote an experience summary for overseas combat officers to refer to, which is called &quot;Twenty-seven Recommendations&quot;. His most important lesson: abandon British habits and immerse yourself fully in the local environment, becoming familiar with &quot;local families, clans and tribes, friends and enemies, wells, hills and roads.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2006, when the United States launched military operations against Iraq, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army, General David Petraeus, ordered senior military officers to read the &quot;Twenty-Seven Recommendations&quot; and learn from Lawrence how to win local support in Iraq.

This is a huge drain on intelligence, physical strength, and spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more important reason is the increasingly escalating killings. In Seven Pillars of Wisdom, he records the first close execution of a man, who then fell ill. At first, he led the Arabs to fight guerrilla warfare everywhere, trying to avoid killing innocent people. During an ambush, they captured a shepherd boy who bumped into them. Lawrence tied him to a tree to prevent him from informing the Turkish army, and released him before evacuating after the battle. As the war became more and more tense and cruel, he no longer cared about much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Battle of Fulila Gorge in the Battle of Aqaba ended, he described in extremely strange and poignant words how he saw hundreds of stripped Turkish soldiers’ corpses under the moonlight. They looked young, white, and peaceful, which made people feel compassionate. &quot;So I arranged them all neatly, one by one. I was very tired myself, longing to be one of these peaceful people, rather than return to the high valley. Being among those mobs who had no moment of peace, noisy, and pain. Those people were still fighting for the spoils.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the increasingly frequent killings, he seemed to be becoming more and more indifferent and indifferent. The more indifferent. But in a letter to a close friend in Oxford, he confided: &quot;I hope the nightmare is over and I can wake up and live again. Killing people, killing Turks is really terrible.&quot; &quot;I know that I have done this kind of thing hundreds of times.&quot; &quot;Times, if possible, I will do it hundreds more times.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t last long in this game.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boss Clayton has noticed the mental state of this most capable officer. , he admitted that he was very worried about Lawrence&#39;s state, &quot;We will remove him as soon as possible and don&#39;t continue to let him take risks, but the time has not yet come, because he is still needed now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;November 1917 In order to cooperate with the Egyptian expeditionary force&#39;s offensive in Palestine, when Lawrence took a guard to survey the situation near the railway hub of Deraa in Syria, he was arrested by an Ottoman force and then taken to the local governor. Lawrence lied and claimed that he was a civilian from a mountainous ethnic group in the Caucasus. This ethnic group is known for its fair skin and light eyes and is exempt from military service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What follows is the most horrific scene in his entire memoir. Lawrence spends five full pages describing the details of the atrocities he suffered - he was first subjected to bloody violence by the Turkish governor. invaded; then whipped by four soldiers, followed by repeated kicks by the torture officer; and dragged back to the governor&#39;s room. Later he was dumped in a courtyard, and an Armenian came over to debridement and bandage him. The group then walked away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn, Lawrence woke up and stumbled out of the town. With the help of a camel trader, he finds companions and then tells a &quot;joyful story of escaping the clutches of his enemies through bribery and trickery.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People discovered that after returning from Deira, something about Lawrence changed, and he became more aloof and indifferent. Since then, this daring man in the past has organized himself an elite guard of 50 people to accompany him at all times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten months later, when he led the Arab warriors back to the railway town, he ordered a bloody massacre with the flame of revenge, in which more than 4,000 people were killed, which is known in history as &quot; Massacre in Tafas”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mental trauma left by the Della incident on Lawrence was permanent - after the end of the &quot;World War I&quot;, he poured out his inner feelings to Mrs. Bernard Shaw, who he regarded as a confessor-like existence. Feeling defiled and intensely self-loathed, after &quot;that incident&quot; he vowed to &quot;renounce a decent life&quot; from now on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/v7QS17IxA1tkbMuvRygpq9jt1YSkqDU2uuPS7uUx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;747&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/v7QS17IxA1tkbMuvRygpq9jt1YSkqDU2uuPS7uUx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the 1962 movie &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; More and more complications: the Balfour Declaration, Weizmann and Lawrence&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November 1917, the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force successfully broke through the Ottoman army&#39;s defense lines and captured Palestine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Lawrence has learned a piece of news that will make the future situation even more chaotic: at the end of October, the British government cabinet initially passed the &quot;National Homeland&quot; in support of the Zionists in Palestine. &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zionism&quot;, generally called &quot;Zionism&quot; in our country, is a Jewish nationalist trend of thought that calls on Jews scattered around the world to return to their homeland, Palestine, and rebuild Jewish state, rejuvenation of the Jewish nation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of the 19th century, after a new wave of anti-Semitism emerged in Europe, the Jewish-Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl proposed the theory and program of modern Zionism, and held the 1897 First Zionist Congress, creating the World Zionist Organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 1916, the new British Prime Minister David Lloyd George took office. He and Foreign Secretary Balfour were both sympathizers of the Zionist movement, and they were friends with the core figure of the movement, the famous chemist Hay. Met Weizmann. In addition to religious sympathy, this also has real political considerations: after the &quot;World War I&quot; reached a stalemate, both warring parties were aware of the extensive influence of the Zionists and hoped to get their help; but Germany was an ally in the Palestinian area The territory of the Ottoman Empire cannot promise too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 31, 1917, the British government cabinet passed a supportive resolution, and the resulting &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot; officially announced: Support for Zionists in establishing a Jewish &quot;national home&quot; in Palestine. The condition is that the rights of existing local ethnic groups will not be harmed, except for political rights. At that time, Palestine was still a territory of the Ottoman Empire, and the Jews were only a local minority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot; is an important document in the history of the British Empire&#39;s Middle East policy and the founding of the state of Israel. It led to the establishment of the Mandate of Palestine, which later became Israel and the Palestinian territories, so the declaration is also seen as a cause of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as eight months ago, Lawrence published an analysis of the current situation in Syria in the Arab Gazette. He talked about the reasons that have led to the fragmentation of the region, including various conflicts among tribes, ethnic groups, and religions, as well as the many challenges that any outsider who tries to impose his will on Syria will face. Lawrence also pointed out that southern Palestine harbors great hatred for Zionist activists, including Muslims and Christians, and recent events have intensified this natural hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this article was written two years ago, and Lawrence fully anticipated the countless turmoil, conflicts and unrest in the Middle East in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 1918, this article aroused special interest from an American representative to the Middle East named William Yale. The young former employee of an American oil giant was determined to get his country involved in Middle East affairs, so he visited Lawrence to get more relevant information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the meeting, Lawrence had no reservations and even revealed the Arab Insurgent Army&#39;s next military action goals. He also predicted the consequences of the Balfour Declaration: &quot;If a Jewish state is indeed established in Palestine, it can only be established by force and maintained by force among a hostile population.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Some biographers believe that Lawrence did this intentionally. He wanted to use Yale to influence and guide the U.S. government, which had just joined the Allied Powers, to adopt policies towards Syria and Palestine that he approved of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, President Wilson did little at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. It was not until after World War II that the United States completely replaced Britain as the world&#39;s number one hegemon. At the same time, it took over its power in the Middle East and became the most solid ally of modern Israel after its founding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement of the &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot;, together with the exposure of the &quot;Sykes-Picot Agreement&quot;, ignited the fire of anger in the Arab world. In Cairo, Egyptian Muslims, who have always been docile, erupted in mass protests. Syrian exiles are also increasingly concerned about a future Jewish state being imposed on the Palestinian areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ibn Saud, King Hussein of Hijaz’s biggest rival in the Arabian Peninsula, took this opportunity to launch a new round of public opinion onslaught. Ibn Saud came from the Saud family that controlled the Najd region and represented the Islamic retrotist force - the Wahhabi sect. He has always had the ambition to unify the Arabian Peninsula. He declared: King Hussein is a puppet of Western Christianity. But in fact, he himself relied on the support of British India, the colonial arm of the British Empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strong backlash in the Arab world has made Britain greatly uneasy. They pressured Hussein to publicly express his support. Clayton asked Lawrence to persuade Feisal, even though Lawrence had always opposed the agreement between the British government and the Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1918, accompanied by the British, the &quot;Zionist Committee&quot; led by Weizmann visited Egypt and Palestine. In Egypt, he launched a charm offensive with the British and exiled Syrians, repeatedly expressing goodwill for the Zionist cause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 4 of that year, Weizmann personally went to Aqaba to visit Faisal. The atmosphere at the meeting was so cordial that Weizmann even put on an Arab headscarf; Faisal avoided making any substantive commitments, arguing that all decisions rested with his father. Lawrence made excuses to avoid it, no matter how his boss called to pressure him. He has decided that the harmony imposed by the British will only make Faisal and Hussein suffer greater opposition in the Arab world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten days later in Egypt, he still met Weizmann. This sophisticated Jewish political leader knew very well that the key to reaching an understanding with the leaders of the Arab uprisings lay in this little baby-faced British officer. The battle between masters also gave rise to mutual sympathy - Lawrence also admired Weizmann&#39;s exquisite skills. On the one hand, he succeeded in allaying the concerns of the Arabs, and on the other hand, he used another set of words to inspire the fighting spirit of the Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two smart people reached a consensus - if the Jews hope to establish a &quot;national home&quot; in Palestine, they must first let the British win the war, which means they should first support Arab Revolt. Weizmann also offered a tempting &quot;support&quot;: let the International Zionist Movement support the cause of Arab independence, including funds and weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Weizmann&#39;s charm offensive was effective. He convinced most British officials who had been worried about the future of Palestine because of the Balfour Declaration that in Palestine, the Jewish community could and The Arab majority lives together in political and economic harmony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the delight of his superiors, Lawrence seemed less resistant to the Zionist movement. But he&#39;s not that naive either. In a secret report, he sharply pointed out the true vision of the Jewish leader - &quot;In 50 years, the Jews will completely control Palestine, and the current goal is for the Jews to control Palestine under the cover of Britain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1930s, after Hitler came to power in Germany, the Nazis carried out a brutal genocide against the Jews, destroying most of the Jewish community in Europe. As a result, the Zionist movement surged, reaching its peak in 1948. On May 14 of that year, modern Israel was officially established, with Weizmann as its first president. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this happened 20 years earlier than Lawrence had foreseen. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A futile last ditch effort&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In July 1918, Lawrence began planning the long-delayed Arab uprising army to march north to fight in Syria. As events unfolded, it became clearer to him that only in areas liberated by the Arabs themselves could their independence be guaranteed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With Lawrence&#39;s various efforts, a mixed force composed of Arab tribal armed forces, Arab Northern Army soldiers, British and French advisers, and specialized artillery and armored vehicle units gathered in Amman and west of the Jordan River. Thousands of people. Also present were important uprising leaders: Faisal, Auda, and major tribal chiefs including Shara&#39;ang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the eve of the war, a heartbreaking news came - Lawrence&#39;s partner and lover in Carchemish, Dahom, the Syrian boy with a bright smile, died in a war that raged in northern Syria. epidemic of typhoid fever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the title page of &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, he wrote a love poem dedicated to Dahom: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot; I love you, so I hold these thousands of troops in my hands/Write my wishes in the starry sky to win your freedom.../When I drive straight in, your eyes will shine.../You His smile made him (the god of death) jealous and saddened, leaving me, kidnapping you, and imprisoning you in the shadow of his death.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Lawrence, for Dahom&#39;s Love was his initial motivation to win freedom and independence for the Arabs. When his dream was about to come true and his lover had passed away, he was overwhelmed by a huge sense of pain and emptiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war continues. In September 1918, Lawrence received an order from the British Army Command: Let the Arabs completely cut off the railway line south of Daraa, but not rush north to Damascus to cooperate with the British army&#39;s northward movement on the West Bank. They also conveyed a hint to Faisal: if the Arabs remained loyal at this critical time, they would be well compensated and even allowed to establish a government in Damascus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving verbal assurances from the government, Lawrence led and launched the most ferocious attack on the Hejaz Railway in the Daraa area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, in the village of Tafas near Daraa, which had seriously traumatized Lawrence, he and the Arab troops saw the atrocities left by a retreating Allied force. : There are mutilated corpses everywhere, and the naked and bloody bodies of girls and women are obviously raped and killed; on a low wall, there is a naked pregnant woman who has been penetrated by a bayonet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence then issued an order: No prisoners would be accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The massacre continued all night and continued into the next day. A total of more than 4,000 captured Allied soldiers died in the killing, which was the famous &quot;Tafas Massacre&quot; in &quot;World War I&quot;. Early the next morning, Lawrence entered the town of Dara. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A British general led his troops to arrive here later. What he witnessed was filthy, barbaric and cruel. How the Arab soldiers tortured and robbed the Turkish patients who were groaning in pain on the medical train. &quot;Anyone Ordinary civilized people cannot bear such a tragic scene.&quot; When he complained to Lawrence, Lawrence told him calmly and gently: This is the Arabs&#39; &quot;war concept.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Battle of Daraa, the Ottoman army had collapsed across the board. General Allenby sent a warm congratulatory letter to Faisal, saying: &quot;I express to His Highness my best wishes and my sincere congratulations on the great achievements of your troops... Thanks to our joint efforts, the Turkish army is now in retreat across the board. .&quot; He then ordered: Leave the honor of entering Damascus first to Faisal&#39;s army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, 1918, at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus, British Commander-in-Chief Allenby and Faisal met. Lawrence acted as translator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;General Allenby announced: The status of the Arabs as a participant in the war has been recognized by the Allied Powers; on the issue of Syrian independence, Faisal has no choice, and France will become the &quot;sovereign power&quot; to protect Syria; Faisal As King Hussein&#39;s representative, &quot;will have jurisdiction over Syria&quot; but &quot;under the guidance and financial support of France&quot; and his jurisdiction will be &quot;limited to the interior of Syria&quot;, excluding Palestine and Lebanon; France will give Faisal is assigned a liaison officer who will work alongside Lawrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence and Faisal were stunned. Faisal objected vehemently at first, but eventually gave in under pressure from Allenby. Exhausted and disappointed, Lawrence turned to the general for leave. The general finally agreed. He left Damascus the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Debacle at the negotiating table&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In December 1918, before the Paris Peace Conference, British Prime Minister Lloyd George and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau spent five minutes negotiating A vision for the Middle East was agreed: the British would control Mesopotamia and Palestine; the French would have control over Syria. In addition to establishing the basic structure of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, they also went beyond it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Paris Peace Conference, Lawrence, wearing an Arab robe, served as Faisal&#39;s adviser and continued to work for the cause of Arab independence, participating in speeches and negotiations as an interpreter, organizing press conferences and guiding newspaper public opinion. This left an indelible impression on the famous historian Arnold J. Toynbee, who was also present at the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Clemenceau, who was extremely angry, went to the British delegation to report Lawrence, and called the young man to reprimand him face to face. The French Prime Minister, nicknamed the &quot;Tiger&quot;, asked in a face-to-face manner: &quot;Colonel Lawrence, do you know that France has had interests in Syria since the Crusades?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence replied: &quot;Yes. I know. . But the Syrians defeated the Crusaders, and we will never forget that.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Clemenceau was rendered speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;This is a tortured soul. I think Lawrence realized while in Paris that, for all his success in the Arab cause, he had not yet won,&quot; Toynbee wrote . &quot;This made Lawrence very distressed, but the pain did not wear away his sense of humor. He was a little great and a little naughty.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blending of Britain and France destroyed the ideal that Lawrence swore to fight for— —National independence of the Arabs. For the big shots of the British Empire, &quot;Hero Lawrence&quot; has become a problem. In a memo, they called it a &quot;detrimental effect&quot; that was &quot;largely at the root of our troubles with France over Syria.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence was eventually disqualified from attending the Paris Peace Conference and was prohibited from assisting Feisal at the conference. He lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, he still made a remarkable effort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the eve of the Paris Peace Conference in December 1918, with his help, Faisal, a representative of the Arab world, and Weizmann, the leader of the Zionist movement, drafted a joint statement announcing their willingness to cooperate. . The fourth article is: &quot;All necessary measures should be taken to encourage and promote large-scale immigration of Jews to Palestine&quot;, followed by a key conditional sentence - the agreement &quot;is only valid under the condition of independence of the Syrian area; if this condition is not met, conditions, it is completely ineffective.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Faisal also spoke kindly of the &quot;ethnic kinship and ancient bonds&quot; between Arabs and Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Palestine, the incompatible Arabs and Zionists also joined hands to establish a joint Arab-Jewish state. However, is Lawrence&#39;s effort really possible? ——If he had succeeded in 1918, would an independent pan-Arab state have been born? If history had happened as agreed between Faisal and Weizmann, would Arab-Israeli/Palestinian-Israeli living in harmony with each other? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a descendant of Lawrence who is separated by a century, it is difficult for me to be optimistic - throughout the modern history of the Middle East, every time there is a glimmer of reconciliation, there will be extremist forces launching targeted assassinations and sabotage operations. On the list of victims were Abdullah, the second son of Hussein and the first king of Jordan, Sadat, the president of Egypt, and Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who promoted &quot;land for peace&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Modern The birth of the Middle East - the man who defined the territory and supported the king&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the Paris Peace Conference in the autumn of 1919, after losing the help of Lawrence, Faisal had to accept the conditions given by the French. Returning to Damascus, he found himself denounced as a traitor who had betrayed his country to European imperialism. He instead took advantage of popular anger, tore up the agreement with the French in 1920, launched a palace coup, and declared himself king of Greater Syria. In April of the same year, Syria was handed over to France. In July, France won the Battle of Mesalon and Faisal went into exile in England. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, history has taken another trajectory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The French, who controlled the Syrian region, did not have a good life - Abdullah launched a continuous and fierce attack on them from Transjordan. The British had more headaches: in Palestine, conflicts between Palestinians and Jewish settlers continued to escalate; in Mesopotamia, anti-British uprisings broke out, with bloodshed and confrontation everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1920, former Admiralty Secretary Winston Churchill returned and later became Colonial Secretary in the Lloyd George cabinet. He extended an invitation to Lawrence, who had been relegated to the sidelines, and asked him to serve as head of the Middle East Affairs Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A frustrated Lawrence said that he was busy writing his memoirs and had no interest in politics anymore. Churchill then repeatedly promised that at the upcoming Cairo Conference, he would be granted almost complete freedom of power to help Britain reshape its part of the Middle East chessboard. Lawrence agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to what he told a biographer: The Cairo Conference in March 1921 was just a formality. Before the meeting, he and Churchill &quot;not only determined what issues the conference would consider, but also what would be discussed.&quot; What resolution was reached?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the resolution, Britain handed over two pieces of former Ottoman territory it controlled to the Hashemite family. Both parties agreed: Prince Faisal became the king of the new country in Mesopotamia, the Kingdom of Iraq; his brother Prince Abdullah ruled the new country east of the Jordan River and consisted of part of Palestine, today&#39;s Kingdom of Jordan. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was based on two ideas that Lawrence had been fighting for: First, the Arabs had to gain control of their own land. Second, the Arabs who were given this power were members of the Hashemite family, the leaders of the uprising: King Hussein and his sons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawrence&#39;s efforts brought a period of peace to the Middle East and partially fulfilled his promise to the Arabs during the Great Revolt. It is generally believed that at the Cairo Conference in 1921, Lawrence played a greater role than Churchill - in the end, he really became the person who defined the borders and established the king in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Anatolia, the former Ottoman general Mustafa Kemal led Turkish nationalists to defeat all those who tried to carve up the country. In 1923, he signed a treaty with the Allies, defining the territory of modern Turkey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the south, King Hussein of the Hejaz refused to accept the realpolitik of the Middle East, and even Lawrence was powerless to persuade him. His stubbornness and erratic behavior eventually tired the British government. The old enemy Ibn Saud took advantage of this contradiction and led Wahhabi warriors to approach Mecca in 1924. Hussein took refuge in Cyprus due to betrayal and separation from his relatives, and later reunited with his second son Abdullah in Amman, the capital of New Jordan. Hussein died in June 1931 and was buried in Jerusalem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The winner Ibn Saud established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after annexing Hejaz. In 1927, the British recognized its independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a brief period of peace, new turmoil began again. In 1946, the French were finally forced to abandon Greater Syria, but carved out a new country - Lebanon. In 1958, Iraqi nationalists launched a military coup and overthrew the pro-British regime, and Faisal&#39;s only son, Faisal II, was executed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, the era of Western colonialism came to an end. Because it has 60% of the world&#39;s oil resources, the Middle East seems to be cursed and continues to become the most unstable corner of geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;When Death Caught Me&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1921, when Lawrence was working for Churchill, he wrote to a friend: &quot;The Arabs are like me. Turn the page, sequels are something I hate.” After World War I, he suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was constantly disturbed by nightmares, fell into severe depression many times, and even had thoughts of suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting in 1920, Lawrence rewrote his autobiography based on his notes and memories and completed the war memoir &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;. He printed 8 copies with a hand-operated printing press and gave them to friends. Later, in response to strong public demand, he compromised and published an abridged version of the book in 1926, along with a popular version of &quot;Revolt in the Desert&quot;, which was a market success. Lawrence donated all royalties to charity and refused to reprint &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; during his lifetime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He could never return to his old life as a scholar. In 1922, after ending his service in the British Government&#39;s Colonial Office, he assumed the alias John Hume Ross and joined the Royal Air Force as a private, but was soon discovered by the press. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He changed his name to Thomas Edward Shaw and continued to serve in the army, escaping the press and public who pursued him. In the last ten years of his life, he lived a solitary life, using various excuses to turn down invitations from friends, even his closest friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faisal, who became the King of Iraq, and Lawrence later met twice, once in 1925. Faced with the life and death acquaintance who had fought side by side, Lawrence was at a loss what to do, and the two were speechless for a time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Faisal visited Britain in 1933, he once again asked to see Lawrence. Lawrence&#39;s attitude was negative. Later, Faisal had to rely on military orders to meet &quot;Private Xiao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 13, 1935, Lawrence rode a motorcycle to Bovington Military Camp to send a telegram. On the way back, we encountered a traffic accident. After being in a coma in the military hospital for six days, he died in the early morning of May 19 at the age of 46. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the dark clouds of &quot;World War II&quot; approached, Churchill, who was stuck in the &quot;confused years&quot;, came to mourn and wrote a eulogy that only politicians can truly resonate with: &quot;In my eyes, he is the greatest figure of our time. One...I fear that no matter how much we need him, there will never be another like him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;(References: &quot;Wisdom&quot; Seven Pillars, by T. E.

By telling the stories of different farmers, the author launched a discussion of different themes, involving farming, working, mechanical cultivation, crop planting adventure, farmhouses, agricultural industrialization, rural governance, rural revitalization and other aspects.

This year, CITIC Publishing House has launched the &quot;Biography of Kissinger&quot; by the famous American biographical writer, Esther,. I am interested in the early experience of Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Kissinger is a Jewish refugee. At the age of 11 in 1938, he fled from Germany to the United States with his family. Earlier, he was discriminated against and persecuted in Phil in Phil in Germany, and he felt uncomfortable when he was young. Fields is not big. Except for Jewish children in the city, they are almost all members of the &quot;Hitler Youth Group&quot;. He and his younger brother stood on the street and saw that they were wearing uniforms, queueing, and marching neatly. Participation. On the contrary, he and his younger brother were ridiculed everywhere. Soon he could not go to the swimming pool or dancing or not to go to the teahouse ... There are more and more places that have &quot;Jewish ban&quot; sign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; After immigrating to the United States, the parents worked for people, and the income was not high. Kissinger read a year in high school and had to read the &quot;night school&quot;. Work during the day and study at night. His job is to work in a shaving of a relative, wearing thick rubber gloves, squeezing solution and water on the brush. The weekly salary was $ 11, and later upgraded to the delivery staff, responsible for delivery, and the weekly salary rose to $ 30. Colleagues recalled that he was often absent -minded when he was working, and he had a chance to read books or do night school homework. His early experience was quite &quot;inspirational&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; The painful childhood experience had an unforgettable impact on him. &quot;For Kissinger, the massacre destroying the connection between God&#39;s will and historical progress -this is the core belief of Jewish religion and the most important contribution to Jewish religion to Western philosophy. For Jews with faith, history The significance should be understood from the connection between it and God&#39;s will. But after witnessing the Nazi evil deeds, Kissinger abandoned Jewish faith. When Harvard studied, the young student began to be academic from academic aspects. Exploring other methods of finding historical significance. &quot;His inner academic&quot; module &quot;has always been Europe, not the United States, and loves Kant, Hegel, Metne, and Dostaevsky very much, but never never, but never has never been Protestant characters representing the creativity of the United States, such as Mark Twain, Jefferson, Franklin, etc. Childhood experience formed his basic idea: pursuing order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;img alt = &quot;src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/49220d026c. jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1588 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/49220d026c.jpg &quot;data- key = &quot;260431&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>; [beauty] Perry Miller: &quot;Endless Disputes: American Thinking Life from Revolution to Civil War&quot; , July 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In recent years, Oriental Publishing House has planned and published the &quot;American Civilization Classic Translation Series&quot;.

The remains are suspected by the police to be the six Chinese citizens who were kidnapped on October 30: including Mr. Zeng and his wife who are presidents of local Chinese charity organizations in the Philippines, brother Zeng and his wife, and brother Zeng’s teenage son. son, and one person remains unidentified. On November 28, the Philippine police confirmed the identities of four corpses, including Mr. Zeng’s two brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, vicious cases involving overseas Chinese have occurred in some overseas countries: In May 2023, a Chinese couple died naked in a Bali hotel; in 2023, a Chinese student was murdered in Thailand on &quot;3·31&quot;... …In addition to these brutal cases, the criminal system of the warlords in northern Myanmar is basically tailor-made for the Chinese people. The number of Chinese people they have killed and the seriousness of their crimes are really too numerous to describe. Recently, the &quot;Ming Family&quot; in northern Myanmar, which specializes in telecommunications fraud, has reached the end of its rope and is about to be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the country&#39;s economic development, foreign economic, trade and cultural exchanges have increased, and Chinese people at home and abroad have more and more interactions with the world. Opportunities are always accompanied by challenges, and contradictions, conflicts, and dangers are everywhere. How to ensure one&#39;s personal and property safety, as well as legal rights, has become increasingly important. Examples of self-security and collective security for overseas Chinese can be found in the Korean community living in North America and the Jewish community scattered around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Korea has a small population, and even fewer people live in the world. However, a small number of Korean immigrants (mainly immigrants from South Korea) became a bright spot in the &quot;Los Angeles Riots&quot; in 1992: After the U.S. police temporarily gave up protecting communities of color, a small number of Korean immigrants united and armed themselves for self-defense , took up arms to defend the community, resisting the onslaught of thugs, and held on until the National Guard entered the city to quell the violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For decades, Koreans have deeply felt the importance of external unity. Their overseas immigrants have strengthened internal unity, taking advantage of North American citizens&#39; gun-carrying laws to arm themselves for self-defense and strengthen their martial spirit. Therefore, even though the 1.65 million Korean immigrants only account for 0.5% of the U.S. population, North American residents know that Koreans are not easy to mess with and they dare to use guns in critical moments. Therefore, the thugs of the &quot;Los Angeles Riots&quot; were unable to capture the strongholds held by Korean armed forces, so they looted Chinese stores because the Chinese generally lacked the ability to defend themselves at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before World War II, the Jewish community was known for being disunited, disorganized, shrewd and philanthropic, and gentle and cowardly. It is said that there are 12 branches of Judaism since ancient times. There are so many factions and small groups below. The Jews who run banks are greedy for money and are unwilling to help others. Therefore, few people are willing to help them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to better integrate into European society, the Jews not only accepted many Western living habits, but also tried to avoid confrontation when they had conflicts with the indigenous peoples. Therefore, various European ethnic groups have long scorned the military value of the Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During World War II, the Holocaust in Nazi Germany nearly annihilated European Jewry, which changed the spirit, character, and psychology of some Jews. After the war, some Jews reached several consensuses:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, they must build their own country and make it strong, rather than just being nomads in the world. When conflicts involving the Jewish community occur again, it cannot only rely on money, but also on the state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it is still necessary to maintain the simultaneous existence of Jews in various parts of the world to spread the risks of survival in case one country is defeated and the entire race is annihilated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, money alone is not enough. To survive, you must have the ability to defend yourself. The two words &quot;wealth and strength&quot; are indispensable. If we are not rich, we cannot afford advanced weapons and equipment and cannot build a strong army, so we cannot be strong; if we are not strong, we cannot maintain wealth for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, Jews have self-defense groups in many communities around the world. Especially in North America, we make full use of local laws and policies to conduct paramilitary training and have a considerable number of foreign reserve soldiers. On October 7, 2023, just hours after the war in Gaza broke out, a large number of Jewish young people from North America and Australia flew to Israel to join the war, with a total number of tens of thousands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through arduous efforts, the Jews have changed to a certain extent the customs of their ethnic group, which were previously fragmented, fighting among themselves, and trying to undermine each other (but there is still a clear distinction between their modern factions and the &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;). It not only engages in &quot;hiding troops among the people&quot; around the world, but also forms an underground intelligence network connecting the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, Israel is a miniature country with a population of only a few million, and its intelligence agency &quot;Mossad&quot; does not have sufficient funds (like the CIA). Especially in the early stages of construction and development, it can be said that there is little money to be had, and even poverty can lead to poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1960, the Nazi war criminal Eichmann was captured; in the 1970s, the &quot;Black September&quot; terrorist organization was hunted around the world. &quot;Mossad&quot; can only send out a small range of troops, and the budget is tight. Each person only has a few dollars per day for food, and cannot afford to live in a hotel or buy a car. They move around the world and live in old houses provided by local Jews. Some of them don&#39;t even have beds and can only make beds on the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With that little activity fund, not only can’t I afford a restaurant, I can’t even afford takeout. I had no choice but to give the money to the local Jewish contacts, who would buy ingredients from the mall on their behalf and cook the food themselves. It is simply impossible for a &quot;Mossad&quot; agent to drive an Aston Martin sports car as elegantly as in spy movies. The vehicles used in many operations were all old cars borrowed from local Jews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the grass-roots teams in the early days when Koreans and Jews established their own power networks in the world, the number of Chinese people and wealth they have around the world is really much stronger. But it is a pity that Chinese expatriates with huge wealth cannot even effectively protect their personal safety and property safety. Malicious anti-Chinese and crimes against Chinese expatriates occur frequently around the world. As for the large number of violent crimes against Chinese people mentioned above, many Chinese gangsters were involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is really regrettable and heartbreaking. The reason is that there is still internal strife among overseas Chinese and there is serious internal friction in their strength. Some Chinese friends in North America vividly told me how they tried to undermine each other in business, criticized each other culturally, and even colluded with &quot;Ghost Cap&quot; (foreign police) to punish each other. The speaker was very excited, beaming, and dancing. When he was excited, his saliva sprayed into my face. This is really heartbreaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, Chinese people at home and abroad have more and more interactions with the world. Contradictions, conflicts, and dangers are everywhere. How to ensure their personal and property safety, as well as their legal rights, has become increasingly difficult. The more important it is. The basis of all this is first of all the unity of the ethnic group. In this regard, we should really think about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[甘肃酒泉市肃北县发生5.0级地震]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261710]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 23:17:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;China Seismological Network officially determined: December 01, 22:55 in Subei County, Jiuquan City, Gansu Province ( A magnitude 5.0 earthquake occurred at 39.30 degrees north latitude and 97.27 degrees east longitude, with a focal depth of 9 kilometers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/1025/process/3ec8970a6e864b58b291bb70ede4aeb0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height= &quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/1025/process/3ec8970a6e864b58b291bb70ede4aeb0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1701443803135-0&quot; data-mce-width =&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[蔚来“朋友圈”再扩容，车企为何统一换电？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261667]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;As of November 28, 2023, NIO has built 2,184 battery swap stations around the world .Visual China/Picture&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/c93d06ff6e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/01/c93d06ff6e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260321&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ; text-align: center;&quot;>;As of November 28, 2023, NIO has built 2,184 power swap stations around the world. Visual China/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following Changan Automobile (000625.SZ), NIO (09866.HK, NYSE:NIO) has made another success with its battery swap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2023, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Geely Holding) and NIO officially signed a strategic cooperation agreement on battery swapping in Hangzhou. The two parties will work on battery swapping standards and battery swapping technology. , carry out comprehensive cooperation in various fields such as battery swap service network construction and operation, battery swap model R&amp;D and customization, battery asset management and operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the agreement, in the future, the two parties will create two major battery swap standard systems for &quot;private cars&quot; and &quot;commercial vehicles&quot; through the &quot;co-investment, co-construction, sharing, and co-operation&quot; model to promote vehicle-end , station end, battery end, and operation end are connected and coordinated to expand the scale of the battery swap network to meet users with different needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 20, NIO founder Li Bin revealed in an internal speech to all employees that in addition to Changan Automobile, there are 4-5 potential partners currently being negotiated. In other words, more car companies may join NIO&#39;s &quot;circle of friends&quot; for battery swapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei, the expert committee of the China Automobile Dealers Association, told Southern Weekend reporters that the expansion of the &quot;circle of friends&quot; for battery swapping has a strategic significance higher than the practical level, and it will have a limited effect on improving their respective revenue in the short term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, the initial cooperation between the parties is exploratory and may start with operating vehicles such as online ride-hailing. &quot;If the results are good, it may be upgraded to more important models or high-value models.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are only two roads in front of you&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, a piece of news &quot;NIO lost 76.4 billion in five and a half years&quot; appeared on Weibo&#39;s hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2018 to 2022, NIO’s net profits attributable to the parent company were -23.328 billion yuan, -11.413 billion yuan, -5.611 billion yuan, -10.572 billion yuan and -14.559 billion yuan respectively. In the first half of 2023, NIO&#39;s net profit attributable to its parent company continued to suffer a loss of 10.926 billion yuan, with a cumulative loss of 76.4 billion yuan in 5.5 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although at the recent Guangzhou Automobile Industry Development Conference, NIO co-founder and president Qin Lihong emphasized that &quot;NIO will never go bankrupt, and it is impossible for it to go bankrupt.&quot; But it is undeniable that Weilai has invested too much in “peripheral products” and its sales have declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Li Bin’s internal speech to all employees was also on the hot search. He said that the road to battery replacement is very difficult, but it is difficult and the right thing to do. &quot;Everyone thinks of battery replacement as Amazon doing cloud services in 2003, as well as Alibaba, Tencent, Microsoft, etc. They have suffered losses for many years. Only then did we finally achieve success.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NIO and NIO’s battery swap are always accompanied by controversy. The construction of a service system with power exchange as the core is regarded as the main reason for NIO&#39;s losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan, NIO will deploy a total of 2,300 power swap stations in 2023. As of November 28, NIO has built 2,184 power stations around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the cost of each generation of NIO&#39;s three generations of power swap stations is slightly different, if based on a rough calculation of the 3 million yuan cost of each power swap station stated by Qin Lihong at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show, NIO&#39;s power swap performance will be The cumulative investment has exceeded 6.5 billion yuan. This does not include additional expenses such as venue rental, personnel operations and electricity expenses. Based on NIO’s goal of adding 1,000 battery swap stations in 2023, the cost of building the stations alone will be as high as 3 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Fei, NIO’s vice president in charge of NIO Power, revealed at a press conference in March that the battery swap station had to serve 50-60 orders per day to achieve breakeven. At that time, NIO’s battery swap station averaged 35 orders per day. -36 orders. The implication is that Weilai is still in the loss-making stage when it comes to battery replacement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei believes that NIO positions itself as a luxury brand and provides services such as battery replacement and user rights to make up for the lack of product and brand power. It has indeed played a very good role in brand building in the early stage. However, as investment increased, its sales volume did not increase significantly, but instead became a huge burden. &quot;Keeping it has limited use, just throw it away. It&#39;s a pity.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are only two ways in front of Weilai, either to sell more cars and dilute the power exchange network construction from within. or introduce more car companies to participate in NIO’s power swap network to create a scale effect and alleviate financial difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Weilai has already had clues about opening up the battery swap business. At the China Electric Vehicles 100 People Forum held in April 2023, Li Bin said that &quot;the battery swap service has reached the stage where it can be exported to the outside world.&quot; He hoped that other companies can share and build charging and swap infrastructure with NIO, and revealed that there are already Car companies are discussing this matter with NIO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Yuwu, honorary chairman of the Society of Automotive Engineers of China, told Southern Weekend reporters that as the current battery swap model has not yet found a profit model, there are only more battery swap stations and a more convenient energy replenishment experience. Only then can more users be willing to buy battery-exchange models, thus forming a positive cycle. NIO&#39;s cooperation with Geely, Changan and other automobile manufacturers will help promote the battery swap model on a larger scale, improve the overall operating efficiency of the battery swap model, and may solve the commercialization problem of battery swap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Or start from online car-hailing services&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The battery swap model laid out by NIO does have many advantages. For example, it only takes less than 5 minutes for car owners to replace the battery at the battery swap station. However, the disadvantage is that the battery swap model still faces problems such as high website construction costs, uncertain commercialization models, and inconsistent industry standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, there are several companies on the market that are trying to lay out the power swap model, but the construction of power swap stations is independent of each other. Since 2020, relevant national departments have continued to promote the formulation of standards for battery swap stations and battery packs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 World Power Battery Conference, Xin Guobin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, revealed an important signal. Currently, a battery replacement technology standard system is being studied and compiled to promote battery replacement battery size, battery replacement interface, Standards such as communication protocols are unified. At the same time, relevant departments have also entered into the inspection process for the national battery replacement station standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Yuwu believes that each car company has different models and batteries. In the context of cooperation, battery swapping may require a transition period to improve the versatility of the battery swapping network. &quot;However, it can force companies to make better efforts in standardization, which is of key significance to the structural adjustment of the battery swap model.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, some people question that unified battery swap operation management may affect Wei Come to the battery swapping experience of existing users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike NIO’s battery swap model, most car companies are betting on high-voltage fast charging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 800V high-voltage fast charging platform is currently regarded as the most likely technology path. In 2019, Porsche launched the Taycan, the world&#39;s first 800V high-voltage platform model. Automobile manufacturers such as BYD, Xpeng, Great Wall, Geely Jikrypton, etc. have all begun relevant layouts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the long term, 800V will be an opportunity to reshape the battery industry,” Li Bin said at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show. “But no company has yet been able to reduce the cost of 800V to close to that of the current 400V. or a slightly higher level.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei also believes that high-voltage charging costs are high and is currently mainly used in relatively high-end models. It is unlikely that the technology will be transferred to low-end models in the short term. In addition, the layout of high-voltage charging piles is still imperfect, and an absolute advantage over the battery swap model has not yet been established in the short term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Liu Jinliang, CEO of Yiyi Internet Technology Co., Ltd., signed the power exchange cooperation with NIO on behalf of Geely Yifang this time. He has led Geely&#39;s travel business in recent years, and has been responsible for Caocao Private Car, Yao Travel and other sectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yanwei said that online car-hailing may be the first area of ​​cooperation between the two parties. Due to cost control, operating vehicles such as taxis and online ride-hailing vehicles mostly use lithium iron phosphate batteries. The batteries are used frequently, so the demand for battery replacement will be higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 01 Dec 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海底捞“科目三”爆火，有创意还是“辣眼睛”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261690]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-01 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Chatting is not as good as dancing.
