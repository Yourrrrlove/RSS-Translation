Modern mathematics is no longer just a few traditional subjects such as geometry, algebra, and analysis. It has become a knowledge system with many branches and a complex structure, and it is still developing and changing. The characteristics of mathematics are not only strict logic, but also add two other characteristics, namely high degree of abstraction and wide application, and thus form two major scopes of modern mathematics research, namely pure mathematics and applied mathematics. Some of the latter developed the computer, which, apart from its importance, has provided more employment to mankind than all other branches of mathematics put together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pure mathematics was initially driven by two factors, namely the penetration of set theory and the application of axiomatic methods. Set theory was originally founded by Cantor in the late 19th century. It was opposed by many great mathematicians, including Kronecker. It was later recognized because of its increasingly obvious role in mathematics. Sets were initially built on number sets or point sets, and soon the scope of the definition was expanded to include any set of elements, such as a set of functions, a set of geometric figures, etc. This has allowed set theory to enter different fields of mathematics as a universal language, causing profound changes in basic concepts such as integrals, functions, and spaces in mathematics. At the same time, it has stimulated the differences between intuitionism and formalism in mathematical logic that will be discussed in this article. Further development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor was a Dane born in St. Petersburg. His Jewish parents did business in Russia when they were young, and their business expanded to Hamburg, London and even New York. Like Kelly, he can be said to be a role model for the children of businessmen outside the country, but Cantor&#39;s grandparents came to St. Petersburg. At the age of 11, Cantor moved to Germany with his parents, where he spent most of his life. He went to high school in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and later went to Zurich, Switzerland, and several universities in Germany. He gradually fell in love with mathematics and decided to make it his career, although his talent in painting once made his family proud. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cantor&#39;s eyes, a set is a totality of objects, whether they are finite or infinite. When using one-to-one correspondence to study sets, he came to a surprising result: rational numbers are countable, that is, they can correspond to natural numbers one-to-one. At the same time, he proved that all real numbers are uncountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Cantor also gave a non-constructive proof of the existence of transcendental numbers. In fact, Cantor proved that algebraic numbers are countable just like rational numbers, and that real numbers are uncountable. In this way, since all algebraic numbers and transcendental numbers constitute the real numbers, transcendental numbers not only exist but are much more numerous than algebraic numbers. The study of transcendental numbers later became a landscape of number theory research in the 20th century. However, when Cantor determined that infinity was a real existence, he was opposed and attacked by his colleagues for a long time, especially Kronecker (1823-1891), a Jewish professor at the University of Berlin. The latter was not only an outstanding mathematician but also a successful mathematician. businessman and the most powerful fighter in scientific debates, while Cantor was so weak and incompetent that he spent his entire life as a professor at a third-rate university, although the truth was on his side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor introduced the theory of cardinal numbers to set theory, calling the cardinal number of all integers Alev zero, and calling the subsequent larger cardinal numbers Alev one, Alev two, and so on ( Aleph is a Hebrew letter and Cantor is also Jewish). That is, he classified the infinite. He also proved that the cardinality of the entire set of real numbers is greater than Alev zero. This leads to the so-called Cantor continuum hypothesis: there is no other cardinality between Aleph zero and the cardinality of all real numbers. At the beginning of the 20th century, when the German mathematician Hilbert delivered his famous &quot;Mathematical Problems&quot; speech at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, he listed this hypothesis or conjecture at the forefront of the 23 mathematical problems left for the 20th century (Transcendental Number Problem is listed at No. 7). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Cantor discovered that the &quot;mathematical body&quot; was seriously ill and that the disease transmitted to it by Zeno in ancient Greece had not been relieved, he couldn&#39;t help but want to cure it. However, his Promethean attack on the infinite problem caused his own nervous breakdown when he was only 40 years old. He died much later in a mental hospital in central Germany. The year after Hilbert gave his speech, Russell also expressed his views:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeno cared about Three problems: infinitesimal, infinite and continuous. The best minds of every generation have tried to solve these problems, but literally, they have gotten nowhere. ...Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor solved them thoroughly. Their answers were so clear that they no longer left any doubt. This achievement may be the greatest that this era can boast. ...The problem of infinitesimals was solved by Weierstrass, the solution of the other two problems was started by Dedekind and finally completed by Cantor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The axiomatic method was summarized by Euclid as early as the ancient Greek era and adopted in his famous work &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;. As we all know, this book uses 5 postulates and 5 axioms. However, the axiom system proposed by Euclid is not perfect. The German mathematician Hilbert redefined the modern axiomatic method. He pointed out, &quot;Whether these objects are points, lines, surfaces, tables, chairs, or beer glasses, they can all become such geometric objects. For them, , the relationships expressed by the axioms are all true.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take points, lines, and surfaces as examples. Euclid gave these objects descriptive definitions, but in Hilbert&#39;s eyes they are all These are purely abstract objects with no specific concrete content. In addition, Hilbert also examined the interrelationships between the axioms and clearly put forward the basic logical requirements for the axiom system, namely compatibility, independence and completeness. Of course, axiomatization is just a method and is not as rich in content as set theory. Nevertheless, Hilbert&#39;s axiomatic method not only gave geometry a strict logical foundation, but also gradually penetrated into other fields of mathematics, becoming a powerful tool for synthesizing and refining mathematical knowledge and promoting specific mathematical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hilbert was born in 1861 on the outskirts of Königsberg in East Prussia, which now belongs to the divided Russian territory, surrounded by Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea, and has long been renamed Kaliningrad. Although the greatest citizen born in that city was the philosopher Immanuel Kant (who spent his entire life in this remote city), he had an indissoluble bond with mathematics. It turns out that the Pregel River flowing through the city is divided into two branches. There are seven bridges on the river, five of which connect the river bank to a small island in the river. So a mathematical problem arises. Suppose that a person can only cross each bridge. Can you cross all seven bridges once? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seemingly simple problem later became the starting point of topology and was solved by the Swiss mathematician Euler. However, it was a boy from the same city who was two years younger than him, Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), who directly guided Hilbert firmly on the path of mathematics. Hermann was born in Kaunas, Russia (now Lithuania), and moved to Königsberg with his family when he was 8 years old, just across the river from Hilbert&#39;s family. This talented Jewish boy won the Mathematics Prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences just after he turned 18. His 6-year-old brother Oscar is the &quot;father of insulin&quot; and discovered the connection between insulin and diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Associating with such a peerless talent, Hilbert&#39;s talent was not only not buried, but was honed and hoarded, prompting him to work quietly and lay a more solid foundation. The friendship between the two men (who later became brothers) lasted for a quarter of a century, stretching from Königsberg to Göttingen. Minkowski later died young of acute appendicitis, while Hilbert lived to Over eighty years old, he has accomplished the great achievements of a generation of masters. In 1900, Hilbert raised 23 mathematical problems at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, which pointed the direction for the development of mathematics in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstraction of mathematics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory and the axiomatic method gradually became the paradigm of mathematical abstraction in the 20th century. After they are combined with each other, they become more It has the power to lead the development of mathematics to a more abstract path, leading to the rise of the four major branches of abstract mathematics: real variable function theory, functional analysis, topology and abstract algebra in the first half of the 20th century. They can be called the four abstract branches. The flower of mathematics. Interestingly, the five mathematicians mentioned in the previous section (including Kronecker) are all Germans. They may be one of the nations best at abstract thinking. Mathematics is of course the most abstract branch of science, and Germany is also home to a large number of talents, whether in the most abstract art - music, or in the most abstract humanities and social sciences - philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory first caused the reform of integral calculus, which led to the establishment of the theory of real variable functions. At the end of the 19th century, the rigor of analysis forced many mathematicians to seriously consider so-called &quot;ill-conditioned functions&quot;, such as the everywhere continuous but everywhere non-differentiable function defined by Weierstrass, and the everywhere defined by Gauss&#39;s student Dirichlet. Discontinuous function. On this basis, mathematicians have studied how to extend the concept of integrals to a wider class of functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first person to succeed in this regard was the French mathematician Lebesgue (1875-1941). He used set theory methods to define the concept of measure (Lebesgue measure) as the successor to the original concept of &quot;length&quot;. Generalization, the so-called Lebesgue integral was established, thus generalizing the concept of definite integral. On this basis, the reciprocity of differential operations and integral operations was used to reconstruct the basic theorem of calculus of Newton and Leibniz, thus forming a new branch of mathematics - the theory of real variable functions. Likewise, this new thing was rebuked by some mathematical authorities, and Lebesgue himself was unable to find a job for almost 10 years after publishing the results. Today, people refer to Lebesgue&#39;s previous analysis as classical analysis, and his subsequent analysis as modern analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to real variable function theory, another important component of modern analysis is functional analysis. The so-called &quot;functional&quot; can be regarded as &quot;a function of functions&quot;. This term was introduced by the French mathematician Hadamard (1865-1963, famous for being the first to prove the prime number theorem in number theory). Many mathematicians have made important contributions in the theory of functional analysis. Among them, Hilbert introduced a set of infinite real numbers. After defining concepts and operations such as &quot;inner product&quot;, he established the first infinite-dimensional space. , the so-called Hilbert space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the viewpoint of set theory helped to establish real variable function theory and functional analysis, axiomatic methods were also penetrating into the field of mathematics. The most representative result was the formation of abstract algebra. Since Galois proposed the concept of groups, it has developed from finite groups and discrete groups to infinite groups and continuous groups. Algebraic objects are also expanding, and other algebraic systems are further produced, such as rings, fields, lattice, ideals, etc. Since then, the center of algebraic research has shifted to algebraic structures. This structure consists of a number of binary composite operations between the elements of the set. It has the following characteristics: first, the elements of the set must be abstract; second, the operations are performed through stipulated by axioms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is generally believed that the &quot;Ideal Theory in Rings&quot; published by the German mathematician Noether (1882-1935) in 1921 is the beginning of abstract algebra. She is one of the most innovative mathematicians in this field. , and her disciples are all over the world. Noether is considered to be the greatest female mathematician to date, that is to say, surpassing the four famous female mathematicians before her, namely Hypatia of ancient Greece and Agnesi (1718-1799) of modern Italy. ), Germain of France (1776-1831) and Kovalevskaya of Russia. Despite this, due to gender discrimination, Noether was not able to be a lecturer at the University of Göttingen for a long time. Until the Nazi government came to power, she was not a professor at over fifty years old. After arriving in the United States, she was only a professor at a women&#39;s college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, we want to talk about topology. The German-American mathematician Weyl (1885-1955) said that the topological angel and the algebraic devil launched a magnificent fight to occupy every piece of mathematical territory. This shows the importance of these two subjects. In comparison, topology has earlier origins and more interesting examples than abstract algebra, such as the Seven Bridges Problem of Königsberg (1736) and the Four-Color Problem of the Map (1852). , and the Möbius Strip (1858). Topology studies the continuous properties of geometric figures, that is, properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformation (stretching, twisting but not cutting and bonding). The word topology was introduced by a student of Gauss (1847), whose Greek The original meaning of the text is &quot;the knowledge of position&quot;. Although it originally belonged to geometry, its two major branches are algebraic topology and point set topology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Point set topology is also called general topology. It regards geometric figures as a collection of points and the entire set as a space. Mathematicians started from the concept of &quot;neighborhood&quot; and introduced a series of concepts such as continuity, connectivity, and dimensionality, plus properties such as compactness, separability, and connectivity to establish this discipline. It also has some interesting examples. For example, at the North Pole of the earth, every direction faces south, which is a defect of longitude and latitude; there is always at least one place without wind (the center of the typhoon) at any time on the earth. These two completely different facts correspond to the fixed point theorem in topology: the continuous transformation of an n-dimensional simplex to itself has at least one fixed point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The founder of algebraic topology was the French mathematician Poincaré. Just like a wall made of bricks, he divided geometric figures into a finite number of interconnected small figures. He defined the so-called high-dimensional manifolds, homeomorphisms and homology. Later mathematicians developed the theory of homology and homotopy, and transformed topological problems into abstract algebra problems. One of the earliest famous theorems in this field was proposed by Descartes (1635) and discovered by Euler (1752), that is, the number of vertices plus the number of faces minus the number of edges of any polyhedron without holes is equal to 2. There is also the so-called Poincaré Conjecture (1904), which states that any three-dimensional simply connected closed manifold must be homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere. A $1 million reward was offered for proof of this conjecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four-dimensional space is a special form of non-Euclidean geometry. When people are still debating non-Euclidean geometry and the philosophical consequences of violating Euclid’s fifth postulate, Poincaré taught us to imagine this. In the four-dimensional world, &quot;the images of external objects are depicted on the retina, and this retina is a two-dimensional painting; these images are a perspective view...&quot; According to his explanation, since a scene from the two-dimensional surface is viewed from the three-dimensional surface As a projection from the three-dimensional plane, an image on the three-dimensional surface can also be regarded as a projection from the four-dimensional plane. Poincaré suggested that the fourth dimension could be described as the succession of different perspectives on the canvas. According to the visual talent of the Spanish painter Picasso, he believed that these different perspectives should be displayed in time simultaneity, so there was &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon&quot; (1907) - the pioneering work of Cubism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that among the many readers of &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot; (1902), there was a Paris actuary named Plance. On the eve of the birth of Cubism, he was the lover of the Spanish painter Picasso. Member of the &quot;Laundry Boat&quot; artist circle. It was under his introduction that new geometry became a new artistic language &quot;explored with passion&quot;. Apollinaire, Picasso&#39;s friend and Cubist interpreter, concluded, &quot;The fourth dimension is not a mathematical concept, but a metaphor, which contains the seeds of new art.&quot; In the poet&#39;s view, &quot;Cubism uses an infinite The universe has replaced a finite universe centered on humans.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;geometric figures are essential to painting, and geometry is as important to plastic arts as grammar is to writing.&quot; Perhaps we can think that Cubism is a literary and art Since the Renaissance, painting and geometry have had another wonderful encounter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstract in Painting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The word &quot;abstract&quot; as a noun in Spanish means abstract, and it is often placed in an article. Begin your mathematics paper, below the title, author&#39;s name, and affiliation. In the field of art, it can be understood as something extracted from nature. Just as the emergence of abstract mathematics such as set theory once caused some controversy, the word has long been used in art with a somewhat derogatory connotation. It is also a matter of endless debate. Since Aristotle, painting and sculpture have been treated as imitative arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the mid-19th century that artists began to lean toward a new artistic concept, that is, painting was an entity of its own existence, not an imitation of something else. Later, a kind of art gradually emerged, in which the theme became an accessory or something bent and deformed in order to emphasize the shape or means of expression. It was an art that did not aim at expressing nature. Cézanne can be said to be the pioneer of this art. He discovered that the eye views a scene continuously and simultaneously. His concepts of nature, people and painting are all displayed in the mountains, still lifes and portraits of his hometown of Provence. For Cézanne, abstraction was primarily a method aimed at recreating natural scenes in independent paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cézanne (1839-1906) is known as the &quot;Father of Abstract Art&quot; or &quot;The Father of Modern Art&quot;. Under his guidance, artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries set off waves of modernism, typically Fauvism represented by the French painter Matisse (1869-1954) and Spanish painter Picasso. of Cubism. However, there are still some recognizable themes in the works of these painters, so they can only be called &quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;semi-abstract&quot; art. Here, abstract is just a general adjective, not a proper noun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real counterpart to the mathematical term &quot;abstract algebra&quot; should be &quot;abstract art&quot;, which refers specifically to paintings without any identifiable subject. The Russian painter Kandinsky is considered the first &quot;abstract painter&quot;. Since the 18th century, Russia, under Peter the Great and Empress Catherine, has long employed great scientists such as the Bernoulli brothers and Euler. At the same time, it has also begun a tradition of sponsoring the arts and has continued to have close ties with the West. In order to make contact, Russians often traveled to places such as France, Italy and Germany. Since the 19th century, Russian literature and music have reached a very high level, and drama and ballet have also made great progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1866, the year Riemann died, Kandinsky was born in Moscow. A few months later, Baudelaire also died in Paris. Kandinsky’s father’s lineage was a tea merchant from Siberia, and he was of Mongolian aristocratic descent. It is said that his grandmother was a Chinese Mongolian princess, and his mother was an authentic Muscovite. When Kandinsky was a child, he traveled to Italy with his parents and aunt, and soon moved to Odessa (now part of Ukraine) on the coast of the Black Sea. After his parents divorced, he lived with his aunt, attended high school in Odessa, and became a piano and cello player and an amateur painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 20, Kandinsky entered Moscow University to study law and economics until he obtained a doctorate. During this period, he still maintained great interest in painting, and once went to the northern Vologda state to work on it. While investigating racial history related to law, I became strongly interested in the colorful non-realistic style of local folk paintings. In 1896, the 30-year-old Kandinsky determined to become a painter. He resolutely gave up his position as an assistant professor at Moscow University and went to southern Germany to study at an art academy in Munich. He graduated after four years. Among his classmates were 13 years younger than him. The 20-year-old Swiss Klee (1879-1940) later joined hands to become the master of painting in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was while in Munich that Kandinsky&#39;s style of painting of non-objective objects or without actual subjects began to take shape. After some exploration, he found and established his artistic goal: to express a spiritual reaction or decision through lines and colors, space and movement, without reference to visible natural objects. His early education in law also helped him become the most theoretical among painters. In the book &quot;On the Spirit of Art&quot;, he talked about the first time he noticed the art from the works of the French Impressionist painter Manet (1832-1883). The question of the dematerialization of objects continues to fascinate him. Revolutionary advances in natural science also shattered his belief in a tactile and perceptible physical world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Kandinsky, we can feel an inner power of mysticism, which is a spiritual product rather than a product of external scenes or manual skills. He himself wrote, &quot;Strictly speaking, the harmony of color and form must be based solely on the principle that touches the human soul.&quot; There is also such a description in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; published in his middle age: &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The colors that left a deep impression on me at first were bright emerald green, white, magenta, black, and brown and yellow. These memories date back to when I was three years old. I have observed them on various objects, and now the shapes of those objects are far less clear in my eyes than the colors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As he grew older, Kandinsky began to evolve towards geometric abstraction, with circles and triangles as the main forms. This can also be seen from the names of his works, such as &quot;In Black&quot; &quot;In a Circle&quot; &quot;One Center&quot; &quot;Yellow Red Blue&quot; &quot;Three Voices&quot;. In his theoretical work &quot;From Points and Lines to Surfaces&quot; published in his later years, he even analyzed the imaginative effect of abstract factors in pictures, believing that horizontal lines represent coldness and vertical lines represent heat. Kandinsky is such a painter. He may not have a particularly memorable masterpiece, but any of his works has distinctive images and bright colors that will make you recognize it immediately and bring you pleasure or deep thought. This seems to indicate that abstract art (like non-Euclidean geometry) has a broader space for expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Kandinsky, the representative painters of abstract art include at least his compatriot Malevich (1878-1935), the Dutch Mondrian (1872-1944) and the American Pollock (1912) -1956). Malevich brought abstraction to a final geometric simplification, for example, by drawing a diagonal black-edged square on a white square. But Malevich and Kandinsky represent two directions of abstract art. He and his contemporary Mondrian were directly inspired by Cubism; while Pollock adopted the unconscious action technology of Surrealism to create With the technique of dripping and pouring paint on canvases and even car hoods, he and de Kooning (1904-1997), who smuggled themselves to the United States from the Netherlands, were the first New World artists to become world-famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人也会得老年病，关注阿尔茨海默症]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257699]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外婆索要带孩费：“家务劳动补偿”的自然延伸？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257707]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Grandma sued her daughter and son-in-law for taking care of her children, demanding payment of remuneration from February 2018 to July 2023 192,000 yuan. Recently, the Guang&#39;an District Court of Guang&#39;an City, Sichuan Province ordered the daughter and son-in-law to pay 82,500 yuan to the grandmother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the court, because the child Xiaobao’s mother Hu and father Zhu had been working in Chengdu and were busy with work and had no time to take care of the child, they left Xiaobao in the care of his grandmother Duan. Hu said: She and her husband give her mother 1,000 yuan a month for living expenses and 2,000 yuan for child care. Hu said that he and Duan had signed an agreement on Xiaobao&#39;s custody, but the child&#39;s father did not know about it. When my grandmother tried repeatedly to get her, but to no avail, she filed a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that Hu and his wife had the rights and obligations to raise, educate, and protect Xiaobao, and were able to earn income through labor and had the ability to support the child. Duan had no legal obligation to support the child, so Hu The couple should pay the grandmother the necessary expenses incurred for daily care and nursing of the baby. However, the child&#39;s father, Zhu, said: The fundamental reason why the old man asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; was that he and the child&#39;s mother had a divorce dispute. &quot;The person she really wants to sue is me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a couple divorces, it is not difficult to understand why the elderly come up with unique strategies to obtain more benefits for their children. Of course, there is no problem with the court&#39;s decision. The current Marriage and Family Section of the Civil Code stipulates that both husband and wife jointly bear the obligation to raise, educate and protect minor children (Article 1058); Children and grandchildren have the obligation to support them (Article 1074), which is essentially consistent with the previously applicable marriage law provisions (Articles 21 and 28). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, statutory law and judicial practice now recognize small families, and large families only exist in the sense of customary law. Under normal circumstances, in the sense of statutory law, the elderly have neither any rights nor any responsibilities and obligations towards their small family members. Therefore, for the elderly of either party to help take care of the children is a matter of affection, not a duty. The elderly can choose to take them or not; they can take them voluntarily for free, or they can ask for compensation before or after the event. These are the rights of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time a similar verdict has been issued. There is a famous case in Nanjing. In 2010, Su married her husband Li. In August 2014, her son was born and was taken care of by her grandmother Fang. In August 2019, the two divorced. In December 2020, the court ruled that the divorce was granted, and the child was raised by Su. On October 10, 2020, Fang sued his daughter and son-in-law, who had not yet divorced at the time, demanding more than 200,000 yuan in childcare fees. The court held that Fang had no obligation to take care of the child and ordered Li to pay a total of more than 160,000 yuan in childcare fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judges have discretion and may make contrary decisions. There is a case in Tai&#39;an, Shandong. Yao married her husband Su in 2013 and had a daughter. The two divorced in 2021. During the marriage, both husband and wife worked, and Grandma Li took care of the children. In 2021, Li sued and demanded that Yao pay 100,000 yuan. The Ningyang County Court held that although the two parties are now divorced, the children still have a close relationship with their parents and ancestors, and the children should not be blamed for their elders&#39; entanglements. &quot;The children should be cared for and will not be supported,&quot; the court said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the elderly&#39;s request for childcare fees is also a natural extension of &quot;housework compensation&quot; and deserves attention and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In judicial practice, the concept of “housework compensation” often appears in divorce cases. One party works to earn money, creates wealth for the family, and provides transfer payments to those who stay at home full-time and their children; the other party stays at home full-time. According to the community property system, one person will receive half of the property upon divorce. For example, if the property is 2 million, each person will share 1 million. However, according to the idea of ​​&quot;family labor compensation&quot;, full-time earners need to provide some additional money to those who work full-time at home. The logic behind this division is that full-time stay-at-home workers contribute more to the family than full-time earners. Theoretically, because common property itself already means compensation for those who stay at home full-time, the so-called &quot;housework compensation&quot; is actually secondary compensation. Reasonable or not? There was endless debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In actual divorce cases, one spouse who used to be a good couple can ask for additional &quot;housework compensation&quot; from the other spouse on the grounds that they stay at home full time. Then it would be more reasonable for one or both elderly people to ask for &quot;child care fees&quot; from the small family, because taking care of children is not the responsibility of the elderly in the first place. This is why when there are more and more divorce cases involving &quot;housework compensation&quot;, there are also more and more cases of the elderly asking for &quot;childcare fees&quot;. The two have both a positive correlation and a causal relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, even if it was just a matter of affection, not a duty, to take care of grandchildren in the legal sense, there were very few cases where one or both elderly people asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; from a small family. There were many reasons: or because they were The constraints of traditional extended family concepts and customary laws may be due to fear of hurting the relationship with grandchildren, or &quot;fear of being laughed at by others.&quot; But when a couple is divorcing, one party can ask for &quot;compensation for housework&quot; from the other party, and the constraints on these concepts of the elderly are invisibly relaxed and even disappear; one of the husband and wife may even secretly ask their parents for help, so that they can When an old man sues himself and his spouse, he will argue as much as possible, and &quot;the flesh rots in his own pot.&quot; This is why we are seeing more and more cases and reports like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贷中贷，“瑕疵案”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257726]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdpTWWeaVi6i.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height=&quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdp TWWeaVi6i. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252272&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, today’s Mujiangwang Village, Baqiao District, Xi’an City . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past nine years, Shaanxi businessman Hu Xufeng has been involved in 273 lawsuits. The origin of the 273 lawsuits is the urban village reconstruction project of Mujiangwang Village in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City that he began to develop in the 2000s. He was only 27 years old when he won this project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Huashang Daily&quot; report, on July 5, 2009, the Xi&#39;an Urban Reform Office released for the first time a list of 83 projects that had obtained the &quot;Approval of the Urban Village Renovation Plan&quot;. In terms of area, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project covers an area of ​​785 acres, making it the largest one on the list. Based on the average sales price of commercial real estate surrounding the project, Hu Xufeng estimated that the market value of the project around 2016 was about 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the project development process, Hu Xufeng pledged the company&#39;s shares due to two private loans, and therefore lost control of the company. One of them was a cumulative loan of 6 million yuan from Wang Jian, a Zhejiang businessman who has lived in Xi&#39;an. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to regain his equity, Hu Xufeng launched a lengthy lawsuit against creditors and administrative agencies, and the lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the Supreme People&#39;s Court made a judgment on the civil case involving Hu Xufeng&#39;s party suing Wang Jian, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court, but found that the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; on January 10, 2012 was illegal. The true expression of intention of the parties does not have the effect of equity transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng sued the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau based on this, petitioning to revoke Wang Jian&#39;s share change registration, but lost both cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng lodged a protest with the procuratorial organ. In July 2020, a prosecutor from the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People&#39;s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. After the protest, Hu Xufeng still lost the case in the retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Hu Xufeng’s opponent, the current shareholder of Hongrun Real Estate, applied to the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau to change the legal representative, but was also rejected. On August 18, 2023, the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court made a second-instance judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case. The court ordered it to administratively handle Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in this equity war that has lasted for nine years, the administrative agencies involved must make the final decision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau had not responded to an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two private loans&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;International Happy City is located in the southeast of Xi&#39;an&#39;s central city, about 20 minutes&#39; drive from the city center, and close to the East Third Ring Road . Property staff said that at the end of 2022, with the opening of the subway Mujiangwang Station next to the community, the rent in the community will also increase slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This real estate project with good market conditions is the origin of a series of lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng was born in Taibai Village, Shuigou Township, Shangnan County, Shangluo City, Shaanxi Province in 1980. After dropping out of junior high school, he went out to work. He claimed that he received advice from businessmen while working in other provinces, and returned to Xi&#39;an to do computer wholesale business and made his first pot of gold. Later, he was introduced to Xi&#39;an and started contracting projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Hu Xufeng established Shaanxi Hongrun Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Group&quot;) in Xi&#39;an. In May 2006, Shaanxi Hongrun Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Real Estate&quot;) was registered and established. Hu Xufeng, who is only 26 years old, has the ability to buy a first-floor office building as the company&#39;s office space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Xi&#39;an Municipal People&#39;s Government issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Transformation of Urban Villages&quot; (Municipal Administration [2005] No. 92), proposing to &quot;encourage social capital investment to participate in urban village transformation projects to make up for the government&#39;s Fund shortage situation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave of urban village (shanty town) renovation, Hu Xufeng was introduced by someone and signed a joint development contract with the Mujiangwang Village Committee of Baqiao District in March 2007. After that, Hu Xufeng injected capital to start the project. While demolishing and demolishing, he built relocation housing and built commercial housing for sale to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hu Xufeng’s statistics, from the start of the project to the borrowing from Wang Jian in 2012, it invested a total of 820 million yuan in the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project, with the funds coming from self-raised and private loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports of the year, the renovation of Mujiangwang Village was the largest project among the first batch of urban village renovations in Xi&#39;an. As for why it borrowed money from the private sector, &quot;the main reason was that the city&#39;s urban reform at that time was characterized by incomplete materials and insufficient procedures.&quot; Hu Xufeng&#39;s explanation was that the project land was developed first without the government purchasing and storing it, and the developer did not obtain the land use rights. Unable to get a bank mortgage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng named the commercial housing he built International Happy City, and the first batch of about 100 units were sold out within three days. During the development process, in 2010, Hu Xufeng’s friend Zhu Yaojiang proposed to take a stake. Judgment No. 1377 of Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu shows that Zhu Yaojiang was born in Shengzhou City, Zhejiang Province in 1966. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that in his early business activities, Zhu Yaojiang provided help. When buying shares, Zhu Yaojiang introduced him to the actual investor Li Bin and introduced Li Bin’s identity as a social worker in Shaanxi Province. President of the Charity Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 14, 2010, Zhu Yaojiang lent 80 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate in the name of Xi&#39;an Zhongsha Investment Co., Ltd., and Hu Xufeng transferred 18% of Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s shares to Zhongsha Company for free, agreeing that The shares will be returned free of charge after Zhongxia Company obtains 18% of the project income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that when he borrowed money from outside the country before, no creditors asked him to mortgage his equity. &quot;Most of them were mortgages for houses that we have not yet opened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 2012, Zhu Yaojiang introduced Wang Jian to lend 6 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate. The loan materials obtained by Southern Weekend reporters show that Wang Jian was born in 1968 in Taizhou, Zhejiang. The term of this loan is 3 months. Hu Xufeng will transfer 75% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian for free. After Hu Xufeng repays the loan, Wang Jian will transfer it back to Hu Xufeng for free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the market value of the Mujiangwang Village renovation project at that time, the proportion of pledged equity corresponding to the two loans of Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian did not conform to normal business logic. In the subsequent lengthy litigation, Hu Xufeng compared it to a &quot;snake swallowing an elephant&quot;, but did not provide a precise explanation for the abnormal equity pledge ratio. According to Hu Xufeng, he repeatedly asked for repayment of debts, but both creditors proposed to change the cooperation method, and the debt repayment was abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1038&quot; height= &quot;778&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252273&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, 16 years after the project was launched, many unfinished buildings can be seen on the site of Mujiangwang Village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Forged signature&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In this regard, Hongrun Real Estate, which was originally 100% controlled by Hu Xufeng and his wife, only Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen and Hongrun Group still hold a total of 7% of the shares. In March 2013, the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate was changed from Hu Xufeng to Zhuyaojiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hu Xufeng claimed that he only learned about the fact that only 7% of the equity was left in July 2014, more than two years after the loan agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his account, in the previous two years, he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, operated, and recovered. During the treatment, the capital chain of Hongrun Real Estate was broken. Although Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian jointly obtained Hongrun Real Estate 93% of the equity, but no further capital injection into the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng tried to restart the project. He went to the industrial and commercial department to inquire and found that on January 10, 2012, the industrial and commercial department received the application materials for registration of changes in equity interests of Hongrun Real Estate shareholders and approved the application on the 31st of that month. Registered the change of 75% of the equity of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the application materials, there is a &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012, which is the document recognized by the Supreme Court. The content is that the Hongrun Real Estate Shareholders Meeting has studied and approved the transfer of 75% of the equity. Transferred to Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The date of the loan agreement between Wang Jian and Hongrun Real Estate is January 11, 2012. Hu Xufeng applied for an appraisal from the Judicial Appraisal Center of Northwest University of Political Science and Law. The appraisal opinion shows that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on this shareholder transfer capital contribution agreement are not their own signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted Wang Jian after many attempts. Wang Jian responded via text message to a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;The whole lies and stories fabricated by Hu Xufeng have troubled me for more than ten years and caused a lot of pressure and shadow to me and my family. At present, there are irresistible problems in all aspects.&quot; Overturning the conclusion, I don’t want to be entangled with such social liars, ruffians, and scoundrels anymore, and I don’t want to explain anything in this matter. The government department will definitely come up with a conclusion about who committed the crime in violation of the law, but before the time comes, the company will go bankrupt. Everything will be revealed during liquidation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Wang Jian refused to explain the facts about his loan situation with Hu Xufeng, equity disputes and handwriting identification. He asked: &quot;He was really rich and capable back then. Do you want to engage in such a big project?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Hu Xufeng and his wife took Hongrun Real Estate to court, claiming that the signatures on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; were forged and completed without the knowledge of Hu&#39;s wife Chen. On the grounds that the transfer of 75% of the shares violated Chen’s right of first refusal, the court requested the court to invalidate the “Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” and restore the industrial and commercial registration information of Hongrun Real Estate to the state before the change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 29, 2015, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court made a verdict. The court found that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, and Wang Jian himself had no objection to this. The court ruled that the agreement was invalid, but rejected the Hu Xufeng couple&#39;s other claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jian refused to accept the decision and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. Wang Jian argued to the court that although the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, there was another agreement signed by Hongrun Real Estate on January 10. The &quot;Shareholders Meeting Resolution&quot; transferring 75% of the shares to Wang Jian has the signature of Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen. Chen cannot prove that her signature is forged, so Chen knows and agrees to the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly asked Hu Xufeng and his wife for verification. They insisted that the signature was not signed by Chen, but &quot;because the appraisal fee was very expensive and they were short of money at the time, they only authenticated the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; &quot;The signature on the &quot;Shareholders&#39; Meeting Resolution&quot; was not authenticated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, 2015, the Shaanxi Provincial High Court made a judgment. The court found that after signing the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; on January 10, 2012, Hu Xufeng and his wife confirmed the authenticity of the agreement several times at the Hongrun Real Estate shareholders&#39; meeting and external agreements on March 15, 2013. The validity of the agreement was not raised and no objection was raised. Therefore, its appeal to determine that the agreement was invalid &quot;has no factual and legal basis and this court will not support it in accordance with the law.&quot; The second-instance judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court revoked the first-instance judgment of the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the lawsuit, and the lawsuit eventually went to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On May 29, 2019, the Supreme People&#39;s Court issued (2017) Supreme Court Judgment No. 171, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. However, the Supreme People&#39;s Court found that the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 was a pledge guarantee by changing the equity holder, and it did not have the effect of equity transfer because it was not the true expression of intention of the parties. As for both parties, &quot;whether the equity pledge in the loan relationship complies with legal regulations can be resolved through separate legal channels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Administrative Protest&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reason why the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau became the defendant is also because of the above two signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng appealed to the court to order the bureau to cancel the change registration and re-register the shares under the name of Hongrun Group on the grounds that the bureau relied on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; with forged signatures in the change registration. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was assigned to the Xi&#39;an Xincheng District People&#39;s Court for trial. On July 8, 2016, Xincheng Court issued an administrative judgment. The court found that when the bureau reviewed the change registration application materials submitted by a third party, it did not find that the signatures on the shareholder capital contribution agreement were not made by the company&#39;s legal representative and shareholders. &quot;It was a flaw in the industrial and commercial change registration and did not affect the administration.&quot; the legality of the conduct”. Hu Xufeng lost the lawsuit. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Intermediate Court, which upheld the original verdict. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 2019, Hu Xufeng filed a protest with the Xi’an Municipal People’s Procuratorate, and the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate supported the protest. The Shaanxi Provincial High Court ordered the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court to conduct a retrial. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the prosecutor of the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. According to the official website of the court, this is the first time that the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate has sent personnel to attend the retrial court for administrative protest cases after the internal institutional reform of the Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate and the establishment of a separate administrative prosecution department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau argued that the law requires administrative agencies to conduct a formal review for the registration of changes in shareholder equity. The change application materials at that time were complete and met the formal requirements stipulated by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Administrative Licensing Law, formal review is a concept corresponding to substantive review. Formal review refers to the review that the application materials submitted by the applicant are complete and in compliance with the legal form, while substantive review refers to the administrative agency’s review of the applicant. The authenticity and legality of the content of the materials provided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau argued that &quot;Although the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; was not signed by me, the content of the agreement represents the true intention of the parties, and there is evidence to prove that the facts of the agreement are recognized by both parties.&quot; In addition, although The Supreme People&#39;s Court determined that the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; is in the nature of an equity guarantee and does not have the effect of equity transfer, &quot;but it does not affect the outcome of the administrative case. Our bureau has fulfilled its reasonable review obligations and has no responsibility to revoke this administrative action.&quot; and obligations”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau emphasized to the court that administrative actions have conclusive power. The registration of equity changes reflects the true meaning of the equity transfer guarantee of Hongrun Real Estate in appearance and cannot be used against bona fide counterparties. Likewise, it does not affect the administration. Effectiveness of behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng&#39;s litigation attorney objected, &quot;Equity transfer guarantee and equity pledge are two completely different legal relationships.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Civil Code, equity transfer guarantee means that the debtor transfers the equity to the name of the creditor. After the debtor pays off the debt when due, the creditor should return the equity to the debtor. Equity pledge can only obtain equity ownership after the debt matures through auction, (liquidation) or negotiation procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the finding in the Supreme Court&#39;s judgment that a pledge guarantee is made by changing the equity holder, it does not have the effect of equity transfer because it is not the true intention of the parties. The parties in the dispute case have argued that Each has its own understanding and expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 18, 2020, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court issued a retrial verdict, and Hu Xufeng lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the application of law to the aforementioned two focus issues in this dispute, the Small and Medium Enterprises Business Environment Research Group of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics commissioned the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society on August 31, 2023. Four legal experts, namely Yang Lixin, vice president, Cui Jianyuan, vice president of the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society, Wang Xizhen, executive director of the Administrative Law Research Society of the China Law Society, and Wang Bo, dean of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics, organized the seminar and issued a legal Opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legal opinions put forward by the experts at the meeting include: Hu Xufeng’s signature in the “Equity (East) Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” dated January 10, 2012 is forged. This document is a false material, and any agreement based on this false material should be revoked. Administrative decision on the registration of change of equity transfer of Hongrun Real Estate; the agreement reached between Wang Jian and Hongrun Group is an equity transfer guarantee, not an equity pledge. If the aforementioned change registration is regarded as a valid equity transfer guarantee registration, Wang Jian will act as a creditor , has no right to exercise shareholder rights and can only receive priority repayment for the equity involved in the case; Hongrun Group, as the debtor and guarantor, has the right to request Wang Jian to return the equity and change the equity registration after repaying the loan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The final chapter is coming&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the dispute that lasted for more than ten years, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project experienced unfinished work, changed hands, and the villagers many times During the petition, Southern Weekend reporters saw at the scene that there are still 10 buildings in unfinished condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the villagers of Mujiangwang Village that around 2015, the government-funded relocation houses were delivered, and the last batch of villagers moved back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, the Xi&#39;an Bahe New District Management Committee changed the project subject from Hongrun Real Estate to Shaanxi Jiaxinyuan Industrial Co., Ltd. The government department advanced 140 million yuan to build some relocation houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The control of Hongrun Real Estate is still being contested by all parties. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced by the Keqiao Court in 2017. According to the law, he can no longer serve as the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, 2017, the People&#39;s Court of Keqiao District, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province issued the (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment for the crime of embezzlement and illegal absorption of public deposits. 13 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are Hu Xufeng’s witness statements on pages 22 and 33 of this judgment. However, Hu Xufeng insisted that he was traveling between Xi&#39;an, Beijing and other places at the time and had not received any inquiries or evidence collection from Shaanxi or Zhejiang public prosecutors and law enforcement departments regarding the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on September 20, 2023, the Keqiao District People&#39;s Court responded to Southern Weekend reporters that after verification, during the handling of the case, the Economic Investigation Brigade of the High-tech Branch of the Xi&#39;an Public Security Bureau transferred 46 files along with it. A set of case materials, including Hu Xufeng&#39;s witness testimony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng’s sister said that on September 23, 2023, she contacted the police officer handling the case at the time, and the other party said that a report record had been made when Hu Xufeng reported the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report refers to the fact that in August 2014, Zhu Yaojiang’s sister was arrested by the Xi’an police on suspicion of illegally absorbing public deposits. Hu Xufeng reported to the Xi’an Public Security Bureau at that time that Zhu Yaojiang was the mastermind behind the case. Hu Xufeng produced the original reporting materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are crime report transcripts equivalent to witness statements submitted to the court? The policemen handling the case and Hu Xufeng each held their own opinions. However, (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment shows that Zhu Yaojiang was only criminally detained in November 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2017, Hui Xiping, then director of the Hongqi Subdistrict Office in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City, said in an interview with CCTV&#39;s &quot;News Investigation&quot; program that Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian collectively acquired 93% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate. Later, it was discovered that the actual controller of Hongrun Real Estate was not these two people, but the aforementioned actual investor Li Bin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are different opinions about Li Bin’s life. Some media once quoted the article &quot;&quot;Luxury Monk&quot; Li Bin&quot; published in the 14th issue of &quot;China Entrepreneur&quot; magazine in 2007 to introduce his life. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to find the original text of the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned in Li Bin’s parents’ neighborhood that his father was a team worker at Xi’an Film Studio. He returned to his hometown in Mei County, Baoji City a few years ago. Li Bin also worked in Xi’an Film Production The factory worked briefly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the relationship between Hu Xufeng and Li Bin is concerned, since losing control of Hongrun Real Estate, Hu Xufeng said that he can no longer contact Li Bin. After Hu Xufeng started litigation to defend his rights, Li Bin reported Hu Xufeng to the public security agency on the grounds of gang involvement. Hu Xufeng also publicly reported Li Bin with his real name for the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 25, 2019, the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department handed over to Xi&#39;an the clues that Hu Xufeng reported about Li Bin and others&#39; suspected crimes in the form of a Director&#39;s Supervision Order (Supervision of Crime Leads No. 044) Verification by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi’an Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that regarding the two people’s reports of each other, the public security organs did not find any illegal or criminal facts on both sides after a lot of work.

The bureau issued a &quot;Notice of Refusal to Registration&quot; on August 22 of that year, rejecting the application for change of registration on the grounds that the identity of the convener of the shareholders&#39; meeting did not comply with the provisions of the Company Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the processing results alone, Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau did not support Hu Xufeng&#39;s application for change of registration, nor did it support the applications of Li Bin and Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hongrun Real Estate then sued the bureau to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Court. On December 30, 2022, the court issued a first-instance judgment in which Hongrun Real Estate won the case. The court ordered the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau to re-administer Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau was dissatisfied and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court. On August 18, 2023, the second-instance court made a final judgment and upheld the original judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the bureau must re-administer the change application of Hongrun Real Estate within 60 days after the judgment takes effect.

The week before, the United States and Iran publicly reached a &quot;prisoner exchange agreement.&quot; The content of the agreement includes the United States unfreezing $6 billion of Iranian oil funds in South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move caused waves in the political arena. The Biden administration has been strongly criticized by US Republicans, saying that unfreezing US$6 billion is equivalent to paying a &quot;ransom&quot; and is an &quot;appeasement policy.&quot; What puzzles the outside world is why the two countries, as &quot;old enemies&quot;, &quot;swap prisoners&quot; during this time period? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters that the United States and Iran have their own calculations behind this move, but it remains to be seen whether it can be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Prisoner Exchange&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Who are the arrested Americans? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before his arrest, 51-year-old businessman Siamak Namazi worked as the director of strategic planning at Dubai-based Crescent Petroleum Company. He was arrested by Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards in October 2015, while his 86-year-old father Bakr was arrested in February 2016 after Iranian officials allowed him to visit his son in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The British Broadcasting Corporation reported that they were eventually sentenced to ten years in prison by Iran for &quot;cooperating with foreign hostile countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, the United States has repeatedly proposed to rescue or extradite Namazi. Because these people obviously serve the United States or have made great contributions to the United States, the United States is unwilling Give them up,&quot; said Li Shaoxian, director of the China Arab Studies Institute at Ningxia University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another 59-year-old Iranian-American businessman Emad Shaji moved to Iran from the United States with his wife in 2017. In November 2020, Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Court summoned him and informed him that he would be convicted of &quot;espionage&quot; and sentenced to 10 years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of the following year, his daughters told the Washington Post that their father, Shaji, was in &quot;a deplorable situation&quot; in prison and that prison guards only allowed him to make a few brief, monitored phone calls. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabaz, a 67-year-old businessman, was arrested together with eight other Iranian environmentalists in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The BBC reported that Tabaz’s organization, a member of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, has been using cameras to track critically endangered wild Asian cheetahs and was accused of using its environmental projects as a “gathering of confidential information” cover&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabaz and his colleagues deny Iran&#39;s accusations against them. But in the end Tabaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2019. He is being held in Evin prison in Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, these arrested American businessmen were released due to the &quot;prisoner exchange agreement&quot; between the United States and Iran. The names and circumstances of the other two Americans released have not yet been released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a statement after his release, Namazi expressed his gratitude and was very interested in knowing the progress of updating mobile phone equipment. &quot;When I was arrested, the iPhone 6S had just come out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side of the prisoner exchange, Iranian media confirmed on the afternoon of September 18, 2023 that five Iranian citizens imprisoned in the United States had also been released. . Of the five Iranians released, only two chose to return to Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Cavlani and Kashani were accused of violating &quot;sanctions.&quot; Afrasiabi, a political scientist living in Boston, was arrested at his home in 2021 on charges of being an &quot;agent of the Iranian government.&quot; Ansari and Hassanzadeh were accused of &quot;links to Iranian security forces.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian said that the prisoner exchange matter contemplated by the United States and Iran is not a temporary decision. In fact, in the US-Iran relationship, the two sides have been fighting for each other to release their own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States and Iran have always been &quot;old enemies&quot; and have no diplomatic relations. Qatar served as the mediator for this &quot;prisoner exchange&quot;. According to public reports, negotiations between the two parties were also conducted in Doha, the capital of Qatar. After at least eight rounds of back-and-forth between Qatar and Qatar, the United States and Iran&#39;s &quot;air-space negotiations&quot; finally reached a prisoner exchange agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, after Iran proposed its latest nuclear agreement plan, the United States believed that Iran had regressed and decided to withdraw from the negotiations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Iran&#39;s reason is that since the United States has withdrawn from the nuclear agreement, Iran is the official representative, so it does not need to face the United States. Face-to-face talks will not occur until the United States resumes the nuclear agreement.&quot; Li Shao said that at that time The EU agrees and agrees with the United States and condemns Iran, so it cannot continue to be the middleman now. &quot;Qatar therefore plays a very important role in this negotiation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Thaw&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The agreement, brokered by the Qatari government, represents It marked an unusual moment of cooperation between the United States and Iran and a rare agreement between two long-time enemies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This deal is an important stepping stone.” Sanan Wakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House in the UK, said that the months-long negotiations have restarted the US-Iran relationship. Indirect bilateral dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bloomberg reported on September 19, 2023 that according to the prisoner exchange agreement, while the United States and Iran exchanged detainees, Iran’s previously frozen oil export payments of US$6 billion in South Korea were remitted to Qatar through Switzerland. Domestic Iranian bank account. The prisoners were released hours after the funds were unfrozen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Korea is a &quot;large consumer&quot; of Iranian oil, and the $6 billion that was unfrozen was previously South Korea&#39;s payment for Iranian oil. In 2010, the Central Bank of Iran opened Korean Won accounts in two South Korean banks specifically to collect payments from South Korea. At that time, Iran could withdraw the funds in the accounts at will. In September 2019, the Central Bank of Iran was included in the sanctions list by the United States, and US$6 billion in payments were frozen in the account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Iran is rich in oil and natural gas resources. For Iran, US$6 billion is a small amount of money under normal circumstances.&quot; Li Shaoxian analyzed, but for Iran in the past few years, &quot;it is definitely a timely help.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reuters reported that after Qatar and Switzerland confirmed that the funds were in the account, Qatar sent a plane to take five U.S. citizens and two of their relatives out of Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yin Gang, an expert on Middle East issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Iran is not only economically difficult, but also diplomatically. At present, Iran can accept such conditions, which shows that Iran urgently needs to ease its international status and change its international balance of payments situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, both the United States and Iran have &quot;different ideas&quot; regarding the implementation of the negotiation results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that when the two sides reached a prisoner exchange agreement, Iran also specifically added the validity period of the agreement. That is, if the frozen payment is not received within two months, the prisoner exchange agreement will automatically be invalidated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The two sides have no trust at all, so they just set a deadline.&quot; Li Shaoxian said that this matter is relatively sensitive for both parties, and the United States and Iran have many different voices in the country. &quot;I think the two-month limit is considered from a realistic perspective, and it also reflects that both parties want to accomplish this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that US Republicans are criticizing the Biden administration&#39;s prisoner exchange. At the time of the move, it was stated that the unfreezing of 6 billion US dollars was equivalent to paying a ransom and may lead to more &quot;hostages&quot; being held. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although this group of U.S. citizens have been released, there is no guarantee that other Americans who decide to go to Iran despite long-term warnings from the U.S. government will get similar results.&quot; On September 18, the U.S. Secretary of State announced Lincoln warned the people at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Win or Lose&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;External comments on this prisoner exchange have been mixed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al Jazeera reported that Sina Tusi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank, said that the prisoner exchange was an &quot;important first step.&quot; She said, &quot;This creates a basis for the United States and Iran to get rid of hostile and confrontational policies, and is expected to reach a broader diplomatic agreement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States will hold a presidential election in November 2024, and at this stage, the two sides have restarted negotiations Friendly relations are unrealistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tusi said Biden was unlikely to make concessions to Iran before the vote, which would draw attacks from Republican hawks. Iran, on the other hand, hopes to maintain its influence &quot;in case Trump returns to power.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported on September 19 that the prisoner exchange agreement was a signal of partial easing of US-Iran relations. It marked a breakthrough in relations between the United States and Iran, long-time enemies, although the two countries remain at odds on a range of issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Objective analysis shows that the United States has made a compromise.&quot; Li Shaoxian pointed out that in addition to US$6 billion, the Biden administration actually &quot;turned a blind eye&quot; to Iran&#39;s oil exports. Therefore, Iran&#39;s oil exports have increased significantly in recent months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;On the one hand, this move can be seen as a sign of the easing of bilateral relations between the United States and Iran. On the other hand, the United States also wants to reduce the diplomatic pressure on South Korea.&quot; Yin Gang analyzed the current relationship between the United States and South Korea Also very important. If South Korea does not pay oil to Iran, it will have great dissatisfaction with South Korea and will bring great difficulties to South Korea&#39;s diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But American Republicans have different opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, former US President Trump publicly stated, &quot;The United States, which was highly respected three years ago, has now become the laughing stock of the world.&quot; Former Vice President Pence criticized Biden, Allowing Iran to “foment terrorism across the Middle East.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian analyzed that the struggle between the two parties in the United States is now booming, and the two parties are even more sharply opposed on the Iran issue and the Iranian nuclear issue. Although Biden did not lift sanctions on Iran after taking office, his goal is to restore the nuclear agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, on the day of the prisoner exchange, Biden issued a statement saying that the United States would impose sanctions on former Iranian President Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Intelligence Ministry on the grounds that relevant individuals and Institutions are complicit in “wrongfully imprisoning” American citizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wall Street Journal commented on September 19 that the Biden administration has been trying to ease tensions with Iran, but it is clear that exchanging prisoners while imposing new sanctions on Iran will complicate the problem again. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the continued sanctions imposed by the United States, it seems to have become the norm for countries around the world to face restrictive measures in certain areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Iranian President Raisi said that the United States has no right to decide how Iran will use the $6 billion in funds that are about to be unfrozen. He emphasized that the frozen funds originally belonged to the Iranian people and the Iranian government, and the use was not determined by the U.S. government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian analyzed that Iran’s nuclear technology capabilities have improved very quickly. &quot;The United States is very anxious, and Europe is also anxious.&quot; He said that under such circumstances, although the United States publicly did not lift sanctions, it gradually released its policies to whet Iran&#39;s appetite. Iran also deliberately slowed down the production of highly enriched uranium. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There have been rumors in the international community that behind the deal, Iran promised to have active dialogue with the United States in the next step on the nuclear issue.&quot; Yin Gang said that at present, the entire Middle East The situation is on the trend of easing, between Iran and Arab countries, and between Iran and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When will there be a breakthrough in the long-stalled Iranian nuclear negotiations? Will the tension between the United States and Iran gradually ease? These issues will also affect the trend of the global political landscape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Xu Ziyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[失落的1945——张爱玲“笔误”解谜丨云端]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257677]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/MOoJJcgGQN3BIjhiUWiurpcBJO2W25OAjeX0Mvgd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;726&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MOoJJcgGQN3BIjhiUWiurpcBJO2W25OAjeX0 Mvgd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Manuscript of Zhang Ailing&#39;s novel &quot;Little Reunion&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I forgot again&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Ailing There are many examples of poor memory. Reading the 700,000-word &quot;Collected Letters of Zhang Ailing&quot; edited by Song Yilang and recently published by Crown has deepened this feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, Zhang Ailing’s bad memory focused on dates and numbers. The more famous &quot;public case&quot; is about the &quot;Genius Dream&quot; which gave birth to Zhang&#39;s famous saying &quot;Life is a gorgeous robe, covered with lice&quot;. Until her later years, Zhang Ailing was still bitter about the &quot;unfair treatment&quot; she suffered in the &quot;West Wind&quot; essay competition when she was 19 years old. However, scholars and Zhang fans have verified that she remembered everything wrong, whether it was the limit on the number of words in the essay, the format of the essay, or even the awards. , and maybe I didn’t read the specific terms of the essay advertisement clearly back then. The number of words in the competition was limited to 5,000, but she mistakenly thought it was 500; when she finally won the third honorary award, she wrote it as a &quot;special award&quot;; she even recorded the more than 1,500 words of her award-winning article as more than 490 words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was looking through old magazines at home not long ago and accidentally found the July 2004 issue of &quot;Yin Ke&quot;. In this issue of Zhang Ailing&#39;s album, there was published a letter she wrote to the Chinese Embassy in Washington on June 4, 1966. Letter from the British Embassy. At the time, Eileen Chang was interested in applying for a position as a writer-in-residence at a university and required proof of academic qualifications. Due to the loss of her documents, she wrote to the University of Hong Kong to request a replacement. However, the Registrar of the University of Hong Kong only certified that she had &quot;two ins and two outs&quot; and did not mention that she had received a certificate for her excellent academic performance. Scholarships and other honors, several negotiations failed. At that time, Hong Kong was still under British rule, so she wrote to the British Embassy in Washington for help. To explain his situation, there is this paragraph in the letter of more than a thousand words: &quot;...I immigrated to the United States in 1955, married an American in the 1960s, and obtained American citizenship. My mother has been naturalized as a British citizen, and she was a British citizen in 1958. Passed away in London...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had never read this letter before, and I was very interested. But I was really surprised when I read this: She and Laiya registered their marriage in August 1956, the second year after arriving in the United States. On August 14th and August 18th, she also wrote to Kuang Wenmei, why did it suddenly become the &quot;60s&quot;? Her mother Huang Yifan died of illness in London on October 11, 1957. On October 24, she accurately reported in a letter to Song Qi and his wife that her mother had &quot;died two weeks ago&quot;, but the letter to the embassy read &quot;1958&quot; in black and white. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/J7ek9M46hhsAvN7cc670HxW3bYAzesTK5Rxozede.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height= &quot;1593&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/J7ek9M46hhsAvN7cc670HxW3bYAzesTK5Rxozede.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The photo that her mother took with her when she left China returned to Zhang Ailing after her death. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This letter was translated into Chinese by Chen Ziyu, and Su Weizhen wrote the introduction. Neither of them discovered it, so it was also There is no &quot;clerical error&quot; noted in the letter. Indeed, no one would have thought that in 1966, Zhang Ailing was 46 years old and was only middle-aged. No matter how bad her memory was, she would not have mistaken the year of her mother&#39;s death and the year of her remarriage. Moreover, she wrote a formal letter to an official agency. inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when I saw so many &quot;I remembered wrongly&quot; and &quot;I forgot again&quot; in the collection of letters between Zhang Ailing and Song Qi, I was no longer surprised. Zhang Ailing lives largely on royalties in the United States, but she can&#39;t even figure out whether Crown Publishing&#39;s fixed royalties for a certain period of time are US$2,000 for half a year or a year. What&#39;s even more outrageous is that before leaving Hong Kong for the United States in 1955, with the help of Song Qi, she advanced all the royalties for two scripts from the Telecom Company, but she forgot all about it five years later. Only after being reminded by Kwong Wenmei did she remember that she had done so. This is the case. It is simply unbelievable that a person who is most afraid of owing money or favors would forget such a sum of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, I have been browsing a collection of essays by book reviewer Liu Zheng, and I came across an article titled &quot;Zhang Ailing Remembers Wrongly&quot;, which records the errors in words, sources, plots, and mistakes in Zhang Ailing&#39;s works. , a total of 22 cases, which is eye-opening. Regarding citation errors, I also read in Chen Zishan&#39;s &quot;Cong Kao of Zhang Ailing&quot; that Zhang Ailing quoted Lu Xun&#39;s translation of the Soviet writer Shuxue Jianke (also translated as Zuoqenko) in 1926 in &quot;Talk about Eating and Painting Cake to Appease Hungry&quot;. The short story &quot;Women of a Noble Family&quot; in 2000 was mistakenly written as &quot;Baozi&quot;; while &quot;Baozi&quot; written by Zhang Ailing was actually translated by Lu Xun as &quot;Meat Buns&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both Chen Zishan and Liu Zheng are sharp-eyed and knowledgeable, but they still respect Zhang Ailing. Liu Zheng said this: &quot;In terms of human relations and physics, as well as in choosing words and sentences, Zhang Ailing can be said to be a very thoughtful person. However, she did not seem to care much about whether the quotations were accurate. In addition, it was very difficult to check the information at that time. Zhang Ailing She doesn’t have the habit of collecting books, so it’s normal to have some misremembering when quoting. To put it into perspective, Zhang Ailing obviously doesn’t have a ‘photographic memory’, maybe she just has a poor memory; what she left behind There are really not too many clerical errors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zheng explained that he had no other intention in writing down these when he was studying, but just for fun - Zhang Ailing would also remember it wrong! At the end of the article, a sentence from Sontag&#39;s novel &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot; was quoted: &quot;Genius, like beauty, everything, well almost everything, will be forgiven.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, He attributed the clerical errors to memory and unverified information. On the contrary, Zhang Ailing said in &quot;Contrast Notes&quot;: Freud, the master of psychological analysis, believed that there is no clerical error or an occasional wrong word, it is all what he thought in his heart and revealed it inadvertently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was also in &quot;Contrast Notes&quot; that Zhang Ailing left another famous &quot;clerical error&quot;: the well-documented &quot;cool party&quot; in Shanghai on July 21, 1945 The photo taken with Li Xianglan was annotated as &quot;Meet the movie star Li Xianglan at a garden party in 1943.&quot; As if following the Freudian line of thinking mentioned by Eileen Chang, two scholars have tried to analyze whether Chang Eileen&#39;s &quot;clerical error&quot; of &quot;one or two years&quot; was just due to poor memory, or there is another meaningful reason behind it. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;1945&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Cooling Party/1943 Garden Party&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Comparative Notes - Looking at Old Photo Albums&quot; is Zhang Ailing&#39;s last work This work is also her only autobiographical collection of pictures and texts. &quot;Picture 41&quot; in the book is a photo of her and Li Xianglan that has been treasured for nearly 50 years. She wrote: In 1943, she met Li Xianglan at a garden party and wanted to take a photo together. She was too tall and the two of them would complement each other if they stood side by side. , someone asked her to sit down, and Li Xianglan stood aside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/iEioqzjAsX9CGyu33WRvaDrFnNz5X5Lb1h9JvdFX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;693&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/iEioqzjAsX9CGyu33WRvaDrFnNz5X5Lb1h9JvdFX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1943, Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan (right) took a photo in Shanghai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The book &quot;After Yun&quot; mentions clothes made from the quilt cover of my grandmother&#39;s bed. This is the one. My aunt took it apart and kept it. Although the tailor said that &#39;chen silk is like rotten grass&#39;, the tailor did not frown, took it without saying a word, and made it according to Yanying&#39;s design. The beige thin silk was sprinkled with light The ink dots hide a dark purple phoenix, which is very picturesque. I have never seen a similar pattern elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;1943&quot;, this year is ridiculously wrong, the correct time and place is: July 1945 On the 21st, a &quot;cool party&quot; hosted by &quot;Magazine&quot; was held at No. 2 Xianyang Road, Shanghai. The basis is &quot;Magazine&quot; in August 1945, which published the article &quot;Records of Enjoying the Cool Coolness&quot;. In addition to this picture of Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan, there is another group photo: Li Xianglan and Zhang Ailing maintain the same posture, and Zhang Ailing&#39;s aunt is also seen. Zhang Maoyuan, his best friend Yan Ying, an unidentified Ms. Chen, and two men in long gowns - Chen Binhe, the president of the Shenbao Press during the Wang puppet period, and Jin Xiongbai, the president of the Pingbao Press. According to Shao Yingjian, a Chinese scholar who studied in Japan and is now a researcher in Japan, in the book &quot;The Legendary Literature and Rumor Life of Zhang Ailing&quot;, Xianyang Road was the name of the current Shaanxi South Road from 1943 to 1945. It was older. The name familiar to Shanghainese is &quot;Yalpe Road&quot;. No. 2 Xianyang Road was the garden of Jin Xiongbai’s private residence at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, when &quot;Contrast&quot; was published, it was the year before Zhang Ailing&#39;s death. In her declining years, she had to study the skirt that she had changed from her grandmother&#39;s old quilt cover, from the texture, color, pattern, Patterns, origins, styles, designs, and tailors are all fresh and clear in my memory. Why do I remember the wrong time and place when I took the photo? What kind of information does this 1943, this &quot;clerical error&quot; reveal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shao Yingjian believes that if you understand Zhang Ailing’s life, this mystery will not be difficult to solve. For Zhang Ailing, 1943 to 1945 were the most glorious days in this life. She wrote &quot;Legend&quot; and &quot;Rumors&quot; in just two years, and she rose to the top of the literary world when she was just starting out. &quot;In the database of the brain, this is a A perfect file, with no details, displayed in its entirety on the screen of memory.&quot; - This statement is very tempting: in the stage of life when the fire is burning, the oil is blooming, and the flowers are blooming, the memory is mixed and unclear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for what Shao Yingjian pointed out, Zhang Ailing wrote &quot;cooling party&quot; as &quot;garden party&quot;, in my opinion, it does not seem to be a clerical error, just like some people say that going to a &quot;theater&quot; or &quot;cinema&quot; to watch a movie is not a mistake. substantial difference. But researcher Shao focused on the difference between the two words and found his answer - interestingly, he also made a &quot;clerical error&quot;. After checking several versions of &quot;Contrast Notes&quot;, Zhang Ailing wrote &quot;Garden Party&quot; Rather than a &quot;garden party&quot; - he found out from the old &quot;Declaration&quot; that on July 8, 1944, the Wang Puppet &quot;Shanghai Press Association&quot; held a party in the central square of Hartung Garden, attended by thousands of people from all walks of life. &quot;Citizen Garden Lecture&quot;, the program includes red star singing and movie card screening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he did not specifically mention the red star singing that night or the celebrities attending the meeting, Shao Wen determined that the red star was &quot;most likely&quot; the popular Li Xianglan, and Zhang Ailing, who is already a celebrity in the maritime literary world, &quot;naturally&quot; should also Be present. He deduced from this that it was on this occasion that Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan met for the first time: &quot;...the first tangible and tangible meeting was at this garden party. The impression on them was profound and indelible. As the years passed, As time went by, the subsequent impressions became shallow and flat, leaving only this scratch. How many years later, in Zhang Ailing’s brain inventory, all the fate with Li Xianglan was merged into this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;He further said that when Zhang Ailing stood on the balcony of her apartment (Eddington Apartment, today&#39;s Changde Apartment), she could see a corner of Hartung Garden. Hartung Garden can also be regarded as Zhang Ailing’s neighborhood. Zhang Ailing also mentioned this legendary garden twice in her 1944 serial &quot;Serial Set&quot; in Vientiane. &quot;Although the scale of Jin Xiongbai&#39;s private garden and Hartung Garden are not the same, there are some similarities: they are both Western-style houses with flower beds and lawns. Just based on the background of the photo and the Western-style cushion chairs, in Zhang Ailing&#39;s memory, , unknowingly, the garden of Jin Xiongbai&#39;s private residence was replaced by Hartung Garden, and the &#39;cooling party&#39; also turned into a &#39;garden party.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s right. One thing is certain: Zhang Ailing has never mentioned and has not seen any information showing that she has been to the &quot;garden party&quot; in Hartung Gardens. Therefore, Mr. Shao&#39;s discussion based on assumptions has a strong reasoning component and is more like a It is a imaginative fiction. The mystery of forgetting is complicated and confusing, but a convincing analysis comes from Professor Wong Sham-cun, Chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Hong Kong. In a wonderful essay, she spent six and a half pages discussing the photo of Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan taken three weeks before Japan surrendered, and put forward a meaningful &quot;maybe&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I don’t remember a thing in this year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Picture 50” in “Contrast Notes” is a picture of Zhang Ailing leaving Hong Kong in 1955 In the photo before America, the makeup is exquisite, the side face is lowered and the eyes are downcast. Eileen Chang described taking a boat from Hong Kong and passing through Honolulu. The customs officer was a skinny Japanese young man who clearly filled out her entry form: height 6 feet 6 and a half inches and weight 102 pounds. She laughed at the young man&#39;s carelessness and made a Freudian slip by writing 5 feet 6 and a half inches as 6 feet 6 and a half inches. &quot;I am thin and look very tall. That is the shocking record of this customs officer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09 /26/g8ajGWryb6p5fYU92Aa3zTiqI33SZTgtDdLC5XE5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;1738&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/g8ajGWryb6p5fYU92Aa3zTiqI33SZT gtDdLC5XE5.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;252199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Contrast Notes&quot; contains photos of Zhang Ailing before she left Hong Kong for the United States in 1955. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Picture 41&quot; in &quot;Contrast Notes&quot;, Zhang Ailing was &quot;careless&quot; and mistakenly recorded as &quot;1943&quot; &quot;Year&quot; frame with Li Xianglan is considered by scholars to be the most important photo of her in Shanghai. Professor Huang Xincun has a paper &quot;Mottled Light and Shadow: Zhang Ailing&#39;s Japan and East Asia&quot;, and his analysis starts from this photo. Taken on July 21, 1945, just three weeks before the end of World War II and Japan’s surrender, “Its strange composition and uncoordinated visual style are also impressive. Viewers who are familiar with the background of the photo even regard it as a depiction.” On the eve of the collapse of the Japanese Empire, a visual allegory of the crumbling Japanese-Chinese combination.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Huang’s analysis of the photo focuses on the different expressions of Zhang Ailing and Li Xianglan, the strange composition of the photo, and their different dressing styles, especially It’s Zhang Ailing’s perverse sitting posture, her downward gaze away from the camera, and all the details. She said, &quot;Zhang Ailing&#39;s facial expressions and body may imply resistance or contempt, but more importantly, she obviously knows how to turn the gaze of the camera lens on her into a help to deepen her own image.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;What I am more interested in is how did Zhang Ailing, her aunt, and Yan Ying go to this &quot;garden party&quot; three weeks before Japan was defeated? Japan unconditionally surrendered on August 15, and the current situation suddenly changed. Hu Lancheng, who had been an important member of the Wang Puppet Government, was wanted by the Nationalist Government and fled hastily. How did it bring shock and panic to Zhang Ailing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly it occurred to me that I should review &quot;Little Reunion&quot;. What happened in the long summer of 1945 is described in the book. Moreover, at the beginning of Chapter 8, what Zhang Ailing wrote about Jiuli was simply an annotation in advance for her subsequent &quot;clerical error&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;From this time until the end of World War II , for more than half a year, there was a kind of chaos in her heart, which was sealed with a layer of white wax, which was a sense of calm and security on the surface. What happened during this period was always regarded as the previous year or the next year. &quot;...I don&#39;t remember a single thing in this year. It can be called a lost year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When she first met him, she knew that he was going to flee after the war, but she became confused when things happened. , also because this was her &#39;lost year&#39; and she was devastated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despondent, she banished 1945 in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe Zhang Ailing herself doesn&#39;t want to believe that this photo was taken on the eve of Japan&#39;s defeat.&quot; Huang Xincun wrote a sentence in the &quot;Notes&quot; of the paper that is heart-stopping. Yes, there is no 1945, only 1943, only the previous year or the next year. Although &quot;Contrast&quot; was published in 1994, half a century after those unbearable and chaotic days, she still remembered that there was a kind of Freudian error. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Psychology has a lot to say about memory and forgetting. Whether Zhang Ailing left defective memories a year before her death was due to retrograde amnesia caused by damage to the hippocampus of the brain, or active forgetting of emotional memories, it is no longer a question. Of course, exploring the secrets involved is not to &quot;disenchant&quot;. As Huang Xinchun said, it is only to &quot;restore a historical Eileen Chang&quot; and &quot;a more complex Eileen Chang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subconsciously shielding the unbearable past and deleting the dark aspects on the memory chip. Isn’t it true for us, many ordinary &quot;people&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I strongly agree with this statement: What ultimately constitutes a person&#39;s life is not experience, spirituality, or any events, but the memory, description, and interpretation of all these experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Matsuo Basho has a haiku: The temple bell/stopped, but the lingering sound in the flowers/continues to echo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[二十届中央第一轮巡视完成反馈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257717]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the deployment of the Party Central Committee, the first round of inspection and feedback work of the 20th Central Committee has been completed recently. Feedback from this round of inspections is carried out through a combination of centralized feedback and &quot;one-on-one&quot; feedback from the inspection team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, the Central Inspection Leading Group held a centralized feedback meeting on the first round of inspections of the 20th Central Committee. The meeting conveyed and studied the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech when he listened to the Central Committee’s first round of inspection reports, informed the common problems discovered during the inspection, and made arrangements for rectification during the inspection. Liu Jinguo, secretary of the Central Secretariat and deputy leader of the Central Inspection Leading Group, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From September 20th to 22nd, 15 central inspection teams conducted &quot;one-on-one&quot; meetings with the party groups of 30 medium-sized enterprises, 5 party committees of medium-sized financial enterprises, and the party group of the State Sports General Administration during this round of inspections. feedback. According to the Central Inspection Work Arrangement, each Central Inspection Team notified the principals of the inspected party organizations of the outstanding problems discovered during the inspection, and reported the inspection situation to the leadership team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feedback pointed out that in recent years, centrally managed enterprises and financial enterprises have faced the complex and severe external environment and the impact of the epidemic. They have withstood the test and bravely shouldered heavy responsibilities. They have been successful in winning the battle against poverty and promoting high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. It has made important contributions in building a new development pattern, promoting high-quality development, coordinating epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development, and has made new progress in building a sports power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback seriously pointed out the outstanding problems existing in the fields of state-owned enterprises, finance and sports. Some fail to implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, do not have a deep understanding of the responsibilities and missions they shoulder, and have gaps in their performance of duties; some do not coordinate development and safety, have weak risk awareness, and have insufficient prevention and control mechanisms; some implement party management The responsibility for party governance is not in place, the pressure transmission is decreasing layer by layer, the implementation of the strict tone is weak, the integrity risks of key positions such as &quot;top leaders&quot; are relatively prominent, the problem of &quot;depending on the enterprise to take advantage of the enterprise&quot; is common, the &quot;four styles&quot; problem is prominent, and it violates the eight central regulations Mental problems still occur; there are weak links in the construction of some leadership groups and cadre talent teams, and the political functions of grassroots party organizations need to be strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback requires that the inspected units should thoroughly study Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, conscientiously study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech when he listened to the inspection report, and fully implement the deployment of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Uphold and strengthen the party&#39;s leadership, firmly establish and practice a correct view of political performance, completely, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, adhere to functional positioning, focus on main responsibilities and main businesses, and promote high-quality development. It is necessary to resolutely implement the political responsibility to prevent and resolve major risks, establish bottom-line thinking and extreme thinking, comprehensively sort out and investigate hidden risks, plug leaks and fill gaps, resolve risks and recover losses, and effectively safeguard national interests. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the &quot;two responsibilities&quot; of comprehensively and strictly governing the party, strengthen the effectiveness of supervision of &quot;top leaders&quot;, intensify the investigation and handling of corruption cases, seriously correct the &quot;four styles&quot; problem, deepen the use of cases to promote reform, use cases to promote treatment, and integrate We dare not, cannot, or do not want to be corrupted. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the party&#39;s organizational line in the new era and effectively strengthen the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feedback emphasized that inspections and rectifications should be more serious and tough, and the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere should be passed on and carried out consistently. The inspected party organization must resolutely shoulder the political responsibility for rectification. The &quot;top leader&quot; is the first person responsible for rectification. Other members of the team must conscientiously perform &quot;one post, two responsibilities&quot;, strictly compare feedback opinions, and establish a problem list, task list, and responsibility list. Combining the problems found during the inspection with the theme education inspection issues and the problems that were not rectified in the last inspection, rectify the system and rectify the whole body, practice the &quot;two maintenances&quot; with practical actions, and reflect the loyalty and responsibility with the rectification results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback requires that the responsibilities of all parties for rectification should be consolidated and efforts should be made in the same direction to solve the problem. Discipline inspection and supervision agencies must strengthen daily supervision of rectification, focus on key issues, focus on specific people and specific matters, strengthen on-the-spot inspections, grasp the real situation, and seize examples of those who deal with perfunctory or false rectifications and seriously hold accountable them. The organizational department should strengthen research and guidance based on the inspection situation, and promote the solution of outstanding problems in the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. Relevant functional departments must comprehensively make full use of the inspection results, strengthen daily supervision of common and deep-seated problems reflected in the inspection, deepen reforms in key areas, optimize policy supply, and improve systems and mechanisms. Inspection agencies must strengthen overall coordination and supervision, establish and improve rectification work mechanisms, and report important situations to the Party Central Committee in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the Central Inspection Team has also received clues about problems reported by some leading cadres, and has transferred them to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission, the Organization Department of the Central Committee and other relevant parties for handling in accordance with relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访胡歌：如果不做演员，生活里的我应该什么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257715]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Throughout September, Hu Ge’s work was fully scheduled.

He said: &quot;When I meet a character I like, I am not playing him, but becoming him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film&#39;s director Liu Jiayin expressed his &quot;jealousy&quot; of Hu Ge: &quot;This character is obviously mine. But I feel like you understand him better than I do. Now I understand that the extra thing is yourself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan is nearly forty years old and was once a failed entrepreneur. The screenwriter, because he believes that &quot;ordinary people can also be the protagonist&quot;, has never been able to write a script that satisfies Party A. Over time, he gradually lost confidence in himself and gave up this career. The character that he could not write became a part of his heart, transforming into a boy named Xiao Yin, who often jumped out of his mind to talk to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wen Shan was in school, he liked to go to funeral parlors and zoos to take notes on his life, which later became a habit. After his life fell into embarrassment, he accidentally found a new job - writing articles for clients to commemorate their deceased relatives and friends. After completing an article, he could get 4,000 yuan, which could just cover his room and board expenses in the suburbs of Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan always wears baggy clothes that have been washed too many times. He is habitually hunched over and has long hair that covers his eyes. He cuts his nails frequently because of typing all the time. He likes to buy large buckets of mineral water and directly Lift it up and drink. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first glance, there is not much connection between the frustrated Wen Shan and Hu Ge himself, except that the latter has also come into contact with many screenwriters at work. Hu Ge told the Southern Weekend reporter with some regret: &quot;This industry is sometimes quite abnormal. Unless the screenwriter is a big shot, he has almost no power of expression. Most of the time, he can only wait to be evaluated, without even a chance to refute. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Ge’s eyes, Wen Shan is a person who is unwilling to compromise. It’s not that he doesn’t know how to write (scripts) to gain favor, but he is unwilling to do things he doesn’t want to do. &quot;I hope to be such a person, but often I can&#39;t. I envy him very much.&quot; Hu Ge said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, Hu Ge suddenly disclosed the news of getting married and having a daughter on Weibo. It quickly became a hot search list and there were constant discussions on the Internet. He did not hesitate to share the joy of becoming a father for the first time: &quot;When I held my daughter for the first time, it was like holding a piece of tofu. I was afraid that I would break her if I shook her.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Get married and have children. I have considered this before, but never took action. I made this decision after playing the role of Wen Shan. This role brought me a lot of changes and influence. After playing this role, I have a lot of confidence to do it. I think it’s a choice that should be made,” Hu Ge told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years after his debut, Hu Ge is no longer a young guy like Li Xiaoyao in &quot;Legend of Sword and Fairy&quot;, but closer to Mei Changsu who narrowly escaped death in &quot;Nirvana in Fire&quot;. Attentive viewers will find that whenever the shots of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; show a close-up of Hu Ge, the scar on his right eye is clearly visible. He has already been able to face the impact of the car accident in 2006. In the first two or three scenes after the car accident, Hu Ge used his bangs to cover the scar, but then he let it go: &quot;If I can&#39;t pass this test myself, how can I let others accept it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;After works such as &quot;Nirvana in Fire&quot; and &quot;The Pretender&quot;, the audience began to pay attention to Hu Ge&#39;s acting skills, and he decided to &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;put down some of his current work and concentrate on experiencing life.&quot; After a few years, &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; may be regarded as Hu Ge&#39;s answer. With this film, he won the Best Actor Award at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. At the award ceremony, he said: &quot; When an actor truly falls in love with a character, he will give himself completely to the character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/26/m0wYwiSsUoiV4OaxXvNhtGAIoiNsQ4VHZX5MklBS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 26/m0wYwiSsUoiV4OaxXvNhtGAIoiNsQ4VHZX5MklBS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Ge rests at the closing ceremony of the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival district. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One afternoon in mid-September 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend interviewed Hu Ge via online connection , the original interview time was only half an hour, but Hu Ge said: &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, I am willing to chat more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Hu Ge&#39;s self-report:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;He has me in him The Firmness That Is Not Possessed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; talks about ordinary people, allowing many viewers to see themselves in it. (I) traveled to seven cities to do road shows, and the audience was willing to share their own experiences of facing the death of relatives and friends when communicating. This is where I can most empathize. This script has many intersections with my own life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, my mother passed away, and I wrote the eulogy myself. So when I first read the script, I was not Wen Shan, but one of his clients. I still haven&#39;t fully recovered from this experience, and it will take me a long time to accept the end of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this, I had never thought that there were people like Wen Shan in my life. In our traditional culture, we seem to be very shy about talking about death and the end of life. Therefore, when a loved one passes away, it is usually difficult to find someone to share and talk to. This script gave me a warm feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan has another meaning to me. In current terms, he is an &quot;i person&quot; (Editor&#39;s note: a result of the MBTI personality test that has become popular in recent years, and &quot;e person&quot; ” In contrast, the two are approximately equivalent to introverts and extroverts respectively), introverts. He is not good at expressing himself or getting along with others. To be honest, the real me may be such a character. But he has a firmness that I don&#39;t have, and he won&#39;t change his choices because of external evaluations and so-called worldly standards. This is something I envy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw in him a part of myself that I couldn’t achieve, my ideal look, and I really wanted to be him. Even though he is not a person with a strong sense of presence, he is still very dignified at heart. This kind of axis is a kind of courage, persistence and courage to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an i person at heart, but I don’t look like me. This may have something to do with my career and environment. As an i person, Wenshan is more able to stick to his own choices, but I often can&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a screenwriter, Wen Shan seems not to be that successful, not because of ability, but because of choice. He insists on his own aesthetic and is unwilling to change his creative direction. Throughout his career, he had almost no opportunity to express himself, and his works were always rejected by others before he could complete them. But what is rare is that he never said that he must seek the approval of others. This is an inner persistence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point in Wen Shan’s life was that by chance, he got the job of writing eulogies for others. Although this job is completely different from being a screenwriter, they are both creating with words. At work, Wen Shan found a sense of identity. This did not mean that everyone praised him for writing well, but that he used his kindness and sincerity to influence others through constant communication. For example, Mr. Wang in the film re-understood his deceased father through Wen Shan&#39;s eulogy. This is the meaning of Wen Shan&#39;s work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pf6D5BNM6E4lSzTB57y1Lxai5d60id3WlXYJbTCa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pf6D5BNM6E4lSzTB57y1Lxai5d60id3WlXYJbTCa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the movie &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, the son of client Mr. Wang reveals his secret to Wen Shan (right), played by Hu Ge, and Wen Shan discovers the mutual relationship between the family. The love without words. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I don’t think the main thing expressed in &quot;A Worthwhile Journey&quot; is death. Writing Death is about how we write life. Wen Shan has gone from being a screenwriter to writing eulogies. He is using his pen to create characters and write other people&#39;s stories. Looking back, we are writing our own lives with our daily lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People will change at every stage, but it has nothing to do with specific age, but has to do with experience. In 2019, my mother passed away, and then we went through another three years of the epidemic and saw a lot of separation and death. In this process, I think not only me, but many people will think more about life. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Most people are the protagonists&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What do you mean by ordinary people? Ordinary people are not particularly mediocre people as usually understood, but relative to those who have the aura of the protagonist. The latter often have particularly strong dramatic conflicts and many miracles happen in their lives. But ordinary people are the majority in life. It is difficult to meet people like the protagonists of idol dramas in our lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film emphasizes that &quot;ordinary people can also be protagonists&quot;, which means that most people are protagonists. Our definition of success seems to be too standardized, and everything has become very utilitarian. In fact, everyone&#39;s trajectory is different. Sometimes if we set our vision and goals too uniformly, it is easy to miss the truly important things in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For individuals, we are already in our own story and in our own growth trajectory. Of course you are your own protagonist. Why do you have to treat yourself as a supporting role? (Why) Do we have to call the character who conforms to the so-called concept of success the protagonist? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am a person who is often easily entangled, and my inner self is very close to that of Wen Shan. It is just because of my various good luck that my life is like an idol drama. From the inside, I do have question marks about my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan is different from the characters I have portrayed in the past. Almost all characters have the aura of the protagonist. Even if they have some flaws, they must have particularly powerful abilities. They are the so-called &quot;tragic heroes&quot; &quot;. In the past, when I created characters, I was doing additions. I had to superimpose various abilities on my body to reach the character. But this time I was doing subtractions. I needed to take off all the things attached to my body and return to my original self. To put it simply, if I don’t become an actor, what should I be like in life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time I did not deliberately design any actions. When I created Wen Shan, I was not trying to play this character, but to become him. Therefore, I did not use any special external methods, but got close to the character first. In my heart, other things are just a natural expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Yin is the mirror image of Wenshan&#39;s heart. As a listener, Wenshan is lonely and can rarely find someone to talk to. He has to learn to get along with himself. The existence of Xiao Yin is to use a special way to show how lonely people get along with themselves, so that at least he is not lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MC2AiDpZGMtuM4xiW492lOe04yepgJnApFZGdZ0L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MC2AiDpZGMtuM4xiW492lOe04yepgJnApFZGdZ0L.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the movie &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, Wen Shan (left) played by Hu Ge and his inner Xiao Yin (right, played by Wu Lei). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The really sad thing is that lonely people have to endure loneliness. Loneliness but not loneliness is a relative ideal state. Xiao Yin is the more active and bold part of Wen Shan&#39;s heart, but this side has been suppressed, and there has always been self-confrontation and entanglement in his heart. Xiao Yin has been pushing Wenshan to face reality more bravely. In the end, Xiao Yin disappeared, which meant that Wenshan found the confidence to continue writing as a screenwriter, allowing Xiao Yin to return to the script world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am afraid that there is more than one Xiao Yin in my body, and there are often some small divisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The actor is a gorilla in the zoo&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wen Shanhui often observes the surrounding environment and people, and takes notes on life. The two most important scenes in the film are the funeral parlor and the zoo. Wherever Wen Shan loves to go, he can quietly observe the people and things around him. I may also have a so-called occupational disease. I like to observe the people I meet. It doesn’t mean that I have to find some characters for reference after I play a certain role. It’s just like Sherlock Holmes, when I see an unknown person in front of me. As I walk by, I can&#39;t help but guess about the other person&#39;s career history and family relationships, and imagine what this person was doing just now and what he has experienced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not used to labeling past roles. Every role is meaningful to me. It is said that film and television are the art of regret, and there is no way to do it again, but I will often reflect on it. Whenever I finish playing a role, I will think about where I did not perform well. Maybe I am not that confident. Even if others say how good I am, I will still find faults with myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading the script of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, I started an online exchange with director Liu Jiayin that lasted for half a year.那段时间，我一直在《繁花》剧组，基本每天都要开工，只能和刘伽茵导演通过微信沟通，我们第一次见面就是定妆那天，我都已经进组开工了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合作过这么多导演，每一位的工作方法都不一样，和演员的交流相处也不一样，我觉得对于导演来说，如何启发演员、引导演员，是工作中特别重要的一部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孔笙导演会给演员特别大的空间，他可能会给你一个大的方向，然后具体的表演方式他会特别放心地交给演员。姜伟导演同时还是非常优秀的编剧，他的剧本所有的台词都无法调整，就连语气词都非常准确。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王家卫导演给我的感觉反而和之前一些媒体报道的不同，他之前的电影在拍摄的过程中可能没有特别具体的方向，但这次我感到他特别知道自己想要什么，也会表达得十分具体。当然有时候他也会让你去突破，如果能够给到他意料之外的火花，也就是更好的即兴的表演，他也会非常欣赏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有时候，角色就是不同形状的瓶子，演员就是水。每次进入到不同的角色里，演员就变成了不同的样子。所以表演是流动的，水进入瓶子之后才被固定成一个形状。我觉得导演最需要的是那个流动的瞬间，从艺术上来说，这一刻才是最美好的表达，而不是那个固定的样子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于演员来说，很多时候因为成名了就忘记如何平视生活。平视生活是非常重要的。忘记自己从哪里来，这是一件特别要命的事情。不演戏、不工作的时候，就是回归生活，要忘记自己的职业和身份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我很羡慕那种可以卸下自己演员身份的生活状态，所以没事的时候，我总是想往远的地方走走。我每次去青海做志愿者，就有网友说我去捡垃圾什么的。其实我就是想去洗涤一下，把身上一些不属于生活的东西洗掉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多时候大家对演员有想象，往往都带着角色滤镜，以为我们和普通人不一样。当你卸下演员这个职业回到生活里，我日常所处理的东西，无非也是今天这只猫生病了，明天那块墙皮掉下来了，浴室的热水怎么不热了……这些构成了生活，面对这些日常，我经常感到自己能力有限，比不上很多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我常常思考演员好像是动物园里的大猩猩，一天24小时的一举一动都在大家的关注之下。很多时候大家将自己的各种好奇、审视和监督都投射在演员身上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾想过冲破这个牢笼，不在这个动物园待了，想要跑到大街上去。但你要知道，猩猩在动物园的时候有笼子隔着，跑到大街上可能会受到更多关注，岂不是要被围追堵截了？所以既然选择了这份职业，在得到很多的同时，就要承受它的压力，这是公平的。 &lt;/p>;
