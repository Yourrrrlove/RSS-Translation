A large number of telecommunications network fraud suspects have been arrested one after another. On October 14, 2,349 suspects were handed over to us and were successively escorted back by the public security organs in Kunming, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Hunan, Chongqing and other places to fully carry out case investigation work. So far, thanks to the unremitting efforts of public security agencies in many places in Yunnan, 4,666 suspects of telecommunications network fraud in northern Myanmar have been handed over to us, including 205 online fugitives.

All the friends I have are older brothers.&quot; He likes to listen to big brothers. The buddies chatted about everything, &quot;You can learn a lot.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past two years, the eldest buddies often got together because of his return to China, and the topics mostly revolved around him and his circumnavigation and transatlantic sailing race. And his IMOCA60 super racing boat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if everyone is talking about himself, Xu Jingkun is still used to silence. When he is not talking, his face, which has been tanned by the sun all year round, looks particularly calm. &quot;Actually, I often do this at sea. I don&#39;t speak, but I enjoy it in my heart. The lack of expression does not mean that I am unhappy, but I have such a habit of being &#39;lazy in talking&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that he is a &quot;Stupid&quot;, this is absolutely not the case. He is sensitive, humble and well-measured. When we politely asked the eldest brother to &quot;exit&quot; and started a two-and-a-half-hour in-depth conversation in a big brother&#39;s quiet and undisturbed office, he opened himself up to us with accurate and moving expressions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/VjJv1LH5mWRi07GYyWBWZYHqxoQfW4ugxzvvUdSq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/VjJv1LH5mWRi07GYyWBWZYHqxoQfW4ugxzvvUdSq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253638&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun&#39;s old childhood photos, the accident has not happened yet, he is a lively and healthy mountain child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sailing makes me feel comfortable, which is the biggest gain&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you feel particularly comfortable and at ease? Many disabled people use sleeves to cover their missing parts, or wear prosthetics when going out, but you just naturally expose your left arm and even use it as a hand or an arm. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I am very calm and I am very free. When I first started training at Shandong Sports School, it was not possible. Even though you were training as a disabled athlete, when others looked at you, you would feel uncomfortable and nervous yourself. Later, I joined the national sailing team and slowly began to change. But what really liberated me was that after the national team was disbanded, I started sailing on my own. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sailing really changed me completely. When many people talk about me, they always say that I am successful now and have changed my destiny. In fact, the biggest gain for me is this kind of freedom. Sailing makes me live very freely. I can choose what I want and my current situation, which is very good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the time I decided to sail, from the time I first sailed around the China Sea, my life began to change. Whether it&#39;s loneliness at sea, wind and waves, or even some fears sometimes, after you experience it too much, you will gain that kind of freedom and become very comfortable, not caring about external things or what others think. In this way It&#39;s very comfortable to be alive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the &quot;one-armed captain&quot; given to you by others?

When Ajiu (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun’s wife and partner Xiao Shuyao&lt;/span>;) wrote my biography &quot;The Humble Dreamer&quot;, I told She, you need to write &quot;one-armed captain&quot; in the title. The media teachers we have contacted over the years are also very professional. Many times they will ask very politely, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we write like this, or what kind of title is more appropriate?&quot; I will tell them to just write &quot; One-armed Captain&quot;. I don’t think there’s anything that shouldn’t be said. On the contrary, one-armedness is a very unique thing about me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You dare to face it only if you dare to speak, right? I don’t care about this at all now. In fact, there is no need to talk about whether I care or not. If you are still thinking about whether you care or not, it means you still care. (Laughs) Let’s put it this way, I think my left arm is great. When I have children in the future, I will be the most unique father in their eyes, which is cool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/NxSHzppQbBvqiojKcnTyOurdXvkbp7ctiri8h4p6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/NxSHzppQbBvqiojKcnTyOurdXvkbp7ctiri8h4p6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253637&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun used this J24 to start a circumnavigation of the China Sea from the northernmost point to the southernmost point of China.

The damage and shadow in my life have been completely wiped out. Expelled. This is what sailing has brought me, including my growth and experiences along the way. I am very lucky! An accidental injury is like a devil appearing in life. It wants to hurt me, but before it can really hurt me, I have already defeated it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I can feel that if I had not stepped out in time to defeat it, I would most likely have been defeated by it. I can also feel that many friends with physical disabilities have been deeply hurt physically and mentally due to their disability, and I always want to give them some encouragement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people outside the sailing circle know you from &quot;Ten In that episode of &quot;Three Invitations&quot;, when you were talking to teacher Xu Zhiyuan, you said that you &quot;have never felt at ease in the first half of your life.&quot; What time are you in now? Is it the previous life or the next life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s still the first half of my life, and I’m still not at ease. I actually don’t have particularly big ambitions, I just don’t like falling to the bottom. The so-called bottom does not mean material life. I am very adaptable to life. Now I still often only eat two meals a day. It’s not that I don’t have money, but that I don’t have time. I have a lot of work to do on the ship, and it’s very troublesome if the work at hand is interrupted. I would rather finish it without eating. If you don&#39;t like the bottom, you don&#39;t like the feeling of having no goals and not being able to control your own life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After setting the goal of participating in the 2024 Vendée Globe, life has become a battle. The Solo Transatlantic at Rum Road in 2022 and the Double Transatlantic at Café Road in 2023 are all aimed at qualifying for the Vendée Globe. We don’t have the financial resources to take our time, so we can only treat one season as 3 seasons and one person as For 10 people, our team only has 5 people, and the German team has 50 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because this is my own goal and I like this goal, I don’t feel how hard life is or how big my sacrifice is. Most people would have a hard time adapting to my life and would suffer to death, but I think this is the life I dream of. In a very beautiful pier, on a very good racing boat, doing what I most want to do, doing my own professional things, without being dominated, commanded or controlled by anyone, I think this is very good, right Bar? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/ps9YjERLoV0uQbWm6Z3XYKpkeQoZib9Sx4Oymdk1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1436&quot; height= &quot;1078&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/ps9YjERLoV0uQbWm6Z3XYKpkeQoZib9Sx4Oymdk1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the way around the China Sea, Xu Jingkun once fell into the water and drifted to Dongyin Island in Taiwan, China.

Is it the thrill of adventure? The freedom of going deep into the ocean away from the crowd, or the desire to return to the mainland and embrace family and friends after fighting the waves? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, I am also trying to understand myself on a deeper level. What do I want? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Navigation is even contrary to my nature. I am very cautious and cautious. I like a room with doors and windows tightly closed so that no thief can sneak in. But sailing is always exposed to wind. No matter how well-prepared you are on the shore, situations will always arise at sea, and you have to hold your &quot;shield&quot; to resist them on all sides. It&#39;s very embarrassing. I actually don&#39;t like that kind of accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not that romantic either. There is a kind of person who really likes the solitude of sailing on the sea, such as the legendary French navigator Bernard. He was disgusted with cities and crowds. He loved freedom and sailing crazily and enjoyed solitude. I&#39;m not that kind of person, I&#39;m not that crazy. I am a &quot;fake lunatic&quot;, and I am not the artistic type. When I&#39;m at sea, I always miss my family and friends on the shore. I want to drink beer and have barbecue with them when we dock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether I was a professional athlete on the national sailing team or am now engaged in extreme sailing competitions, I do not have a competitive mentality that insists on winning championships, advocating gold medals and winner takes all. Some people who compete in extreme sailing competitions participate in the competition just to win. Their competitive strategies are very aggressive. If they cannot win, they may choose to quit the competition. Neither am I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yST5LtCmWEI4dPPdC6KCdhDzm7YrmfK5wjv3OAfV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yST5LtCmWEI4dPPdC6KCdhDzm7YrmfK5wjv3OAfV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253642&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2015, Duarnenez, the one-man transatlantic extreme sailing race, set sail.

Sailing seems like the craziest thing you, a rational person, could do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I am very rational. But he seems to be doing something very irrational and crazy. He sailed around the China Sea and around the world, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a 6.5-meter boat, and now bought a racing boat to participate in the world&#39;s most difficult extreme circumnavigation race. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It can only mean that you really like this thing . As a rational person, you can devote so much to sailing. To you, this is really crazy to the extreme. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, that’s true. The life we ​​live now is a complete state of madness. After crossing the Atlantic in a single-person boat in 2015, it was actually considered top-notch in China. At that time, I was working as the vice president of a yacht club in Shenzhen, and my income and treatment were very good. Let’s put aside the good life, from 2017 to 2020, I completed a three-year circumnavigation with Ah Jiu. After that, we had a pretty good time in Hainan, and I had the goal of participating in the Vendée Globe. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qingdao has many sailing talents, and they have already gone before you There are several legends, why can you go further and further, especially starting your own journey to the world&#39;s top professional rowing captain in 2022? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am a &quot;stupid person&quot;! On the one hand, I am very rational, and on the other hand, I don’t think too much about anything. When I think something is good and worth doing, I won’t think about doing this or not doing that, or not doing it. How about doing this and that...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I bought the IMOCA60 racing boat, I started to think about it, because I started to analyze rationally: I am a person from an ordinary peasant family, and every year Not making this money, but spending so much money...that&#39;s it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It costs 15,000 euros to lift the boat from the shore into the water, so there is no test drive. After paying the money, I got on the boat for the first time. It really felt unreal. It was completely different from all the boats I had sailed before. When that boat was flying on the sea, I saw why it was called the world&#39;s top racing boat. &quot;I finally stood on this boat, and this boat belongs to us!&quot; This feeling just rose in my heart, I felt a lot of pressure in the next second. There are so many cable accessories on this super racing boat, it is really difficult to learn in a short time, and an operating error will cause huge losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw it was too complicated and thought it was impossible to solve it. After taking over, I never left the ship. I parked it on the dock and studied it every day. It took two months before I went to sea alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not a very smart person, and I am very forgetful. I can’t figure out what I thought and calculated when I bought the boat. Forget it, we don’t want to think about it anymore, let’s talk about it tomorrow, tomorrow we will forget these things again, and you don’t want to think about it anymore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I like mechanical things, and I may have a little talent for boats. Our racing boat is very complicated. Many captains in Europe have engineering degrees, and they also have teams and coaches. I bought the boat by myself. I haven&#39;t graduated from junior high school, and I&#39;m self-taught in English, but I&#39;m not afraid, I can figure it out even if I spend some time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My experience with racing boats is pleasant most of the time, but it is too expensive and the maintenance bills are expensive. I feel distressed every time I have to pay a bill, but my rationality tells me to pay it quickly, and then forget about this unhappiness, haha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/x2HEJrLwLBk7baJ6HnQgmSBo8lwDGmiNb3L1ZLHG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/x2HEJrLwLBk7baJ6HnQgmSBo8lwDGmiNb3L1ZLHG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In Madagascar, Xu Jingkun gave the ship’s batteries to local schools that had no electricity.

For a long time, I actually had no time to think. This state made me particularly uncomfortable. Maritime navigation is my job, and I like this project myself, but this matter really makes me very tired now. I feel a little resistant when I think of going back to France, which is like a battlefield. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to find a rational reason, I don’t want to easily say why I like it and why I don’t like it. I need to think about it, and I want to find a real answer that I feel comfortable with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Global sailing and extreme transoceanic racing are completely different. In extreme racing, you face multiple pressures on funds and speed, as well as the formulation and execution of competition strategies. You cannot enjoy the voyage and the sea like you can when sailing around the world.

Sailing between the sky and the sea is a very wonderful enjoyment. I have been to so many places where the sea is connected, and everything I see and experience makes people feel wonderful. But I may actually prefer the specific sense of goal of extreme sailing competitions. If I keep floating on the sea, I will not be satisfied. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am a perfectionist and a bit heroic. I don’t mean to be a superhero who saves the earth alone. I want to be my own little hero. Withstanding the pressure and crossing the sea during extreme sailing, I feel like a little hero every time I come back after completing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, from the arduous preparation before the start of the season, to the high pressure after the start, to the release when I finally arrive at the shore, it is the process that I enjoy the most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/PRfAyTagmNJJWaGCsrssaVZ8gjAGh0PyPOXZ40sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/PRfAyTagmNJJWaGCsrssaVZ8gjAGh0PyPOXZ40sm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253651&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Meet musicians from all over the world and catch up with the Hiwa Festival in Tahiti.

My body is particularly good, which was developed under extreme requirements. I can feel the strong adaptability and recovery ability of my body, and the limits of my body are stimulated in the extreme environment. This is why I particularly like sailing. I can feel that I am a strong person among human beings. For me, this makes me stronger inside. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sailing is not about romantic yearning or blind bravery. You have to complete the extreme challenge, bring the racing boat back safely, and go ashore to give your waiting family a hug. A lot of specific and hard work needs to be done to get the boat in perfect condition before setting off. Any problems must be taken into consideration, and there are two or more sets of prepared contingency plans. Sailing has allowed me to develop a strong execution ability. &quot;I do what I say&quot;. No matter how high the goal is, I will put in more effort. This is also engraved in my bones. Take everything seriously and never leave it at that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After experiencing the loneliness and wind and waves of sailing alone, I prefer daily life and love my environment and friends from the bottom of my heart. Calm, stable, storm-free daily life like now makes people cherish it, and makes people want to praise the beautiful weather and beautiful atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have had very lonely and difficult days, and you often have one when you are a teenager The fear and hopelessness of falling to the bottom of nowhere. When I set sail alone to circumnavigate the China Sea in 2012, I was filled with resentment as I feared that I would die. After so many years of sailing, have you made peace with yourself and your destiny? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time in 2012, I really felt like I was gambling with my fate, and I had a feeling in my heart that once a hero is gone, he will never return. That kind of tragic, even with some resentment, asking why my life has to be so difficult, if you don&#39;t believe me, I will fight to the death, I want to make this happen, yes, with this kind of energy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that these have been healed, it is very important to me to complete each goal one by one. You will slowly know that you can control your own destiny. When I was a child in the countryside, I lost half of my arm. I was surrounded by an environment where I really had no goals and my life was aimless. You don’t know where your goal is, and you have never achieved a goal. You will hate the cowardly and vulnerable self, and long to be full of fighting spirit and courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through sailing, I have one goal after another, which is also a process of self-healing and growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since I spent more than 7 months repairing a small boat that was about to be scrapped, named it &quot;Dream&quot;, and achieved the first goal of circumnavigating the China Sea, I learned to believe in myself, Believe in the dream. In fact, if I failed that time, I might never get up again in this life, and I might be completely defeated. Not only was I defeated by external things, but my own line of defense was also gone. Looking back now, I really feel that it was understandable for others to say that I was unrealistic. I can say that I was too lucky. That beginning made me learn to believe, and this belief helped me step by step to get to where I am now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sail offshore, deep into the heart of the sea, on both sides of the mainland How would you feel about a scene like that at 1,500 nautical miles?

The rules set by Western society are for the East, and the East must make some checks and balances against the West, right?

If I take good care of the boat on the shore, then the boat can take good care of me in the deep sea. This is for sure.

I knew in my heart that this would definitely not work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the next devilish voyage like the Vendée Globe, if you don’t have sincere love, sincere faith, and lose your original intention, you won’t be able to persevere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Vendée Global is known as the &quot;Mount Everest of the Sea&quot;.

&lt;p>;达尔马宁指出，目前主要的危险仍然来自法国本土的激进分子。这些人通常是在互联网上逐步激进化，他们极度孤立，乐于接受圣战宣传，响应仇恨号召。由于宗教激进化、模仿或精神脆弱等原因，他们使用非常有限的手段实施行动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，基地组织和“伊斯兰国”分支在一些地区重建。在萨赫勒地区，尤其是在黎凡特和阿富汗，毒品网络正在重建，并有可能为恐怖主义提供资金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有了钱，这些组织就可以通过渗透移民潮等方式，就地培训圣战分子。就像2015 年11 月13 日袭击事件中的一些行凶者一样。他们还可以远程培训其他人。”达尔马宁说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;罩袍禁令&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;拉锯战&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;据法国BFMTV 9月15日报道，该恐怖组织呼吁“让穆斯林儿童独处”“在父母的保护下成长”。这段文字，加上针对“巴黎某个部级政府部门”的威胁，暗示基地组织指的是与最近法国国内的“Abaya禁令”相关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“很难不把它与最近法国学校禁止穿Abaya联系起来，尽管根本没有提到这一点。”报道称。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿巴雅（Abaya）是一种宽松的长袍，可以遮罩女性身体曲线。在法国学校中，常常可以看到女性穆斯林学生穿着阿巴雅上学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年8月末，法国政府以政教分离原则为由，禁止学生穿这种有着明显宗教标志的服装。据教育部门指令，9月开学时，穿阿巴雅到校的学生禁止进入课室，之后由校方向她们“解释禁令的意义所在”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法国总统马克龙在此项问题上强调，政府在这个关系世俗主义原则的问题上“绝不让步”。他表示，“我们知道会有违规的情况出现……有些或许只出于一时疏忽，但相当一部分是想要挑战共和价值。我们决不能妥协。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管法国政府就禁令表现出了强硬姿态，但依然有穆斯林学生身穿罩袍到校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据法国教育部统计，9月4日开学时，全国有298名学生穿着罩袍上学，其中只有67名学生坚持不愿脱掉罩袍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地时间9月7日，法国克莱蒙费朗高中一名女孩因坚持穿着罩袍上学而被禁止入校。随后，女孩父亲向校长发出了“割喉”死亡威胁。校长报警后，该名家长当晚被警方扣留。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了学生群体外，也有很多穆斯林支持者以多种方式反对“罩袍禁令”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法国政府颁布禁令后，包括巴黎南方教育协会在内的三家机构提出上诉，他们要求中止禁令，称禁令违反了“基本自由”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月19日，十多名穆斯林女性聚集在法国驻奥地利大使馆门外，就阿巴雅禁令对法国穆斯林妇女表示声援。在线传播的抗议视频中可以看到，一位身穿橘色长袍、头戴头巾的女性高举抗议标牌，上面写着“Abaya，我们的身份，我们的权利”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“法国的穆斯林政策，其实是其针对所有族群公民基本要求的组成部分。”上海外国语大学中东研究所研究员钮松告诉南方周末记者，就宗教服饰而言，其所涉及的也不只是头巾问题，其他宗教包括基督教的相关服饰或标志也在限制之列。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“换言之，法国在公共领域对于宗教服饰、标志的限制，并不是针对特定的宗教，但宗教信仰者的抗争也一直伴随着政策推行的过程。即便是法国社会内部，也存在着对共和同化与政教分离原则的理解和执行方法上的不同看法。总之，围绕头巾、abaya服装的激烈对抗不仅撕裂了法国社会，而且也必然激怒保守的穆斯林群体。”钮松说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;争论持续多日后，法国最高法院9月25日作出裁定，政府对穆斯林服饰长袍的禁令是“合乎法律”的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;为什么&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;总&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;是法国？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2015-2016年，法国巴塔克兰音乐厅枪击案、《查理周刊》袭击案等接连发生，暴力恐怖袭击愈演愈烈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年7月14日，造成至少84人死亡的“尼斯海岸恐袭案”发生后，英国安全智库“现实主义研究地缘政治与安全中心（CGSRS）”刊发名为《为什么总是法国》的报告，试图分析法国境内恐袭高发的内在逻辑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报告称，虽然其他欧洲国家也经历过恐怖主义，但是“法国正在呈现出一种明显的模式”“受到的影响尤为严重”。同时，虽然袭击者宣称“效忠极端组织”，但大多数人都是年轻的法国公民，且呈现小团体式活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么法国成为本土伊斯兰恐怖主义如此突出的目标？报告对此作出了多个解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先是外交政策。报告称，法国长期以来一直干预穆斯林世界，特别是中东和北非（MENA）地区。因而伊斯兰主义者经常把法国视为“合法目标”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，法国人口构成增加了伊斯兰恐怖袭击的可能性，比如7%-9%的人口是穆斯林，远高于德国或英国等其他欧洲大国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，来自中东和北非地区的移民缺少流动机会，长期生活在贫困之中，由此带来对法国本土人民和机构的“不信任和仇恨”。最后，法国有着悠久的世俗主义传统，许多公民对任何形式的宗教都持非常消极的看法。这让一些穆斯林群体感到宗教自由受到了攻击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于法国缘何被极端组织“盯上”，多名中国国际关系学者也向南方周末记者作出解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钮松认为，在西方阵营内部，法国针对多元族群和信仰群体的态度较为“严苛”，强调族群平等并捍卫世俗化原则，不允许宗教元素在公共领域过分展示。因此，围绕头巾问题、abaya服饰问题等所产生的矛盾与冲突便会周期性呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，外来移民、难民与欧洲社会存在着结构性矛盾，这既包括经济实力上的显著差距，更包括文明背景上的迥异。德国与意大利等国对穆斯林移民的态度与政策相对温和，而法国因其严格的世俗化政策而更容易在宗教服饰等问题上激化早已累积的矛盾，并因问题的涉教性而难有回旋余地。法国自然成为恐怖组织在欧洲展开袭击的“优先”选项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国人民大学国际事务研究所所长王义桅告诉南方周末记者，法国是近代欧洲文明的发源地。法国大革命的自由、平等、博爱理念影响了整个欧洲。但是，自由的泛滥也带来了对其他文明的冒犯，这会引起保守主义者的不满。同时，法国穆斯林人口众多，针对外部穆斯林世界的行为也会引起内部的反弹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如《为什么总是法国》报告中预测，“由于问题的复杂性和深度，法国未来可能面临更多恐怖袭击”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;这&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;不是新鲜事&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;除了法国外，瑞典也是这场“恐袭预告”中的袭击对象。这与瑞典国内数月来激进主义者焚烧经书风波有关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自2023年6月起，瑞典多地发生焚烧、亵渎伊斯兰宗教典籍事件，主要参与者为伊拉克难民萨尔万·莫米卡（Salwan Momika）和萨尔万·纳吉姆（Salwan Najem）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二人多次公开反对伊斯兰宗教典籍《古兰经》，并举行示威活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，在这次“恐袭预告”之前，瑞典就因“烧经”事件被其他极端组织“点名”恐吓。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年8月，基地组织媒体平台“As-Sahab 媒体基金会”（The As-Sahab Media Foundation）在一份题为“攻击侵略民族的义务”的公告中呼吁，对丹麦和瑞典在过去几个月中发生的焚烧经书行为展开“报复”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月13日，英国外交部发布出行警告，称瑞典很有可能发生袭击事件，其安全当局已挫败了多起袭击企图。中国驻瑞典使馆也提醒，中国公民应关注瑞典当前安全形势变化，提高安全意识，保持高度警惕，加强安全防范。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月17日，瑞典将该国恐怖主义威胁等级从3级提升至4级“高威胁状态”，这是2016年以来的首次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;瑞典当局称，这一决定是基于瑞典安全形势不断恶化而作出的“综合性、长期性和战略性判断”。此后，瑞典多个部门在边境、机场、公共交通等多领域加强安全措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于瑞典遇到的“恐袭威胁”，英国国王学院瑞典恐怖主义研究员汉斯·布鲁恩（Hans Brun）认为，这些威胁“并不是新鲜事”，没那么重要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他告诉瑞典TT新闻社，“你可以把它看作是对个人行动的号召。如果这是他们自己组织的，他们就不会这样提前宣布。你还应该记住，基地组织如今已被大大削弱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布鲁恩表示，基地组织的声明不会影响整体安全局势，最大的影响可能是在中东工作的丹麦和瑞典外交官，他们可能需要采取额外的预防措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布鲁恩的“预言”并非空穴来风。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月，激进分子在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩一座清真寺外焚烧经书后，伊拉克抗议者冲进瑞典驻伊大使馆，驱逐了大使并烧毁了使馆。伊拉克总理苏达尼甚至因此驱逐了瑞典大使，并暂停了瑞典电信公司爱立信的工作许可。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至目前，瑞典政府正在寻求法律手段限制近日来愈演愈烈的经书焚烧事件，以缓和与伊斯兰国家的紧张关系。然而，支持者们则提出，这可能违反该国宪法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;他们会采取行动吗？&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;自2023年9月8日橄榄球世界杯开幕以来，法国一直在举办大型活动，包括查尔斯三世国王来访、教皇来访等，而这些活动将一直持续到2024年巴黎奥运会。正如法国内政部长达尔马宁在受访时感慨，“恐怖主义风险很高，重大事件接踵而至”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;达尔马宁表示，为了做好奥运会安保，法国已经增加了14000名警察和宪兵，并与多个部门合作，以应对不同的风险。 “我们已经为此努力了两年。”达尔马宁说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;伴随着恐袭预告的发出，不少民众担心极端组织是否会付诸行动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法国情报研究中心副主任阿兰-罗迪埃在接受BFMTV采访时称，阿拉伯半岛基地组织威胁《查理周刊》两年后才采取行动，“这表明基地组织有能力等待”“当他们发出威胁时，随后往往会采取行动”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月28日，南方周末记者通过邮件联系到阿兰-罗迪埃，他透露了该组织的诸多细节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿兰-罗迪埃表示，2013年，阿拉伯半岛基地组织通过线上出版物《Inspire》公布了11名“通缉人物”，其中包括《查理周刊》漫画家斯特凡·沙邦尼尔(Stéphan·Charbonnier）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两年后，两名自称来自基地组织的恐怖分子谢里夫·库阿奇(Cherif Kouachi) 和赛义德·库阿奇(Saïd Kouachi) 兄弟袭击了《查理周刊》，导致包括周刊主编在内的至少12人死亡，多人受伤。而肇事者之一赛义德曾于2011年在也门接受了军事式训练。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿兰-罗迪埃认为，自2015年袭击事件以来，极端组织发起的圣战运动似乎不再把西方国家作为直接目标，而是“通过广告招募”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这些组织似乎没有足够的手段派遣活动分子到欧洲实施恐怖行动。我们必须确保他们的演讲不会被内生的恐怖分子所利用。”阿兰-罗迪埃说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海外国语大学中东研究所钮松认为，在全球协同反恐的攻势之下，基地组织的影响力大不如以前，但其仍具有实施暴力恐怖主义袭击的动机与能力。因此，此次基地组织威胁对法国与瑞典展开袭击仍不可掉以轻心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钮松表示，事实上，包括法瑞在内的国际社会一直对基地组织的当前动向和活动能力保持高度关注和应有的警惕，不会对其口头威胁无动于衷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有人对这场恐袭预告持怀疑态度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法国苏凡中心(Soufan Center)资深研究员瓦西姆·纳斯尔在接受法国《观点》杂志（Le Point）采访时呼吁，民众应该保持理性，“恐慌的时刻还没有到来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他认为，该杂志内容共17页，重点关注也门，对瑞典和法国的威胁只出现在第14页。 “威胁当然存在，我们必须认真对待它，但目前没有理由更加恐慌。”纳斯尔说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（南方周末实习生李金澳对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴赫：国际奥委会正考虑创办奥林匹克电子竞技运动会]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258672]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;电竞能否入奥，或许不久将有一个新的答案。国际奥委会主席巴赫14日晚在这里透露，国际奥委会正在考虑创办属于电子竞技的奥林匹克运动会。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2021年，国际奥委会举办奥林匹克虚拟系列赛。这是国际奥委会在电子竞技领域的首个试点项目。基于奥林匹克虚拟系列赛的成功经验，国际奥委会在今年又举办了首届奥林匹克电子竞技周，结果大受欢迎——包括预选赛在内，电子竞技系列赛吸引了超过50万名参与者，比赛在所有频道上的直播浏览量超过600万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巴赫说：“这是一个充满希望的开始，但这仅仅是一个开始。就像在任何运动中一样，即使在一个充满希望的开始之后，真正的比赛仍然在前面。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巴赫在当晚的致辞中还谈到了人工智能，他说:“我们的持续成功取决于我们如何拥抱不断加速发展的数字技术，特别是人工智能。这使得我们的《奥林匹克2020议程》更加紧迫——&#39;要么改变，要么被改变&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巴赫强调，国际奥委会必须掌握主动权，“我们必须对人工智能的机遇和风险进行全面分析，然后立即采取行动。我很高兴地告诉你们，这项工作已经在进行中。如果事情进展顺利，你们可能会在巴黎（奥运会）看到一些初步的结果”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国际奥委会第141次全会将持续至17日。此次全会的主要议程包括就《奥林匹克宪章》修正案以及2028年洛杉矶奥运会的项目设置进行表决，选举产生若干名新的国际奥委会委员。此外，全会将对《奥林匹克2020+5议程》的中期实施情况进行评估，并听取2024年巴黎奥运会、2028年洛杉矶奥运会、2032年布里斯班奥运会、2026年米兰-科尔蒂纳丹佩佐冬奥会以及未来两届青奥会筹备工作进展的报告。 &lt;/p>;

The employees of the maintenance shop in the service area threatened to stop the maintenance technicians hired from outside to repair the car. Is this &quot;reasonable and legal&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, a truck transporting fruit broke down and failed to start while resting in the Jiangxi Fengcheng service area of ​​the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway. After the auto repair shop in the service area said it could not repair the vehicle, the driver himself invited a technician from a nearby designated repair shop of the truck manufacturer to come to the service area to prepare for repairs. Unexpectedly, he was blocked and intimidated by the staff of the repair shop in the service area. The maintenance technician who was invited had no choice but to leave. The truck driver contacted several local repair shops, but they did not dare to arrange for personnel to go to the service area to repair the vehicle. There was no choice but for the driver to drag the car off the highway to repair it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for car repairs to conflict with repair shops in expressway service areas. More than a month ago, a similar incident occurred in the Jiqing service area in Hunan. A truck driver was stopped by repairmen in the service area when he was inspecting his truck. After being told that the driver made the repairs himself, he uttered wild words. On social networks, similar complaints involving car repairs and tow truck conflicts on the highway are not the same. Some service area repair shop staff even use violence or threaten violence against drivers who repair their own cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the highway, can only repair shops in the service area repair cars? In an interview with the media, the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said that the practices of the repair shop in the service area are &quot;reasonable and legal and have laws to follow.&quot; The law the person in charge refers to refers to the provisions of the Highway Law, Highway Safety Protection Regulations and other relevant regulations that &quot;prohibit the establishment of stalls within the scope of highways and highway land.&quot; This is obviously a misinterpretation. The so-called &quot;setting up stalls&quot; refers to setting up relatively fixed stalls for a long time and waiting for customers to come to your door. The purpose of prohibiting it is to avoid &quot;damaging, polluting the highway and affecting the smooth flow of the highway.&quot; After receiving the invitation from the customer, he temporarily went on the road to repair the car, precisely to repair the vehicle as soon as possible to avoid parking on the road for a long time and to ensure the smooth flow of the road. Regardless of the definition of &quot;setting up a stall&quot; or the legislative purpose of the regulations, it is completely legal for drivers to repair their cars by themselves or to invite repairmen to temporarily repair their cars on the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict at the Jiqing service area in Hunan mentioned above, the maintenance personnel in the service area claimed that the Provincial Department of Transportation has a document that stipulates that &quot;people below&quot; (referring to repair shops other than highways) cannot go to the highway for repairs. car, but ultimately failed to produce relevant documents. Do the traffic management departments in some places really have such regulations? If such a document does exist, it should be made public and reviewed for legality. If the government department does not have such regulations, is this an internal regulation of the highway management department, or is the service area repair shop lying? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In vehicle maintenance services, drivers and car owners are consumers, and of course they have the right to freely choose repair service providers. Auto repair shops in service areas prevent drivers from repairing their cars by themselves or other repairmen, and force drivers to go to their repair shops to repair their cars. This is a &quot;forced transaction&quot; behavior that is expressly prohibited by the Consumer Rights Protection Act. The Criminal Law also stipulates that using violence or threats to forcefully buy or sell goods, force others to provide services or force others to receive services, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes the crime of forced transaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are obviously illegal behaviors so common? The root of the problem lies in the word &quot;profit&quot;. As the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said, off-road vehicle maintenance personnel going to the service area to repair cars &quot;harms the interests of the service area repair shops.&quot; The interests of service area repair shops are actually the interests of service area and highway managers. Expressway service areas, as part of expressway service facilities, are constructed and operated by expressway managers. If a repair shop opens in a service area, it must pay space rent to the highway administrator. These rents are generally higher than those for sites outside highways, because this is not only site rent, but also implies a premium for &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; Precisely because highway managers also benefit from the &quot;exclusive operating rights&quot; of repair shops, they will naturally try their best to protect the interests of repair shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;exclusivity&quot; premium is very common in closed establishments. Food prices in airport terminals and highway service areas are generally much more expensive than in urban areas. Even canteens in primary and secondary schools can be auctioned for sky-high prices. This is all due to the monopoly benefits brought by the &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; More importantly, these premium benefits are not obtained through market competition, but rely on franchise rights granted by administrative power. For these infrastructure operators with administrative monopolies, the common practice in various countries is to strictly limit their profit margins to maintain a balance between attracting social investment and avoiding huge profits to maintain public welfare. To this end, they must be strictly supervised to prevent them from relying on their monopoly status to harm the public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, there was an incident in a highway service area in Guangdong where a driver repaired his own car and was threatened by a repair shop employee. Due to public opinion and the intervention of relevant departments, the auto repair shop in the service area was shut down for rectification. The same incident occurred in Fengcheng, Jiangxi this time. The public expects local market supervision and other departments to take timely action to investigate and deal with forced buying and selling, and forced transactions to safeguard the interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[身份证、退伍证、婚姻信息、家庭住址……当一个明星被“开盒”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258670]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of October 12, Chen Muchi, who plays the role of Prince Yin Jiao in the movie &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;, He posted a statement on Weibo, responding that he &quot;did have a marriage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/a4e19d459cf53705edb203836a30d784.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;413&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/a4e19d459cf53705edb203836a30d784.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254121&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why suddenly Admit that you have been married? It turned out that before Chen Muchi released his statement, a screenshot purporting to be his marriage registration information had been quickly circulated on the Internet. The screenshot contains very detailed information, including not only the registration certificate number, registration institution, registrar’s name and registration date, but also personal information such as the ID number and household registration location of both men and women. Some netizens even circulated an unmosaic version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the melon-eaters discussed with enthusiasm was nothing more than: getting married and divorced at a young age? There was no response to rumors about a relationship on the Internet before, so why did you come out to respond when it was revealed that you were married? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some netizens pointed out that Chen Muchi had to respond because he was &quot;opened&quot;. Because not only his marriage registration information is spread on the Internet, but also his ID card photo, veteran information and personal contact number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/e216e7cb88a5f40d47751c7ce1ddfeef.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/e216e7cb88a5f40d47751c7ce1ddfeef.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254119&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot; Open the box”? &quot;Unboxing&quot; is not essentially different from &quot;human flesh&quot;. It is an act of publicly exposing the privacy of others on the Internet with the purpose of &quot;breaking the other party&#39;s hypocrisy&quot;. It is actually an act of cyber violence that infringes on personal privacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, celebrities, like ordinary people, have the right to marry and love freely, and they can choose to do so publicly or not. Although celebrities, as public figures, will be exposed to the public eye and accept comments from the outside world, can their personal privacy be exposed at will and involuntarily? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of personal privacy leakage reflected in this incident is more serious than many people imagine. Nowadays, any ordinary person will receive sales calls from different banks, credit, and real estate companies every day, and the leakage of personal contact information has become a common occurrence. For celebrities, their ID numbers are almost an open secret. Taking airport pick-up and drop-off as an example, how do fans learn about a celebrity’s travel itinerary? Most of them have the ID numbers and itinerary information of celebrities, and this information usually comes from illegal &quot;scalpers&quot; selling it for a few yuan to dozens of yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/18a2b1484d42333596d077e3559bf7b8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;617&quot; height= &quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/18a2b1484d42333596d077e3559bf7b8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/208f5fa16d95e7cd3c26e368dbbbbe9a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/208f5fa16d95e7cd3c26e368dbbbbe9a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254118&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this information, they can not only grasp the star&#39;s schedule, They can also book air tickets and steal their mileage at will. Artists such as Li Chen, Wu Lei, and Jiang Yingrong have all experienced situations where their airplane seats were changed and their mileage was stolen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the desire for voyeurism is infinitely magnified, some people will even use public power to satisfy such dark desires. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Chen Muchi&#39;s marriage registration information was exposed, many netizens questioned the source of the screenshots - from which channel did such detailed personal privacy information leak out? Was it the work of staff from the civil affairs system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, on January 31, 2023, Hu Ge announced that he was getting married and had a daughter. However, because his wife was not a public figure, Hu Ge did not disclose her identity. Someone also exposed Hu Ge&#39;s marriage registration information, allowing netizens to discover that Hu Ge&#39;s wife is a staff member close to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/ae1f0a396113d36fa7ceeb8745b50d52.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;630&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/ae1f0a396113d36fa7ceeb8745b50d52.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have a lawyer Popular Science: In real life, no matter lawyers, courts, public security, or procuratorates, they cannot access citizens’ information at will.

The act of spreading other people&#39;s privacy based on the mentality of taking advantage of others will not only cause secondary harm to the victim, but is actually illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 1032, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code stipulates: &quot;Natural persons enjoy the right to privacy. No organization or individual may infringe on the privacy rights of others by means of spying, intrusion, disclosure, disclosure, etc.&quot; The right to privacy protects the privacy of natural persons. It can be seen from the word privacy itself that it has two characteristics: one is &quot;hidden&quot;, that is, it is not a public state. If it has been disclosed by a natural person on his own or legally disclosed, it is not private; the second is &quot;private&quot;, That is, private matters have nothing to do with other people&#39;s rights and interests, public interests, etc. It is from these two aspects that Article 1032, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code defines privacy as: &quot;A natural person&#39;s private life is peaceful and he does not want others to know about his private space, private activities, and private information.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Article 1033 of the Civil Code stipulates that, unless otherwise provided by law or with the explicit consent of the right holder, no organization or individual may commit the following acts:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;( 1) Intruding on the private life and peace of others through phone calls, text messages, instant messaging tools, emails, leaflets, etc.;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Entering, photographing, and peeping into other people&#39;s homes, hotel rooms, and other private spaces;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;(3) Photographing, peeping, eavesdropping, and disclosing the private activities of others;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Photographing, peeping at the private parts of others’ bodies;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(5) Process other people&#39;s private information;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(6) Infringe on the privacy rights of others in other ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter whether you love or hate a person, you should not use the &quot;open box&quot; method to make other people&#39;s legally protected privacy and personal information public, and you must never do anything illegal. Blind tolerance and helplessness will only encourage the voyeurs&#39; desire for control and arrogance, allowing them to hide in dark corners and continue to do whatever they want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you are a celebrity or an ordinary person, your right to privacy is protected by law. Legal experts also emphasized that when the legitimate rights and interests enjoyed are illegally infringed, one should immediately call the police and use legal weapons to protect one&#39;s own rights and interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国足协换届选举产生新一届主席、副主席]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258674]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 10:13:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 16, the 12th Member Congress of the Chinese Football Association was held in Beijing to elect new members.

The probe successfully entered orbit. The two first stages of the launch vehicle All thrusters were recovered and the launch mission was a complete success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the whole mission has just begun. According to NASA: The probe will have to fly 2.2 billion miles (nearly 3.6 billion kilometers) to reach &quot;16 Psyche&quot; in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter in 2029, and orbit the asteroid for 26 months. scientific investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The magnetometer on board the probe will search for evidence of the asteroid&#39;s ancient magnetic field to prove the theory that it is the remnant of a fragmented planet&#39;s core. Gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers will help scientists determine the chemical elements that make up asteroids. A multispectral imager will provide information about its mineral composition and its topography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This exploration mission includes many first-of-its-kind scientific and technological innovations: This is the first time a human spacecraft has used Hall-effect thrusters (electromagnetic propulsion) in deep space beyond the lunar orbit. vehicle), driven almost entirely by solar energy, flew to the junction of the inner solar system and the outer solar system; it was also the first time for humans to explore the first M-type asteroid metallic body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA emphasized: This project is the result of comprehensive cooperation between the American scientific community and industry. The main research team is led by Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University, and more than a dozen other universities and research institutions participate. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech in Southern California assist NASA with scientific management, systems engineering, integration and testing, and mission operations. Maxar Technologies&#39; team in California is responsible for the solar power system and the &quot;Hall electric pusher&quot;. SpaceX&#39;s Falcon Heavy launch vehicle is responsible for the probe launch mission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to NASA&#39;s scientific expedition mission, this project is of great significance to the future development of mankind. It can be said to be the first step in the exploration journey of &quot;interstellar mining&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;16 Psyche&quot; is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was discovered by the Italian astronomer Gasparis on March 17, 1852. It was named after &quot;Greek mythology&quot; by humans. Named after Psyche, the wife of the soul and Eros, the god of love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The long axis of its ellipsoidal body is 225 kilometers, and it is almost entirely made of metal. Its mass is astonishingly large, about 272 million tons, accounting for about 0.6% of the total mass of celestial bodies in the &quot;asteroid belt&quot;.这颗小行星的金属比重达82.5%，主要成份是铁、镍，以及黄金、铂、铜等贵金属。 &quot;Forbes&quot; and others value it at between US$1 billion and US$100 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists are curious: Why is the metal content of this asteroid so high? One theory is that it is the remnant core of an early planet in the early stages of the formation of the solar system. During the growth process of a planet, it was hit by other celestial bodies, and its outer crust and mantle were shattered into countless fragments, leaving only bare metal material. The original planetary core. The reason for this speculation is that the small &quot;Psyche&quot; actually has two large impact craters, and there is no sign of water or hydrated minerals on its surface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, human research on the planet’s core is still extremely limited. We have not even drilled through 1/3 of the thin crust, the outermost layer of the Earth’s structure. Research on the mantle and core can only be done. Make inferences based on seismic waves. If &quot;Spirit Star&quot; is indeed proven to be a rocky planetary core, then this cooled planetary core will allow humans to intuitively understand the structure of the planet&#39;s core and gain a deeper understanding of the planet&#39;s origin, evolution, and development. This will further promote the rapid development of geophysical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA’s launch of a probe to the “Spirit Star” is undoubtedly paving the way for the commercialization of space resources in the future. This kind of investment in technology and capital is very long-term. Just like Prince Enrique in the early days of the &quot;Great Navigation&quot;, he continued to invest in the ocean for decades, but it took several generations for the Portuguese royal family to get feedback from the ocean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With human aerospace technology, the cost of mining from extraterrestrials and transporting it back to earth will be so high that 1 kilogram of pig iron is more expensive than the same weight of top-quality diamonds. So, why do NASA and Musk conduct such research and exploration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author believes that their idea is not to smelt iron on the &quot;Ling Shen&quot; and then send it back to the earth, but to &quot;colonize Mars&quot;. &quot;Ling Shen&quot; is extremely far away from the earth, but relatively close to Mars. &quot;Mars colonization&quot; requires a large amount of building materials. If iron, nickel and other metals from &quot;Spirit Star&quot; are used, it will be much cheaper than transporting materials from the earth to Mars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Iron and nickel are the basic materials for making stainless steel. Using solar energy, space metallurgy is directly performed in a vacuum space environment. The production process is completely different from that on the earth, and no carbon-based energy and catalysts are needed. Musk insists on exploring the application of stainless steel in his &quot;Starship&quot; research and development, rather than the carbon fiber aerospace materials used by other countries. This can be explained logically: they have considered the selection of materials for large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing on extraterrestrial planets. question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Musk has also invested in Solar City to develop solar energy. This can be explained by NASA taking great technical risks to use solar-powered &quot;Hall thrusters&quot; in the &quot;Psyche&quot; mission. pass. In the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, solar radiation is already weak, so why choose a less efficient solar drive? It seems that NASA is exploring technology to improve the efficiency of its use under the conditions of low solar energy in deep space. This is the exploratory spirit of &quot;knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, and prefer to travel to the tiger mountains&quot;, which shows his great determination, firm will and actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I played the video game &quot;StarCraft&quot;, and &quot;interstellar mining&quot; was the first step in building a base. Unexpectedly, before reaching old age, human beings have already begun to try to realize their dreams. It can be said that thousands of sails are racing against each other and hundreds of teams are competing against each other.

Photo by Wang Xinyi&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Wenfeng&#39;s 15-year career as a blind masseur can be divided into two periods: in the first period he struggled with &quot;what can a blind person do&quot;, and in the latter period was he answering &quot;what can I do&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval was a two-year escape - in 2019, he decided to escape from the blind employment paradigm and worked as a barista and telephone recruiter in Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about the same time, another blind masseur, Sun Jingrui, also chose to run away. After they briefly crossed paths in Guangzhou, the two lifelines bifurcated again, but they ended up reaching the same destination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 31, Ren Wenfeng returned to his hometown of Huanggang, Hubei Province and reopened a massage parlor in the small county town. He and his wife manage the small shop, which is about 40 square meters, and entertain three or four customers every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;34-year-old Sun Jingrui also returned to the massage parlor, but he chose to work in the metropolis Guangzhou. His store is also closer to the consumption perception of modern urbanites: warm yellow lighting, the fragrance of essential oils, supplemented by Mindfulness meditation.客人不太多时，静睿会写方案，或是外出对接资源，像一个创业者那样，思索着如何打造更多连锁店。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the China Disabled Persons&#39; Federation, as of 2020, there are 17,300 blind health massage institutions in China. In the common discussion of &quot;What can blind people do without massages?&quot; Ren Wenfeng and Sun Jingrui may have many answers to this question, but one thing is for sure, although returning to a massage parlor may not seem to fit the mainstream narrative, it is Doesn&#39;t mean &quot;failed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Falling into Darkness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ren Wenfeng and Sun Jingrui are both acquired blind people, which means that they need one more layer of psychological construction than congenitally blind people. They want to eliminate all their once-visible selves, as well as their past thoughts, and learn to live in darkness from scratch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was 8 years old, a wooden stick flew in while playing and changed the direction of Ren Wenfeng’s life. The surgery failed to save his vision, and retinal detachment was a gradual farewell, which was more painful than a sudden plunge into darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He began to worry about his future life: Will he have to rely on his parents for the rest of his life? How will I support myself in the future? These questions all point to the same thing: What can a blind person do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day during the summer vacation, he listened to a radio program that introduced summer training classes to people. He called and asked: &quot;What can blind people do?&quot; The other party told him that he should contact the local Disabled Persons&#39; Federation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, the process of Sun Jingrui&#39;s blindness is like a person struggling in the water. When he was in junior high school, he was diagnosed with retinal detachment.因为发现较晚，手术难以逆转损伤，这几乎等同于宣判失明。 The doctor suggested that he go to a school for the blind to adapt to his future outcome in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sun Jingrui decided to race against his eyesight. He wanted to get into a good university before he lost his sight, so that he could &quot;choose a major that is not too hard on the eyes and continue to live a normal life.&quot; Before suffering from eye disease, Sun Jingrui’s dream was to major in mechanical engineering at South China University of Technology. This was a place where he could realize his dream of becoming an engineer. But in his sophomore year of high school, the fog in front of his eyes became thicker and thicker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2006 was the year of Sun Jingrui&#39;s college entrance examination. The girl he had a crush on would call him and ask him &quot;When will he come back to class?&quot; She had sorted out the class content and was waiting for him. Sun Jingrui said vaguely &quot;next month.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui could not wait until the day he returned to the classroom. With the disappearance of the last bit of light, he became completely blind. He no longer dares to go out for fear that others will notice the strangeness of his eyeballs. Occasionally, once he goes out every few months, he will outline the surrounding environment in his mind and turn his head frequently, trying to act like he was before he lost his sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For discerning people, career planning is a process of continuous focus: &quot;study-weigh-choose&quot;, and finally choose the track you are best at. But for blind people, massage parlors are one of the most common secular choices and one of the few stable careers for this special group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blind massage parlors are like blind paths in the city, existing but not noticeable. They are scattered throughout the city, set up at street intersections, on the first floor of residential buildings, or between barber shops and grocery stores. Most stores are simply furnished, with a few lamps, a few beds, and one or two chairs placed in fixed locations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Wenfeng’s first massage parlor job was in Wuhan, and he was contacted by the Disabled Persons’ Federation in his hometown. The massage shop is located on the second floor of a residential area. Four beds and two sofas are squeezed into the 20-square-meter house. At night, he called his mother and complained: &quot;It&#39;s too shabby. I want to turn around and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he persisted in the end: &quot;As long as there is a job that a blind person can do, anything can be done.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, Ren Wenfeng came to Shanghai from Wuhan. When customers at the massage parlor talked about urban life, Ren Wenfeng stood aside with envy. In his world, the busiest moment in Shanghai is the store celebration in June. The heat wave carries the crowds, sending the noise and footsteps into the store. The masseurs are busy amidst the waves of people&#39;s voices and the sounds of watches. . After the store celebration, the crowd dispersed, leaving the masseur in the dark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time is monotonous: working from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., food and accommodation are included in the store, and most of the time is spent waiting. Time just slipped between the thick and deformed fingers. In the view of Ren Wenfeng at the time, &quot;This is a job with no future, or even a present.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任文峰第一次工作时，那双骨节分明、纤细柔软的手，被人评价为“一双可以用来弹钢琴的手”；现在，从事按摩业十年有余，任文峰的手指变得像擀面杖一样厚重，“专门干按摩这一行的手”，有人这么夸奖他。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Sun Jingrui has also noticed changes in his body. The muscles on the back of the hand are broad and thick, and the top of the thumb nail is slightly buckled due to years of exertion. The skin connected to the nail has shed its skin and is slightly white. In Guangzhou, he relieves the pressure on the shoulders and necks of many white-collar workers who sit in offices for a long time, but his own cervical vertebrae are tingling due to long-term fixed posture massage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui is unwilling to live in a traditional massage shop. Pictures of the lives of discerning people in the past remind him from time to time. If he cannot return to the world of discerning people, he must at least make achievements in the massage industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sun Jingrui&#39;s thumb tip is peeling.

Photo by Wang Xinyi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Beyond Making a Living&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Internet is one of the common channels for visually impaired people to contact the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2018, Ren Wenfeng learned about the &quot;Coffee in the Palm&quot; project of Hemu Innovation Center, a non-profit organization in Guangzhou, through an online forum. This is an activity to train visually impaired people to learn hand-brewed coffee skills and become baristas. As the road was being built in front of the store and business was not booming, Ren Wenfeng closed the massage parlor operating in Wuhan and went to Guangzhou to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yingzhang, the head of Hemu Innovation Center, was deeply impressed by him: &quot;I resigned from Wuhan and occasionally do some part-time jobs to supplement my income.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Sun Jingrui also used the Internet to The community gained access to the &quot;Dialogue Academy&quot; project organized by &quot;Dialogue in the Dark&quot;, a Hong Kong social enterprise. He sold the massage parlor he was running and went to Hong Kong alone for training as one of the six members who passed the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Ren Wenfeng who started his career with massage, Sun Jingrui had the consciousness of entering the &quot;mainstream workplace&quot; when he just lost his eyesight. With good English, he once sought opportunities to work as an interpreter through a hotline program on a radio station. This experience ended in failure, which shattered his illusions about employment for the visually impaired. Returning to the field of massage, he also considered entering a hospital. But &quot;total blindness&quot; once again prevented him from getting a stable and decent job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem goes far beyond that. Finding a position that accepts visually impaired people is the first step. After entering the workplace, the challenge really begins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming blind, more than ten years of experience in massage parlors affected Ren Wenfeng&#39;s character. Sensitivity and low self-esteem were the biggest challenges he faced in the &quot;mainstream workplace&quot;. When he was a barista, some customers would initiate conversations, but he could only respond with silence. In Ren Wenfeng&#39;s narration, his perception of the &quot;mainstream world&quot; is contradictory: like a mirror: on the polished surface facing outward, he wants to be recognized and prove that he &quot;can also accomplish many things&quot;; on the coated surface It is his timidity, he is afraid that others will notice his &quot;difference&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hong Kong, in order to adapt to the teacher&#39;s rhythm and language environment, Sun Jingrui needs to listen to class recordings repeatedly. &quot;Going to bed at two or three in the morning, and getting up again at six or seven in the morning, because class starts at eight.&quot; During the course, he was deeply touched by two parts. The first part is &quot;self-advocacy&quot;, where visually impaired students learn how to seek help in the workplace; the second part is skills training, including holding regular meetings, taking notes, organizing activities, etc. These ordinary people&#39;s daily work content is very new in Sun Jingrui&#39;s eyes. &quot;There is no such thing in a massage parlor.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visually impaired people choose other jobs, they always subconsciously compare them with the massage industry. They use the massage industry as a frame of reference to view the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the practical part of the course in Hong Kong, Sun Jingrui needed to design workshops and course content alone in a social enterprise. With the help of his instructor, he gradually grew from an initial &quot;facilitator&quot; to an &quot;implementer&quot; of the project. By&quot;. He gradually discovered: &quot;I can actually do a lot of things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from Sun Jingrui&#39;s discovery of &quot;what he can do&quot; in the workplace, Ren Wenfeng&#39;s experience as a barista made him discover &quot;what he cannot or cannot do&quot; What do you like to do?&quot; Looking back now, Ren Wenfeng feels that knowing &quot;what not to do&quot; is the beginning of career planning - in this sense, although he failed to become an excellent barista, this experience is not a failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the limited income of a barista, Ren Wenfeng wanted to do something else. His second job is telephone recruitment: 30 phone calls a day that last for more than 30 seconds, corresponding to a basic salary of more than 1,000 yuan; if the other party is willing to submit a resume and successfully joins the job, he will receive a commission. According to Ren Wenfeng&#39;s rough statistics, the call answering rate is about 50%, which means that at least 60 calls need to be made every day. What is more difficult to control is that most of the answerers will hang up the phone in about 10 seconds. Rejection is normal, and what makes Ren Wenfeng even more unbearable are those unfriendly words. After a few months, Ren Wenfeng&#39;s performance was at the bottom of the group because he was not good at speaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Sun Jingrui also experienced telephone recruitment work. He summarized the job as &quot;repetitive&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;: &quot;I keep saying repetitive words every day, and even get scolded.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Guo Siyuan, a teacher at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Zhongkai College of Agricultural Engineering: &quot;The uneven quality of education for blind people is the pain point that restricts the employment of people with disabilities.&quot; Ren Wenfeng also described the problems encountered in the &quot;mainstream workplace&quot; The embarrassment is attributed to the lack of education. Blind people only need to learn the skills of living. As for spiritual nourishment and interpersonal communication skills such as literature, history and philosophy, it seems not so important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sun Jingrui&#39;s &quot;Healing Time&quot; store uses warm yellow as the main color.

Photo by Wang Xinyi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Seeing” myself&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, after returning to Huanggang from Guangzhou, Ren Wenfeng started a family. Now the massage parlor he runs is facing the road, with a small yard behind it. Although it cannot be seen, he bought green plants and table lamps and carefully arranged this imaginary space. In his free time, he would make himself a cup of coffee with the sound of wind chimes and sunshine, waiting for customers and learning something new at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I returned to the massage parlor because I didn’t feel safe enough.” Ren Wenfeng said, “Many jobs are not only unstable, but may also have no income at all.” The stable income brought by massage parlors means that he Be able to feel more confident in front of parents, loved ones and neighbors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Take what you have learned back and open a store. This may be Wenfeng&#39;s most practical choice.&quot; Liu Yingzhang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the rush of big cities, small cities are more casual. The guests communicated with Ren Wenfeng about the details of the massage in their hometown dialect. Sometimes Ren Wenfeng would take the initiative to ask the guests &quot;does it hurt?&quot; He was no longer content to be a silent backdrop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jingrui’s store in Guangzhou opened in 2022. The store staff are partners who met during charity activities, and are supported by startup resources from the Hemu Innovation Center. The concept of the store is to use mindfulness to guide customers to observe their bodies, highlighting the masseurs Masseurs gain recognition through their professional skills and techniques, and no longer rely on selling essential oils and other peripheral products to gain value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of colleague Zhang Jinlan, Sun Jingrui&#39;s attempt to break through traditional massage parlors is &quot;very meaningful.&quot; Many customers will give gifts to the visually impaired masseuses in return, and will also hold their hands and show them the gifts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;White-collar workers like to call Jing Rui by his English name Ray, and some customers call him &quot;dolphin&quot;. He said he likes this nickname: when humans are drowning, dolphins will lift humans to the surface of the water. In daily life, Jingrui is willing to enlighten his visually impaired friends and lift them out of the &quot;ocean&quot; of emotions.每当张金兰在工作上遇到难点时，孙静睿就会罗列出要点，逐条和她讲道理，“他是一个可以并肩作战的伙伴”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙静睿希望帮助更多的视障人士到外面看看，但单枪匹马的“托举”往往有些无力。他不太好意思直接劝，有时会采取“迂回战术”，比如，故作轻松和朋友说：“明天有一个演讲俱乐部，谁有空一起过去玩一下？”朋友们会觉得很新奇，但是一到真的要上台表演的时候，他们又觉得“太害羞了，不行的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙静睿也曾面临这样的困境。在刘颖璋看来，孙静睿算是这一群体的“精英”。第一次来到该中心参加活动时，孙静睿戴着墨镜，用一口流利的英语和大家打招呼，这种“大哥”气质当时就给刘颖璋留下了很深的印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在工作中，孙静睿最初也有“依靠明眼人管理者”的思维惯性。目前，合木创新中心的“手心咖啡”和“愈时间”按摩店项目都由视障人士担任管理者，独立带领视障与非视障的员工，共同参与市场竞争，这和以往由非视障人士领导的模式有本质不同。他们希望这种模式能够打破视障者只能在职场中扮演从属者的偏见，有一天，只需稍加引导，他们能主动探索世界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;孙静睿在网络上广为流传的个人照。网络图片&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/bd761597be.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1264&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/bd761597be.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254116&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;孙静睿在网络上广为流传的个人照。网络图片&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在网络上流传较广的一张照片中，孙静睿身着白衬衫、牛仔裤，戴着墨镜，一只手托着下巴，露出标志性露齿笑。但他记忆中自己的形象，却停留在18岁之前，静睿的梦想是未来有一天，他的视力恢复了，能够亲眼看看身边伙伴的模样，也能看看自己穿上职业装是什么样子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（陈鑫、刘颖璋和深度训练营对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我们该以什么姿态面对“牺牲者”丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258658]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/z03yFnCJiTOLmMoGQ3hWWPydrAH9HG48GZcsUjV2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1063&quot; height=&quot;681&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/z03yFnCJiTOLmMoGQ3hWWPydrAH9HG48GZcsUjV2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254109&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;年轻时的何协（左）与朋友。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月，我去了内蒙古根河市郊的敖鲁古雅鄂温克自治乡采访，使鹿鄂温克人已经搬迁到那儿整20年了。这场搬迁，对鄂温克人来说，最大的变化就是禁枪。这意味着他们传统游猎生活的终结。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在乡里闲晃，和人谈起枪的事，边上的看客马上给我指路：这得找何老大啊，还有谁能比他更清楚？语气里隐约带有些揶揄的味道——在当时，我并不清楚这里头有什么故事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;找到何老大也不难，大多数时候，他都和妻子卓耶在家门口的长凳上安静地坐着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何老大的本名叫何协，“中国最后一位女酋长”玛力亚索的大儿子，鄂温克人里最后一代猎民。一到他家门前，他就招呼我坐下，还给我开了瓶海拉尔啤酒，这是他的待客之道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来我才知道，枪在去年刚给何协惹来麻烦。2003年前后收枪时，他私藏了把小口径枪，2022年卖给了别人。被人举报后，法院以倒卖枪支罪判刑。何协搞不清判决书是怎么写的，就记得“判二缓三”，退休金也没了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好在，何协也没那么在乎钱，够用就行了嘛。两口子靠卓耶每月四千多的退休金过活，是“月光族”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何协的一位朋友和我讲起不久前发生的事。前段时间，何协向他借了500块，说是要拿去还钱。结果，何协还了一百多块的账，剩下的钱全买了卤牛肉和啤酒。三百多买的肉，两口子没吃几筷子，全拿去喂了乡里的狗。“这不是糟蹋钱吗？”提起这事，这位朋友多少还有些生气。他也拿何协没辙，“这家伙，倒是什么也不操心！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何协的一些举动也的确让人无可奈何。采访期间，我和何协等人一起回了趟搬迁前的老敖乡，当晚在附近民宿住宿。即便民宿大堂醒目地贴着请勿吸烟的告示，何协还是旁若无人地抽起烟来。同行者劝他出去抽，他又犟上了：抽根烟怎么了？现代社会的规矩在他那儿基本是失效的。民宿老板只得再三叮嘱我们，一定要看住何协，房间里可绝对不能抽烟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在敖乡，他成了“没进步”的一类人。内蒙古社科院民族研究所研究员白兰关注鄂温克人已有三十多年，和何协一家成了老友。她和我讲起，2023年7月，她去敖乡参加一场旅游论坛。碰到何协时，他已经喝到差不多了。乡长赶紧让工作人员把他送回了家，“那么多领导来，（担心）何协搁那儿丢人”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离开敖乡前，我打算去和何协告个别。一进门，他正躺在屋里闷着头睡觉呢。卓耶告诉我，何协已经在床上躺了一整天，前两天有客人来，高兴，又喝猛了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到北京后，我读了纪录片导演顾桃写的《敖鲁古雅·敖鲁古雅》，这是他拍摄“鄂温克三部曲”时的日记合集。书里描写的何协同我见到的完全是两副模样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在顾桃的书里，他是山上猎民点神气的“点儿长”。“锯鹿茸时，何协总要对着喷血的茸喝上几口，眼睛眯成缝，卷卷的头发，脸上还溅着血滴，别人看了会吓一跳，他却很享受。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在猎民点，何协的气场能镇住那些偷酒喝的人。“维佳和毛谢（二人都是鄂温克猎民）没有去找鹿，而是搭上顺风车去阿龙山找酒了。中午毛谢和维佳醉醺醺地回来，看到何老大，都悄悄躲回自己家的帐篷睡去了”。“只要何协在点上，玛力亚索就不会担心”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;我忍不住想，要是他们还有枪，还能上山打猎，何协会不会和现在的状态不一样？当然，这只是个无效的假设。只有一两百人的使鹿鄂温克人，融入现代化进程中，是早晚都会发生的事情。而其中总有一两代人，会成为这一进程中的牺牲者。他们上一代，完整地享受了山林中的生活，而下一代，没那么多包袱，又探索出了新的活法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有学者认为，从国家治理的层面上看，这是必须要做出的牺牲。理性的态度是，记住牺牲的那部分人，给予他们及后代一定的补偿，“这才是现实”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;白兰说，她一直在思考，怎么让鄂温克人在发展过程中，有更多自主选择权，让传统得以延续。不过，她到现在，还是没有结论。“作为研究者，有时候我感觉自己是失败的。”听到白兰说出这句话，我心里咯噔一下。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为记者，我能做的，只能是记录下“牺牲者”如今的生活状态，抵抗遗忘。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/CoPO3sir3sJ83J1WYSZA9THj2LsdK3ILWHYsS49V.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1073&quot; height=&quot;771&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/CoPO3sir3sJ83J1WYSZA9THj2LsdK3ILWHYsS49V.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254108&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年7月23日傍晚，何协坐在定居点的马路牙子上喝酒。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者韩谦/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
