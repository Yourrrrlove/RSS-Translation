The reimbursement ratios of employee medical insurance and resident medical insurance are 70% and 50% respectively. The new regulations will take effect on November 1, 2023. According to Li Rong, director of the Reproductive Medical Center of Nanning Second People&#39;s Hospital, according to the above notice, women with fertility difficulties can be reimbursed for first- or second-generation in vitro fertilization, ranging from more than 4,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan, depending on the type of insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move once again aroused attention and discussion. Previously, several provinces have included assisted reproduction projects in basic medical insurance. Since July 1 this year, Beijing has included 16 therapeutic assisted reproductive technology projects, including in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination, into the scope of basic medical insurance reimbursement; Liaoning has also included 18 assisted reproductive technology projects such as embryo culture and embryo transfer this year. Reproductive projects are included in the catalog of maternity insurance. It is conceivable that more provinces will follow suit, and assisted reproductive technology will be included in basic medical insurance or become standard equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are mainly two types of families that benefit from this medical insurance policy: one type of family is for elderly mothers who have reproductive needs but have difficulty conceiving naturally, and the other type of family is for infertility (not caused by age factors) , such as congenital factors, reproductive history, lifestyle or environmental factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuehong, an expert from the National Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Review Group, said: It is generally believed that the physiologically ideal reproductive age for women is 22-28 years old, or at least no more than 35 years old, because fertility or ovarian function cannot be achieved before the age of 35. It reaches a peak and then declines rapidly, and the risk of over-age childbirth will also increase; and, according to her clinical experience, the average age of patients seeking assisted reproduction has tended to become younger in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for assisted reproduction in the first category of families stems from the fact that as marriage and childbirth continue to be postponed, the number of infertile people due to age is increasing. According to the 2017 Fertility Situation Sample Survey data, from 2006 to 2016, the average age of first childbirth for Chinese women increased from 24.3 years old in 2006 to 26.9 years old in 2016. In big cities, the age of first childbirth and childbearing is even later. For example, in Shanghai in 2022, the average age of first childbirth will be 30.36 years old, and the average age of childbirth will be 31.18 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the second type of infertile families, in addition to congenital factors, reproductive history is also a major factor that cannot be bypassed. In 2021, Qiao Jie, Dean of Peking University Third Hospital, released the &quot;Lancet Special Invited Major Report on Maternal and Child Health in China&quot;. The report stated that between 2007 and 2020, the incidence of infertility in my country increased from 12% to 18%. In terms of reproductive history, miscarriage, especially repeated miscarriage, may lead to postoperative salpingitis, endometritis, or even fallopian tube adhesions and uterine cavity adhesions, which may lead to infertility. The above-mentioned report shows that from 2005 to 2017, China’s induced abortion rate increased from 20.2‰ to 27.3‰. Among women in China who have experienced at least one miscarriage, the repeat miscarriage rate is 65.2%. The high miscarriage rate and repeated miscarriage rate are highly positively correlated with the infertility rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turning to assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization, because of a strong desire to have a child is not an easy matter. Basically, it is a matter of luck to succeed once and for all. From eggs to embryo culture and then to embryo transplantation, problems may occur in every step and the success may fail. The pain suffered by the body and the pressure endured by the spirit cannot be explained to outsiders. The cost is not only money, time and energy, but also mental burden and wear and tear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, the inclusion of IVF in basic medical insurance can only partially cover the financial costs borne by these families, but it cannot fundamentally solve the problem of infertility, because infertility is both a medical problem and , is also a social issue. Generally speaking, if a problem is taken seriously before it appears or is in its infancy, the cost is the lowest if it needs to be prevented and solved if it needs to be solved. Waiting until it becomes a large-scale social problem before dealing with it will not only increase the cost exponentially. rise, and the effect is unsatisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, the infertility problem that can be solved is: pushing the age of first childbearing forward to fall within the optimal childbearing age range, which requires early marriage and childbirth; reducing the miscarriage rate, especially repeated miscarriage rate, which means reducing or even avoiding unplanned pregnancies. This is better than resorting to assisted reproductive technology in the future. For individuals and families, it is obvious that they can consider and make decisions in this way. However, once a problem becomes a social problem, it is not that simple, because the essence of this social problem is a problem of values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people attribute the delay in the age of marriage and childbearing, the decline in fertility rate, and the rise of unmarried and childless people to the high cost of childbearing. But when it comes to fertility, the benefit side is obviously more important than the cost side. Nowadays, many young men and women ask &quot;What is the meaning of getting married, forming a family and having children?&quot; This in itself means a sudden change in the fertility instinct and the values ​​of marriage and childbirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today we live in an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Material abundance is unprecedented. This will first lead to the reduction and disappearance of selection pressure. At this time, the population is more inclined to enjoy self-enjoyment rather than sacrificing self-enjoyment. , go through all kinds of hardships to raise offspring; secondly, it will lead to the rise of the concept of non-marriage and childbearing, which in turn will further suppress the desire to marry and have children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the high abortion rate, especially the repeated abortion rate, from a technical perspective, it is nothing more than a question of strengthening contraceptive measures; from a moral perspective, there is also a question of how to strengthen sexual morality. Parents should care about their children&#39;s values ​​and teach them by words and deeds to have a serious and prudent attitude towards sex: men should of course respect women&#39;s rights and wishes and assume due responsibilities; women, as the first person responsible for their own physical and mental health, should protect Regarding one&#39;s own body and reproductive health, in Chinese judicial practice, reproductive rights or reproductive decision-making rights are unique to women. The other side of this right means the ultimate responsibility to oneself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 15:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[茅台宣布涨价20%，你会考虑买吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259728]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/qL5DZI90cRcSNDnj5wu2J1eJR5qcV1BCEtlztjt7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/qL5DZI90cRcSNDnj5wu2J1eJR 5qcV1BCEtlztjt7. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256342&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31, Moutai announced that it would increase the volume of Kweichow Moutai by 53% starting from November 1 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Feitian, Five Star&lt;/span>;) ex-factory price, &lt;strong>;the average increase is about 20%&lt;/strong>;. This adjustment does not involve the market guidance price of the product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Moutai’s first price increase in the past six years. The last time was in January 2018, the ex-factory price of 53-degree Feitian Moutai 500ml was increased from 819 yuan to 969 yuan, and the retail price was adjusted to 1,499 yuan. According to this 20% increase estimate, the ex-factory price of Feitian Moutai may reach about 1,162.8 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moutai’s price increase also has a certain impact on the stock price. On November 1, Kweichow Moutai’s bidding opened 9.82% higher, with the stock price at 1,850 yuan, approaching the daily limit. Although it fell back quickly after the opening, as of 11 a.m., Kweichow Moutai was still up 4.74%, with an intraday turnover of 13.4 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June this year, Ding Xiongjun, chairman of Kweichow Moutai, said at the shareholders’ meeting that one must be wise when and how to raise prices. “If Feitian Moutai can raise prices, there will be more profits.” , the management thinks so too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a price inversion in the famous liquor market, and Feitian Moutai is almost unique. Combing the ex-factory price and retail price of 53-degree Feitian Moutai from 2004 to 2020, it is not difficult to see that the ex-factory price has been rising all the way, and the retail price has increased by 757%. Among them, there are both the influence of market supply and demand, and consumers’ psychology of “hoarding goods to increase prices”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2020, Ji Keliang, former chairman of Kweichow Moutai, said, &quot;Young people don&#39;t drink Moutai because it&#39;s not time yet.&quot; Will the price increase announced this time have an impact on people’s purchasing intentions? When &quot;Moutai ice cream&quot;, &quot;sauce latte&quot; and &quot;wine-filled chocolate&quot; are released one after another, how many people will pay for that expensive sip of Moutai? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在3260米的香格里拉高山植物园，普通比浪漫重要]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259715]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/01/b1acc0ba09.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 01/b1acc0ba09.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256368&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden at an altitude of 3,260 meters. Visual China|Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is it like working in a botanical garden? This has intrigued me for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the countless late nights when I was incompetent in writing, I wanted to resign and go to the botanical garden to be a gardener. The dream soon came true, and the location was actually Shangri-La. In September 2023, I became an intern gardener at Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shangri-La, formerly known as Zhongdian, is located in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan. At 3,260 meters, it is the highest botanical garden in the world. It protects about a thousand species of higher plants on land equivalent to 1/5 of the Summer Palace. There are many endemic species named after Zhongdian, such as Zhongdian rose, Zhongdian hawthorn, etc. Some of them are nationally protected wild plants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The strange thing is that hundreds of plateau plants are bred here, and they are basically not exotic flowers and plants, or even &quot;ordinary and common&quot;; most botanical gardens belong to The Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden is a public institution with financial allocations, but it is a private non-enterprise organization with &quot;three noes&quot; - &quot;no money&quot;, &quot;no one&quot; and &quot;no establishment&quot;. It was planned to be established in 1999 and opened in 2005. It relies on itself to find a way to survive. road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;All this gives Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden an independent and romantic color. However, after the short internship and interview, the romance had long since dissipated for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a story about finding the meaning of ordinary seeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Romantic&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Along the Yunnan-Tibet Highway, starting from Shangri-La County and heading northwest, the buildings gradually recede, and large tracts of golden highland barley suddenly burst in. Come into view. In early September, the Napa Sea formed by the melting of summer snow is gradually turning into the green Yila grassland, with horses roaming and white Tibetan-style houses glowing under the clouds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/2bd98486b7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;717&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/2bd98486b7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;View of Napa Sea from Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden.

My task today is to move the indoor hypericum seedlings outdoors, and then transport the hypericum to the maze area of ​​the botanical garden on the top of the mountain with a tractor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/7dc6bc48e4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/7dc6bc48e4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256370&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tractor loading hypericum in the nursery. Photo by Liang Jingyi&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sounds so simple. The first step is to change equipment. I put on a red and black plaid bear apron that reached my ankles, put on plastic gloves, and held a big pink basin. The second step is to enter the nursery. A nursery is 24 meters long and 8 meters wide, which is equivalent to a classroom. There were hundreds of black bags on the ground, containing hypericum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/961698f128.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/961698f128.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256371&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 24, 2023, Huaian, Jiangsu Province, hypericum flowers were in full bloom in Jiulong Lake Park. Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hypericum is a common flower in parks and greening projects. When it blooms in June and July, the slender bunch of stamens on the top are as bright as gold threads. The bottom petals look like butterfly wings, so they are also called golden thread butterflies. The hypericum I see now has been sown for two years and has not yet bloomed. It has slender branches and oval leaves. It is fragrant when you get close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I found that this botanical garden is different from the ones I have been to before. There are neither weird potted plants nor collections of treasures from around the world. On the contrary, there are many native plants similar to Hypericum in the botanical garden, including pink-flowered Zhongdian thorn rose, blue-purple Zhongdian aconitum, red-fruited Zhongdian hawthorn, standing Yunnan pine and alpine pine...their names Just carry local labels, such as &quot;Zhongdian&quot;, &quot;Yunnan&quot; and &quot;Gaoshan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/288ef03f89.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/288ef03f89.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhongdian Delphinium. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fang Zhendong, the founder and former director of the Botanic Garden, also has a picture of a native plant - Trichosanthes versicolor hanging in his office. He is 59 years old, of medium build, with drooping eyebrows, gray hair, and cheekbones that are black and red rendered by ultraviolet light from the plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fang Zhendong is from Weixi, Diqing. The local area lacks biological talents. His college entrance examination application was changed from the mathematics department to the biology department. After graduating from Yunnan University, he returned to Works at Diqing Institute of Plateau Biology. Later, he traveled throughout the mountains and valleys of Diqing and wrote the book &quot;Wild Flowers in the Hengduan Mountains of Yunnan, China&quot;. When he was almost 35 years old, Fang Zhendong wanted to build a world-class botanical garden in Shangri-La. This was also a romantic thing for him at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/4975935dd1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/4975935dd1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256373&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Zhendong was on an inspection trip to Niru High Mountain Area. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yunnan is the base camp of horticultural plants and has been known to foreign &quot;plant hunters&quot; more than a hundred years ago. There are at most 12,000 plant species in Europe, while Yunnan has 17,000 species, and Shangri-La alone has more than 5,000 species. Alpine valleys with large vertical elevation gradients became a refuge for plants during the Ice Age and a breeding ground for biodiversity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A Scotsman named George Forrester was sent to China by the Edinburgh Botanic Garden. Starting in 1904, he conducted seven botanical expeditions in the Hengduan Mountains. . He hired eight Naxi people in Baisha, Lijiang, to move a rhododendron with a diameter of more than one meter from Gaoligong Mountain out of the mountains and transport it to the British Museum for display; he used mules to transport 31,000 Yunnan plant seeds and wax leaf specimens, which were recommended To gardens around the world, specimens are used by taxonomists at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh to rename and publish new species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The azaleas and primroses brought back by Forrest from Yunnan are still being bred in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and the specimens are kept in the herbarium. In the 1990s, Fang Zhendong went to Edinburgh Botanic Garden. Looking back now, he is still very touched, &quot;Our local plant resources are valued by foreigners, but what about us?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While talking about this, Fang Zhendong suddenly stood up , found his copy of &quot;Wild Flowers in the Hengduan Mountains of Yunnan, China&quot;, pointed to a passage written by his mentor, the late botanist Mr. Qin Renchang, and read word for word:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text -align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yunnan The rich source of plants has contributed to the progress of European and American civilization far and wide. It is a pity that our country is backward in science. The Chinese people did not know how to use the treasures of talent to enrich their lives. Instead, they cultivated them in public and private courtyards in large cities and towns. The flowers that are being viewed are almost all imported and have been common in European and American gardens for hundreds of years. Once they enter the country, those who like them flock to them like birds of prey, sacrificing themselves for others, which is a shame. &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This passage was written in the 1930s, but even in the 1990s, native species were not valued and were even threatened by alien species. The situation remains. Fang Zhendong still remembers that at that time, a kind of Eupatorium adenophora native to South America entered from southern Yunnan and approached Diqing along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. He worries about the impact of invasive alien species on the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Land use is also changing, with natural pastures being converted into cultivated land, and hillsides being exposed due to sand and stone quarrying. Fang Zhendong discovered that Diqing was originally the area with the richest wild orchid resources in China. In the 1980s, it was not difficult to find orchids every time he entered a ravine. But in the 1990s, the orchid craze took off, and outside owners bought the orchids by the truckload. Since then, wild orchids have been hard to find anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So Fang Zhendong wants to build a botanical garden. &quot;The first is to conserve local species; the second is to develop and utilize local plant resources for garden construction and cultivation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1999, the Alpine Botanical Garden was approved as a project after discussion by the Yunnan Provincial Development and Reform Commission and the former Environmental Protection Department. A preparatory office was first set up, and Fang Zhendong was appointed as the director. In 2001, construction of the park started, and plants were planted on the exposed scars of sand and stone excavation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/2c81e4e808.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/2c81e4e808.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256374&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Today, green trees grow from the sand pit in the Alpine Botanic Garden. &amp;nbsp; Liang Jingyi/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Reality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After I changed my clothes in the nursery, I said two words Don&#39;t talk, let&#39;s do it. I squatted down, used a shovel to dig Hypericum out of the bag, cut off the roots on the ground, and put it into the pot. One bag of Hypericum with seedlings and soil is about 4 pounds, and one pot can hold two bags. After installing it and getting up, I used the strength of my lower back to pick up the pot, walked 10 meters to the outside of the nursery, took out the seedlings, arranged them, and returned. Repeat this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/a9dd2c7f83.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;811&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/a9dd2c7f83.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Transporting Hypericum seedlings. &amp;nbsp; Liang Jingyi/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2, 4, 6... Every time I transport a pot, I count it silently. The number rises and I feel a sense of accomplishment. But starting from the 10th basin, it was a bit difficult to stand up, and my back began to strain. By the 16th pot, it was no longer a problem. I was gasping for air and my heart was pounding. Do you think I&#39;m weak? But I was doing weight-bearing exercises on a plateau three thousand meters above sea level, moving soil in a place where my speaking speed slowed down significantly and I avoided running and jumping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;20, 22, I can’t hold on anymore. At 10:36, it started to rain and the greenhouse leaked. More than an hour of moving work was stopped. I don’t know how grateful I am for this rain. When I stood up, my vision went dark. The light and the romantic imagination of the botanical garden disappeared in this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When building a botanical garden, will there be a moment when romance disappears?&quot; I asked Fang Zhendong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Yes, when it&#39;s time to find money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1999, the office to be built in the Botanical Garden was only It is a temporary agency and cannot pay insurance for newly hired employees. In 2004, the Botanical Garden Office invited relevant departments to a meeting to discuss the management system and came up with two options: one is to jointly build a public institution. The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the local government will each establish several establishments to jointly manage it, and it will be operated by central or local financial funds. , which is also a common system in domestic botanical gardens. The other type is private non-enterprise, which is responsible for its own profits and losses, has no financial budget and no establishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We recommended the first set of co-construction plans to the government, but at that time the government&#39;s finances were still relatively difficult and the staffing may be tight, so we proposed the second plan. Take care of it first.&quot; Fang Zhendong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This plan paved the way for subsequent operating pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the Botanical Garden was established as a private non-enterprise, the first board of directors was also established, and Fang Zhendong became the legal representative, chairman and executive director. The pressure came like a mountain, including finding construction funds, paying employees, and also needing to bear ecological compensation for the local community. In total, the annual cost of maintaining the botanical garden is no less than three million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although it is a tourist attraction, it is difficult to make money from tourists. At 17:28 on September 1st, there were still 2 minutes before the park closed. A total of six people bought tickets to enter the botanical garden throughout the day, two foreign tourists and four local tourists, and the total fee was 80 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some employees once felt that tourists now like to check in and take photos, and suggested that &quot;we should keep up with the times and create a cherry blossom avenue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fang Zhendong denied it very directly, &quot;If you want to see cherry blossoms, go to the park to see them. We are not a park.&quot; He felt that the more important thing &quot;is to show the cherry blossoms.&quot; Domesticated local native species, (this is) our original intention.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Botanic gardens are often in debt. A friend of Fang Zhendong always lends him money. &quot;He is a scientist, not a businessman. He can only write scientific research reports and take on greening projects. Some (projects) still cannot collect money.&quot; Most people&#39;s stress lasts for a month or two at most, but Fang Zhendong persisted for twenty years, relying on scientific research and engineering projects to support it. The situation only eased two or three years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the 24 years since its establishment, the botanical garden, with the efforts of 20 employees, has built many plants including the Fragrant Snow Medicine Garden, Linzhi Spruce Seed Garden, and Alpine Pine Seed Garden. A specialized garden. Although the business situation has improved, some ideas still remain on paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The sign near the south gate of the Botanical Garden says &quot;dry heat type&quot; and &quot;humid type&quot; exhibition greenhouse. Follow the direction and you will see two exposed greenhouses. Crushed limestone. Fang Zhendong made a calculation and found that there are two major parts in greenhouse construction, first is infrastructure construction, and then is species collection and cultivation. The initial investment is estimated to be more than 10 million, and subsequent maintenance will be even more expensive. &quot;Warmth preservation, temperature control, and humidity control must all be considered.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/29ece74f96.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/29ece74f96.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256376&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The greenhouse is still stuck on street signs and planning. &amp;nbsp; Photo by Liang Jingyi&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Tired.&quot; Fang Ye, the current director of the Botanical Garden, had tired eyes. Three years ago, he took over the botanical garden from his father Fang Zhendong. He wanted to build a smart scenic spot and improve the explanation system, but he was stuck because there was no one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Local young people are more willing to work within the system, while outsiders find it too remote. Fang Ye finally found a person born in Guangxi in 1995 on Weibo. A college student who stayed for 4 years and left &quot;without saying anything&quot;. Four years is already a long time, and Fang Ye is recruiting people now and he doesn&#39;t expect to stay that long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fang Ye still hopes that the botanical garden can be merged into a public institution. Before the merger, this private non-corporate organization has to find its own way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the rain stopped, I counted more than a hundred bags of hypericum on the wall. A master gardener took off his apron, I saw him wrapped around a white jockstrap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Seeds&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first step in raising hypericum seedlings in the Alpine Botanical Garden Nursery is naturally to have seeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The gardener took me to see the seeds of Hypericum. As soon as I walked into the seed warehouse on the second floor of the nursery, the scent of rosin hit my face. This is the first time I have seen so many &quot;dry goods&quot;: the cones of alpine pine are like elastic brown balls, the seeds of lupine are like thumb-sized lotus pods, and the fruits of Nyingchi spruce are like hard and sun-dried roses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He grabbed a handful from a large sack and said, &quot;These are the seeds of Hypericum.&quot; I looked closer and saw that they were lighter than sand and smaller than sawdust. They ran away when the wind blew and multiplied with the wind. This is the natural law of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But it is difficult for humans to collect seeds. When hypericum planting season comes in November, the botanical garden will invite villagers to collect hypericum seeds in the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But not all seeds can be obtained from villagers. Employees of the botanical garden also have to go to the wild to collect seeds, while also inspecting very small populations and collecting specimens. Extremely small populations refer to wild plants that have a narrow distribution area, are severely disturbed by the outside world, and are on the verge of extinction at any time. It&#39;s extremely difficult to find them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/59774e2679.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;717&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/59774e2679.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;256377&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Botanical Garden collects the seeds of S. truncatula.

Many major events happened in the world, but they have nothing to do with us for the time being. We walked in the back mountains of Naixia Village, Gyirong Town, Gyirong County, Shigatse Prefecture, the Pure Land of Tibet. We focused on field investigation work and were far away from the hustle and bustle of information. It seemed that all rumors had lost their carriers and became nameless islands. In such an environment, we seem to have a lot to say every day, and we seem to say the same thing every day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Are you hungry?&quot;...

It&#39;s full of water, so wet that it feels like it&#39;s been stuffed in a refrigerator when it&#39;s taken off. A cold chill shoots out from your spine. Then the stove was stuffed into the lungs, and the cold air was sucked in, which made the lungs hurt. foot?

Green velvet, also known as &quot;alpine peony&quot; and &quot;dream flower&quot;, grows on flowstone beaches or on the front edge of glaciers at an altitude of more than three or four thousand meters. The whole plant is covered with downy or bristly hairs, and its color is clear and eye-catching. Three species of green velvet have been designated as national secondary key protected wild plants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/a21754f83b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/a21754f83b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green velvet. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After harvesting, the seeds need to go through a process of soaking and seed selection. Empty or underfilled seeds will float up and be fished out and thrown away. . But Liu Lin was reluctant to soak the seeds of green velvet because it was too difficult to collect. &quot;It would be a pity to throw them away if the seedlings can emerge even if they float.&quot; The deputy director of the botanical garden is tall and has two blushes on her face. The table is full of plant tables. She manages the collection, breeding, domestication and utilization of seeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are very few examples of successful breeding of green velvet. On December 5, 2022, Liu Lin and her colleagues planted a batch of green velvet. One month later, the emergence rate was less than 50%. Green velvet &quot;is most likely to die when it grows two leaves. It will die if there is too much water, and it will die if there is too little water, so it is very difficult.&quot; I asked her how many seedlings survived in the end. She pointed to the pile of soil in the distance and said, &quot;Look, half of them are already dead.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After working for more than ten years, Liu Lin has long been accustomed to accepting the death of plants. After many battles and difficult passes, there is still the process of tempering the seedlings after they emerge - taking measures such as ventilation, cooling, and proper water control to train the seedlings. She still remembers the Nepalese yellow flowers she planted for the first time. They were raised in a nursery greenhouse for half a year and moved out to refine the seedlings. All of them died in one winter, and only two or three of the 20,000 trees were left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;We can only start over. They figured that maybe it was too cold and the transplanting season was wrong. So while the Nepalese yellow flower seedlings are still in the greenhouse, occasionally put them out to practice in the sun for a while, and then transplant them when they are firmer. There is no previous experience in the breeding of these plateau native plants, so &quot;we can only try to do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like the hypericum I moved today, the seedlings sprout easily, but for some reason, the seedlings tend to die when transplanted. So they came up with a new plan: fill the bag with soil, put the seeds in the soil, and when the seedlings grow up, just tear the bag open and plant it into the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Every slender Hypericum tree I can see is a miracle, having experienced life and death. However, Hypericum is not a rare species and has not been included in the protection list. Where will the native plants that Liu Lin and the master gardeners have worked so hard to breed end up going? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Repair&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 30, 2023, I followed the Greenpeace team in Shangri-La From a road not far away, I saw some mountains that had been blasted away for road construction. Neatly planted cedar trees were planted on the bare plots, but the leaves were wilted and yellow, drooping in the cold mountains. Greenpeace researchers said with regret, &quot;These trees are probably not going to survive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Lin said that many ecological restorations involve buying exotic tree species. , cheap and easy to cut, but difficult to adapt to the local environment, and later maintenance and management are also difficult, seriously affecting the survival rate. Fang Ye explained that many people think that ecological restoration is enough to turn green during inspection and acceptance within one or two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shangri-La suffered large-scale commercial logging in the 1980s and 1990s. After 2010, everyone realized the importance of ecological restoration. However, Fang Zhendong felt that the initial ecological restoration &quot;had no good concepts and ideas at all. The greening company found ready-made tree species based on ready-made plans, regardless of whether the plants could adapt to (the environment).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 28, I attended a seminar on ecological restoration in Shangri-La. Experts from Yunnan University and the Chinese Academy of Forestry also believed that True ecological restoration is not simply about planting trees and greening: planting trees at all costs on the Loess Plateau without allowing thinning, overly dense forests will make things worse for areas with little water; fire may not be the &quot;source of all evil&quot;, for some forests, fire is just Scorch the surface and give the seeds time after burning, and they will come back to life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the seminar, Fang Zhendong took us to see the large-fruited cypress, a tree of the genus Picea in the Pinaceae family, a national second-level protected plant. He said that the policy stipulates that whoever cuts down trees should restore them, and large-scale green trees with large fruits are used for afforestation. When the botanical garden was built, a research team also applied for a vegetation restoration project on degraded forest land and planted 300 acres of large-fruited green cypress in the botanical garden. It grows very slowly when first planted, but grows rapidly after reaching one meter. The fruit is red and smooth, and is very ornamental. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fang Zhendong suddenly stopped explaining, looked for reporters, and reminded me to write it down. He went on to say that a scenic spot in Shangri-La has a large-fruited green tree forest, and diseases and insect pests have appeared one after another. There is a spruce sawfly that eats all the needles off the tree. There is also a fungal disease in which the leaves start to turn yellow inexplicably, and then the entire trunk dries up and the tree dies in pieces. There was also an insect infestation in Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden, but it disappeared later, maybe it was controlled by other organisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But in many places, entire spruce trees have been eroded by disease and introduced to the local larch. However, native spruce trees do not develop this disease. &quot;We suggested to the forestry department that we should not use this (large-fruited green tree) species for afforestation in the future, but use our local spruce.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/073c891244.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/01/073c891244.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256380&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Big tree in the botanical garden Fruit green skewer Liang Jingyi&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2006, Fang Zhendong understood the theory of ecological restoration succession: plant communities change dynamically. As time goes by, a plant The community is replaced by another plant community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Starting from the bare surface, grass seeds flew in and evolved into herbaceous vegetation; birds and animals excreted shrub and tree seeds here through feces, evolving into shrubs; trees After more than ten years, it will grow into dominant vegetation and become a forest; different types of trees slowly mature through young and middle age, and become top-level vegetation after hundreds of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logging and mining are bringing the top vegetation back to the original bare surface. Without human intervention, nature will still start a new cycle of succession. Fang Zhendong&#39;s team is trying to shorten the succession time of hundreds of years. For example, it takes decades to rely on wind birds and beasts to spread seeds, while artificial sowing and transplanting seedlings only take a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the process of succession, some plants are called &quot;pioneer plants&quot;. They sprout quickly and cover the ground surface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Like the Hypericum that I carried?&quot; I asked Fang Zhendong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Yes, it is a pioneer plant. It can grow naturally on burned land at an altitude of 2000-3300 meters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The native plants in the Shangri-La Botanical Garden have adapted to the cold and harsh environment. During ecological restoration, subsequent maintenance costs are low and they are not susceptible to pests and diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, failed ecological restoration projects have come to the botanical garden for advice. The botanical garden, which was struggling to operate, also found a way to survive and no longer went into debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/4462cf67f4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1129&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/4462cf67f4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256381&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ecological restoration case before and after restoration. &amp;nbsp; Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I went to an ecological restoration case site. This area was once an exposed wasteland due to the construction of a bridge, with limestone, debris, and gravel everywhere. Since 2006, with the help of the theory of natural succession, alpine pine seedlings, Nepalese goldenrod, ruffled-leaf primula, and Yunnan seabuckthorn cultivated in the botanical garden have gradually become pioneer plants, &quot;occupying&quot; the exposed surface. Now, the poplar catkins blown by the wind have taken root here and grown into poplar trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the distance, the human bones in the sky burial platform have been broken into pieces, and the red-billed crow is circling in Songzanlin Temple. The wild plants in the mountains that were destroyed by people slowly recovered, and ordinary seeds took root and sprouted here for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[马大勇：关于三部电影的回忆]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259586]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/sALtonw37jkUcz1EzbAPbtJSujus10HVlqo2d0Gf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;711&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/30/sALtonw37jkUcz1EzbAPbtJSujus10HVlqo2d0Gf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256017&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Four Weddings and A Funeral &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, I remembered Andy again. I&#39;m talking about Andie MacDowell, the heroine of Four Weddings and A Funeral. The poet Zhu Zhu once uniquely compared Juliette Binoche to &quot;the first bite of ice cream in spring.&quot; Yes, everyone has their own bite of ice cream. The difference is that his ice cream is French, while mine is from the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is the representative of British comedy movies, but the overwhelming joy of it has been almost forgotten. What can&#39;t be washed away is Andy&#39;s eyes, which look tenderly and lovingly at Hugh Grant, who always looks hasty and clumsy, and at me, who is also hasty and clumsy. She is the kind of person who is very tolerant and restrained, allowing you to make mistakes and holding you lightly in her arms. During the time when I was in my twenties, Andy had been quietly watching my sadness, unobtrusively and undazzlingly, like the simple and strange flower in my youthful dreams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, she was forgotten. Time flies by, the soul is lost, the youthful mood gradually fades, and there are no more dreams at night. As a result, Andy became a coordinate of his youth, precipitated in the light and shadow of time, eroded and lost day by day. When the world of mortals rises, what is left in our hearts? I once read some beautiful short poems and was filled with emotion, so I wrote a quatrain: &quot;After eating, my heart is drowning in the Zen of my pen, and I am disappointed with the dripping of powder and kneading cakes. I was also very fond of it back then, and once wrote about the spring breeze.&quot; When spring ice cream Melting little by little, the strange flowers in the dream withered little by little, Andy, none of us can resist the wand of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since ancient times, beauties are like famous generals, and they are not allowed to grow old in the world.&quot; In the blink of an eye, Andy is in his sixties, right? It is no longer easy to find negative photos of her youth online. Audrey Hepburn, Catherine Zeta Jones, Sophie Marceau, Maggie Cheung, Rosamund Kwan, Christy Chung, Zhu Yin... How should they think lovingly of their radiant beauty when they look in the mirror at midnight? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Seventy Years Back in Time&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/vpztrExXnh6Tp89qxkOGuwoYdapFWWvdWJCAtFYr. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/vpztrExXnh6Tp89qxkOGuwoYdapFWWvdWJCAtFYr.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;256018&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Somewhere in Time &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;The flowers bloom in spring, the wind in autumn and the setting sun in winter, I once ignorantly thought so in my melancholy youth.&quot; On the university campus in the 1980s and 1990s, there was no other music than Luo Dayou&#39;s This song touches our heartstrings even more. I am a person who is quite sensitive to time. When I was a teenager, I would be immersed in her magic and couldn&#39;t extricate myself. Later, after seeing the dead end, the legend, the ups and downs, and life and death, I finally understood time. If you can heal everything and carve everything, you are already heading towards the vicissitudes of middle age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I have been fanatical about Time Movie for a long time. Because movies are one of the ways to understand time. It has infinite capabilities of hypothesis and expression, and it brings me endless emotion and sadness. A movie that also belongs to youth: &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (Somewhere in Time). At the end, when the male protagonist sees today&#39;s sun and moon inlaid on the coin, the beauty from seventy years ago instantly moves to that end of time. Falling, how melancholy it is forever and ever, and how terrifying it is! Time-themed movies usually have amazing visual effects, like &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, like &quot;Black Hole Frequency&quot;, like &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, but this one does not. It relies on time itself to create the effect, like a cup of pure Kuding. Tea, without any added flavour. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kcje4CxpjUT7PJW6oRdUxKTdl0CK4IBNe9MBXEOL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;453&quot; height=&quot;664&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/kcje4CxpjUT7PJW6oRdUxKTdl0CK4IBNe9MBXEOL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256019 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Shawshank Redeption&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is the taste of time? To me, at least, those black and white video tapes with blurry, pulsing images are one of a kind. After I fell in love with movies, those black and white lights and shadows accompanied me for a long time, day and night, morning and night, like dreams that I couldn&#39;t see clearly or remember. &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;Last Year at Marienba&quot;, &quot;Fang Fang&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and yes, there is also the one that can never be skipped &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (The Shawshank Redemption). After watching it dozens of times, I still can&#39;t quite explain its charm. Or, any elaboration and explanation are unnecessary. As the Buddhists say, will it become a &quot;textual barrier&quot;? However, there are some sentences that I can still retrieve from the warehouse of my memory at will (thanks to the subtitles of the video version, their Chinese version is no less than Stephen King): &quot;We can&#39;t understand what is being sung in it, but it seems to be an angel The sound made the thick stone wall disappear without a trace. At this moment, the prisoners in Shark Castle regained their freedom.&quot; &quot;Busy, busy living, or busy dying.&quot; &quot;Some birds cannot be shut down because of their wings. It’s so glorious.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Birds with brilliant wings lingered in my once bleak world. Without their chirping, we would always be prisoners of despair. Staring at the beating black and white light and shadow that night, listening to the &quot;hissing&quot; echo of the video tape, my prison disappeared without a trace, and I came to the moon and stars, savoring the taste of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a movie. To me, it may mean a way to survive, the wind settles the dust, and the sky brings happiness and auspiciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网络实名制，在争论中从“幕后”走向“前台”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259710]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 11:45:10&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Big V will face a real-name test at the front desk.

Nong Jian Illustration&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The entire network of self-media will implement a real-name system at the front desk.&quot; In mid-October 2023, &quot;Hong Rong&quot;, a financial blogger with more than 3.5 million fans, posted this news on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost at the same time, Weibo CEO Wang Gaofei began to display his real name in the personal information column of his Weibo account &quot;Come and Go&quot;, marking &quot;self-media front desk real name&quot;, and communicated with Weibo netizens many times Leave messages and interact on related topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31, Weibo issued an announcement stating that it will soon guide self-media accounts with more than 1 million fans in social current affairs, military, finance, medical, legal and other professional fields to fill in real-name information, and will expand in the future. to more than 500,000 fans. Bilibili, WeChat, Douyin, Kuaishou and other platforms also issued similar news, implementing a front-end real-name system for &quot;head self-media&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years or so, the online real-name system has experienced a development process from scratch, from partial to comprehensive. In 2011, local documents required Weibo users to &quot;real-name in the background and voluntarily in the front-end.&quot; In 2017, Weibo fully implemented this requirement. Now, now, the real-name system has gradually moved from behind the scenes to the front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This quickly triggered heated social debate. In the past, almost every time a request for a real-name system came out, there would be similar debates. Supporters believe that the online real-name system can enhance the standardization and responsibility awareness of online activities, help eliminate rumors and obscene information, reduce online violence or illegal crimes using false information, and improve the sense of security in netizens&#39; lives. Opponents believe that, The real-name system not only affects information security and the sense of relaxation in public expression, but also endangers the security of personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real-name system at the front desk has changed personal information from centralized collection by a small number of platforms to being exposed to a wide range of public views. Its impact is more complex and diverse. Some scholars have publicly suggested: &quot;This is a big matter and it is not appropriate to do so.&quot; Launched hastily.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Weibo is not alone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend observed that as of the evening of October 31, many Weibo influencers with more than 1 million fans were still &quot;anonymous&quot; in the front office. On Bilibili, Douyin and other platforms, most leading self-media in related fields do not see real-name information displayed on their personal homepages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Weibo announcement, the platform will guide users to fill in the information that needs to be displayed at the front desk. According to Wang Gaofei&#39;s internal beta information on his personal page, the personal information that may be displayed in the future includes real name, gender, zodiac sign, occupation, IP location, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Private messages sent to big V from Weibo previously obtained by Southern Weekend show that the first batch of front-end self-media accounts need to be real-named before the end of October, and accounts with 500,000-1 million fans need to be real-named by the end of December. completed before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the aforementioned private message mentioned that the real-name system requires all platforms on the entire network to implement it uniformly. &quot;As for the front-end real-name system, Weibo, Douyin, Tencent and other platforms have communicated and fought for it many times. If it causes trouble, , you can feedback your opinions and suggestions through your own channels, or you can submit them to us for forwarding.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to find from the announcements released by major platforms that the real-name system for top self-media front desks has become inevitable. The main difference between platforms lies in the number of fans of the first batch of real-name self-media accounts. Except for Douyin, which started with accounts with more than 500,000 fans, the others all started with accounts with more than 1 million fans, and then gradually expanded to more than 500,000 fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is no standard and clear implementation document this time. Each platform can only explore and implement it based on its own platform attributes and past review priorities.” A platform insider revealed. According to him, front-end real-name verification is slightly different from content review. The latter has a certain amount of &quot;discretionary space&quot;, while the former must be implemented when it reaches a certain level. The platform it is on will have a larger number of fans and greater influence in a certain field. The account priority requires the front desk to real-name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the background of this incident, the aforementioned private message stated that it was to further implement the &quot;13 Self-Media Management Regulations&quot; of the Cyberspace Administration of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a notice, in order to strengthen the management of &quot;self-media&quot;, consolidate the main responsibilities of website platform information content management, and improve the normalized management system and mechanism, requiring website platforms to &quot; &#39;We-media&#39; engaged in the production of information content in the fields of finance, education, medical and health, justice and other fields shall undergo strict verification and display the names of their service qualifications, professional qualifications, professional background and other certification materials on the account homepage, and add the label of their field.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Affected by multiple factors, I feel that responding to the increasingly serious problem of cyber violence and building a better online content ecosystem are top priorities.” Wang Sixin, a professor at Communication University of China, said that in recent years, cyber violence has Problems occur frequently. Starting in 2022, relevant departments have intensively introduced a number of targeted measures, and platform parties have further implemented their respective responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin is a consulting expert of the Cyberspace Administration of China and has participated in legislative work including the Cybersecurity Law and the &quot;Regulations on the Ecological Governance of Network Information Content&quot;. He explained that because big Vs often have wider social influence, and some have complex backgrounds and diverse purposes, some big Vs have their own teams behind them, and their online activities, including speeches, endorsements, etc., all have commercial interests. In practice, It is difficult to rule out the possibility of misleading the public for economic interests, which will have many negative impacts on the healthy development of the information ecology. &quot;The front-end real-name system will help these big Vs enhance their sense of social responsibility and risk awareness, and standardize their behavior in cyberspace.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Gaofei responded on Weibo to the issue raised by some Weibo users who were unwilling to use their real names. You can clear your followers to delete them below 1 million, or change your posts to other fields. The aforementioned private message also mentioned that it can help users &quot;detect spam fans and help clean them up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Weibo announcement also stated that for users who should be real-name but do not want to be real-name, the traffic and income of the account will be partially restricted, including restrictions on recommendation stream display, hot search display restrictions, advertising sharing restrictions, Tip income limits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The relevant details are still unclear at the moment. The platform should balance the real-name and personal information security issues at the front desk, such as the obligation to inform in advance and whether it is necessary to display the work unit and position information of the big V at the front desk. , whether the employer can refuse, and whether there is an exit mechanism if the individual is unwilling, and procedures need to be set up.&quot; said Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Research Center of China University of Political Science and Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is still a big difference in what kind of personal information is displayed at the front desk.” Zhu Wei gave an example. For example, if a doctor influencer discloses that his occupation type is a doctor, it may be more important than disclosing his employer and company. Job information can further reduce the occurrence of cyber violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the aforementioned announcement on Weibo, the content related to the protection of front-end information is: users who are not logged in, have not passed the verification of real identity information, have abnormal behavior, and have been dealt with recently are prohibited from viewing the real-name information of other users&#39; front-end information. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;More than twenty years of evolution and changes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as 2002, Li Xiguang, a professor at the School of Journalism at Tsinghua University (now the School of Journalism and Communication) mentioned in an interview with a TV station that he suggested that the National People’s Congress Anyone should be prohibited from being anonymous online, sparking heated public discussion. This is considered by the media to be the first time that the online real-name system has entered the public eye in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following ten years, the online real-name system began to be partially tested. In 2004, the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Campus Network Management in Colleges and Universities&quot;, and the &quot;Internet Real-Name System&quot; was officially written into official documents, and college online forums began to implement user real-name registration; in 2005, Tencent, according to the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau&#39;s &quot;About &quot;Notice on Carrying out the Clean-up and Rectification of Online Public Information Service Sites&quot;, which requires real-name registration of the founders and administrators of QQ groups; in 2006, the State Administration of Press and Publication proposed the &quot;Real-name System Plan for Online Games&quot;, requiring online game players to register with their real names in order to Distinguish between adults and minors...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until 2011, the real-name requirement once again aroused great concern. That year, Beijing promulgated the &quot;Several Regulations on the Development and Management of Microblogs in Beijing&quot;, proposing that Weibo users must use their true identity information when registering, and implement &quot;real names on the backend and voluntary on the frontend.&quot; Subsequently, Weibo publicly stated that it would implement real-name registration for new users and gradually improve the real-name review of old users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Weibo users are required to have their real names, in 2012, Wang Chen, then director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, responded publicly, saying that Weibo has the characteristics of fast dissemination, great influence, and wide coverage, and has a strong social influence. Mobilizing power. Weibo has changed the previous public opinion communication pattern. While reflecting social conditions and public opinion, enriching information services, and conducting public opinion supervision, it has also enabled the rapid spread of harmful information such as negative public opinion, obscenity, and fabricated lies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since 2009, Weibo has used its influence on the platform to have a huge impact on the formation and direction of public opinion on many issues involving public interests. What happened in China around 2011 Many public events have become hot fodder on the Internet.&quot; Wang Sixin further explained that among the series of management measures that were subsequently formed, many requirements were formed based on learning these lessons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin gave an example. When the Wenzhou high-speed train accident occurred in July 2011, “the Internet was filled with various rumors about the accident, which gradually became outrageous and evolved into attacks on China’s high-speed rail and national economic development model. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The existing management is very unsuitable and poses new challenges to network information security and social harmony and stability.&quot; Wang Chen mentioned in the above speech. &quot;The regulatory requirements for online real names were also proposed and gradually implemented under this background.&quot; Wang Sixin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the &quot;Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Strengthening Network Information Protection&quot; was promulgated and implemented. In the form of a legal document, it is clearly required that online service platforms need to register users with real names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next peak of attention regarding the online real-name system occurred around 2016. The Cybersecurity Law was promulgated in 2016 and came into effect in 2017. Article 24 of the Law stipulates: When signing an agreement with a user or confirming the provision of services, network operators shall require users to provide their true identity information. If they do not provide their true identity information, they shall not provide services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2017, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Internet Comment Service Management Regulations&quot;, requiring all online platforms to authenticate the real identity information of registered users in accordance with the principle of &quot;real-name backend and voluntary front-end&quot;. Otherwise, no comment service will be provided to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, Weibo issued the &quot;Announcement on Weibo&#39;s Promotion of Completing the Real-Name System for Accounts&quot;, requiring all users to complete real-name verification before September 15, 2017, otherwise they will no longer be able to send comments and new posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The promulgation of legislation and related normative requirements was also prompted by some events. Wang Sixin introduced that the Snowden &quot;Prism&quot; incident in 2013 (the electronic surveillance program implemented by the United States) aroused high-level attention to national network information security, and related work such as legislation on network security has also been accelerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the telephone real-name system also provides convenience for online registration. In 2013, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology required users to provide their true identity information when handling landline, mobile phone, broadband and other Internet transfer services. And in late 2015, the operator stopped serving non-real-name numbers. As for online service platforms, most of them use mobile phone number verification to complete the registration review. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The pros and cons of foreign real-name systems&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At present, supervision of the Internet environment is relatively common internationally. For example, the United Kingdom has introduced a Communications Data Act, which stipulates that network users need to register personal information such as names and addresses; mobile online communication services in the United States need to be bound to social security numbers that can identify personal information; Germany has also introduced laws to supervise the Internet, providing Merchants operating online, Internet mail, telephone and mobile phone users shall implement real-name registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also places that require the public to provide personally identifiable information to market-based service platforms. Southern Weekend learned from netizens in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and other countries, as well as several Chinese people who have lived in many countries, that currently enterprise service platforms in many countries do not require direct real-name registration, but some countries require binding The email address or mobile phone number associated with the personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not many people ask for real names at the front desk. In Wang Sixin&#39;s view, the front-end real-name system requirements for network service platforms this time are &quot;essentially detailed specifications for the management of front-end network real-name systems. Many tasks are not carried out in one step and need to be carried out step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the past process of China&#39;s online real-name system, almost every step has attracted great attention, especially the real-name system on market-oriented platforms such as social platforms and information services, which often triggers heated debates among all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend searched past literature and reports and found that supporters of the real-name system generally believe that the anonymity of the Internet has given rise to a series of problems such as online language violence, rumors and defamation, Internet fraud and even illegal crimes. In recent years, frequent incidents Internet violence incidents have also caused serious physical and mental harm to the parties involved in some social incidents, and the real-name system is a good solution to the above problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Nowadays, many self-media accounts are operated by a team, often with some commercial demands. We-media accounts with a large number of fans must disclose their true identities and be responsible for their online speeches.&quot; Zhu Wei said. He added that in lawsuits related to cyber violence cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff, but the personal information of the alleged infringing subject needs to be obtained from the platform through the court, and the front-end real-name system can also simplify this process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most opponents believe that the real-name system inhibits the enthusiasm for public discussions, expressing true thoughts, and putting forward valuable opinions, and is not conducive to venting emotions and easing conflicts. In recent years, many corruption cases have been detected through anonymous reporting online, and the real-name system will put pressure on the reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Both social psychology and communication science have confirmed that in an environment where personal information tends to be transparent, people’s words and deeds also tend to follow the herd, and people who follow the herd rarely have a sense of innovation. From From the perspective of social development, real-name identification at the front desk is not conducive to encouraging people to think actively and be brave in innovation.&quot; said Lao Dongyan, a professor at Tsinghua University Law School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Dongyan also believes that the real-name system at the front desk may not solve the problem of cyber violence, but may instead give rise to some kind of &quot;precision cyber violence.&quot; &quot;I started using Weibo in 2022, and I have always used my real name. I have been verbally abused and insulted many times because of my participation in public discussions. Some people not only reported me online @my unit, but even reported it offline. The real-name system at the front desk is for these People provide convenience.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the concerns about the real-name system, one issue runs throughout: the online real-name system will affect the security of personal information. This worry is not groundless. In 2017, experts from the Ministry of Public Security told the media that the generalization of the online real-name system has indeed affected personal information security. The more information collected such as personal ID numbers and facial recognition, the more information will be leaked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been related incidents in China. In 2016, Xu Yuyu, a student from Shandong Province, was defrauded by a fraudulent phone call to pay for college. She was depressed and eventually died of cardiac arrest. According to media reports, the student information leaked in this case was caused by criminals attacking the candidate information system of the local education bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also international precedents. In 2005, a girl in South Korea encountered online violence because she refused to clean up pet feces. As a result, the girl was forced to drop out of school and became mentally ill. In order to control cyber violence, starting from that year, the South Korean government began to gradually require the public to implement real names on the Internet. It was gradually promoted in gradients and fields, supplemented by measures such as improving legislation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2010, a total of 167 Korean websites implemented the online real-name system, mainly large portals, news websites and shopping platforms. However, between 2010 and 2012, large-scale user information leaks occurred on multiple platforms, the largest of which affected 35 million people, while South Korea&#39;s total population in 2010 was only over 48 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2012, South Korea’s online real-name system was suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Telecom fraudsters are very rampant now. It can no longer be solved by blocking individual mobile phone numbers, because the other party often uses a virtual number and may receive fraudulent calls anytime and anywhere.&quot; Lao Dongyan said , she herself has been woken up by fraudulent phone calls in the middle of the night many times, and she can no longer bear the disturbance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant departments are also strengthening the protection of personal information security. The National People&#39;s Congress&#39;s decision on network information security in 2012 and the Cybersecurity Law introduced in 2016 both set forth prohibitive regulations on the collection, use, and protection of citizens&#39; personal information by platforms. In 2021, the Personal Information Protection Law will also be officially implemented, making all-round normative requirements for personal information protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the public security department has also continuously strengthened its efforts to combat domestic and cross-border telecom fraud. In addition to conventional detection of related cases, it has also launched multiple special operations to focus on combating telecom fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Sixin said that in the future, the supervision of Internet information dissemination will be more standardized. &quot;Managing the Internet in accordance with the law, using the Internet in accordance with the law, and providing services in accordance with the law will become the norm in the process of building an Internet civilization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州地铁要求乘客卸妆惊悚形象？南周记者实地探了探究竟]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259708]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[除了上厕所不能随意活动？部分中小学生课间10分钟被约束现象调查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259681]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The 10 minutes between classes are very valuable for students. The figures running freely and the laughter from time to time are the vibrant scenery of the campus. However, &quot;Xinhua Viewpoint&quot; reporters recently investigated in some places and found that some primary and secondary school students were restrained for 10 minutes between classes. Except for drinking water and going to the toilet, they were not allowed to leave the classroom or even leave their seats at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Education clearly requires that no unnecessary restrictions shall be placed on students&#39; freedom of speech and behavior such as legitimate communication, games, and activities outside the classroom during recess and other non-teaching time. . So, why do some schools strictly control students’ 10-minute recess activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The campus becomes quiet during the break&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10-minute break between classes is commonly known as the break. It is an important time for primary school students to adjust their learning status, relieve fatigue and communicate with each other. The reporter recently visited many primary and secondary schools and saw that the campus became quiet because students were required not to leave the classroom at will during elementary classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that this phenomenon has been around for a long time. A 2019 survey of more than 1,900 parents showed that 75.2% of parents believed that the phenomenon of &quot;quiet recess&quot; is common in primary and secondary schools around them, and is most prominent in primary schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Parents of students from many primary schools in Changchun City reported that the school requires their children not to play on the playground during recess and can only go to the toilet or move quietly in the corridor. One parent said that the child&#39;s class teacher stipulated that the child should stay in his seat except when going to the toilet during class breaks. &quot;Some students were punished for fighting in the classroom during recess. Since then, they no longer dare to run around after class.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many schools in Haikou City The primary school arranges for teachers on duty to patrol each floor and strictly prohibits students from chasing and playing in the corridors. Some schools also select young pioneers to form a duty team, which scores and assesses the behavior of students in each class during class. Once chasing and fighting are found, points will be deducted from the class. The assessment is directly linked to the selection of civilized classes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar phenomena also exist in some primary and secondary schools in Hebei, Guizhou and other places. The reporter saw in a primary school in Langfang City, Hebei Province, that except for some students going to the toilet, most of the children were sitting in the classroom chatting after class. Zhang Xu (pseudonym), a primary school teacher in Zunyi, Guizhou, said that some class teachers do not allow students to play on the playground during recess. &quot;This is too depressing for children&#39;s nature.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents of primary school students in Haikou City said that only a few teachers attach importance to students’ physical exercise between classes, and most teachers will try their best to make active primary school students more active in the name of emphasizing discipline. Be quiet, euphemistically called &quot;civilized rest.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Over-restraint&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;is not good for&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;children Healthy Growth&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are students frequently over-restrained during primary school breaks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some teachers interviewed said that mainly because of the limited space and dense crowds, accidents such as collisions often occur when students play on the playground. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A teacher from a primary school in a county in Hebei Province said that once a student encounters an accident such as a collision during recess activities, the school not only needs to apologize to the parents, but may also involve financial compensation. For this reason, the school simply emphasizes discipline between classes and reduces children&#39;s outing activities. &quot;It is better to do less than to do more.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the objective conditions of the site are also an important reason. Many teachers interviewed reported that many urban school teaching buildings are built relatively high, with only 10-minute breaks between classes. The elevators are not enough for students to run up and down, and the narrow corridors easily create the risk of crowding and stampedes. Moreover, the playgrounds of urban schools are small and often have too many children to move around. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many parents believe that restricting children’s recess activities is mainly for schools and teachers to facilitate management and reduce trouble. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some grassroots educators interviewed also believe that excessive restrictions during small classes violate the regulations of the Ministry of Education and are also a manifestation of extensive and lazy school management. Strictly limiting the scope and intensity of activities for primary and secondary school students during recess can reduce the chance of accidents, but it is not conducive to the healthy growth of children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This approach will suppress the child&#39;s nature and is not conducive to physical development. Psychologists believe that walking out of the classroom and exercising properly during recess can relieve study pressure and promote interpersonal communication. Yin Ruofeng, deputy chief physician of the Spine Surgery Department of the Third Hospital of Jilin University, said that heavy academic load and decreasing physical activities are important factors affecting the body posture and spinal health of primary and secondary school students. Going out of the classroom to move your limbs during small classes is beneficial to students&#39; health. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Data from the National Health Commission show that the overall myopia rate among children and adolescents in my country in 2022 is 53.6%. According to the interviewed ophthalmology experts, participating in outdoor sports is an important means to prevent and control myopia. Being &quot;crowded&quot; during primary school hours will lead to a reduction in the time for outdoor sports among primary and middle school students and an increase in the probability of myopia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;此外，这种做法也容易令学生产生厌学情绪。长春市外国语实验学校小学部副校长沈微指出，长时间待在教室可能会导致学生精神倦怠；学生利用课间调节、放松身体和头脑，有助于集中精力上好下节课。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;坚决落实国家保护&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;未成年人相关规定&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2021年9月1日正式施行的《未成年人学校保护规定》要求，学校不得设置侵犯学生人身自由的管理措施，不得对学生在课间及其他非教学时间的正当交流、游戏、出教室活动等言行自由设置不必要的约束；学校应当完善管理制度，保障学生在课间、课后使用学校的体育运动场地、设施开展体育锻炼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/be1e0af9353df253306c927ce8cf3a43.png&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;记者采访了解到，有些学校利用小课间开展丰富多彩的户外活动。比如，长春市外国语实验学校小学部开辟了篮球、排球等活动区域，学生可根据个人兴趣选择。同时，在学校的支持下，班主任也鼓励学生尽量外出活动。河北省邯郸市丛台区连城小学不仅配有篮球、足球和羽毛球等运动设备，还在教室里配备了图书、象棋和五子棋等物品，便于学生课间取用。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;受访教师和家长认为，把小课间还给孩子，需要综合施策。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;作为校园安全管理中的重要一环，学校要常态化开展校园安全隐患排查，将校园安全工作做细致、做扎实。沈微介绍，长春市外国语实验学校小学部一至六年级共有学生1980人，为保障学生课间活动的安全和秩序，学校派出6名体育教师、6名各年级教师和学生干部在走廊、楼梯、操场进行巡查、值周，大多数学生能做到秩序井然地上下楼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;专家建议，教育主管部门要出台指导意见，通过督导加强对学校的监督管理，把课间时间尽可能还给学生。学校还要加强对学生进行运动、游戏的技能指导和安全教育，降低意外发生的概率。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;受访对象认为，在校园管理规范、校内设施安全到位的情况下，出现校园安全问题时，社会和家长不能一味将责任推给学校和教师。可以建立由政府部门或第三方机构规范处理校园安全事件的工作机制，降低学校与家长产生直接矛盾的概率。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“年纪大了，玩芭比有点幼稚”：棉花娃娃寄托的情感生意]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259679]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年4月30日，昆明，市民带着棉花娃娃在蓝花楹大道拍照。（视觉中国/图）&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;只见路飞正襟危坐，面前摆着一排小蛋糕，照片下方，芝桃情真意切地打出一行字：又长一岁啦，生日快乐！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“因为（海底捞）那个事嘛，害怕被别人说。”芝桃是一位棉花娃娃爱好者，按照这个圈子的通行玩法，玩家如同养孩子一般，给自己的娃娃添置衣服、饰品，带着它们出去旅游、聚会，甚至是过生日。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，也因为外界对这些行为不理解，互称“娃友”的玩家们遭到诸多非议。 “网友说这是神经病，话很难听。”芝桃刚刚升入大三，和很多娃友一样，性格偏于内向、敏感，为不善人际交往所困扰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;棉花娃娃是一种近来在年轻人当中悄然走红的潮流玩偶。 2023年10月16日，一位消费者带着自己的棉花娃娃到海底捞进餐时，被服务员拒绝提供给玩偶过生日的服务，此事发酵成为社交平台热搜话题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;棉花娃娃究竟有着何种魅力，能够让年轻消费者慷慨解囊？为何90后、00后们，会把自己的情感需求，寄托在一个毛绒玩具身上？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;娃友：“现实中没见过这么好的男生”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;给路飞过生日，是芝桃临时冒出来的想法。那天是“五一”假期的末尾，同寝室的舍友还没有返校。白天，她和妈妈吵了一下，电话里被反复询问，放假为什么不回家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;芝桃心情低落，在校园里漫无目的地走着，刷到同学在朋友圈祝贺路飞生日快乐，她情绪一下“支棱”起来，到小店里简单购置几个蛋糕，准备给这个陪伴自己成长的“小伙伴”过一下生日。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;通常，漫画作者会在公司网站公布角色生日。路飞是日本热血动漫《海贼王》的主角，他勇敢无畏、执着乐观的性格，以及对待朋友纯真善良、重情重义的特质，让芝桃为之倾倒。 “可能，我也希望过自己是这样的人，或者希望有这样的朋友。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;宿舍里只有她一个人，从小到大已经习惯孤单生活的芝桃，把床头的棉花娃娃路飞放在桌上，再摆上小蛋糕，瞬间仿佛和这个小伙伴有了情感链接。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;芝桃解释，对于棉花娃娃，她其实属于典型的“穷养”模式，即便如此，偶尔看到好看的饰品，还是忍不住买来给路飞配上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我算是富养娃。”19岁的周舟也是一位娃友，她养的棉花娃娃名叫丸子。刚入手的时候，丸子只是一个“裸娃”——没有什么装饰。看到好看的发卡、帽子和围巾，周舟就很想买回来给娃娃戴上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;她还会给丸子买衣服，刚开始只是淘一些婴儿服，感觉大小尺寸总是差了一点。后来，干脆像当初“团购”娃娃一样，去定制一些衣服，不过价格略贵，周期也会长一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;周舟说，除了打扮娃娃，她有时候还会“整活”。比如做作业的时候，让丸子在旁边陪着，然后把对话拍成视频传到网络平台，“一边做作业，一边问丸子，你爸爸不是医生吗，这题你会不会呀？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在圈子里，那些有角色原型的玩偶，被称为“有属性娃娃”。丸子的角色原型来自一款女性向网络游戏，在游戏里，周舟代入的一个女性角色和一个名叫查理苏的医生谈恋爱，丸子则是爱情的结晶。 “丸子娃娃，是三次元世界的宝宝，这种陪伴和寄托有一种实在感，让我感觉很幸福。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“现实生活中，没见过查理苏这么好的男生。”查理苏的人物设定是浪漫、善良，以及尊重女性。周舟说，游戏里有五个男主角，她刚开始没有关注到查理苏，但是渐渐被对方的细心所吸引，尤其是看到查理苏的书房里藏着一本《房思琪的初恋乐园》，瞬间被这个细节打动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;周舟是学生物专业的“理工女生”，在安徽合肥读大二，现实生活中还没有谈过恋爱。 “每天打开微博、抖音，全都是&#39;恐婚&#39;预警。”她说，作为女性，经常能感知到外界的不友好行为，这让她对步入一段感情保持谨慎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;棉花娃娃之于娃友，往往起到寄托感情的作用，这些情感的面向十分广泛。 “我从小就缺乏陪伴。”芝桃解释，她生长在单亲家庭，妈妈一个人开工厂，平时非常忙碌，每天要很晚才回家。在漫长的青少年时期，她都是一个人待在家里看电视、刷手机，以及翻阅漫画书度过。 “五一的时候，其实我也想回去，可是回去了，也是一个人在家，还不如在宿舍一个人待着。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;除了路飞，芝桃还定做过一个原型叫影山茂夫的娃娃，这是日本动漫《灵能百分百》的男主角。影山茂夫具有超能力，可以帮助很多人，却因为不擅长和人打交道而感到自卑、忧郁，通过痛苦的成长，慢慢接纳了不完美的自己。 “路飞和影山茂夫就是我性格的一体两面。”芝桃说，把路飞和影山茂夫两个娃娃放在床头，自己感到很踏实。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;一些娃友会为棉花娃娃布置娃屋。（受访者供图/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/96e9831b87.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;

&lt;h4>;娃妈：“没有人卖，就自己做”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;芝桃回忆，给路飞过完生日后，她悄悄把照片发在了少人关注的QQ空间，偶尔自己翻一下，“主要是害怕别人不理解，会说你”。所以，当海底捞事件的争议出来后，敏感的她赶快删除了这段痕迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;她感谢棉花娃娃的出现，让她找到能够理解彼此行为的同类。芝桃解释，最热门的棉花娃娃是当下最火的动漫、游戏、剧集或者“爱豆”，因为刚流行起来，周边产品还不够完善，粉丝想要表达爱意，需要通过DIY的方式，制作寄托情感的棉花娃娃。 “就是表达情感的途径有点少，那就自己做。”其中，又分为养成系娃娃和爱豆娃娃，就是把娃娃当成孩子一样养育，或者当作明星那样去追捧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;和外界认知稍显不同，路飞这样的动漫“大众偶像”，虽然拥趸众多，但其实并不是最受追捧的娃娃，“因为《海贼王》火了很久了，各种周边非常多，选择多。”芝桃同样喜欢的影山茂夫，也不是热门娃娃，因为这部动漫时间有点久，却相对冷门，知道它、喜欢它的人并不多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所以，当芝桃在社交媒体刷到自己喜爱角色的帖子或周边，就会感到很欣喜，“啊，没想到这种冷门的角色，也有娃娃”。她介绍，在社交平台会有同好者，发帖子征集粉丝，一起团购棉花娃娃。粉丝如果有意向便主动联系帖主，然后被拉到一个电商平台的团购群内交流，“至少拉够50个，才能成团”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这个发起人，就被娃友们称为“娃妈”。 “娃妈相当于饭圈的&#39;粉头&#39;，其实也是爱好者。”她解释，通常棉花娃娃是由娃妈先期找人或者自己亲自设计，会事先公布娃娃的图样、尺寸，征询大家的意见，如果对设计不满，可以提出修改意见。待到定稿之后，娃妈再到工厂做出来一个样品，样品满意便可以出货。这个周期，通常需要几个月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“一般九百多块打一个样。”同眠（网名）正是传说中的娃妈，她说，开团之前得先画草图，因为有一点绘画基础，所以自己出设计稿。画完之后，发到社交平台找人，行话叫做“蹲坑”，看感兴趣的人多不多，如果能蹲到一些人，就开始建群，陆续进群讨论之后，才找工厂打样，“满意的话就做货，不满意继续打样，最多可以打三次”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;同眠说，她是兼职做这项工作，相当于为爱发电。一开始，她非常喜欢游戏《光与夜之恋》里边齐司礼这个角色，所以想拥有一个玩偶，可是找遍各大电商平台一无所获，“没有人卖了，所以我决定自己做”。做好后，娃娃加邮费合计70元，同眠还会送一些小饰品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在交流群里，除了交换对图纸、样品的意见外，娃妈还会公布制作进度、和工厂主的交流细节以及费用明细，整个过程，更像是粉丝爱好者的DIY。娃妈们看到自己的想法一点点变成现实，会收获成就感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;企业：“小众，批量太少”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;芝桃发现，有娃妈在群公告中明确表示，拒绝未成年人“开团”。 “一个娃娃几十块钱还蛮贵的，是害怕都已经下厂了，家长觉得贵找过来退货。”她解释，喜欢某个特定角色的娃友，人数本来就少，对于工厂而言，她们的单量实在太小，是能够开机生产的最小限度。 “娃妈本来就是用爱发电，如果退货的话，就要贴钱去做这个事了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所以，虽然五六十元一个娃娃不算便宜，但是芝桃觉得合情合理。 “毕竟喜欢这个的人太少了。”她说，一些大IP的衍生品非常丰富，选择面很广，而小众爱好的周边，只能通过DIY的方式获取。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;创业者冯赫（化名）并非动漫迷或者饭圈人士，他留意到棉花娃娃不是出于爱好，而是本能的商业嗅觉。不过，在切入这个赛道之后，他渐渐领悟到，这一新鲜事物为什么是以粉丝开团的形式出现，“主要还是小众，比较特殊，没想象中那么好搞”。冯赫是广东中山一家棉花娃娃公司的创始人，刚开始他也是找工厂代工，后来购置了机器自己来做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“最主要的难点，还是批量太少。”冯赫介绍，棉花娃娃的品类繁多，但是单一品类的生产数量却十分有限。珠三角有着大量玩具类代工工厂，但是对于他们而言，每一笔订单数实在过于微小。 “他们主要还是接外国的单，以出口为主。”刚刚介入这个行业时，他要频繁和工厂沟通，消耗大量时间和精力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，冯赫还是不愿意错过这个新兴市场，于是成立公司、买了机器，决定开工厂自己干。 “最主要的成本是人员和管理成本。”他介绍，一位成熟的打样师傅月薪至少8000元，机床师傅需要6800元，还有绣花工、杂工每个月的工资都在6000元以上，而一个成熟的绣花工一天至多能缝合40个娃娃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;即便是已经开起工厂，他们接单的方式，仍然是发帖子，凑够人数再开团。根据娃娃尺寸大小、开团数量的不同，定价会有不同，区间多为几十元波动。 “虽然现在很火，但是在玩偶这个大市场里，是一个很小的细分门类。”他说，棉花娃娃其实是对制造业的一次升级，之前大批量的出口贸易增长放缓后，只有承接这类小批量、多批次的需求才有出路，这对企业管理、成本管控提出了更高要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;即便是外部创业者陆续介入，灵活、微小仍然是这个行业的特征。一家电商平台的数据显示，有成交记录的棉花娃娃商家数量，从2017年的不到400家，到2020年底已经达到了近万家，3年间增长了20多倍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;品牌&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;首要问题是&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;版权&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;小七（网名）也是一个棉花娃娃爱好者，她在一家小型棉花娃娃公司上班，近水楼台，收集到二十多个娃娃。作为重度玩家，她会给娃娃换不同的刘海、衣服，在脸上打腮红，到网红咖啡店打卡拍照。她还在衣柜上腾出空间盖了一间“娃屋”，按照社交媒体上的教程挂上挂钩、图画等道具，布置娃娃的房间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随着产业发展，棉花娃娃的配饰产业链发展起来。在电商平台，针对棉花娃娃的首饰、娃衣、鞋子、腮红，以及娃包、娃屋、家具等周边配套应有尽有。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;囿于有属性娃娃受众群体的专属性，很多棉花娃娃不能够实现大规模生产，但是配饰品很多则可以通用，且没有版权风险，反而更早实现批量化生产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“年纪大了，玩芭比有点幼稚，棉花娃娃就刚刚好。”小七并不是饭圈或者动漫迷，她入坑棉花娃娃主要是为了满足小时候的公主梦。她的二十多个棉花娃娃全部是无属性娃娃，既没有对应的IP原型，也没有版权授权问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“走品牌化路线，首要解决的问题，就是版权。”Rua娃吧创始人叶映丹是最早注意到棉花娃娃有可能成长为一个行业的人之一。叶映丹原本是电商平台的一个市场总监，早在2019年，她在后台数据中监测到，“棉花娃娃”作为关键词成为热搜商品。细究下来发现，棉花娃娃是一个非常有趣的品类，产品软萌、可爱，无论设计者、制造者还是受众群体，都非常低龄化，大多为中学和大学生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2018年购入的棉花娃娃，原型为一韩国男团。（南方周末记者高伊琛/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/3aac636350.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;807&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“整个还是处于比较粗糙的阶段。”叶映丹介绍，因为主要还是兴趣驱动的产物，早期开团DIY的棉花娃娃，性质属于同好分享，并不算严格意义上的商业行为，所以并不涉及严格的版权问题。当然，单个品类的数量也很有限，制作周期很长，甚至在开团几个月后，产品还没出来，一些娃友甚至已经将此事遗忘，出现过娃妈“卷款跑路”的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“供应链生态很落后，上游又无法解决正版授权的问题，整个市场发展很受限制。”叶映丹解释，尽管问题重重，可她还是看到了蓬勃发展的朝气。当年，棉花娃娃在她们平台一年的GMV（一段时间内的成交总额）增长达到300%以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从起源于韩国的追星文化，到在国内悄然走红，并迅速扩展至动漫、影视、游戏各个圈层，且发展出属于自己的圈层文化。叶映丹觉得，这个行业大有可为，她要做一个棉花娃娃的品牌出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;叶映丹发现，创业初期一大难点，是如何准确挑选出具有持续性商业价值的IP，“因为棉花娃娃本身有原型，产品并不是品牌去主导，而是角色粉丝共创出的产品”。经过摸索发现，相较于爱豆和动漫，影视剧的IP更为合适品牌化运作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们到市面上待播的热剧中排查，尽量做到&#39;应签尽签&#39;，保证持续产出电视剧爆火角色的周边。”叶映丹介绍，品牌化的棉花娃娃，只能覆盖当下热门、大众识别度高的角色形象，而很多冷门IP仍然需要同好者靠兴趣DIY制作。所以将来，拼团式的小作坊模式，仍然会长期存在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“直博生主动选择博转硕”背后：博士过剩正在愈演愈烈丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259693]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;据《中国青年报》报道，“直博生主动选择博转硕”成为高校新现象。记者采访了几名直博生，他们选择“转硕”的理由各不相同：有的是不适应博士生活，有的是课题难度太大，还有的是担心毕业后的就业去向。转为硕士或干脆转战职场，对他们而言是“主动分流”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些博士生之所以选择急流勇退，自然是出于成本收益比的理性考量。如果课题难度太大，攻读数年都拿不下学位，那么由此产生的沉没成本是惊人的；即便是费尽艰辛啃下博士学位，如果毕业后找不到工作，那么他们付出的机会成本也势必大到无法承受；即便辛苦拿到教职，不少“青椒”仍需要奋力搏杀，才能逃离各种“非升即走”的考核泥沼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不难设想，一名博士生花费数年时间攻读学位，再拼尽全力找到稳定的科研教学岗位，这是一出不折不扣的“历险记”，而同龄人恐怕已用这几年时间成家立业了。两相对比之下，读博确实像是一场“赌博”。报道中几位当事人正是基于这些考虑，果断选择“杀跌止损”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一现象的背后，是国内博士生的选拔与培养出现了“错配”与“过剩”的问题。所谓“错配”，就是不少并不适合读博的学生误入博士之路，入学后惊觉自己不是这块料；所谓“过剩”，就是高校培养的博士生太多，呈现供过于求态势，社会无法提供充足的就业岗位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自1983年中国自主培养的首批博士获取学位以来，四十年来国内每年招收与毕业的博士生人数都在高速增长。据教育部《2022年全国教育事业发展统计公报》，2022年共有8.23万人博士毕业，这一年博士生招生人数突破13万大关，在读博士人数达到55.61万的规模。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纵向来看，中国博士生招生从1995年突破1万人，到2009年达到6万人，再到2022年的13万，不到三十年间的时间里狂飙十几倍；横向来看，中国早在2008年就超过美国成为世界最大的博士学位授予国，目前每年新授予的博士学位也超过了美国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面，中国每年博士入学与毕业的人数迭创新高；另一方面，“博士过剩”凸显并愈演愈烈。 “核物理博士当城管”“医学博士应聘校医”“博士生争当中小学教师”的新闻屡屡出现，“青椒集体焦虑”的困境，每每展现出博士生在就业市场上“大材小用”的尴尬。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;博士生为什么会过剩？这与社会需求、传统观念、政策引导都有关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;社会对博士生的需求往往是随着经济形势与产业结构而变动的。一旦社会“需求端”不能创造足够多的科研教学岗位，那么就无法容纳足够多的博士就业。如果说理工科博士还可以在企业研发部门找到用武之地的话，人文社科博士恐怕只剩下公职与教职可以争取，而这些职位一个萝卜一个坑，增长速度毕竟有限。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国传统观念素有“学而优则仕”的说法，当代的博士似乎与古代的举人进士一样，属于公职人员的后备军。站在象牙塔入口的博一新生视“博士”为一种身份乃至护身符，像是“考中进士”一样“候缺”。现实中，博士生入职公务员的“定级优势”也在强化这一观念。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，现代社会毕竟不是古代，迅猛增长的博士生人数远远超过昔日一年只有几百人的科举名额，社会能够容纳的公职岗位名额也未必赶得上过剩的博士毕业人数。如果不能意识到“社会需求”与“博士供给”之间关系的话，那么学生读博的出发点就难免与博士学位的内涵产生脱节，距离博士学位的“初心”越来越远。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;博士学位，从一开始就与教育体系中的其他学位有所不同。攻读博士被称为是“在知识的最远边界独自钻研”的艰险之旅，获得博士学位的人也会被誉为“为人类创造了新的知识”，意味着可以独立完成研究，拓展人类的认知边界。一个形象的形容是，如果把人类知识体系视为一个不断向外扩展半径的同心圆，那么博士就是触及最外端圆周，并且向外做出了一点突破的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现代社会对博士生的需求，往往是随着经济形势与产业结构而变动的。需求端的变动，自然应该倒逼供给端的调整。面对社会需求的变动，高校应主动调整博士生培养计划，公立大学要用好纳税人的高等教育经费，私立大学也要对得起校友的大额捐赠。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以美国为例，新冠冲击带来的财政压力，就让美国诸多名校减招乃至停招了不少博士项目，不挣钱的文科博士首当其冲。根据美国媒体统计，仅在2021年，美国数十所精英大学就暂停了140多个人文社科类博士项目的招生。而在大语言模型ChatGPT横空出世之后，人工智能领域的博士生专业赢得了新一轮的青睐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你是否适合读博士？博士生队伍又是否需要你？社会又是否需要你这个博士生？认真回答这些问题，攻读博士才称得上一场“双向奔赴”。同时，高校也应深入思考，如何面向社会需求，主动调整博士生的招生培养计划，而不是“像种蘑菇一样培养博士”，带来学位内卷与博士过剩的难题。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;国家大气污染防治攻关联合中心密切跟踪本次污染过程，组织专家团队解读污染成因。专家指出，10月22日起，区域气象条件转不利，PM2.5污染逐渐累积。截至10月30日8时，京津冀及周边地区共16个城市累计发生32天次PM2.5中度及以上污染。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;专家分析，从气象条件看，近期京津冀及周边地区气象条件较不利，容易造成污染累积与转化。 10月22日以来，区域内冷空气活动偏弱，地面气温、低层大气相对湿度较常年均偏高，易形成区域性污染。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从区域污染排放看，区域工业企业、重型货车活动水平和秸秆火点数量环比上升，污染排放呈增加趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在工业源方面，10月下旬以来，区域工业用电量较前期明显增长，其中水泥、砖瓦等行业用电量增幅更为明显，钢铁、焦化、石化等行业用电量基本持平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在移动源方面，近期京津冀及周边地区重型货车交通流量处于秋冬季以来的高位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在面源方面，10月21日至28日区域内累计发现火点325个，其中天津、河北（沧州、张家口）、河南（周口、驻马店、漯河）等地数量较多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;记者了解到，京津冀及周边地区多个城市启动重污染天气预警。其中，北京市，天津市，河北省石家庄、唐山等13个城市（包括定州、辛集、雄安新区），河南省安阳、鹤壁等5个城市启动橙色预警。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据预报情况，10月30日至11月1日，受偏南风叠加高相对湿度影响，京津冀及周边地区将持续中至重度污染；11月3日起，随着冷空气到来，污染过程将结束。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期以来，人们都把身体质量指数（BMI）作为衡量肥胖的简明指标。 BMI是指体重（千克）除以身高（米）的平方，BMI小于18.5为消瘦，18.5至24.9为正常，大于等于25为超重，大于等于30为肥胖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过《自然》杂志近期发表文章称，这种诊断肥胖的标准存在缺陷。首先是，脂肪在人体内积累的总量和分布于不同部位的数量超过一定的量才算是肥胖，但是BMI并不测量人体的脂肪量和各部位的分布量，因此不能反映人们是否真的肥胖，肥胖的程度有多严重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，即便BMI相同，不同年龄和性别的人也有不同的脂肪，如老年人一般比年轻人有更多的脂肪和更少的肌肉，女性往往比男性拥有更多体脂。而且，即便年龄相似性别相同的成年人具有相同的BMI，他们也可能有不同的体脂以及分布在不同的身体部位和器官的脂肪量。研究发现，在内脏器官中堆积的脂肪伤害性更大，如肝脏、心脏，而在腰部堆积脂肪，要比在臀部、腿部堆积脂肪更有害。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，BMI具有种族差异。 BMI是根据对白人测量的数据制定的标准，并不适合其他种族。与白人相比，BMI指数较低的亚洲人患心脏病等疾病的风险更大，原因可能是由于体脂百分比和在体内不同部位的分布有差异。因此，世界卫生组织建议亚洲人使用较低的BMI来衡量超重和肥胖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于BMI指数的一些弊端，根据BMI指数制定的现行的肥胖标准有可能高估了全球的肥胖情况。 2023年8月17日，《糖尿病、肥胖与代谢》期刊发表一篇题为《中国肥胖患病率及相关并发症：1580万成年人的横断面真实世界研究》的文章，描绘了中国肥胖地图，在1580万成年受试者中超重人群占比34.8%，肥胖人群占比14.1%。此外，世界肥胖联合会发布的《2023世界肥胖图谱》则为全球描绘了肥胖地图，预测未来12年，将有4亿人超重或肥胖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，这两篇文章都用BMI作为衡量肥胖的标准来估计肥胖人数。显然，这样的判断可能会不太准确。而且，对于用BMI来衡量肥胖，也早就有人提出不同意见，并提出了补充和改善的标准，可以测定体脂率，将此与BMI共同用来衡量肥胖。但是，由于测量体脂率比较麻烦，迄今并没有广泛推广和应用。而用BMI则比较简单，同时还有一些人是简单以外观来评判自己是否肥胖，因而自行减肥，可能会造成一些后果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个最大的后果是，减肥药的广泛使用和滥用，由此带来一系列问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近，新的减肥药物陆续获得上市，如胰高血糖素样肽1（GLP-1）、索马鲁肽（semaglutide）和替西帕肽（Tirzepatide），服用者有的产生了较好的效果，体重大幅减轻，有的可减少21%的体重，而且索马鲁肽也被证明可以降低严重心血管问题的风险。但是，当初研发这类药物本来不是为了减肥，而是为了治疗糖尿病。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最新一代的抗肥胖药物模仿一种称为胰高血糖素样肽1（GLP-1）的激素，它与食欲调节有关。此后，与GLP-1同类的索马鲁肽于2017年被美国食品和药品监督管理局（FDA）批准（商品名Ozempic），用于治疗2型糖尿病，后来在2021年被批准用于治疗肥胖症（商品名Wegovy）。此后，FDA又于2022 年批准替西帕肽（商品名Mounjaro）销售，用于治疗糖尿病，但后来也被用于治疗肥胖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，逐渐增多的不良作用开始让人担心这些治疗肥胖的药物对人的副作用。现在发现的主要危害是胃肠道问题和肌肉质量损失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加拿大英属哥伦比亚大学的研究人员在2023年10月5日的《美国医学会杂志》（JAMA）上在线发表一篇文章指出，现在治疗肥胖的药物存在较大的潜在的有害性。研究人员对一个大型健康保险数据库的肥胖患者进行调查，有4144人服用利拉鲁肽（liraglutide，也是一种胰高血糖素样肽-1类似物，用于治疗2型糖尿病和肥胖）、613名服用索马鲁肽和654人服用安非他酮-纳曲酮（另一种减肥药）。服用索马鲁肽的胆道疾病发病率（每1000 人年）为11.7人，服用利拉鲁肽为18.6人，服用安非他酮-纳曲酮为12.6人，这三类药物服用者的胰腺炎发病率分别为4.6、7.9 和1.0人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结论是，与服用安非他酮-纳曲酮相比，服用胰高血糖素样肽-1药物的胰腺炎、肠梗阻和胃轻瘫（胃轻瘫是一种减缓或阻止食物从胃到肠道的移动的病症）的风险增加有关，但与胆道疾病无关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前的临床试验已经表明GLP-1药物与胃肠道副作用之间存在关联，包括恶心、便秘和罕见的胰腺炎病例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于替西帕肽来说，比较明显的副作用是肌肉减少，导致肌无力。但这一情况还需要长期的监控和研究。 &lt;/p>;
