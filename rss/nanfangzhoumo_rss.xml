How should we prevent and treat it? What are the misunderstandings about respiratory diseases? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Healthy China&quot; column of the main station invited Professor Zhang Wenhong of Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Liu Qingquan, President of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University, and Vice President of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University. Three experts, including Tong Zhaohui, director of the Institute of Respiratory Diseases, explained in detail the common misunderstandings about respiratory diseases on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 1: Respiratory viruses are complicated this winter, and superinfection is scary? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong said that many people are afraid of superinfection. In fact, sometimes multiple viruses or bacteria are detected because very sensitive detection methods are used, so don’t worry too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said that although many pathogens have been detected, it does not mean that every one is pathogenic. The doctor will comprehensively analyze which bacteria are the patient&#39;s pathogenic bacteria based on the patient&#39;s clinical condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qingquan said that from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, superinfection is a combined disease or comorbidity. &quot;For example, after having a fever for 7 days, it was discovered that it was influenza. About 10 days later, the fever returned, and this time it was mycoplasma. This is actually not a superposition, but a situation of poor maintenance and subsequent illness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 2 : Mycoplasma pneumonia is a mutation of the new coronavirus? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said that humans discovered mycoplasma as a microorganism at the beginning of the 20th century, and it was not determined to be a pathogen until the end of the 20th century. The new coronavirus was only known to everyone at the end of 2019, and there is no difference between the two. It doesn&#39;t matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are children particularly susceptible to mycoplasma infection? Tong Zhaohui said that children&#39;s immune systems are not fully developed and their resistance is not as good as adults&#39;, so they are more susceptible to infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 3: Once you have a cold or fever, you need to get an infusion quickly? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said, &quot;Infusions will heal a cold and fever quickly.&quot; This is actually a misunderstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with influenza, colds and fevers have lower temperatures and milder symptoms, and are often upper respiratory tract symptoms. If you have a fever or cough after catching a cold, just take fever-reducing or cough-relieving medicine at home. Pay attention to getting more rest, drinking more water, and supplementing your nutrition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for influenza, some influenza may cause pneumonia or even severe pneumonia. At this time, you may need to be hospitalized, and the resident doctor will determine whether you need infusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong also said that infusion is generally limited to hospitalized critically ill patients, or some drugs cannot be taken orally and can only be administered through infusion. For the common cold, oral medications work better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myth 4: Mycoplasma pneumonia can be cured at home? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tong Zhaohui said that in most cases, whether it is a virus or mycoplasma, if it is limited to the upper respiratory tract, most of it can heal on its own, and a small number may develop pneumonia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong said that generally speaking, mycoplasma pneumonia can be improved by taking some symptomatic drugs at home, but it is necessary to pay attention to whether it develops into a serious condition. For example, if your child&#39;s condition improves after taking medicine, you can observe it at home; if your child still has a high fever after taking antipyretics and is sluggish and unwilling to eat, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Myth 5: Increased exercise and sweating in winter can improve immunity? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liu Qingquan said that from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, excessive sweating will damage a person’s yang energy. During winter sports, your body will feel slightly warm and you may sweat a little. It&#39;s okay to work up a sweat, but it doesn&#39;t have to be every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wenhong said that everyone is encouraged to maintain a certain level of exercise. &quot;Even if you are very busy today, it is good to walk 5,000 steps.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Special reminder: Please pay attention to the weather conditions in winter and wear a mask as appropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[OpenAI忙宫斗，AI大模型和应用忙上新丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/27/5c1572c356.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 27/5c1572c356.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259782&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-to-late November 2023, OpenAI experienced a constant reversal of personnel turmoil, and Sam Altman was re-appointed as OpenAI CEO It&#39;s over for now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plot is complicated and confusing, and it really attracted enough attention. Can a star company and a star CEO really influence the development process of AI in the human world? You might as well take a look at the efforts of more companies in upgrading and applying large AI models. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New large model&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 21, Anthropic, an AI start-up from San Francisco, California, launched &lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www. anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Claude 2.1 AI model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>; supports the input of up to 200,000 Tokens, exceeding the OpenAI large-scale Model GPT-4 Turbo has 128,000 Tokens, which can handle longer text content, and also has a new system prompt word (System Prompt) function. Anthropic claims that the accuracy of Claude2.1 is twice that of Claude2.0, which enhances the ability to understand text content, especially when processing higher-accuracy documents such as legal documents, financial reports, and technical specifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as OpenAI cooperates with Microsoft, Anthropic and Google stand together. In early November 2023, Anthropic announced that it would use Google&#39;s chip Cloud TPU v5e to support its large models and use its cloud computing services. Google promised to invest US$2 billion in it in October 2023, with an initial investment of US$500 million. Dollar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Inflection AI, a company co-founded in March 2023 by Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google’s DeepMind AI research group, Karén Simonyan, chief scientist of DeepMind AI, and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, in November &lt;a href=&quot;https://inflection.ai/inflection-2&quot;>;&lt;strong>;A new generation of large model Inflection-2&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>; was released on the 22nd, calling it the world’s second-generation large model. Language Model (LLM). Inflection-2 performs FP8 mixed-precision training on 5,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, with approximately 10^25 FLOP computing capabilities. It is in the same training computing category as Google&#39;s PaLM 2 Large model, and has been tested on MMLU, TriviaQA, HellaSwag and GSM8k. In most AI benchmark tests, it is better than PaLM 2, and in some tests it is second only to OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone is benchmarking against OpenAI, and OpenAI is certainly not idle either. On November 6, OpenAI released customizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts&quot;>;&lt;strong>;GPTs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>; at its first developer conference , allowing ChatGPT Plus users and OpenAI’s enterprise customers to create customized versions of ChatGPT. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Users do not need to master programming knowledge. They can build a GPT with exclusive functions in GPT Builder by relying only on dialogue and a specific knowledge base. This will be more in line with the user&#39;s specific needs and usage scenarios, and will greatly The application threshold is lowered. This service will bring new changes and opportunities in vertical industry artificial intelligence, software applications and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, this &quot;involution&quot; of computing power, data, and models belongs to enterprises. For users, the use value and application scenarios of large models are more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, in office, smart terminal, social media and other scenarios, users can easily get started directly through the built-in large model application, making commercialization faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;AI application implementation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since August 2023, various mobile phone brands have announced plans to access large models. On November 8, Samsung Electronics released a large AI model developed by Samsung Research Institute&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0 %84%ec%9e%90-%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1-ai-%ed%8f%ac%eb%9f%bc%ec%84%9c-%ec%9e%90% ec%b2%b4-%ea%b0%9c%eb%b0%9c-%ec%83%9d%ec%84%b1%ed%98%95-ai-%ec%82%bc%ec%84 %b1-%ea%b0%80&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Samsung Gauss&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;. It consists of Samsung Gaussian language, Samsung Gaussian code and Samsung Gaussian image, and is planned to be integrated into various products in stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days ago, Elon Musk’s AI company xAI released a large model on November 4&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.ai/&quot;>;&lt;strong >;Grok-1&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;, with real-time access to X (formerly Twitter), and Internet browsing and search capabilities to obtain more of the latest news on specific topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 14, the Google DeepMind team published a paper in Science titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2336&quot;>;Learning Skillful medium-range global weather forecasting&lt;/a>; paper introduces their new machine learning weather forecast model Graphcast, which can generate 10-day forecasts in one minute on a single Google Cloud TPU v4 device, and supports forecasts including tropical Cyclone tracks, atmospheric rivers and extreme temperatures. At present, the source code of this model has been made public. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The weather forecasting method (MLWP) is more accurate and efficient than the traditional &quot;Numerical Weather Prediction&quot; (NWP) method. In July 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3&quot;>;Pangu meteorological model developed by Huawei Cloud&lt;/a>;, in the medium and long-term global weather forecast surpass traditional numerical prediction methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, the MLWP model can also be extended to other geographical spatiotemporal predictions such as ecology, energy, and animal activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 20, &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; published a paper on the research results of Alibaba Damo Academy and more than ten medical institutions around the world&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature .com/articles/s41591-023-02640-w&quot;>;Large-scale pancreatic cancer detection via non-contrast CT and deep learning&lt;/a>;, for the first time it has been proven that &quot;plain scan CT + AI&quot; technology can effectively detect early stage pancreatic cancer on a large scale Pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pancreatic cancer is a digestive tract tumor with a very poor prognosis. It has the characteristics of difficulty in early diagnosis, low surgical resection rate, and easy recurrence and metastasis after surgery. It is also known as the &quot;King of Cancers&quot; because of its early diagnosis. Symptoms are vague, lack specificity, and are easily overlooked. CT is the most widely used and most sensitive examination method for detecting pancreatic cancer. However, the contrast of plain CT images commonly used in physical examinations and hospitals is low, making it difficult to identify early pancreatic lesions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The research team built a deep learning framework—Pancreatic cancer early detection model PANDA (Pancreatic cancer Detection with AI), which uses AI to amplify and identify subtle pathological features that are difficult to detect with the naked eye in plain CT images; internal Test evaluation shows that PANDA can achieve 90% pancreatic cancer lesion sensitivity and 99.9% lesion specificity in more than 20,000 clinical cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using AI to accelerate the popularization of early cancer screening, early detection and early treatment, the quality of patients’ lives can be guaranteed to the greatest extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Attached are three recent major developments in the field of biomedicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New progress in biomedicine&lt;/h4>; &lt;h5>;Eli Lilly&#39;s weight loss therapy was approved by the US FDA&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;On November 8, Eli Lilly announced that its glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor dual agonist Zepbound (tirzepatide) &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ fda-approves-lillys-zepboundtm-tirzepatide-chronic-weight&quot;>;Approved by the US FDA&lt;/a>; for the treatment of patients with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities (blood pressure, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep disorders apnea or cardiovascular disease) to lose weight and maintain weight stability. Zepbound is the first approved drug that simultaneously activates two intestinal hormone receptors (GIP and GLP-1), directly targeting the root cause of excess weight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The obesity indication approved for Zepbound this time is mainly based on the results of two Phase III clinical trials, one of which targeted 2,539 adults with obesity or overweight and weight-related problems (excluding diabetes). Injecting Zepbound as a dietary and exercise aid, the highest dose group (15 mg/week) lost an average of 48 pounds (approximately 22 kg) in 72 weeks, while the lowest dose group (5 mg/week) lost an average of 34 pounds (approximately 15 kg) , the placebo group was 7 pounds (about 3 kilograms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Comment: Zepbound is a GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist injected once a week. Eli Lilly announced the first new Chinese evidence in the field of Zepbound obesity treatment on October 3, 2023. And has submitted a registration application for long-term weight management indications in adults in China. As of now, there are no GLP-1 drugs officially approved in China for the treatment of obesity or overweight. China has a huge weight loss market, and the market competition in the field of weight loss indications is fierce, which provides more information for individuals seeking effective weight loss treatments. multiple choice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;The world’s first CRISPR gene editing therapy was approved&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;On November 16, the US biopharmaceutical company Vertex (VRTX.O) and the Swiss gene editing company CRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP.O) announced that the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted it &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-crispr- therapeutics-announce-authorization-first&quot;>;CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy Casgevy (Exa-cel) Conditional Marketing Authorization&lt;/a>; (CMA, applicable to drugs that meet significant unmet medical needs, valid for one year, updated annually Once), for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell disease (SCD) with recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and transfusion-dependent beta-Mediterranean patients who are unable to obtain human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Anemia (TDT) patients. This is the world’s first CRISPR gene editing therapy approved for marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Casgevy is an autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy that modifies the patient&#39;s hematopoietic stem cells in vitro so that red blood cells can produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, a hemoglobin that carries oxygen ). Results from two global clinical trials of CASGEVY in SCD and TDT showed that treated patients had no serious VOCs or independent blood transfusions for at least 12 consecutive months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Comments : The above approvals open the door to further applications of CRISPR therapies in the future, with the potential to cure many genetic diseases.

The researchers crossed yeast cells containing different synthetic chromosomes and then looked for individuals carrying two synthetic chromosomes in the offspring. After a long hybridization process, the research team gradually integrated all the chromosomes they had previously synthesized (6 complete chromosomes and 1 chromosome arm) into the same cell. The resulting yeast strain accounted for more than 31% of the synthetic DNA and had a normal morphology. ; Later, a newly synthesized chromosome (chromosome 4, the largest of all synthetic chromosomes) was transferred using chromosome replacement, thus obtaining a yeast cell with 7.5 synthetic chromosomes, with the proportion of synthetic DNA accounting for more than 50%.

In recent years, news of kindergarten closures has appeared in many places. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the news that &quot;China&#39;s most populous county has closed 50 kindergartens&quot;, the closure of kindergartens has become a directly related factor to the decrease in the birth population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Linquan County, Fuyang City, Anhui Province, with a registered population of 2.293 million in 2022, is known as &quot;the most populous county in China&quot;. In August 2023, the Linquan County Education Bureau issued an announcement that 50 local private kindergartens had ceased operations, accounting for 24.5% of the total number of private kindergartens in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A decrease in the number of births is considered to be the main reason. A set of government public data has been repeatedly mentioned in online communication. Linquan County has 58,243 children in kindergarten in 2023, a decrease of 9.2% from the previous year. This is the fourth consecutive year of decrease. This is consistent with the national trend of decreasing the number of kindergartens and the number of kindergarten students in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, another set of data did not attract attention. In June 2023, the Linquan County Development and Reform Commission stated that in 2022, the county will build, renovate and expand 9 kindergartens, effectively expanding the number of public kindergarten places by 2,070; simultaneously handing over 7 community supporting kindergartens, adding 2,610 places, completing the annual target tasks 103.5%. According to the plan, the county will add 1,890 new public kindergarten places and 2,000 kindergarten places in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, 2023, the founders of many closed private kindergartens in Linquan said that the main reason for the closure was the impact of local public kindergartens. “Their environment is better and their fees are higher. Cheap&quot;. However, they have not received policy support and their living space has become narrower. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are fewer children and the policies are not supportive&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the 50 private kindergartens that have terminated their operations in Linquan County, 12 private kindergartens have applied to terminate their operations, and the other 38 private kindergartens have no actual enrollment. , school-running behavior, the school-running license has expired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chengdong Street Yifan Kindergarten founded by Chen Min (pseudonym) belongs to the category with expired school license. Yifan Kindergarten was opened in 2006. Chen Min recalled that there were only more than 20 students at that time. It later gradually developed to its peak, with nearly 230 students enrolled around 2017. &quot;It has been running for more than ten years, and it has feelings.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Min said that the direct reason for the closure of Yifan Kindergarten was that the Linquan County Education Bureau interviewed and informed it that the current kindergarten operating standards had been improved, but the hardware facilities and site area of ​​Yifan Kindergarten did not meet the standards. , if it continues to open, enrollment will need to be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we are given few places, we will definitely not be able to cover the rent, so there is no need to do it.&quot; Chen Min did some calculations and believed that if we continue to do it, there is a high probability of losing money. The number of students enrolled in Yifan Kindergarten has been declining in recent years, while new public kindergartens continue to be built in the surrounding areas. &quot;Public kindergartens have a good environment and low tuition fees.&quot; Chen Min believes that even if the Education Bureau does not stop it, it will have to take the initiative to close it down in two years. After struggling for several months, Chen Min decided not to apply for a license renewal and shut down. Before the closure, Yifan Kindergarten had three large classes and one middle class, with a total of 110 students and 12 teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teaching land of Hongyang Kindergarten in Huangling Town is a private house built by the principal himself. The number of students enrolled has always been around 80. &quot;But the number of small classes will be reduced from 2022 summer vacation.&quot; The principal of the kindergarten said that before the closure, they had a total of three classes, with more than 20 students and two teachers in each class. Since the kindergarten&#39;s operating license is about to expire, applying for license renewal and acceptance requires reinvestment to improve the environment and facilities in the park. She does not want to invest anymore and simply closes down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that the gradual closure of private kindergartens is the general trend. &quot;Young people are unwilling to have children, so the state has increased investment in preschool education and supports public kindergartens.&quot; And she can clearly feel that after the development of public kindergartens, it is difficult for private kindergartens to recruit students. When asked whether the kindergarten had received a request from the County Education Bureau to limit enrollment, she said: &quot;How should I put it, you can&#39;t recruit many people even if I ask you to recruit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gaotang Town Kindergarten founded by Yang Hui Jiyangzhuang Kindergarten is one of the 12 private kindergartens that voluntarily applied to terminate its operation. &quot;For various reasons, the funds could not be transferred, so the application was stopped.&quot; Yang Hui believes that the primary reason is that the number of students enrolled is small. In the past, Yangzhuang Kindergarten could enroll thirty or forty children, but in 2022, only 10 children were enrolled in small classes. &quot;It will be less every year, and it will be very few by 2022.&quot; At the same time, the school required &quot;two teachers and one childcare&quot;, that is, each class must be equipped with two teachers and three childcare workers. The income was far lower than the expenditure, and Yang Hui began to go into debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui mentioned that another reason is that it is very difficult for private kindergartens to recruit qualified teachers. Yang Hui said that in recent years, more and more kindergarten teachers have been recruited, and all of them have joined public kindergartens, and the supply of kindergarten teachers exceeds the demand. In addition, teachers’ salaries are not high, and young people of appropriate age are more likely to choose to work outside the home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 23, 2023, the Linquan County Education Bureau and the County Party Committee Propaganda Department declined an interview with Southern Weekend reporters. A local official told Southern Weekend reporters that as the number of public kindergartens in Linquan County gradually increased after 2017, the living space of private kindergartens became smaller and smaller. &quot;The impact of population decline is only the beginning of the phenomenon, and it is not the fundamental reason (the closure of private kindergartens).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There will be 45 fewer private kindergartens in 2022&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend Reporter Checking the public data of the local government, it was found that the number of private kindergartens in Linquan County has been decreasing year by year since 2019, and there has been a cliff-like decline for two consecutive years in 2022 and 2023, with a decrease of 45 and 50 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the number of public kindergartens has shown an increasing trend from 2019 to 2021 (data is missing in 2022 and 2023), growing from 160 to 221 in three years, and surpassing the number of private kindergartens in 2020 quantity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned officials said that the increase in the number of public kindergartens is mainly due to central policies. On November 7, 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Several Opinions on Deepening the Reform and Standardized Development of Preschool Education&quot;, which clearly requires provinces with a low proportion of children in public kindergartens to gradually increase the proportion of children in public kindergartens. , in principle, the country will reach 50% by 2020, ensuring that the coverage rate of inclusive kindergartens (the proportion of children in public kindergartens and inclusive private kindergartens) reaches 80%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is also because of the implementation of this policy that we have been able to obtain funds from above and have continued to expand some public schools in recent years.” The official said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Fuyang Daily&quot; report, as early as the beginning of 2020, the Fuyang Municipal Education Bureau formulated the &quot;Fuyang City Preschool Education Deepening Reform and Standardized Development Plan&quot;, proposing to promote the universal, universal, safe and high-quality development of preschool education. We will vigorously develop public kindergartens and build, renovate and expand more than 50 public kindergartens every year. In principle, each town (street) should have one public kindergarten for every 15,000 or more people. By 2020, the city&#39;s gross kindergarten enrollment rate for the three years of preschool will reach 90%, and the coverage rate of inclusive kindergartens will reach 80%, of which the proportion of children in public kindergartens will in principle reach 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, the official WeChat public account of the Propaganda Department of Linquan County Party Committee announced that the county had successfully completed the above-mentioned &quot;985&quot; target tasks for preschool education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;985&quot; goal has further requirements in the &quot;Fuyang City&#39;s &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; Preschool Education Development and Improvement Action Plan&quot;: by 2025, the proportion of children in kindergartens in public kindergartens in the city will reach 70%. %above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that while Linquan County is increasing the proportion of public kindergartens, some places are also building more private kindergartens. On October 18, 2023, the Linquan County Education Bureau issued an announcement stating that the study approved the establishment of three private kindergartens in Tupei Township, Guanmiao Town, and Huangling Town. The three new kindergartens are all non-profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned official said that this is the process of natural replenishment in the market. He mentioned that among the 50 private kindergartens that will be closed in 2023, some were newly registered in 2021 and 2022. &quot;It shows that while private kindergartens have discovered that there is a market, the government is also looking at where there are vacancies to supplement.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After market elimination&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the closure of the six private kindergartens contacted by Southern Weekend reporters, most of the original students were diverted to surrounding public kindergartens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The village party secretary of Zhangmiao Village in Tubei Township told Southern Weekend reporters that after a kindergarten in the village was closed, students were diverted to public kindergartens in several nearby villages. &quot;Public kindergartens charge cheaper, (in this village) The public kindergarten has enrolled more than 90 students in 2023. In the past, it enrolled only a few students, about 30 or 40 people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A parent interviewed in Qizhuang Community, Xingtang Street, also believes that one of the advantages of public kindergartens is that they are cheap. According to his understanding, there is a public kindergarten equipped with a school bus, and the tuition for a semester is more than 2,000 yuan if lunch is provided. If you go to a private kindergarten, the tuition fee will be 4,000 to 5,000 yuan under the same conditions. However, the national chain private kindergartens are more expensive, with tuition fees You get seven to eight thousand yuan per semester. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his opinion, there are not many local students, but now parents pay more attention to education. Parents, whether in rural areas or county towns, tend to send their children to public kindergartens or kindergartens in farther urban areas. The hardware facilities and teaching staff are better. For example, public kindergartens have larger student activity areas, more teaching aids, picture books, and more interest courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most of the local private kindergartens are in private houses. The house built by my family has a small courtyard as a playground, and there is nothing.” The above-mentioned parents believe that most of the local private kindergartens that have been closed down are local private kindergartens. “Basically, those that have been eliminated by the market, those with better student sources and up-to-standard software and hardware will be converted into public ones, and all will be taken over by the government.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yang Hui, it is a helpless choice for private kindergartens to withdraw from the market. Yangzhuang Kindergarten has been closed for more than three months. His kindergarten building and playground are abandoned and cannot be rented out. &quot;I am exhausted every day, and I have no choice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reluctantly closing the kindergarten, Yang Hui is working hard to keep his private elementary school. The primary school was founded by his father in 1994 and has a history of nearly 30 years. As a rural primary school, when the surrounding public village primary schools merged and closed down, it still attracted many students to attend due to the quality of its schooling. It was regarded as the &quot;central school&quot; of the surrounding villages. At its peak, the primary school enrolled nearly 600 students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui said that the current requirements for running schools in Linquan County have increased. The Education Bureau will give him 18 primary school enrollment places in 2022 and 20 in 2023. The school&#39;s enrollment has now dropped to just over two hundred students. Yang Hui did not dare to close down because the investment in primary schools was greater than that in kindergartens, and the losses caused by closure would be greater. But he had no idea about the way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新内阁成立不到三月，三成员辞职，日本政坛怎么了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261385]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-27 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, three Japanese political affairs officials and deputy ministers have died in explosions. A scandal broke out and he was forced to resign. A local opinion poll showed that after the scandal broke out, the approval rate of the cabinet led by Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio fell to 21%, setting a new low since Kishida became prime minister in October 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The new cabinet was reorganized in September this year, and three people resigned in less than three months. For Fumio Kishida, he is currently facing a severe political crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This is a period of unstable governance.&quot; Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told Southern Weekend reporters that other factions within the party will also I&#39;m ready to replace him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/n33bJRcdIjL91WToVBPr9WcziXEwzahoqY4Kijl0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height= &quot;1225&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/n33bJRcdIjL91WToVBPr9WcziXEwzahoqY4Kijl0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259766&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 13, 2023 local time, in Tokyo, Japan, after the cabinet reshuffle, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida attended a press conference in the Prime Minister&#39;s Office. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Many senior officials were forced to resign&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;Kanda Kenji, 60 years old, is a member of the House of Representatives of Japan&#39;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was the Japanese &quot;Bunshun Weekly&quot; that first broke the scandal of the then Japanese Deputy Minister of Finance Kenji Kanda. According to reports, a company under his name defaulted on taxes, and between 2013 and 2022, the company&#39;s land and properties were seized by the tax department four times. The report also stated that as a tax accountant, Kanda Kenji himself violated relevant industry regulations and failed to participate in necessary training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Kanda apologized for the relevant scandal and admitted that the reports were true. Since he was &quot;too busy to get involved&quot; in overseeing the company&#39;s tax details, the work had been left to an accounting firm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the scandal broke out, it triggered domestic public criticism of Kanda. Japan&#39;s opposition parties put pressure on the ruling party to remove him from office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 9, during his defense, Kanda also stated that he would &quot;continue to perform his duties.&quot; However, on the 10th, he changed his words on whether to continue to perform his duties and said, &quot;No.&quot; Comment&quot;. Resigned on the 13th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In just a few days, I changed my words three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is generally believed that Kenji Kanda was essentially replaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In response to rising prices in Japan, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida proposed an economic countermeasure, an annual supplementary budget of over 17 trillion yen. Previously, the leader of the Cadet Party, Kenta Izumi, said that the Cadet Party would not participate in the deliberations on the budget unless Kishida replaced Kanda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the day of his resignation, Kenji Kanda admitted that he resigned because he &quot;did not want his scandal to affect the debate in Congress.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is not the first senior figure in Japanese politics to resign due to a scandal in recent times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 31, the then Deputy Minister of Justice Kakizawa Mitaru resigned due to suspicion of violating the Public Office Election Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Kakizawa is a member of parliament elected from Koto Ward, Tokyo. Previously, Koto Ward Mayor Kimura Yayoi and her team were arrested by Tokyo for allegedly violating the public office election law. Search by the District Prosecutor&#39;s Office. Kakizawa admitted that he made suggestions to Kimura regarding illegal campaigning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the scandals that broke out in Kanda and Kakizawa were due to tax evasion and other illegal issues, while Taro Yamada, then administrative officer of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, was involved in &quot;extramarital affairs&quot;. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 56-year-old Taro Yamada, who is married and has children, is also a senator of Japan&#39;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Just one month before Kanda resigned, on the evening of October 19, the media photographed Taro Yamada spending the night with a young woman in a hotel in Tokyo. , which lasts about three hours. After the news came to light, Taro Yamada admitted to having an extramarital affair and apologized, but denied paying the woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Subsequently, the scope of negative public opinion spread wider and wider. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 26, Taro Yamada resigned, becoming the first senior government official to resign after Kishida Fumio reorganized the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Japanese politics have long been unclean.&quot; Zhou Yongsheng emphasized that the financial sector provides money to support politicians&#39; campaigns, and once politicians gain power, they will Opening up the financial circle, formulating laws that are beneficial to them, and promoting policies that are beneficial to them, this is the collusion of money and power politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Corruption scandals captured by the media as collusion between the financial and political circles are, in most cases, immediately exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chou Yongsheng added that for those in power, this will make them disgraced, or their approval ratings will continue to decline. For them, the media is actually called the &quot;fifth power constraint.&quot; Sometimes it is helpless, and sometimes it can be settled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 13, 2023, in order to save the sluggish support rate, Kishida reshuffled the cabinet again, replacing the existing 19-person list with 13 people, including the Foreign Minister , Defense Minister and other important positions, and declared that this is a &quot;cabinet that transforms change into strength.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three members of the new cabinet, which was established less than three months ago, have resigned, but the public is not surprised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The Japanese public is accustomed to scandals in the political world. Ordinary people have developed a &#39;political apathy&#39; and do not pay much attention to the personal integrity and moral character of politicians. Great trust and expectations. &quot;Sun Wenzhu, an associate researcher at the Asia -Pacific Research Institute of the China Institute of International Issues, said that the public did not recognize this open&quot; fertilizer politics &quot;, but lack of restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; No support rate has reached a record high &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I must apologize to the Japanese nationals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text- Align: LEFT; &quot;>; On November 13, Kishida Wenxiong was dismissed about the liquidation of Tianda because of the arrears of taxes. He publicly stated that he attaches great importance to his responsibility and will continue to perform his duties to restore the trust of the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Many public opinion believes that many senior officials are forced to resign and are the &quot;double blows&quot; of the other side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Affected by factors such as domestic economic downturn, strong pushing nuclear pollution water, and frequent scandals of many ministers, the support rate of Kishida cabinet continued to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 12, the results of a joint public opinion survey in Japan showed that the support rate of the cabinet led by Kishida was 27.8 %, which was a decrease of 7.8 from the October survey results decreased by 7.8 A percentage point, a new low since the establishment of the Kishida cabinet in 2021. The non -support rate reached 68.8 %, a record high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Tang Qifang, an associate researcher at the Institute of International Strategy of the China Institute of International Issues, believes that the performance of the Japanese people&#39;s performance on politicians is in a state of disappointment. The &quot;Domino card&quot; resignation effect appeared this time. The public can be said to be &quot;voting with your feet&quot;, and the cabinet&#39;s support rate will naturally decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; She added, in fact, from the later period of Abe&#39;s administration, it has maintained a relatively low support rate. It was not the decisive factor of Kishida Wenxiong. Kishida obviously did not pick up this stall, so it was a process of continuous lowering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In Japanese politics, &quot;the support rate of the cabinet below 30%&quot; is regarded as entering the &quot;dangerous waters&quot;; once a further falls below 20%, it means The cabinet is not far away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Tang Qifang said that at the beginning, the Japanese people did not have much expectation, and felt that he might not be a decision or particularly innovative person. Facts have also proved that many claims of Kishida Wenxiong have not transformed into very practical policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the Liberal Democratic Party, the President of the Liberal Democratic Party, Moriyama President Moriyama pointed out publicly that high-level resignation is &quot;extremely abnormal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Moriyama leads the Moriyama faction of one of the smaller valves in the Liberal Democratic Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sun Wenzhu believes that the so-called &quot;abnormal&quot; is not only to maintain the authority of the Liberal Democratic Party, but also a certain kind of euphemistic accusation for the Prime Minister Kishida Wento, so as to put himself on himself. The sent valve was cut with Kishita. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;This incident has further revealed money problems, and style problems have become Japanese political illness.&quot; Sun Wenzhu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Earlier this month, Kishida Cabinet launched an economic stimulus plan of over 17 trillion yen. The main content is tax cuts and extended subsidies. The Japanese government estimates that the plan will increase by 1.2%each year in the next three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But Kishida &quot;Sprinkling money&quot; failed to get the expected goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 15, the Japanese Cabinet Mansion announced the third quarter GDP data. In Japan for the first time, GDP growth was negative. In the third quarter, private consumption in Japan declined, net exports decreased by 0.1%, and corporate investment declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The new economic countermeasures have not been recognized by the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A poll in Japan shows that more than 60%of the people &quot;do not praise the government&#39;s comprehensive economic countermeasures. The reason is that since 2020, Japanese income tax and residents&#39; tax have increased year after year. Today&#39;s economic policy formulated by Kishida Cabinet is not really &quot;beneficial to the people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It turned out that Japanese prices did not rise for decades. Zhou Yongsheng pointed out, &quot;As Japan&#39;s imported goods are expensive, it has promoted domestic inflation and led to rapid prices rising. Sudden price growth, Japanese people can&#39;t stand it. &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; What is more worried about the public is that Kishida Cabinet has announced a significant increase in defense budget between 2023 and 2027, with a total investment of 43 trillion yen. Many people are worried that Kishida Cabinet will increase defense forces with tax increases and embezzlement of financial funds in the large earthquake -stricken area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Yongsheng believes that the public&#39;s concerns are &quot;unreasonable.&quot; Kishida Cabinet is currently facing the biggest pressure of domestic economic growth, the pressure of fiscal constraints, and the pressure of debt. The Japanese fiscal budget had to rely on issuing government bonds to expand its fiscal budget, leading to further heavy debt burden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The fiscal elasticity of the governance of Kishida Cabinet is actually increasingly reduced, and the arms should be greatly expanded, resulting in the pressure of fiscal pressure. . &quot;Zhou Yongsheng believes that the arms is purely a industry that burns money, consumes money, and does not see benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sun Wenzhu believes that Kishida Wenxiong has been the President of the Liberal Democratic Party for two years, and will usher in the President of the Democratic Party in the fall of 2024. From the perspective of the election strategy, it is likely to actively dissolve the House of Representatives of the Congress before the party election, and use the Liberal Democratic Party to win the majority of the House of Representatives to add points to themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The governance pressure under &quot;bright yellow lamp&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the outside world, reorganization of the cabinet does not allow the Kishida regime to &quot;return to life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;First of all, the current lives of Japanese people are in a state of uneasy state, which directly affects people&#39;s livelihood and leads to a decline in support. Governance is a very big threat. &quot;Zhou Yongsheng said,&quot; Secondly, Kishida is inappropriate in terms of government governance. >; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is worth noting that this year Japan regardless of the international community&#39;s opposition, insisting on the nuclear pollution of the Fukushima first nuclear power plant, which has caused huge controversy at home and abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sun Wenzhu pointed out that in terms of diplomacy in Japan, it is essentially strengthening its comprehensive binding with the United States. With the help of the United States, The Japanese people really need and improve Sino -Japanese relations have not yet seen actual actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Many media reports that if Kishida wants to be re-EMC in the Liberal Democratic Party next fall and achieve long-term governance, it is necessary Good results in the election. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But the cabinet&#39;s low support rate, the low support rate of the Liberal Democratic Party, and the resignation of &quot;Domino&quot; to resign from the government officials, and the &quot;yellow lanterns&quot; for a long time for Kishida. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, from the perspective of many interviewed experts and scholars, this status quo will not force Kishida to step down immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The pressure of Kishida Wenxiong is how to win the election of the Liberal Democratic Party&#39;s president next year, and the might dissolve the election of the House of Representatives in advance to achieve continuing governing.&quot; The so -called &quot;political performance&quot; is of little significance for the Japanese people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Yongsheng said that in the past, in addition to Abe and Koizumi, the cabinet in Japan was almost changed every year. Kishida has been in power for two years. If there is no big leakage, it is likely to continue in power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, Kishida has decided to abandon the plan to dissolve the House of Representatives during the year, go all out to promote the government&#39;s comprehensive economic countermeasures, and strive to gradually boost public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The probability of the Liberal Democratic Party will still maintain the status of the ruling party. Let the presidents recognized by each factional valve. &quot;Sun Wenzhu thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But the Japanese people&#39;s disappointment of politics and the &quot;cold sense&quot; of politics cannot be reversed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Bao Jingzheng also contributed to this article) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访央行原副行长李东荣：数字化金融不会改变金融功能属性和风险属性]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261417]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-27 20:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; On November 10, 2023, the &quot;Three Ding&quot; Plan of the State Administration of Financial Supervision landed: Financial Control Group&#39;s supervision Responsibilities for the protection of functions and financial consumer rights and interests are officially planned at the People&#39;s Bank of China.

Why must we reform? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; For a long time before the reform and opening up, my country has implemented a highly centralized planned economic system. It is compatible with the fiscal unified revenue and banks. In 1969, the PIFC and the Ministry of Finance were co -deployed by the Ministry of Finance. At that time, the main characteristics of the national financial system were that the Bank was a state -owned bank that managed finance and a national bank that operated the banking business. Banks only apply for mobile fund loans, the institutional business is single, the credit concentration, and the scale is not large. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 4, 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out at the symposium with the principals of the party committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. The role of to the bank. To become a lever for the development of economic innovation technology, banks must truly run the bank into a bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Comrade Deng Xiaoping outlined the main problems facing my country&#39;s economic and financial at that time at that time, and timely pointed out the direction for my country&#39;s financial reform at the beginning of reform and opening up, and became an important guidance for my country&#39;s financial system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Turn to state banks into a real commercial bank&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family : Kai style, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; How do you understand&quot; the bank is really done into a bank &quot;? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; can be divided into two main lines to summarize. One is to make state -owned banks as real commercial banks; the other is to handle Chinese bank Real central bank. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; bank? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; In the early days of reform and opening up, due to the reasons such as the burden and management of historical, the four major state -owned professional banks generally face the unclear governance mechanisms and unclear unclear governance mechanisms are unclear. Unreasonable, high proportion of non -performing assets, and outstanding problems such as increasing interest and increasing interest. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 exacerbated its impact on the four major banks, highlighting the urgency of accelerating the reform of the state -owned banking system. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You have gone through the process of transforming state -owned banks to commercial banks, especially injecting the four major banks with foreign exchange. How is the difficulty to overcome it? ? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; The State Council established a pilot group leading group of the shareholding system of wholly state -owned commercial banks. He was the director of the office, and the Central Huijin Company was established at that time. According to the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, since December 2003, the Central Huijin Company used foreign exchange reserves to inject capital with the Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China. Later, they also injected capital with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, and promoted their listing in mainland China and Hong Kong, and gradually realized the transformation of state -owned professional banks to joint -stock commercial banks. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I was transferred to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in early 2002. Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the People&#39;s Bank of China and the Party Group of the Foreign Exchange Administration, Guo Shuqing, then director, led us to participate in and witnessed the preparation and launching foreign exchange capital capital of the Central Huijin Company. In the process of participation, I am proud of the correct decision -making decisions of the Party Central Committee and the strong implementation of the financial system. It was this series of important and timely decisions that laid an indispensable foundation for the China Banking system at the time and the rapid rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How to fulfill the obligation of good investors? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I remember that in order to truly fulfill the duties and obligations of the investor, we pay attention Establish a party group to strengthen the construction of the party&#39;s grass -roots organizations; on the other hand, actively organize learning, learn from the advanced experience of corporate governance in the international market, explore the establishment of corporate governance mechanisms that meet China&#39;s national conditions, and select comrades from all units to dispatch politics and excellent business quality from all units. As a dispatched director, and the dispatch directors to conduct politics, business and other aspects of the directors, and improve the ability of the directors to perform their duties. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Since then, state-owned banks have continued to change to commercial banks, you What are the key factor? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Looking back, the reason why my country&#39;s wholly -owned commercial bank&#39;s stock reform can succeed, based The party&#39;s leadership of the reform and development of financial undertakings; the second is to establish a market operating mechanism on the basis of the national conditions. The Party Central Committee and the State Council are far -sighted, trial, and correct decisions. Established the Central Huijin Company, especially the use of national foreign exchange reserves to inject capital injection to pilot banks, and promote the final completion of stock reform and listing in wholly state -owned commercial banks. Later state -owned banks rejuvenated and became real commercial banks. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Historical practice shows that today China&#39;s banking system has a considerable scale in both the employment institutions, the total amount of deposits and loans, and the amount of funds. The trend of intelligence has well supported the development of the real economy and serving the people&#39;s lives of the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;&lt;strong>; Pedestrian &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Real Central Bank &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;FONT-FAMILY: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Another main line you mentioned just now is to run the People&#39;s Bank of China into a real central bank.

Is there something particularly impressive? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; In order to adapt to the new situation faced after reform and opening up, to do a good job The pace of banking system reform. In 1978, the Central Committee decided to leave the national financial management from the financial part of the financial part. Since then, the pedestrian system has been reforming. Until December 25, 1993, the State Council issued a decision on the reform of the financial system and pointed out that making the People&#39;s Bank of China into a real central bank is the primary task of deepening the reform of the financial system. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I worked at the Guangdong Branch of the People&#39;s Bank of China at the time. From June 20th to June 26th, 1991, experts and scholars from the People&#39;s Bank of China, various professional banks, other financial institutions, relevant legal departments, financial and legal circles gathered in Zhuhai, and solicited opinions and opinions and opinions and opinions on the drafting content of the bank law. suggestion. In 1995, the version reviewed and approved by the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress was divided into the People&#39;s Bank of China Law and Commercial Banking Law. They more objectively and accurately reflect the direction and status of my country&#39;s banking system reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How to deepen and improve functional positioning? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; As the functional positioning is becoming increasing Monetary policy tool box. The credit fund management system has been changed from the original unified loan to the difference, and soon transition to the &quot;unified plan, divide funds, real loans, and integrate with each other.&quot; The transformation of the Lord laid the foundation for the macro -control model of the subsequent asset -liability proportion management. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In November 1997, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council held the first National Financial Work Conference to determine the policy of further deepening the reform of the financial system and emphasized that the People&#39;s Bank of China should be held into a real central government. Banks, fully reflect the three characteristics of issued banks, banks and national banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After that, the bank separated the financial supervision functions, and established the Securities Regulatory Commission, the Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the CBRC to concentrate on the implementation of the implementation of monetary policy and macro -prudential policies, and maintaining financial stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Reform has been continuing. In 2023, according to the reform plan of the State Council&#39;s institutional institution, the daily regulatory responsibilities of the People&#39;s Bank of China on financial groups such as financial holding companies and relevant financial consumer protection duties were included in the State Administration of Finance and Administration; People&#39;s Bank of China (Municipal) Central Sub -branch. This reflects the direction and measures of further construction of the Chinese modern central bank system during the new historical period. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Department &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Technology is the reform &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Important driving force &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You just mentioned the intelligent trend of the service means of the Chinese banking system. In recent years, no technology and not finance have become consensus. As the deputy governor of the central bank in charge of science and technology, what do you think that in the financial system reform so far, what role does technology have played? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The 45 years of reviewing the reform and opening up of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up are 45 years with the advancement of global science and technology and follow the pace of scientific and technological progress. It can be said that it is the important driving force of technology that allows my country to continue to adapt to the reform and development of the economy and provide more adaptive and effective financial services to the society. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body _gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; In the early days of reform and opening up, did financial technology be applied? At this stage, what are the characteristics of China&#39;s fintech? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; As early as the mid -1980s, the People&#39;s Bank of China led the establishment Prepare, &quot;Seven Five -Year Plan&quot; foundation, the size of the &quot;Eighth Five -Year Plan&quot;, and the overall goal of &quot;Nine Five&quot; basically achieved electronic goals. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, the financial industry mainly relies on technological methods such as computer technology and network technology to improve the efficiency of traditional financial business and reduce operating costs. The first is to operate electronic. The second is system networking. The third is the unified standard. Bank card is a successful case of standard unified standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Benefiting from reform and opening up and technological progress, the road of financial electronic construction in my country has realized the historic breakthrough of &quot;from scratch, from manual to electronics, from single -machine to networking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Under the guidance of the top -level design, my country&#39;s financial information construction has begun to enter the fast lane. The construction of financial information and financial standardization is also closely linked to international financial supervision. I was fortunate to participate in and witnessed many major financial information incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Which event makes you most impressive? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The application and promotion of financial IC cards. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the growth of bank card management funds and the continuous development of information technology, the magnetic strip card has gradually become a criminal attack due to its weak computing processing capacity and easy copying of information. object. Technical experiments and global practical experience show that after the completion of the financial IC card migration in Britain, France and other countries and regions, the risk of bank card fraud has decreased significantly. On the contrary, countries and regions that have not carried out financial IC card migration in time may become the security depression of global bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the rapid development of the bank card industry in my country and the completion of financial IC card migration in neighboring countries and regions, some pseudo card fraud activities have gradually penetrated into my country. Accelerating the application of financial IC cards has become a top priority to improving the level of risk prevention and control of bank cards in my country and ensuring the security of the people&#39;s payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Looking back at the application and promotion of financial IC cards, you What is the biggest experience? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Looking back at this difficult journey, I deeply realize that the significance of the financial IC card promotion and application is not only from security protection. In the angle, reduce the loss of fake card fraud, protect the people&#39;s money bags, and also play an important role in promoting the development of mobile finance, inclusive finance and green finance, and promoting the upgrading of the domestic industrial chain. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the one hand, it lays the foundation for improving the acceptability and convenience of people&#39;s financial services; on the other hand, the People&#39;s Bank . For example, build an experimental environment and pilot to verify the application of the national secret algorithm on the financial IC card. This provides application scenarios and contributes to the technological development and progress of critical areas in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Remediation &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Mutual Gold &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Risk &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; >; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Internet finance has grown brutal but also represents a trend.

The documents clearly need to strengthen the self -discipline of the Internet financial industry, and require the People&#39;s Bank of China to build the China Internet Finance Association in conjunction with the relevant departments to give full play to the positive role of industry self -discipline mechanisms in regulating the market behavior of employment institutions and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the industry. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I accept organizational arrangements, responsible for the establishment of the China Internet Finance Association and participating in the special rectification of Internet financial risks, and witness the process of the industry from chaos and regulatory development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; as an industry self-discipline organization: China Internet Finance Association to Internet finance specifications for Internet finance What are the main principles? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; In April 2016, the State Council issued the &quot;Implementation Plan for the Special Rectification of Internet Finance Risk&quot;, which was jointly rectified by the 17 ministries and commissions such as the People&#39;s Bank of China. The illegal and illegal acts in the field of Internet finance have promoted the orderly development of Internet financial norms. At the beginning of the establishment of the Internet Finance Association, it was invested in the special risk rectification work according to the deployment of the State Council and the People&#39;s Bank of China. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since 2016, the state has actively promoted the digital transformation of banks while organizing the development of the Internet financial industry&#39;s risk and guiding the development of the industry. As an industry self -discipline organization, the association mainly carried out work through four aspects and establishes self -rhythmic constraints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First, strengthen the construction of basic systems and self -discipline rules. Through the establishment of statistical monitoring, reporting, registration disclosure, information sharing, financial advertising monitoring and other business systems and system platforms, it provides basic services for the unified industry standards, standardized operations, and preventing risks. Monitoring information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second is to formulate and promote the implementation of relevant standard rules. To prevent Internet financial risks and financial consumer protection as the starting point, promote regulatory policy implementation and ensure the implementation of policy implementation through standard rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Third, to carry out statistical monitoring and risk early warning. Cooperate with the National Bureau of Statistics to promote the implementation of the relevant statistical system, cooperate with the financial regulatory authorities to continuously monitor the relevant risks areas, grasp the bottom number of risks, and issue risks on activities such as virtual currency, cash loan, first token issuance (ICO), illegal or illegal financial advertising and other activities. Early warning prompts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fourth is to cooperate with the country to carry out the infrastructure construction of the financial industry. In accordance with the overall planning and regulatory requirements of the national credit market development, the association organized various participating units to prepare through all aspects, and obtained the first domestic business institution permit for personal credit reporting business in February 2018, and was listed in the same year. .

The hiddenness, suddenness and diffusion of risks during this period will be more prominent, thereby putting more new challenges to modern financial supervision and social stability. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The digital transformation of banks in my country presents a rapid development trend, which is manifested as: First, technology -driven is more prominent. Second, demand leadership is more common. Third, industry integration is closer. Fourth, risk management is more urgent. Therefore, in the process of transformation of the banking industry, on the one hand, we must actively face and embrace the opportunities and challenges brought by the application of new technology. At the same time, we must firmly establish awareness of risk prevention and strengthen safety construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What are your suggestions for the reform and opening up of the financial industry? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Li Dongrong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Thousands of sails on the side of Shenzhou, Wanmuchun in front of the sick tree. China&#39;s financial reform has gone through 45 years and has made great achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. Looking back, I have four deep feelings: First, we must always adhere to the party&#39;s leadership and use the correct ideological policy to guide financial reform and opening up. The second is to always adhere to the people -oriented, financial products and services supply, and cannot be separated from the reasonable needs of the people at any time, and pay attention to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the masses. The third is to always adhere to the laws of the market, based on the national conditions of the country, and to deal with the relationship between serving the real economy and preventing risks in a realistically. Fourth, we must always adhere to the development of technology -driven financial development and achieve the improvement of the quality and efficiency of financial services and financial supervision. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking forward to the future, financial reforms are still on the road, and there is a long way to go. As long as we continue to work hard in the correct direction of reform and opening up, China&#39;s financial industry will continue to pioneer and compose a new chapter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从庇隆主义到奥地利学派：米莱将带领阿根廷走向何方？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261377]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-27 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; The Argentine election is announced, the right of the right election alliance &quot;Freedom Ahead of the Party&quot; candidate Harveil Milan won, news Out, the domestic critics are generally low. Argentina slipped from developed countries and was caught in populism, inflation and poverty -stricken quagmires. The president who has been selected now advocates that many government ministries and commissions, privatize the prison, bomb the central bank ... Is the Argentine people crazy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The foreign political and economic community is not so pessimistic. After Miller&#39;s election, governments of various countries congratulated all countries. Former US President Trump (Miller was also often regarded as &quot;Trump in Argentina&quot;), which made Argentine great again. Musk&#39;s statement is even more direct: Argentina&#39;s prosperity is coming. The Argentine stock market soared more than 22%on the same day. In addition to its own investors, foreign investors were also very excited. Milan was elected as Argentine President and was regarded by many people as an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The domestic media&#39;s introduction of Milai is not distorted. Those sensational claims really belong to Millai. The expectations of the optimistic people are also very serious. Compared with the previous Argentine President, Mille is refreshing and is regarded as the most important change for Argentina in recent years, and this change does not necessarily lead to disaster. To understand this, you must have a deep understanding of Millai&#39;s own and his concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Millet is a believer in Rosbad &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Milai is born in a civilian class. His mother is a housewife and his father is a bus driver. He was economics in college, and he has been living for a living since then. Teaching in universities, providing consultation for enterprises, and being an economist at HSBC Bank, serving in international organizations ... Compared with scholars in the academy, Miller&#39;s experience is rich. In the era of social media, Millai commented sharply on the Internet, laughed and scolded, and harvested a large number of fans, becoming a famous Internet celebrity economist in Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, Miller officially entered politics. He joined the &quot;Liberal Party&quot; established by his fans as a political amateur attitude, served as the party chairman, and integrated with another right party to form an influential &quot; Freedom to the party. &quot; In 2021, Miller was elected as a member of the parliament. In 2023, he was running for the president and succeeded in one fell swoop. Miri has accumulated energy on the Internet, which is of course an important reason for his success; however, his true source of power is his political and economic concept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Milai is the faithfulness of the Austrian Economic School -this is an Economic School with the task of defending the freedom market, which originated in the Austro -Hungarian Empire in the 19th century. By intervening in the argument with various interventionism, the Austrian school continued to develop. Its representative figures were economist Messez, and later were Rosbad. Rosbard inherited Misceis&#39;s economics, also developed the theory of free will, and participated in the creation of the third largest party liberal party in the United States today. Mirley&#39;s spiritual mentor is Rosbad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mirley once said that after reading &quot;People, Economy, and State&quot; (the most important economic work of Rosbard), he deeply realized that the economics knowledge he learned in college is problematic. Argentina&#39;s long -term disaster source is that the entire country is shrouded in the haze of interventionism. Earlier Peronism, since then, Kishnerism, has nothing more than populism, trade protectionism, Kanesianism, welfareism and other ideas. These ideas bring endless inflation, monopoly, and scarce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the Austrian school as an ideological weapon, Miller attacks domestic economic policies all year round and attracts public attention. This is his own post as an economist. As a loyal believer in Rosbad, Milai stands at the end of absolute personal rights, which is not surprising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this campaign, Milai did not intend to hide his real views when talking about controversial topics (and could not hide it. For many years, he has already been the image of the big mouth on the Internet for many years). This may be his campaign strategy: creating a dare to speak, get more attention. Propagate political opinions in disputes and build your own basic disk. Such a strategy Trump has also used it. Campaign is a stage show, and governance is another matter. The focus of Mirley&#39;s really concerned is the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Thirteen Policy Plan &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In August 2023, the Argentine election launched the primaries, and Miller submitted a policy plan, including thirteen measures. These measures are almost related to the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first measure is to greatly reduce the 18th ministries commissions in Argentina and retain the eight ministries and commissions of the internal affairs, diplomacy, national defense, economic, judicial, security, infrastructure, and human resources. It sounds crazy. The reality is that the current economic difficulties in Argentina, a large number of departments are paralyzed, and employees do nothing. Reform is not cut off, but to stop new recruitment. In the short term, it is not fired, but the personnel are re -assigned. The employee no longer renews it, unless it is absolutely needed, privileges (such as bodyguards and drivers) cancel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This measure also includes the privatization plan of state -owned enterprises -through the sale of state -owned assets, filling the government&#39;s deficiencies and compensating for being cut. Looking at it, it seems inseparable. The remaining dozens of measures include: reduce public expenditure, reduce fiscal deficit; flexible labor law, reduce the cost of enterprise employment; implement unilateral free trade, cancel import tariffs; cancel the central bank, Argentine Peso dollar; implement energy reform, reduce new to new to new to new to new to new to new to new to new. Energy subsidies; attracting long -term investment in foreign capital; cancellation of exchange rates and export quota controls ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Each measure is remarkable, and the direction is consistent: reducing government control and increasing market vitality. The core and most controversial are the monetary policy. “炸掉央行”，使用美元，这让很多学者尤其国内公众瞠目结舌。一个主权国家，居然可以没有自己的央行？惊诧者没有意识到：各国货币制度，除国家自主发行货币的央行制度，还有一种货币局制度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;货币局制度是指，本国货币基于外汇储备，与他国货币建立锚定关系，民间按固定比率随时兑换。本国货币成为锚定货币的代币。该制度有其弊端——例如一国货币绑定美元，要承受美元通胀代价。优势也很显著：它束缚政府印钞权，使经济免受本国通胀之害；政府要有充足外汇储备承兑，就得量入为出，不能大搞赤字财政。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上世纪90年代，阿根廷也曾施行货币局制度，通胀率一度降至5%以下。然而政府依旧大手大脚，搞到财政崩溃。 2002年，这个国家重启央行，再次发动货币洪水。如今的阿根廷是通货膨胀极其严重的国家，年通胀率达两位数以上，每隔几十年货币体系就得重启。 2022年，阿根廷通胀率就超过140%。在这样的货币体系下，民众手中钞票每隔一段时间就形同废纸，还谈何储蓄和投资呢？启动一种有约束力的新制度，就成了可以接受的选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;切换货币体系，不能不谈技术方案。阿根廷外汇储备约300亿美元，外债近3000亿美元，民众手里几乎没有美元，谈何美元化？米莱的方案是，出售国有资产，引进外资，填补债务亏空，积累外汇储备；暂停发行本国货币，允许美元流通，以市场化的良币驱逐劣币，形成真实汇率。待市场稳定后，官方政府阿根廷比索和美元的官方汇率，以此形成锚定——这正是货币局制度的大概框架。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿根廷是一个有4600万人口的中型国家，竟允许美元在境内流通，本国货币沦为附庸？很多人难以理解。可事实是，在某些治理失败的国家，美元化并非不可接受。拉美的巴拿马、厄瓜多尔和萨尔瓦多都使用美元。委内瑞拉与美国是死敌，该国货币玻利瓦尔几经通胀，已形同废纸，民间广泛使用美元交易，政府只得接受现状，事实上放弃了货币主权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通货膨胀是阿根廷经济弊病的症结。政府滥发钞票，支出无度，还滥发福利，助长民粹风气。阿根廷难以获取国际援助，外资也不愿前往，整个国家寅吃卯粮。只有拧紧货币闸口，才有真正的经济改革。 “炸掉央行”只是听起来癫狂，其实并不算离谱。嘲笑者能提供更好的解决方法吗？至少在目前的阿根廷政坛，米莱的思路最为清晰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;米莱能成事吗？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在其他领域，米莱也有解决思路，自由市场是原则方向，并以折衷妥协为方案。有人批评米莱妥协，我不以为然。此时的米莱不是经济学家，而是政治人物。不管强硬还是妥协，都得依据时势调整。一次缓慢的渐进改革，总好过快速的流产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来几年，阿根廷的公务员、国企和公共服务体系，他们为了保住铁饭碗，一定奋起阻挠改革；经济中利益受损的民众，也将加入反对行列。阿根廷周边多是左翼国家，他们是米莱反对者的有力援奥。各个领域强力推进改革，阿根廷势必沸反盈天，米莱有这样的操盘技巧吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;改革需要进程，经济增长也需时间，即便米莱做得全对，他本人也很可能快速下台。 “自由前进党”在竞选时并无显著优势，需要和其他党派结盟才能执政。米莱本人的基本盘并不稳固，他能否在五年内争取到足够多支持者，这是一个疑问。阿根廷素有军事政变传统，军方会不会趁乱将他赶下台？这些都是超越了经济的议题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;米莱自从走上政坛，就已经注定，他不能只是学者。 He needs to become a politician and even a strongman to put Argentina on the track of development. The 21st century is no longer the era of strong men, and Milai is no longer Pinochet. It is worth observing how far Argentina&#39;s reforms can go. Argentina is a model for middle-class countries, and its success or failure in reform will have an exemplary impact on Latin America and even more countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后讨论一个话题：阿根廷这样左翼氛围长期浓厚的国家，米莱这样的奇形异类，为何能够上台呢？他本人的突出能力，在社交媒体时代的风云际会，这些固然非常重要。社会思潮酝酿，也是重要的因素。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二战以后，阿根廷在庇隆主义统治下，经济长期停滞，各路干预主义轮番上阵，经济却未好转。其间短暂的经济亮色，是1990年代初期的自由化改革。进入新世纪，阿根廷进入基什内尔时代，经济上延续庇隆主义的管制习气，经济长期不振，政治上基什内尔夫妇轮流执政十多年。这种沉闷氛围下，政治素人米莱带来革新风气，让人眼前一亮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，阿根廷的自由思想基础不可忽略。 1959年奥地利学派的宗师人物米塞斯曾访问阿根廷，发表多次演讲，这给当代阿根廷学界种下自由思想的种子。奥地利学派在国际经济学界不算主流，在阿根廷却十分活跃。其中有经济学家传播因素，阿根廷无处不在的管制，也让听者常有共鸣。米莱在阿根廷年轻人中受欢迎，并非偶然。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿根廷本国也有自由思想渊源。 19世纪，阿根廷涌现出一批信奉古典自由主义的政治家。政治思想家胡安·阿尔韦迪曾是外交官，他从欧洲吸取先进思想，回国主导制定宪法，阐述阿根廷应以移民和贸易立国，融入全球市场。萨米恩托是第一位平民总统，他废除欧洲殖民者遗留的等级制度，主张通过自由贸易和城市化改造国家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;类似思想者在早期的阿根廷并不少见，这个国家能在20世纪初期步入发达国家行列，是几代先贤经营的成果，他们在本国人民心目中拥有崇高威望。米莱熟知经济历史，他挖取本民族的古典自由资源，引经据典，占据了道义高地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;选举胜利之后，米莱再次呼吁拥抱阿尔韦迪，回归有限政府理念，恢复本民族应有荣光。 “让阿根廷再次伟大”并非东施效颦，而是许多阿根廷人的真实所想。无论何时，民族主义都是一面有号召力的旗帜，关键看它指向何方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

(more than two-fifths of the book, but not too much) &lt;/span>;. From the perspective of &quot;raising questions is more important than solving them&quot;, he summarized a number of enlightening problem areas arising from the development of this field following the path of modern geography. The whole book uses a narrative method that is completely different from that of textbooks, painting a vivid intellectual portrait of historical geography on the page. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This book is written very emotionally, so it can easily shorten the distance with ordinary readers. Witnessing Hou Renzhi taking out a few soil samples from the archaeological ash pit and taking them away, the author &quot;suddenly felt that something called science suddenly appeared.&quot; He used Zhang Chengzhi&#39;s words, &quot;If I had read this book earlier, I would have taken the postgraduate entrance exam for him&quot; to recreate the academic impact of Shi Nianhai&#39;s &quot;Collection of Rivers and Mountains&quot;. He pointed out how important it is for Chinese historical geography to be recognized by Tan Qixiang, who has the trust of first-class academic scholars in the field of historical documents. He also said that Skinner&#39;s assertion that traditional China had &quot;no nationwide urban system&quot; first made him &quot;stunned&quot;, but then, &quot;of course I immediately realized that Skinner was talking about economics, not politics.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have always thought that the emergence of the Yugong School from the field of ancient history analysis meant the formation of modern historical geography in China. However, this book regards it as just a &quot;transitional state&quot; and takes the emergence of the &quot;new paradigm with geography as its ontology&quot; in the 1950s as a sign of the &quot;creation&quot; of this branch of the discipline. This understanding, including whether historical geography has really been &quot;geographicalized&quot; today, and whether it should be &quot;geographicalized&quot; across the board, still deserves further discussion. The &quot;geographicalization&quot; of historical geography and the &quot;humanities&quot; of geography may reflect the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of modern scholarship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you ask, is there anyone in contemporary academia who maintains the magnanimous, elegant, and gentle academic gentlemanly demeanor? The first thing I think of is Tang Xiaofeng. This book deepened my impression.

What is a good life? When should charity be shown to someone who has made a mistake? If narcotics are recognized to shorten lifespan, should they still be used to suppress pain? Should we live a thousand years? Can public figures have a private life? Is open diplomacy possible? Some readers may feel that the author has not provided any &quot;substantive conclusions&quot; on questions such as this. That may be precisely because we are too familiar with another way of discussion, which can give a decisive and only correct answer to any question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A book that talks about ethics to the public can be written without looking like a boring sermon with a straight face.

The key is whether you start from a bunch of ready-made presuppositions and pretend to interpret history, or do you go back to the scene and examine it from scratch? In fact, we cannot return to the historical scene. However, as long as you are willing, you can still &quot;see&quot; that period of history as empathetically as possible through the various records left by people at that time. &quot;The devil is in the details.&quot; To give an example that is not included in this book: Wang Kaiyun recalled the &quot;painful history&quot; of the burning of the Old Summer Palace. Why did he call that fire &quot;Lishan Fire&quot;?

Different from many self-proclaimed political science studies that always try to explain political struggles in terms of power, selfish desires and the pursuit of maximizing interests, and regard the pursuit of values ​​as just a fig leaf for seizing power and maximizing interests, the author emphasizes that it is the two sides’ mutual opposition to The common belief in popular sovereignty and republican principles prevented the American Revolution from becoming a story of a life-and-death struggle between good and evil, but instead became a witness to the initial establishment of modern democracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chapter 5 &quot;Reconstruction of the Concept of &#39;Democracy&#39;&quot; is particularly worthy of careful reading. The British Revolution promoted constitutionalism but did not talk about democracy.

But in terms of their ability to judge big rights and wrongs, good and bad, the people are superior to intellectuals.… Therefore, Confucianism believes that people’s likes and dislikes derived from judgments of right and wrong can be trusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73726&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70521 &quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/9c20ec3332.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;006r8eOoly1hix2fxfbgxj30j60pkwi4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1626&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/9c20ec3332.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259765&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shao Xiaofeng: &quot;Song Style Artistic Life&quot;, Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, September 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text- align: left;&quot;>;After China emerged from the &quot;medieval era&quot; during the Tang and Song Dynasties, did it enter its &quot;pre-modern era&quot;?

The whole book uses seven theme words to connect fifty essays, focusing on the small and big things. Although it cannot be said that it has achieved the effect of &quot;gathering armpits into fur&quot;, it is not too much to say that it uses auspicious light feathers of different colors to connect a picture of the night sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 16:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[看网络短剧的人：“成功来得那么简单，爱情也是”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261395]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-27 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is a CEO with a net worth of hundreds of millions.

On November 22, the &quot;2023-2024 China Micro-Short Drama Market Research Report&quot; released by iiMedia Consulting showed that China&#39;s online micro-short drama market size will be 37.39 billion yuan in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 267.65%. Overseas, according to media reports, ReelShort, a short drama application platform owned by Chinese Online, has topped the U.S. iOS entertainment list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What supports the new trend of short dramas is the huge number of viewers. The &quot;China Online Audiovisual Development Research Report (2023)&quot; shows that as of December 2022, the number of short video users in China has reached 1.012 billion, of which more than half of the short video users have watched micro-short dramas and instant noodles that are less than 3 minutes in length. etc., the viewing proportion of users aged 19 and under exceeds 50%. In August 2023, data released by Kuaishou also showed that the number of people interested in short dramas on Kuaishou exceeded 260 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In just one or two hours, the audience traveled through the various fun spots that were set, experiencing rebirth, sudden wealth, and reverse. Attack, slap in the face, revenge and other various virtual lives. In this short drama world, they can easily gain a perfect love and reach the other side of success effortlessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“What is needed is simplicity, speed and directness”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiao Wei used to play otome games (note: those targeting women Dating simulation game), I watched the short drama in August. She is 39 years old and works as a training supervisor in a company. The first short drama she watched was a clip automatically recommended by a short video platform. The plot was simple: the heroine had to find someone to get married because of various grievances between wealthy families. She mistakenly thought that the male protagonist was the president at the construction site. He was an ordinary worker. After marrying him, the two started a life of marriage first and love later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiao Wei watched it for more than a minute. Her first impression was of handsome men and beautiful women. She thought the theme of &quot;The Domineering President Falls in Love with Me&quot; was interesting. After searching for the full collection Then they gave chase. To her surprise, the short drama had a compact plot and no unnecessary plot. She finished it in just over an hour. After that, she started looking for short dramas recommended by other netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During a busy working day, Qiao Wei only has lunch break and two hours before going to bed. For her, the length of short dramas is just right. Even if there are more than a hundred episodes of short dramas, it only takes an hour or two to finish them all. During her lunch break, she would randomly open a movie and watch a dozen or twenty episodes, which lasted only about twenty minutes, as a pastime. &quot;Anyway, my time is fragmented.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The scene of Tan Zhifeng watching the short play is also similar. She is completing her third year of master&#39;s degree this year and will watch short dramas in her spare time. However, she usually doesn&#39;t go out of her way to find short dramas recommended by others. She just watches the ones that appeal to her. She would even watch short dramas at double speed. &quot;The main reason is that she doesn&#39;t have enough time and is anxious, so she wants to finish it as soon as possible.&quot; Moreover, &quot;each scene of the short drama does not contain such complicated information,&quot; so double speed does not affect it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to her observation, short dramas generally rely on dialogue between actors to advance the plot. The president may sit on a chair and communicate with the butler next to him. Once the matter is done, &quot;you can move on to the next step.&quot; There are not so many details to explore in the short play, such as what traditional elements the set is designed according to, and what information is conveyed by the actors&#39; movements and eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tan Zhifeng used to read online articles for more than ten years. When she first saw some clips from short dramas, she thought they were &quot;tacky&quot;. Those settings, such as &quot;The Overlord and His Little Wife,&quot; were all popular elements in online articles more than ten years ago. But she didn&#39;t expect that now she is chasing short dramas. During the play, I still felt like I was &quot;on top&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/b396882cb5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1598&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/b396882cb5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259758&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the online short drama &quot;The President Loves Me Too Much&quot;. Data map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She thinks this may be related to the simplicity and directness of the short play. For example, she wants to watch &quot;The Boss&#39;s Sweet Pet&quot;. In some TV dramas, it may take a long development process to reach the plot point of &quot;pet&quot;, but the short drama is different. It will directly use the plot scene of &quot;pet, love hard&quot;. Presented; another example is the plot of a slap in the face. A long drama may take a long time to prepare, but a short drama may reveal the conspiracy of the vicious female supporting character in the next episode and slap the face immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Instead of waiting for an hour for that one (cool) point, why don&#39;t I look at 10 (cool) points in 5 minutes. Although it looks tacky, But it’s refreshing faster.” Tan Zhifeng told Southern Weekend reporters, “What everyone needs is simple, fast and direct.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mo Xia also thinks so. She is 28 years old and works in a public institution. She remembered a costume-themed short drama she had watched before. There was a plot where the heroine changed her face, and no one except the hero could recognize her. She felt that if this plot was placed in a long drama, there would definitely be misunderstandings that would take several episodes to complete, which would make people feel frustrated. However, in the short drama, “There are no misunderstandings, it’s just a very smooth plot, and everyone just It was fun to watch.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I don&#39;t care what the two people in the middle have gone through, I just want to see them reconcile.&quot; Qiao Wei said. In her opinion, long dramas will always try to be logically linked, but &quot;there will still be logical gaps.&quot; Short dramas are less concerned with logic. &quot;(Since) it&#39;s not perfect, I might as well show more of what I want to see.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Provide us with material for dreaming&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like online articles, short dramas are also divided into &quot;gender&quot;. &quot;Mainly serving male audiences, the audience of &quot;Female Channel Drama&quot; is mainly female. Li Yu is currently mainly writing &quot;male dramas&quot;. He has created eighty or ninety short plays, most of which have themes such as the God of War and the son-in-law. He introduced that the audience of &quot;male video drama&quot; is mainly between the ages of 35 and 55. Most of them work as security guards, delivery workers, online ride-hailing drivers, etc., and their educational level is generally low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yan Peiliang, who currently mainly produces &quot;female video dramas&quot;, said that &quot;female video dramas&quot; are more like romantic dramas, usually with elements such as sweet pets and sadomasochism. &quot;Male dramas&quot; are more delicate, and the age of the audience is relatively young, mainly between 25 and 45 years old. These women usually have a certain level of education and pay more attention to the picture, atmosphere and other factors of the short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But in Yan Peiliang&#39;s view, whether it is a &quot;male video drama&quot; or a &quot;female video drama&quot;, most viewers will substitute themselves when watching. Female viewers may fantasize about a handsome guy pursuing them, while male viewers may assume the identity of the male protagonist and feel that they are &quot;counterattacking&quot; and &quot;getting rich&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He observed that unlike female audiences who have high requirements for the appearance of the male and female protagonists in &quot;female-channel dramas&quot;, male audiences watch &quot;male-channel dramas&quot; &quot;, the requirements for the male protagonist&#39;s appearance are not high, just ordinary. Too good-looking will affect their acceptance. But at the same time, they hope that the heroine will be as beautiful as possible, so that &quot;the fantasy can be fulfilled.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a short play writer and director, Zhizhu pays more attention to creating a sense of atmosphere when filming, so that the audience can better relate to it. She is a photographer and started filming short plays in early 2022. Now her two short plays have received ratings of 6.8 and 7.2 respectively on Douban. She will work hard on lighting and composition, and create a sense of atmosphere by arranging scenes such as rain and wind. Sometimes she will also create a sense of tension through the gazes of the male and female protagonists as needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/e0e94ec1e9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;834&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/e0e94ec1e9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259759&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the online short series &quot;Donglan Snow&quot;. Data map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Actually, everyone has a dream about love in their hearts. I think the short drama invisibly provides us with material for dreaming.&quot; Qiao Wei told Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She always calls herself a &quot;middle-aged girl&quot;. In reality, she has a happy small family, and her son is already in the first grade of elementary school. But she feels that &quot;the reality is You are who you are, and you will never be the heroine in &#39;The Boss Falls in Love with Me&#39;, but when you watch the show, you can realize such a dream.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qian Wan is 27 years old and works in a bank. When watching short dramas, he prefers the plot of &quot;chasing his wife in the crematorium&quot;. For example, the male protagonist originally had a &quot;Bai Yueguang&quot;, but he abandoned the female protagonist after Bai Yueguang came back. After experiencing some things, he realized that the person he really loved was the heroine, thus starting the &quot;crematorium&quot; mode. She felt that this might be related to her only real love experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That relationship was pursued by her, and it only lasted for more than ten days. The other party admitted to her during a phone call that he still liked the girl he had not pursued before. Qian Wan felt that she had been tricked by the other party, and she was unwilling and sad. At that time, she really hoped that the boy would regret it, but she sent a message to the other party at that time, but the other party did not reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Aren&#39;t (these) dramas just for dreaming?&quot; Qian Wan said. Ren Dongxiao also thinks so. She is a sophomore this year. When watching short dramas, every time she sees the heroine being bullied and the CEO hero standing up to protect and take care of the heroine and slapping other people in the face, she expects it to really exist in reality. Such a person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiao Wei remembered watching &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; when she was a child. No matter how much Tom was tortured by Jerry, he could not get enough of Jerry. This made her very happy. Peace of mind is a joy. Watching short dramas gave her a similar feeling. The villain&#39;s thoughts were always on his face. No matter how he framed the heroine, the hero would always appear at the critical moment. No matter how many twists and turns the hero and heroine went through, there was always a positive outcome. &quot;Everything you hope will happen happens, everything you hope to see will be seen,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Tan Zhifeng’s view, many short dramas will deliberately omit complicated things in real life. For example, if an 18th-tier star becomes a movie queen, the middle part should be It’s a long road, but in the short play, “you can get all the fame and achievements you want without putting in any effort”; no matter what the heroine’s conditions are or how she behaves, the CEO is devoted to her for no reason. . &quot;Success comes so easily, and so does love.&quot; She said, &quot;(These) things that make no sense if you think about it carefully may just be a dream created for everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maybe this kind of thing &quot;Happiness can&#39;t be found in the elegant hall, but it doesn&#39;t matter&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Yu currently writes mainly &quot;small program short plays&quot;. He is 20 years old and can write two pieces a month. Three parts, each with about 100 episodes. The four short plays he wrote in the past two months are &quot;60% similar in content&quot;, and they are all based on the same God of War theme. The protagonist may be a fish seller in this drama, but next time he will be a pig butcher; some of the key slap-in-the-face plots will take place at the old man&#39;s birthday party, and some will be at the heroine&#39;s home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Yu doesn&#39;t want his friends to know that he is writing a short play, for fear that they will think, &quot;It turns out that such rubbish stuff was written by people like you.&quot; . He would feel &quot;very ashamed&quot; and &quot;(the short play he wrote) has no nutrition, literary value or artistic value&quot;, but &quot;currently they (editors and platforms) do not want to innovate and do not require taking risks&quot;, and he also needs to survive . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Short plays inherently have many similar plots. (If you) often watch short plays, you will find that many characters have similar names and cannot be distinguished at all.&quot; Many short dramas currently on the market do not have the so-called film and television language. &quot;To put it bluntly, it is a dynamic PPT for online novels.&quot; Yan Peiliang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mo Xia said that she &quot;can remember very few&quot;. She has watched nearly fifty short plays this year, and she can name the titles and general plots of them. No more than ten. Other short drama viewers interviewed also mentioned that it was difficult to remember which short dramas they had watched. Tan Zhifeng recalled a certain short drama he had watched before, and what he remembered more was the short drama elements of &quot;traveling through the past, empress, queen, CEO, sweet pet, counterattack and slap in the face&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I can only say that this kind of short play is excitement itself. No matter how it is produced, it only meets some momentary needs for happiness. Maybe this kind of happiness even reaches the top of the screen. It’s not elegant, but it doesn’t matter.” Tan Zhifeng told Southern Weekend reporters. Just like herself, she is busy and stressed in real life, and she hopes to focus on watching things in her spare time that do not require the use of her brain. &quot;You can&#39;t keep one string tight all the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/be166c8ad3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1663&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/be166c8ad3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259760&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the online short series &quot;Abuse of Love: Mr. Lu&#39;s Newly Married Mute Wife&quot;. Data map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiao Wei attaches great importance to the two hours of free time before going to bed. For her, &quot;If I didn&#39;t have these two hours, I would either be a As a wife, either a mother or an employee, I have to think about how to live a better life. (But) I feel that only when these two hours belong to myself, (will I) consider whether I am happy or not. I It doesn’t matter who it is, I don’t have to work hard or think.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She feels that the short play is “quite efficient” in terms of satisfying her own needs for happiness. . She used to spend those two hours playing games where she could design her own plot, or learning to play the ukulele. Although she was happy, she still found it too mentally taxing. &quot;The short play feels like a popping candy to me. I&#39;ve finished it in one bite. I don&#39;t need to think about it. I just feel happy now. As for whether it is meaningful or not, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s important.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But she also feels that if there is no short drama, it will not have much impact. Zhizhu also believes that even if there is no short drama, there will be something else, because everyone is very tired from work, and there must always be some entertainment channels for emotional release. Games, short videos, and novels can all be options. &quot;( Short plays) are very alternative for the audience.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yan Peiliang feels that although short plays are &quot;dispensable&quot; for some audiences. But just like Coke, some people think it is dispensable, and there will always be people who regard it as a necessity. &quot;Let the audience choose for themselves.&quot; For example, a breakfast shop sells steamed buns and provides side dishes. Some people buy the steamed buns and leave, while others just pick them up. Some dried radishes and pickles, &quot;The value of our existence is that when the audience has this demand, we still have some relatively good quality pickles waiting for them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (At the request of the interviewees, Tan Zhifeng, Mo Xia, Qian Wan , Ren Dongxiao, and Li Yu are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[离婚跟拍火了，闲得慌还是花钱买仪式感？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261363]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-27 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, divorce follow-up photography has become popular among young people.

In the past two years, it has also remained above 2‰. Among them, young people aged 25-35 have become the main force in divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under this trend, young people&#39;s attitudes and thoughts when facing divorce have changed greatly compared with the past. Compared with the bitterness and hatred of the older generation, divorce seems to be becoming a &quot;peaceful thing&quot; and a positive thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, as early as the 2010 movie &quot;If You Are the One 2&quot;, Mango, played by Yao Chen, and Li Xiangshan, played by Sun Honglei, held a party when they separated. Divorce ceremony. Actor Ge You, as the divorce certifier, said in his speech: &quot;Let&#39;s shake hands like acquaintances,&quot; which brought a relatively happy ending to the separation between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today&#39;s young people use the method of divorce follow-up, taking photos and Vlog to record the end of one stage and the beginning of a new stage. Taking photos becomes a ritual in the divorce process. Of course, this ceremonial divorce photoshoot is completely different from the wedding photoshoot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As we all know, when taking wedding photos, the theme is to get married and the main focus is celebration. Almost every newlywed couple will wear Chinese or Western-style dresses and hire professional photo studios and photographers to record the two people as a couple cuddling with each other and being united forever in various settings such as the seaside, under the shadow of coconut trees, and in the courtyard of an ancient house. The beautiful shadow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But divorce photos are no longer carefully posed on the beach or in the shadow of coconut trees, but may be the Civil Affairs Bureau or a place where the two went shopping together, or even A certain park or tea house for daily simple photography. After photographer Song Yang accepted an order to follow up on the divorce of an old classmate, he followed his friends to several places that were memorable to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the process, Song Yang followed silently and did not find a special camera position to capture the scene. He only occasionally gave simple guidance to the subjects. The overall atmosphere was not heavy and similar to normal. life portraits. Song Yang said, &quot;It&#39;s like shooting with normal friends. Everyone is calm, no conflicts, and not too close. And it&#39;s more casual, without even discussing in advance where to shoot and how to shoot.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to the final group photo, other divorce photos also include a photo of a girl who came to a coffee shop after the divorce and took a photo with a coffee cup with &quot;Happy Single&quot; written on it. . The scenes and shots are not complicated, but with this simple stroke, the divorce was brought to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/TQWNs1nqr7G10j9Rh1deJAu8nZcnQfnvvMD0Iv9n.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/27/tqwnqr7g10j9rh1dejau8nzcnqfnvmd0iv9n.jpeg&quot; data-key = &quot;259748&quot;>; &lt; /p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (visual China/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot; >; &lt;strong>; Why do young people want to take divorce &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So why do young people want to take divorce photos when they divorce? First of all, of course, because the divorce incident occurred. With this incident, many comprehensive factors behind this have begun to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, the development process of society has entered a new stage. Marriage is becoming a lifetime from traditional concepts to Freedom of choice. The influence of traditional concepts on young people is weakening, and young people are beginning to pay more attention to their personal rights and feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; With the change of this concept, when facing the divorce incident, people have changed from crying, discrimination and dissuasion to today&#39;s equality. Looking at peace and face, and the positive solution of calmness and stability, it is regarded as a turning point towards happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Xiaoyan, a professor of psychology at Chongqing Normal University, believes that &quot;divorce and shooting this business can be carried out enough Gao. In the past, everyone generally believed that divorce was an ugly thing and did not want to talk too much. Now it is a incident of divorce as a life. >; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; and record the divorce process, which is proposed by French anthropologist Fan Jirenep. Need a ritual in the process of conversion. &quot; These records, sharing, and praise, the mood, expression, time, place, etc. of the divorce, fixed on the circle of friends and the social platform, is a sense of ritual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On the other hand, as the professor of sociology professors of Tsinghua University said, &quot;social media pulled far people to the side&quot;, whether it is vibrato or Xiaohong Books, the influence of online social waves is inevitable. When the people of generations see some bloggers or peers when they share the experience of taking divorce photos, they can easily produce curiosity they want to try. It is the common sense of people who want to try. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Shooting divorce will become a large-scale business? &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So, with the interest of young people taking divorce photos, will divorce and shooting become a large-scale business? From now on, it is not very large -scale yet, and relatively niche. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; From the perspective of demand, although the divorce rate is now high and the number of divorce is also a lot, the divorce group is also divided into divorce photos and no need to take pictures. Among them, this demand is still a minority. Therefore, the market size of divorce photos is actually relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; From the current order situation, many photographers receive such a camera invitation on social platforms and then follow them. Some photographers with similar experience also obtained customers through social platforms to publish relevant information. In reality, there are no special docking platforms and professional institutions, and no large -scale promotion has been formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, from a business perspective, where there is demand, consumption will be created. The spirit of business opportunities is often from scratch, from small to large. Divorce is actually a phased turning incident in life like birth, age, graduation, marriage, funeral, etc. Compared to graduation or marriage, one of the important life events of divorce obviously have not received enough attention and response, which is the business opportunity for divorce services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the future, with the continuous changes in ideas, the end of marriage is paid attention to as the beginning of marriage. It is impossible. Once this importance to divorce is transformed into demand and consumption links, the corresponding divorce service items will appear more and more like wedding services. According to media reports, Japanese divorce companies can provide services such as divorce ceremony, divorce travel, and many divorced couples have experienced corresponding services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Of course, divorce and shooting also involve photographers who know the emotions and privacy of both customers. Avoid it in operation. However, as the other side of marriage, related practitioners can pay attention to divorce -related products and services. It is not necessarily an explosive growth business, but as a second growth curve, it may not be an effective supplement to conventional business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
