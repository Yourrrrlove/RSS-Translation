Opening speeches, media meetings, parallel forum speeches... his schedule is filled with &quot;brain activities&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his first time to participate in the &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &quot;This is an open discussion, very interesting and exciting.&quot; Xussel told Southern Weekend reporters, and &quot;people read and wrote &quot;Good speech&quot; is different. This is a conversation with controversy, &quot;both positive and negative, and people express their own opinions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are representatives from different countries here. Whether they are Europeans, Americans, or Chinese, everyone can participate. This makes it possible for people to reflect on their existing positions, understand new ideas, and gain enlightenment.&quot; Xu Sai I said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 40 years, Xussel has visited China more than ten times and witnessed China&#39;s &quot;incredible development.&quot; Xussel is friendly to China and values ​​relations with China. During his term as prime minister from 2002 to 2007, the trade volume between China and Austria doubled several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, against the background of tense Sino-US relations, voices such as &quot;decoupling theory&quot; and &quot;deglobalization&quot; have become increasingly popular, casting a shadow on China-EU cooperation. Schüssel said he was &quot;totally opposed to decoupling&quot; because it was globalization and international trade that brought affluence and prosperity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. And decoupling is a &#39;lose-lose&#39; strategy.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;At noon on December 3, Wolfgang Schüssel accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

(Photo/Southern Weekend reporter Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“China is a special model”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>; &lt;span>;What do you think is the difference between China&#39;s development model and that of the West? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China is certainly a special model. In the past, China did not have free movement, free enterprise, private ownership and private property, but today the situation is completely different and China is developing in a positive direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination is very interesting. Usually we believe that market economy, free enterprise, private companies, etc., are complementary to freedom, openness, and pluralistic democracy. China, on the other hand, shows a different model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the Communist Party has a certain dynamic, an elitist management approach. They take the best and most talented people and then put those people to the test. If these people are successful, then they will be assigned to different positions again and then enter the next stage. This is a very interesting model. It&#39;s not our model, but it&#39;s a very effective model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How does Europe view the rise of China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, the European people respect China’s peaceful rise very much. I am an economist. I remember when Deng Xiaoping came to power, China&#39;s GDP was less than 200 billion US dollars. Today, that number is $7 trillion. This is incredible growth. China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and their living conditions have now greatly improved. The “One Belt, One Road” initiative proposed by China is also playing an important role. So I think China plays an important role on the international stage and has huge influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have great respect and admiration for the Chinese model. Of course, we have different views on our respective political systems, that&#39;s for sure. But no matter what, every country has the right to choose its own future, and China does not belong to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent times, Europe’s voice on China has not been positive. What is the reason behind this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, one million people have been killed or disabled in the past two years. Mostly young people. Every day, missiles and drones rain down on Ukraine, destroying infrastructure, homes, and apartments. Today, the area where the battle was fought looks like the moon, a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I think both Europe and China should use their influence to stop this war and respect the sovereignty of independent countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Decoupling&quot; is a &quot;lose-lose&quot; strategy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What do you think? &quot;Decoupling theory&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am completely opposed to decoupling. it&#39;s out of the question. It is globalization and international trade that bring affluence and prosperity. According to customs figures, global trade has exploded over time. Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. So (decoupling) is absolutely impossible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some research suggests that when decoupling actually occurs, it will cause a loss of more than 7% of global GDP. For countries that are more deeply integrated into global supply chains, decoupling will do more harm. Like China or Austria, Europe and the United States. Therefore, decoupling is really a “lose-lose” strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Are de-risking and decoupling the same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;De-risking is different. I know some people suggest that these two statements are consistent, but in fact they are not the same. De-risking refers to the reluctance of people to rely heavily on a single partner. Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Suddenly, we saw a shortage of medical equipment. Moreover, due to the trade blockade, all channels have been closed. We have no medicines from India and no masks from China. De-risking means you have to leave some protection areas in place to protect your people, just in case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, in terms of energy, we cannot completely rely on Russia. We have to diversify our sources. If someone blew up the pipeline in Austria, or Ukraine or Russia stopped the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, everything would be ruined. No energy, no electricity, you can imagine what that means for the economy. So, you have to diversify. China is also de-risking. China needs to maintain sovereignty in data, supply chains, etc. This is completely understandable, and we will do the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is national defense. The Europeans have outsourced national defense to the Americans. Trump said that we will eventually leave NATO and Europe will be responsible for itself. This is what de-risking means. We have to invest more in our own defense because in a crisis you have to protect your own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should you do if you suddenly encounter cyber hackers, surprise attacks, or blockades? What about your government, your site, your hospital, your energy company? Just like a company, we analyze potential risks in all directions of the company from a professional perspective - including paying attention to usage context, technical risks, external risks, market risks, etc. Every company will protect itself from risks, and the government must do the same . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent years, China has emphasized high-level opening up. What opportunities do you think this will bring? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think China’s opening up to the outside world is very important. Two factors struck me during the discussions at this conference. The first one is that a Chinese friend suggested that China is now focusing on developing a unified domestic market, such as managing the financial market, allocation, lending standards, etc. in all provinces with the same rules. This is exactly what the EU has always wanted to do but has not quite done yet. And once we complete that, it will be a huge catalyst for new growth. So, China is also following the same path. If China provides a large-scale market for its consumers and industrial partners, this is a major benefit for all of us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point is that China is now committed to developing regional trade with ASEAN countries, which will also help Europe. Because I know that many companies in Europe are also interested in establishing ties with ASEAN countries. In many cases, people cannot accurately tell where a product comes from. For example, if you look at my smartphone, it contains 700-800 different components. They may be from Vietnam, Thailand, China, the United States, etc. As another example, my Audi car is made up of 900 different parts. It&#39;s assembled in Mexico, its engine comes from Slovakia, the gasoline comes from Hungary, parts come from China, and some elements come from Germany. So, this isn&#39;t just a &quot;German car&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think this kind of inter-regional cooperation is beneficial. Moreover, cooperation enhances neighborly relations. For example, the EU intends to integrate the Western Balkan countries into the EU. Thirty years ago, a bloody war broke out in the Balkans. If Serbia develops cooperative trade with Croatia, Slovenia, etc., it will &quot;force&quot; peace. Therefore, I believe that inter-regional cooperation is conducive to prosperity, conducive to peace, and conducive to a harmonious future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“In short, we need to cooperate”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2020, Austria’s first trip from The China-Europe train from Vienna to Xi&#39;an sets off. How do you evaluate the impact of China-Europe freight trains on Austria? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China-Europe freight trains are very important. Shipping containers by rail is much faster and more environmentally friendly than shipping by sea. Although shipping is cheap, it does have more negative impacts in terms of environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. So in my opinion, rail transportation is one of the elements of the future, which can both reduce costs and make cooperation more effective. Such an application has been very successful in Germany. If you look at the actual data, you will find that trade is growing positively, and it is not the so-called &quot;deglobalization&quot; or &quot;decoupling&quot; trend. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the changes in Sino-US relations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;First of all, 80% of the world’s population is neither Chinese nor American. Therefore, I think Sino-US cooperation is not the only cooperation that both sides need. I think we should really work on promoting cooperation between Europe and China. Currently, we are looking for and working hard to develop together. By the way, same interests as China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a multipolar world requires well-functioning institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. This is important, if something goes wrong, arbitration is always better than bilateral tensions and that is in our interest. First, it is important to resume military engagement because no one wants to cause an accident, but it can happen. Likewise, what we need is a multipolar world, not a bipolar world. This could be beneficial to all of us if there were some effectively functioning international institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few weeks ago, the heads of state of China and the United States met in San Francisco, and I felt very optimistic about it. This is a positive step towards cooperation. We should look forward to a positive and bright future, because the world needs such a future, and we are also facing common problems, such as climate change, financial problems, inflation, regional conflicts, etc. All in all, we need to work together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Do you think Austria or Europe will choose sides? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge. I trust the leaders on both sides, they are rational politicians. I believe that good political initiatives always have the welfare of the people at heart. And the happiness of the people means prosperity, it means peace, it means employment, it means a good position when competing with other countries - of course in a peaceful and economic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this conference, we honor Henry Kissinger. He is one of the architects of such a good policy. He was born in Germany and was deported. (He) came to the United States as a refugee from Nazi Germany but became a historian and an advocate for peaceful cooperation. Not confrontation, but working together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recently commemorated the late Premier of China, Li Keqiang. He founded the Forum Connecting Europe and China about 10 years ago to develop innovative worldviews and explore overall solutions to related problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think they are our role models in how to deal with tough times. This is the challenge we see today, but we should not be pessimistic, we should make a positive future possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Zhang Xinyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[聚焦丨2023年“读懂中国”国际会议（广州）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261802]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:06:20&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;From December 1st to 3rd, the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; International Conference (Guangzhou) was held at Yuexiu International Convention Center , hundreds of domestic and foreign guests from more than 30 countries and regions exchanged and discussed.

In 1935, he was admitted to the History Department of Tsinghua University and was taught by professors such as Yu Pingbo, Chen Yinke, Qian Mu, and Jin Yuelin. In 1948, he went to study in the UK. In 1955, he was invited by the French sinologist Bai Lege to assist in the &quot;Song History Research Project&quot; and write &quot;The Births, Deaths and Chronology of Figures in the Song Dynasty&quot;. Since then, he has served as professor in the Chinese Department of Ruhr University Bonn in Germany, the Department of Oriental Languages ​​at the University of Wisconsin in the United States, the Nanyang University in Singapore, and the History Department at Soochow University in Taiwan. Published include &quot;Chinese Science and Technology History Series&quot;, &quot;Yilin Congkao&quot;, &quot;Siku Synopsis Supplement&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng Tongwen is an internationally renowned scholar of Chinese literature and history. His academic fields include not only the traditional four-part study, but also social history, literary history, and cultural history. He is well known to the world for his outstanding achievements and widespread influence in many fields, such as history of art, history of science and technology. I entered school late, and due to the cross-strait barrier, I didn’t get to know him, which I regret very much. Recently, Taishun held a meeting to commemorate Mr. Weng to discuss Mr. Weng&#39;s achievements. After a brief review of Professor Wu Songdi&#39;s two huge volumes of works, I was impressed by his admiration. What is particularly admirable is that Mr. Weng cared about his hometown in his later years and donated a lot of money. Later scholars in the country did not forget his kindness. They published anthologies and commemorated discussions, which are enough to make good stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng and I have not had the opportunity to ask for advice in person, and there are few points of intersection in our academic fields. I feel that Mr. Weng Tongwen’s nostalgia for boxing and his academic merits , I am also grateful for Professor Wu Songdi’s enthusiastic invitation. The organizer of Taishun is motivated by the desire to advance cultivation and promote academics. However, I am sometimes troubled by trivial matters and am unable to advance. I would like to write down my rough experience after reading &quot;The Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot;. . A little bit of petal incense is used to pay homage to the former philosopher. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. &quot;Supplement to the Siku Synopsis&quot;: traditional reading notes with high spirits&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let me first talk about the philological research that I am more familiar with. , take the fifth volume of the anthology, &quot;Supplements to Siku Synopsis&quot; as an example. The eighty-eight articles in this part are written according to the traditional bibliographic and postscript method. Most of them are relatively simple and record the correction of errors found in &quot;Siku Synopsis&quot;. Some of them show the depth of effort. The first article examines the three volumes of Guo Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Peijin&quot; in the early Song Dynasty. It discusses the summary and quotes Zhongshu&#39;s biography from &quot;History of the Song Dynasty&quot;. It is believed that the summary quoted is very different from the popular Baiji version and the palace version &quot;History of the Song Dynasty&quot;. It is speculated that the two There was originally a rift in the shogunate of Liu Yun, Duke of Xiangyin, and the target was misunderstood. Then based on the surviving documents of the Five Dynasties and the early Song Dynasty, Guo Zhongshu&#39;s life was restored, Daduan was restored, and he criticized Zhongshu for being a &quot;drinker and irresponsible person who had many disobediences with others&quot;. He also revealed what Wang Guowei had studied and later engraved the &quot;Nine Classics Characters&quot;. It was written by Zhongshu, and his contribution is indescribable. Today, people have a lot to say about the eight volumes of the four-storey version of &quot;The Biography of Talented Scholars of the Tang Dynasty&quot; written by Xin Wenfang of the Yuan Dynasty. Weng Kao has a particularly valuable historical material, that is, it is revealed that the second volume of &quot;Shitian Collection&quot; written by Ma Zuchang of the Yuan Dynasty contains &quot;Ti Xinliang Shi &quot;Pisha Collection&quot;&quot;: &quot;If you can&#39;t sort through the sand, there will be too much gold. The meaning of modern and ancient times is short and short. Long song. Autumn plugs sing frost armor, spring houses cut paintings, chanting turns the remaining hair, desolate is Yin He.&quot; Mr. Weng therefore knew Xin You&#39;s &quot;Collection of Poems on Peeling Sand&quot;, and commented: &quot;Yin He, Yin Keng, He Xun is also . Compared with this, it is profound, and there is no doubt that he is as famous as Wang Zhiqian and others, and Yang Zai and others advocated peace with them.&quot; &quot;>;(&quot;Collected Works&quot; mislabeled this passage as Ma Zu Changyu)&lt;/span>; This is very important for understanding the poetry level and achievements of Xin Wenfang himself, who worked most diligently on the poets of the Tang Dynasty in the Yuan Dynasty. A study of Zhang Tangying&#39;s &quot;Shu 梼杌&quot; in the Song Dynasty shows that the original book must have been in ten volumes. The whole article is only over 200 words long and contains extremely rich information, so you can rely on it for basic judgments. There are five volumes of &quot;Luoyang Jialan Ji&quot;, and the biographical annotations are all mixed into the main text. Since the Qing Dynasty, many scholars have hoped to separate out the annotations as Quanzu Wangxiao&#39;s &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; did. Tang Yan&#39;s &quot;Gou Shen&quot;, recent scholars Fan Xiangyong&#39;s &quot;College Notes&quot;, Zhou Zumo&#39;s &quot;College Notes&quot; and Xu Gaoruan&#39;s &quot;Republication&quot; believe that Xu Shu &quot;learned from various schools and came from behind&quot;, but did not add annotations to historical events. In this regard, it is known that Fan and Zhoujia have &quot;profound skills&quot; and the attached pictures are &quot;sufficient for reference.&quot; This has gone far beyond the revision and supplement of &quot;Siku Synopsis&quot;. In five or six hundred words, one can read the gains and losses of modern people&#39;s governance of &quot;Jialan Ji&quot;. Since the publication of the abstract, Yu Jiaxi&#39;s &quot;Diagnosis of Syndrome&quot; has been particularly famous, and his scholarship has paid special attention to the collected works of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which can supplement the author&#39;s actions and the beginning and end of the original book. Mr. Weng Tongwen also paid attention to the historical events of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. He discussed various articles with Yu, such as the life story of Ye Zhi, the author of &quot;Ai Rizhai Congchao&quot;, and the article in &quot;Xijing Miscellaneous Notes&quot; quoted Lao Gan and Hong Ye, The remaining books are unknown. Wang Chen was the author of &quot;Tang Yulin&quot;. There are many inventions in the remaining books. Mr. Weng Tongwen even read Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Wang Danian&#39;s Lament&quot; written for Chen&#39;s father. He also knew that Chen came from a maternal relative&#39;s house and was a cousin to Shen. , Chen is older than Shen. There are so many wonderful things like this that it is impossible to list them all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73967&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70758&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/101090ef9a.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204163902.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;759&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/101090ef9a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260816&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;In 1936, Weng Tongwen (first from left) was with his family in Xi&#39;an. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Research on Publishing History: China’s Contribution from a Western Academic Perspective&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Research on the History of Science, Technology and Culture&quot;, Part Three of &quot;Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot; &quot;, there are twenty-one surviving articles, one of which talks about silkworm breeding, eleven on the history of publishing, two on the custom of sitting on chairs, one on the history of gunpowder, one on the incorruptibility of Han corpses, and one on It talks about the observations of genetic phenomena by people in the Tang Dynasty, and the other four articles talk about social and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries, covering a wide range of topics. The most direct impression is that Mr. Weng is a traditional scholar who has read many Chinese books in depth. However, because he has studied and taught in the West for a long time, his research interests and narrative stance are fundamentally different from those of traditional scholars. Whether he reads common books or Xi Jian&#39;s books all have unique insights and revelations, numerous discoveries, solid evidence, and new and reliable conclusions. These are the common characteristics of this group of papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let’s talk about the history of publishing first. From writing to publishing, the Tang Dynasty was a critical period. Exactly when the earliest engravings began has been debated among bibliophiles. Due to the discovery of Dunhuang posthumous documents and new documents, the earliest publication was probably in Shuzhong during the Yizong period. As for the scriptures found in South Korea with Empress Wu&#39;s new characters, the exact date of publication is still controversial. The articles written by Mr. Weng Tongwen were written at different times, but they involve more detailed interpretations and discovery of documents. Here is a summary, which is very enlightening to read. &quot;Correct Interpretation of the Word &quot;Mule&quot; in Yuan Zhen&#39;s Writings Intertwined with the History of Printing&quot; is a large article that analyzes it from a small perspective. In December of the fourth year of Changqing reign of Yuanzhen, he wrote the &quot;Preface to the Collection of Baishi Changqing&quot;. There is a self-note: &quot;Yang and Yuejian wrote many calligraphy models of Le Tian and Yu&#39;s miscellaneous poems, which were sold in shops.&quot; Hu Zhenheng of the Ming Dynasty also wrote It is believed that &quot;Mule&quot; refers to engraving and printing. In modern times, Hu Shi advocated Youli, and then there were as many as 20 or 30 writers. Only three people such as Xiang Da expressed their opposition, thinking that &quot;Mule&quot; refers to double-line hooks to draw white. Reproduction technology of ink marks on poetry manuscripts. Mr. Weng agreed with Xiang and analyzed the interpretation and changes of the two words in the past dynasties from the etymology and word formation, hoping that future researchers will no longer be troubled by this word. His argumentation process was extremely rigorous, and he had two unexpected gains. First, he compared the word &quot;mo&quot; with the words &quot;mo&quot;, &quot;motuo&quot;, &quot;motuo&quot;, &quot;mole&quot;, and &quot;moji&quot; that have appeared successively since the Eastern Han Dynasty. They must all be the same. &quot;The technique of making copies on paper according to the original pattern of writing strokes or ink marks.&quot; The second is to prove that &quot;mule&quot; is a new term that appeared in the mid-Tang Dynasty. This argument may seem trivial, but it actually resolves the ambiguity in the interpretation of a large number of documents related to engraving issues in the Middle Ages, and the conclusion is fully credible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest self-engraved poetry collection was Chen Yong, a native of Shu in the late Tang Dynasty&quot;. It is not long, but it is very interesting. &quot;Si Ku Yuan Jiu&quot; identifies the person who first engraved a collection of poems as Qian Shu Guanxiu, whose disciple Tanyu&#39;s &quot;Preface to the Collection of Chanyue&quot; says: &quot;Then I searched for and inspected the collection of poems and secretly memorized about a thousand poems, which were carved into a volume. The title is &quot;Collection of Chanyue.&quot; This preface was written in the fifth year of Qiande in the former Shu Dynasty &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(923)&lt;/span>;, and it is clear that there is no Disagreement. Ye Dehui&#39;s &quot;Shu Lin Qing Hua&quot; according to the &quot;Old History of the Five Dynasties - He Ning Biography&quot; states that &quot;there are hundreds of volumes collected, self-sealed on the board, hundreds of seals printed, and benefits distributed to others&quot;, which lists his events before Guanxiu. Mr. Weng believes that He Ning is later than Guan Xiu, and there is no absolute date for the engraving of his books, so he disagrees. He uncovered a neglected record from &quot;Beimeng Suoyan&quot;, that is, Chen Yong, a Jinshi during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, had a pair of lines at the beginning of his poem: &quot;Buffaloes on the other side cross with their noses floating on their noses, and sandbirds nod their way along the stream.&quot; Taoist priest Du Guangting Questioned, these two sentences are not good, &quot;Why should this be the beginning of the volume?&quot; Chen Yong replied: &quot;It was once rewarded by the nobles, so it is engraved on the beginning of the volume.&quot; Mr. Weng revealed this article, which is of course very valuable and should be able to supplement the previous ones. A case study of Shu engraved poetry collection. Whether the absolute date is earlier than Guanxiu can be discussed again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest publisher in world history appeared in Chang&#39;an in the middle and late Tang Dynasty&quot;, first based on Dunhuang documents, it was confirmed that there was a person selling almanacs in the second year of Emperor Xizong&#39;s reign in the late Tang Dynasty. The Fan Shang family in Chengdu and the Bian family in Longchifang, Chengdu County, which sold Buddhist mantras, are all mentioned in the discussions of Zhang Xiumin, Li Shuhua, and Qian Cunxun. Chen Zuolong, a bookseller in Chang&#39;an, has passed the examination of two calligraphers surnamed Li. Mr. Weng even cited the example of Bo 2633&#39;s &quot;Mrs. Cui&#39;s Training of Women&quot;, although it was a banknote version, but there was no &quot;printed version of the Li family in Shangdu&quot; at the end, so it was written based on the printed version. I have read this volume again and again. The so-called &quot;Praise to Bai Shilang&quot; is definitely named after Bai Juyi, and the work may not have been published during Bai Juyi&#39;s lifetime. The second is Bo&#39;s 2675 reverse note of &quot;New Collection of Emergency Moxibustion Sutra&quot;, which has the characters &quot;Seal of the Li family in Beijing in Dongshi&quot; at the end. Although it can be inferred to be after the second year of Xiantong, it is also very precious. The third one is a printed copy of the Si 8010 residual calendar, with the cross &quot;Shangdu Shi Dongshi Dadaojia seal&quot; at the end, which is considered to belong to a bookstore or publisher with &quot;Da Dao&quot; as its inscription. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the two articles about movable type printing, in addition to researching Bi Sheng&#39;s invention of clay movable type printing stated in Shen Kuo&#39;s &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, Mr. Weng vigorously pursued Bi Sheng His real life and what inspired his clay movable type skills. Particularly exciting among them are &quot;the doubts caused by clay type and its efficiency issues&quot; and &quot;the reason why movable type could not replace engraving before the late Qing Dynasty&quot;. The former, based on bits and pieces of records, shows that Bi Sheng had several projects in succession in the two hundred years after Bi Sheng. Several attempts were made, but there was no big development. Mr. Weng’s explanation for this is that although Bi Sheng was the first to invent movable type, there was no inheritance of linearity in the future. Instead, everyone kept starting from scratch and never overcame the shortcomings of the crude and rough movable type. Although China invented movable type printing, it did not replace woodblock printing. Fundamental changes did not occur until Western technology was introduced. &quot;Supplementary Discussion on the Invention of European Movable Type Plate Also Induced by Engraving Printing&quot; examines the way Europeans experimented with printing techniques before Gutenberg in Germany promoted the principle of movable type in the 15th century. In particular, he saw that the high frequency of letter engraving made it easier for Westerners to get ideas. Chinese woodblock printing methods inspired Europeans even more prominently. Although there are many speculations in this article, the basic insights are still within a reasonable range, and what I see is quite reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, the study of the life and book engraving career of Chen Qi, a descendant of Wu Zhao from the Later Shu Dynasty, the Xiangtai Yue family of the Southern Song Dynasty, and the book printer, are also included. They are all important and key figures in the history of Chinese printing. It is interesting to read clearly. &quot;Printing reduces the cost of books by nine-tenths&quot; is also an interesting topic. What I am more interested in is the interesting story at the end of the article about the fairy Wu Cailuan&#39;s book &quot;Tang Yun&quot;. Mr. Weng continued the opinion of Taiwanese scholar Wang Meng&#39;ou and believed that Wu Cailuan&#39;s &quot;Tang Yun&quot; was hidden in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. He always regretted not being able to see it in person. According to Zhou Zumo&#39;s &quot;Collection of Yun Shu of the Tang and Five Dynasties&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Zhonghua Book Company)&lt;/span>;, this volume is stored in the Palace Museum in Beijing and was photocopied by Zhou After reading the complete version, it was concluded that it was the Tang Dynasty Pei Wuqi&#39;s orthographic version of &quot;Public Mistakes, Filling the Gap and Qie Yun&quot;, not Sun Wei&#39;s &quot;Tang Yun&quot;. As for the book written by the female fairy Wu Cailuan, it is only a beautiful legend caused by the inscription and postscript of Xiang Yuanbian of the Ming Dynasty, and cannot be taken as true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73968&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70759&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/61524c0624.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204164056.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;714&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/61524c0624.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260817&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;In the 1950s, Weng Tongwen (first from right) was in France with his friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Science and Technology Life History Research: Daily and Important Perspectives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Regarding life history, Mr. Weng Tongwen talks about the origin of chairs in China These two magnificent articles are examined in the context of global human history. They not only draw on the insights of Chinese and foreign scholars, but also extensively quote rich material objects obtained from literature and archaeology, and strive to restore the Chinese people from sitting low or kneeling to gradually sitting high. The process, including the &quot;Chronological Record of Rope Bed Materials&quot;, covers a period of more than 700 years. It mentions six chairs that appeared east of Congling from the Jin Dynasty to the end of the Six Dynasties. Five of them originated from India, which further proves that the chairs were introduced from India via the Silk Road. He also came to the same conclusion when he investigated the special-shaped rope beds of chairs, and proved that most of them were related to monks and monasteries. He pointed out that the rope bed was a tool for monks to meditate and meditate, and some monks developed the habit of not lying down day and night throughout their lives, and most of them He sat on the rope bed. After the Middle Tang Dynasty, he examined the traces of chairs entering the palace and scholar&#39;s homes, and explained that chairs also led to an increase in the height of other furniture, such as tables, tall cabinets, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng talked about the era when the book &quot;The Synopsis of Zhenyuan Miaodao&quot; was written. Based on the mention of Yanluozi in the book, it is suspected that it was written in the middle and late Five Dynasties. . I quoted the general rules of Taoist discussion from Taoist books, and felt that it was more likely to be written in the Song Dynasty. Based on the experience of the Waidan family, the article believes that incendiary gunpowder weapons began in the Song Dynasty, and the emergence of firecrackers should be after Song Renzong. The general conclusion can be believed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Three Interlocking Inventions Traced to Silk Production Techniques&quot; is the first and most important article in this part, so I I’ll introduce it at the end. China is a large agricultural country, and there has been a tradition of men farming and women weaving since ancient times. This article will explain that China&#39;s three great inventions (referring to printing, gunpowder, magnets) or four great inventions (the first three plus papermaking) have certain logic in themselves. His opinion is: 1. The discovery of the use of silk The invention of techniques for breeding silkworms to produce silk and bleaching wadding; 2. Papermaking originated from the imitation of &quot;natural paper&quot; appearing in bleached wadding; 3. Block printing originated from the combination of &quot;printable paper&quot; and &quot;plate lettering&quot;; 4. Movable type printing technology was conceived due to the &quot;phenomenon of discarding undamaged carved boards&quot;. Although this does not include all the four great inventions, it well explains the intrinsic reason why only China can pioneer the invention of papermaking and printing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73966&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70757&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/9bc7149361.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204162745.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1504&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9bc7149361.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260818&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;&quot;Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot;, Zhejiang People&#39;s Publishing House, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Standing between tradition and modernity, showing the path for future generations to learn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Weng Tongwen as the representative Make a brief summary of the academic achievements and characteristics of the older generation of scholars. Mr. Weng Tongwen is a generation of scholars born in the early Republic of China, and his research path continued until the end of the twentieth century. When he was born, the Qing Dynasty was already dead, but he was proficient in the four classics, based on the Classics, and enriched with poetry. He took notes because of his gains in reading, and concentrated on writing papers based on his experiences. This is a traditional academic method. There are still lingering thoughts. However, the trend since the early Republic of China has strongly advocated using Western learning to explore the path of national salvation and development, and has also led humanities scholars to strive to accept Western academic approaches and explore various new academic topics related to life and society that the sages often ignored. Mr. Weng Tongwen was initially educated at Southwest Associated University, Yunnan University and St. John&#39;s University. He studied and worked in Britain, France, Germany, the United States, New Zealand and other countries, and finally served in universities in Taiwan. His scholarship is rooted in tradition, and his vision and methods are deeply influenced by Western learning. He highly integrates documents and cultural relics, fully integrates society and life, and pays special attention to the lower society, special skills, and basic classics. As mentioned above in this article, there are less than a hundred articles in the &quot;Sikubiaoyao Supplement&quot;. The long ones are more than a thousand words, and the short ones are only a hundred words. However, what they say must contain new insights and maintain a high spirit. It is a reference to the sayings of many famous writers in modern times. , all with outspoken comments. Articles on the history of life, science and technology, and publishing history can also exhaust the literature, refer to the sages of the times, analyze the subtle ideas, invent new insights, cite abundantly, be cautious in speaking, have clear opinions, and write well. Being peaceful can fully reflect everyone&#39;s style and can show the path for future generations to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[感冒发烧了，到底感染了啥？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261944]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 08:01:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/12/06/d8d9dbf252.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2860&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/ 06/d8d9dbf252.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260833&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五月天被质疑假唱]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261928]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 23:10:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Recently, Mayday was questioned for lip-synching at the concert.

At present, the Cultural Market Inspection Department has launched an investigation, which will scientifically evaluate and analyze the original video and audio of the &quot;Mayday&quot; Shanghai concert, and publish the investigation results. In recent years, lip-syncing has frequently appeared in concerts and commercial performances, causing public anger and dissatisfaction.</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[校长9年性侵22名女童，乡村小学里的罪恶为何难以发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261936]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73945&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70736&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/7a0ad81139.jpeg&quot; IMG-tital = &quot;WeChatimg3263.jpeg&quot; alt = &quot;November 2023, Pingliang City, Gansu Province Jingning County, the village where the primary school is located.

This is the destination -in the jurisdiction of Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, an electronic map failed to include a remote village with the right position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; From the distance, this village is almost on the yellow hillside, and the building of the red-top white wall is layered on the hillside. On November 16, 2023, the village was scarce. Snow melted, and an older couple worked in the field, intending to plant potatoes. The local proud Apple has been taken off and sold, and the village is about to enter the agricultural leisure period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 9 days ago, a person with a close relationship with the village was executed. His name is Zhang Longji, born in Jingning County in 1979, a university culture. According to the Pingliang Intermediate Court notice, from 2010 to June 2019, during the period of teaching director, principal and teacher in a elementary school degree in Jingning County, he made a spiritual control of elementary students who lack sexual defense ability through corporal punishment. Students have opportunities to assign homework and other opportunities to conduct adultery for young girls aged 8 to 12 in their dormitory. Children implement obscenity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Perhaps it is to protect the privacy of the victims. The southern weekend reporter learned that the incident elementary school was a village primary school in the aforementioned village and was withdrawn in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When the news that &quot;primary school principal rape 22 girls&quot; set off a stir on the Internet, the village in the eyes of the storm seemed extremely silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Village small in Dashan &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Especially in our village, don&#39;t ask these things.&quot; Hearing Zhang Longji&#39;s name, villager Zhang Bi Peng&#39;s tone became severe. On November 16, 2023, he stood at the entrance of the courtyard to drive the reporters in the southern weekend to drive out, &quot;it is all the sad past.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhang Bipeng&#39;s yard is only a few hundred meters from the original site of the incident. Only the couple lived in the family. His father Zhang Pinghe took care of his grandson in Jingning County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhang Pinghe is the old principal of the incident elementary school. He has taught in the village for more than forty years and has retired. On the social platform, he is named &quot;The Persistence in Dashan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Now, the empty waste school building is left at the northern end of the village. The door is locked from the outside and cannot enter. Compared with the picture appearing in the news ten years ago, the red roof of the elementary school bungalow still looks white. The outer wall has become white. It seems that in the last few years, it has been repaired, and the windows and doors are covered with seals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The yard next to the school is still open, there are only two old houses, one is piled up with the New Year&#39;s fire and lion dance props. Zhang Danchen&#39;s wooden table, with medals on the wall. Between the dead branches and weeds, there are two green basketball racks. A villager said this area is the school&#39;s playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The villager introduced that the primary school was withdrawn in 2019. Subsequently, the children in the village went to the town&#39;s central elementary school to study. It is the first boarding school in the town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Before the merger, this rural primary school was a model of Jingning County. Among more than a dozen schools in the countryside, the annual results can be ranked in the top three. There are not many people in the school. When the staff of the Education Bureau of Jingning County went to visit in 2015, there were only 29 students and 5 teachers in the school. Many students went to the towns or counties with the parents of the migrant workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 2015, Zhang Pinghe is still the principal, and there is still one or two years from retirement. Sun Chining was very impressed with the old principal. He said he did not know Zhang Longji and did not pay attention to the situation when he visited the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The old principal has been repeatedly commended. In public reports, he took the teacher to dig the Qingtu painting classroom, collect waste materials to make a simple table bench at the forest farm, and dig into the school building in the heavy rain. Some netizens stated in the comment area that in the memory, even the old principal&#39;s wife pulled a cart and worked in school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A Pingliang photographer once filmed micro-movies for him when the old principal was approaching. He said that he was shot to &quot;evaluate the award&quot; at that time. At the end of the film, the words &quot;produced by the Education Bureau of Jingning County&quot; appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the same period, Zhou Lan, a student who lives in a nearby village, came to this primary school to study. The school&#39;s fame is one of the reasons why parents choose schools, but more importantly, this is almost his &quot;only solution&quot; in traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The peripherals are inconvenient and there is no public transport. Students used to measure the distance from walking back to walk, and they could get in 30 minutes, even if they were &quot;very close.&quot; The map shows that Zhou Lan&#39;s central elementary school in the town takes about 7 kilometers, and it takes an hour and a half. At that time, &quot;there was a age requirement for living there, and fifth or fourth grade&quot;, so Zhou Lan could only study in this village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The grandson of the old principal did not study in this village, but was sent to the county seat, and now he is studying in high school. Zhang Bipeng explained that &quot;county conditions are good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The number of teachers and students in rural primary schools is constantly decreasing. At the highest peak, there were more than 200 people in this school. In the years before Zhou Lan, there were more than a hundred people in the school. In the report of the school&#39;s evaluation and acceptance self -inspection report that Zhang Ping and the school filled in in 2016, there were only 21 students and 4 faculty members in the school, and 4 teaching classes were divided into 4 teaching classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The report introduced that the primary school was founded in 1957, expanded into standardized elementary school at the original site in 2002, and changed to six years of full primary school in 2003. In the report, the old principal wrote such a paragraph: the school carefully organized teachers and students to study and educate laws and regulations, teachers&#39; laws, and the protection of the rights and interests of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhang Longji is a member of the above-mentioned teacher team. A relevant roster in Jingning County in 2014 showed that Zhang Longji was the 12th level of professional and technical and primary school -level teachers at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 2017, Zhang Longji took over as the small principal of the village. Teachers at rural schools are responsible for the mobilization of the local education bureau. According to the principal of a rural elementary school in Gansu, the principal&#39;s position must be competent through layers of selection, including examinations and back adjustments. &quot;Each unit must pass it again. For example , Especially strict. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to the court&#39;s notice, Zhang Longji had criminal acts for several years. Why did Zhang Longji do not attract attention during the period? As of press time, Zhang Pinghe did not reply to the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Jingning County Education Bureau said that the details involve the protection of minors, so it is not possible to disclose. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &quot;I don&#39;t understand at that time, when the jokes look&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Lan was studying in this village. Inspired students in the classroom, but there is no way to be conscious, because &quot;he is the principal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the school withdrew and the school building was locked, Zhou Lan had secretly turned over the wall and several male classmates. He said that Zhang Longji had two dormitories at school, one of which belonged to his daughter -in -law. The couple have two daughters and one man, and the three babies sometimes come to the dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Lan said that he and his classmates tear off the sealing sticks on the door of the dormitory and hold a &quot;special ritual&quot; in it. According to the video from Zhou Lan, they stood a photo on the low table. Three small tray were put in front of the photo, put on chocolate school, and burned paper on the side. Before Zhang Longji executed the death penalty, this &quot;ritual&quot; containing the meaning of commemoration was a retaliation. They have been held three times in total, the last time in October 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Lan&#39;s heart remembers this teacher. He said that Zhang Longji&#39;s assault against the students was punished, and he started very hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; They are the last batch of students brought by Zhang Longji, and they are now in junior high school. Zhou Lan recalled that before the incident in 2019, there were only three girls in the school, and some were transferred before. Zhang Longji will obtain a girl in front of him. When correction of homework in the class, the girl will also call the girl to the podium and obscene in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He also listened to the girl in the school that Zhang Longji would call them into the dormitory. When school at night, Zhang Longji will use excuses such as &quot;the homework is not finished&quot; to prevent female students from returning home and stay until nine o&#39;clock in the evening. He said that he was still young at the time, and he didn&#39;t have much concept to Zhang Longji. He just felt strange and did not tell his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Lan only saw the tip of the iceberg. The southern weekend reporter learned that the situation of being obscene by Zhang Longji was likely to be mentioned as mentioned in the court notice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; From 2004 to 2005, Lulu studied in the first grade in the town in the town. At that time, Zhang Longji, about 25 years old, was his math teacher. She recalled to the reporter from the south weekend that the school was a bungalow at that time, and it was cold in winter. In the mathematics class, Zhang Longji will call the female students on the podium in the name of the thirty or forty students in the class in the name of the whole class, and hold it in her arms, &quot;doing some very close moves.&quot; She said that several girls in the class were held by herself, &quot;he will pick some little girls who look better.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lulu himself is also a victim. Zhang Longji hugged her in her arms and was angry at her, &quot;I think it&#39;s particularly strange, I just hide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; By 2009, Professor Zhang Longji&#39;s subjects changed from mathematics to English. That year, the male student Zhang Lei read the third grade. During the class, Zhang Longji held the girl in the class in his arms to teach his words, touched his face, and had intimacy. He saw that the female classmate was sitting on Zhang Longji&#39;s legs, disgusted with her face, forcing the majesty of the teacher, and she dared not resist big. She could only twist her body and avoid her physical contact, but it did not have much effect. &quot;I didn&#39;t understand it at that time, I just watched it as a joke.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the same year, a class, Lin Ling in the fifth grade said lying in the class When sleeping on the table, there were a lot of students in the classroom, and Zhang Longji suddenly hugged her from behind. Lin Ling was frightened and said, &quot;You hurriedly let me go&quot;, he let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the description of the students in the past, Zhang Longji&#39;s obscenity behavior died for a long time, and students in different grades had been harmed. &quot;He should have been molested by the girl from the time when I just joined the work ... My last session, my session, my next session, including my sister, I know.&quot; In November 2023 Lin Ling told the Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lin Ling said, the female students dare not get along with Zhang Longji, afraid of being hugged by him. That&#39;s it again. &quot; &quot;But we didn&#39;t realize that he was illegal at that time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;h4>; The neglected help &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhang Longji&#39;s earliest obscene female students I tried to save myself. At that time, Lulu, 7, told his mother that his mother did not take it seriously, only thinking that it was the elder&#39;s love for children. &quot;She said, your mathematics teacher sees you very good, distressed you.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When opening the parent meeting, Zhang Longji will face Lulu&#39;s mother The praise her said that the little girl was &quot;smart or obedient.&quot; Lulu analyzed that this strengthened her mother&#39;s judgment and made her mother feel that the young mathematics teacher was responsible and appreciated her daughter without alertness. Looking back, Lulu felt that rural parents &quot;lack of consciousness in this regard.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lin Ling agrees with this analysis. She euphemistically said that the adults in the village are relatively simple, traditional and conservative. At that time, Lin Ling, a 12 -year -old, told her mother that a teacher in the school always hugged a female classmate and hugged herself during class, but the answer was unexpected. &quot;My mother said it was my dishonesty.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Talk about the memories of asking for help from parents in the fifth grade, the adult Lin Ling hesitated for a few seconds for a few seconds ,Sighed. &quot;Maybe he stands well, and adults don&#39;t believe it.&quot; She told her mother two or three times. Seeing that her mother reacted like this, she stopped mentioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In front of children and adults, Zhang Longji has two different faces. In the face of students, he sometimes hugs himself, sometimes violent and corporal punishment. But in the face of adults, in Lulu&#39;s statement, he was very responsible, &quot;it is quite invisible.&quot; His WeChat avatar is a photo of Zhang Hong&#39;s background, the face of the Chinese character, a single eyelid, a wide nose, a smile, wearing a black suit, a red dot tie, and his hair is meticulous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The folks have a good impression of him where Zhang Longji grows. Compared with the remote coaching village, the Xiaohe Village of Gangou Town, where Zhang Longji is located, is closer to Jingning County, and has convenient transportation. In the eyes of the villagers, Zhang Longji is one of the few &quot;high students&quot; who read the university. High education and decent work. &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A villager said that Zhang Longji and two sisters were college students. After graduation, they made money. The county town bought a building. Zhang Longji&#39;s wife is a teacher. &quot;His wife is teaching, and he looks good (dialect, refers to thin), and the conditions at home are good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Now the house of the Zhang family is vacant, the iron door is rust and the bricks are piled up in the inner courtyard. The red paper posted on the porch has faded. The yellow leaves floating from the branches are scattered in the courtyard. The above -mentioned villagers said that Zhang Longji was poor when he was young. The shoes that his mother wore was made of rags. Without the upper, the father sold rapeseed rapeseed and cultivated three college students. He never thought he would go wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73929&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70720&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/23 /12/05/b9dc7b55d7.jpeg &quot;Img-Title =&quot; WeChatimg3262.jpeg &quot;Alt =&quot; Xiaosi Village, Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, the old house of Zhang Longji. &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;810&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/b9dc7b55d7.jpeg&quot; data- key = &quot;260820&quot; style = &quot;&quot; &lt;&quot;>; /p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; Xiaohe Village, Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, the old house of Zhang Longji&#39;s family. Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The villagers saw Zhang Longji in 2019 for the last time. Some villagers remembered that in April of that year, there was an elderly man in the village died, and Zhang Longji returned to the village to &quot;lift the people&quot;. At that time, he was &quot;good&quot; at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; More than a month later, Zhang Longji was taken away by the police in the Dragon Boat Festival because of a victim&#39;s family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhang Longji still has relatives to run supermarkets in Xiaohe Village. He said that Zhang Longji rarely returned to the village after settlement in the county, and there were not many exchanges between the two sides. &quot;After the old man (Zhang Longji&#39;s parents), he couldn&#39;t come back for a year or two, and he hurriedly took a look when he came back. We did not chat.&quot; >; He refused to remember when Zhang Longji&#39;s obscene students were known. &quot;These things have come out. Now I know that there are such people here. We ca n’t say some things, we ca n’t say or want to say.” &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = “text-align: left;”>; A 64 -year -old villager still impressed Zhang Longji and believed that he was serious and his act was &quot;stable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He may have never seen Zhang Longji&#39;s fierce side. In the students&#39; narration, boys and girls have been beaten by Zhang Longji, and iron rods, steel bars, and mops are all &quot;weapons&quot;. A boy recalled that when he was 9 years old, he was beaten &quot;I can&#39;t sit for a month, and the buttocks are black.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Violence makes help more difficult. Lin Ling remembered that when he was in the first grade, Zhang Longji kicked a boy from the podium to the end of the classroom. &quot;No one dares to resist, it is really dare not. Because he is fierce, we dare not say anything.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; In the past injury, &quot;I haven&#39;t mentioned it again&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt; P Syle = &quot;Text-Align: left;&quot;>; Lin Ling&#39;s most difficult to release is to watch his friend hurt by Zhang Longji. One day in the fourth and fifth grade, when the extra -curricular activity time, she went to Zhang Longji dormitory to hand in the homework. Zhang Gang came back after playing, barely in the dormitory, and only wearing shorts. &quot;When we handed in homework, he hugged my classmate, and suddenly kissed there, scared me, I ran away quickly.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left; &quot;>; At that time, there were no other teachers around. Lin Ling ran out and told another classmate that the two comforted each other and said, &quot;It should be okay.&quot; After about 10 minutes, the classmates who were hugged came out of the Zhang Longji dormitory. Lin Ling asked her about her situation, and the answer she got was &quot;okay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I am worried about my classmate, but at that time we were young and dare not say.&quot; Lin Ling recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; That memory became her childhood shadow. She always remembers that the hugged female classmates are trying to resist and try to break away, but she is just a elementary school student, with a small figure and a small strength. Zhang Longji has been holding hands and kissing her mouth. When Lin Ling grew up, he realized that &quot;we have to go to his independent dormitory every time we do something.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Things are buried in the hearts of two girls. &quot;I know (that&#39;s right), my classmate hurts a lot, but I have never dared to ask her when the accident. She has been married now, and this matter has never been mentioned.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p Style = &quot;Text-Align: Left;&quot;>; In the past two decades, most of the victims licked their pain silently. After the &quot;Primary School President&#39;s 9 -year Rape 22 Girls&quot; has attracted attention, some people worry about the social platform: what to do after the injured children, they are still long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Girl Protection&quot; sponsor Sun Xuemei told the southern weekend that after sexual assault, the child&#39;s psychology will change, even for a long time, even a long-term ones Poor, hopes that with the help of the local women&#39;s federation and other departments, children can get timely psychological intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; She deliberately reminds parents not to scold and blame her children. &quot;This is not the child&#39;s fault. To make the child feel that the family is safe, parents can accept and rely on. If such things happen, parents are scolding and blame, and push their children to a more helpless situation. . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>;&quot; Girl Protection &quot;project team has visited a number of rural schools across the country to conduct preventive sexual assault courses. Sun Xuemei found that the common problem currently exists is the lack of sexual education, and many people talk about sexual changes. However, it can be seen from the gradual increase in reporting rates that people&#39;s awareness is increasing. &quot;Only by improving consciousness and attaching importance to this issue, (problems) are exposed to more and more, will it solve faster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The end of Zhang Longji&#39;s criminal behavior was due to the alarm of the victim&#39;s family&#39;s family in June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Lan recalled that at noon on the day of the incident, Zhang Longji drove to school. Disappearing together, there was a female classmate in the school. &quot;After class, (I) saw that the girl was not there, and told other teachers. I knew that the next day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He heard the girl&#39;s sister said that the girl was struggling at the time and was beaten by Zhang Longji with heavy objects, and was seriously injured. Girls were taken to Jingning County Hospital, but the injuries were serious and sent to Lanzhou for medical treatment. Zhang Longji was later taken away by the police in Lanzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In November 2019, Yu Tong, 30, met Zhang Longji in the detention center. The two were in the same supervisor for three months. In 2023, he provided his release certificate to reporters in the South Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the prison, Zhang Longji wore red vests and handcuffed feet. Yu Tong said that &quot;prison friends&quot; know that he was suspected of rape and sin of children. During that period, Zhang Longji was often bullied by the same supervisor and had to be transferred from one monitor to another. Another &quot;prison friend&quot; Zhao Wuping also confirmed that &quot;there is no kind of bullying in it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhao Wuping entered the detention center in July 2019 due to drunk driving, &quot;headache&quot; for his own situation, and was unwilling to chat with others. But he remembered that Zhang Longji&#39;s state was &quot;still&quot; at the time, and said, &quot;I will come out for more than ten years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The severity of things is obviously exceeded Zhang Longji&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that Zhang Longji was crime of rape, sentenced to death, and deprived of political rights for life. ,Decided to implement the death penalty, deprivation of political rights for life. Zhang Longji had appealed and was rejected by the Gansu Provincial High Court, maintained the original sentence of the death penalty, and approved by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 7, 2023, the Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court followed the execution of the death penalty order issued by the President of the Supreme People&#39;s Court to test the positive body of Zhang Longji and go to the execution ground.

The article states that the student threatened the whole class during the test paper during the test period. She cried and made the teacher&#39;s thighs, and gave the teacher kneeling and praying that the test results should not tell their parents. After being rejected, they threatened to abuse the teacher. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Parents are collectively protested and picked up their children in advance to start strikes. On November 29, the local education bureau issued a notice saying that the primary school was transferred to the parents of the students in the class, and the parents of the students were resolved in the class. Changtu County Education Bureau and Experimental Primary School ... After research and decision, the transfer plan was canceled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What do you think of this incident? First of all, it is necessary to discuss the nature of the student&#39;s problem. If the above -mentioned parents are true, then the life threatens the whole class for a while, and pray for the teacher for a while, and then threatens to abuse the teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the position of the 8th parents of the 8th class is not difficult to understand: the original class order and discipline are good. Suddenly a &quot;troublemaker&quot; and &quot;irritation of the wrong&quot;, so that other children can not be peaceful, affect learning No one will welcome progress, tension, or even disturbing children&#39;s mood. If you can&#39;t get it out of the door before you come, please go after you come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because a student in a class has a behavioral problem or character problem, interfere with the order order or bullying other students; As a result, other parents were unbearable, and they &quot;strikes&quot;, went to the Education Bureau to petition, and went online to control complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, the fifth grade parents of Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School sent an open letter online that the classmates of the surname W were a child who was too protected by the parents and had a dispute with teachers and classmates in the school. Impact schools, impacting classrooms have repeatedly threatened, scolded related children, parents, and even teachers in extreme ways. For this reason, parents were angry. The school issued a notice that &quot;the incident of multiple students who had not taken off in the school in the 505 class of our school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Secondly, the school and the local education bureau&#39;s handling of such incidents is nothing more than trying to reconcile and persuade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Changtu County Experimental Primary School abandoned the transfer plan, saying that &quot;it will further optimize educational resources, reasonably allocate teachers, and teach students to teach students.&quot; The implication of the problem, the students of the problem continue to stay in Class 11, but it seems that the more resistant and more ways to resist. &quot;At present, students have returned to school fully.&quot; The problem is temporarily resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The strike of the Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School was established at that time, a joint class composed of the District Education Bureau and the District Public Security Branch, and then a parent interview, &quot;seriously listening to the situation and appeal of the parents&#39; situation&quot;, &quot;The two sides actively communicate, eliminate differences, and discuss the consensus before discussing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Why are similar treatment methods so common? This is because the current compulsory education law stipulates that students who violate the school management system shall criticize and educate them and not be expelled (Article 27). Under such constraints, a &quot;problem child&quot; that many parents think of unbearable can only be tolerated at the beginning of a class. Let the &quot;problem child&quot; transfer to school; if you can&#39;t get rid of it, parents with the door will consider transferring to their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, some people say on the Internet, and the volume is not small: let the &quot;problem child&quot; be transferred to a specialized school to accept correction? This question is simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Indeed, Article 6 of the Minor Crime Law stipulates that the state has strengthened the construction of specialized schools and specially educated minors with serious bad behaviors. So, how about serious bad behavior? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The bad behavior defined by the law refers to &quot;acts that are not conducive to their healthy growth&quot; by minors, such as multiple absenteeism and escape; Gangs participating in the implementation of bad behaviors and so on. Obviously, if bad behavior is just harmful to yourself, many of the key behaviors are negative, which will endanger other children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Article 31 of the Law stipulates that the school should strengthen management and education for minor students with bad behaviors and not discriminate; if they refuse to correct correction or the circumstances are serious, the school can be punished according to the situation or adopts the following. Management and educational measures: training; requiring to obey specific behavioral specifications; requiring to participate in specific special education; requiring to participate in service activities in school; psychological counseling and behavioral intervention of social workers or other professionals. But obviously does not include firing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called severe bad behavior refers to &quot;the criminal law implemented by minors, the behavior of not criminal punishment due to the dissatisfaction of the legal criminal responsibility age, and the serious harm of society&quot; , Intercept others, forced to use hard or arbitrarily damaged, occupying public and private property, etc., and other provocations; beating, abused, intimidating, or intentionally hurting others&#39; bodies. So can you be sent to a special school immediately with such behavior? Neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Article 41 of the Law stipulates that for minors with serious bad behaviors, the public security organs can take the following correction education measures according to the specific situation: to teach; order to apologize and compensate for losses; ; Order to report regularly; order to obey specific behavioral specifications, shall not implement specific behaviors, contact specific personnel, or enter specific places; order psychological counseling, behavior correction; or order to participate in social service activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Minors implement serious harm of social behavior, harsh circumstances or serious consequences, or have repeatedly implemented a serious harmful social behavior, or refuse to accept or cooperate with the above 41 correction education measures, After the evaluation and approval of the Special Education Guidance Committee, the education administrative department and the public security organs may decide to send it to specialized schools for special education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen that students just disrupt classroom discipline and bully other students, which is not a &quot;serious bad behavior&quot;. It is impossible to get fired. It is impossible to go to a specialized school. External nature makes other children, teachers, and parents suffering. In the above -mentioned framework, the problem is difficult to solve, and I am afraid it will happen from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[持有不超十天、覆盖数千只股票、年换手率百倍中国量化投资的股市“淘金术”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261894]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 21:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; In the second half of 2023, as the A shares fluctuate intensify, it approached 3000 points a few times, and &quot;quantitative transaction&quot; became the &quot;quantitative transaction&quot; became becoming a quantitative transaction. The focus of controversy in China&#39;s capital market. Focusing on whether the quantitative fund is &quot;the tool of cutting leeks and the vampire of the stock market&quot;, the market has set off a round of discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The low -key head quantification fund has continued to reveal news. At the end of August, according to a number of media reports such as the Securities Times and the brokerage company China, Qiu Huiming, the founder of Minghong Investment, won the Shanghai &quot;First House&quot; for 285 million yuan. At the end of October, the news of other head -of -the -art founders was widely spread in the asset management circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The chairman of a private equity institution said to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;The biggest problem of the quantitative fund is that no one has disclosed specific operations to the outside world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; mysterious quantitative investment How is it operating? Why does quantitative investment become the target of criticism when the stock market is sluggish? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Southern Weekend reporters recently interviewed a large number of domestic quantitative investors. Interestingly, they are eager to explain to the outside world what they are quantified, but they want to hide behind the scenes- &quot;Low -key, we must be low -key.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Believers of Simmons &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2010, American high -speed network supplier SPREAD Networks cost $ 300 million to build a grown between Chicago and New York and New York The most direct optical cable of 1330 kilometers is to shorten the time for high -frequency traders to obtain information by 0.003 seconds. Michael Lewis tells this true story in the book &quot;High -frequency trader: Wall Street Speed ​​Game&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Just this year, China ’s Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 stock index futures were officially launched, providing hedge tools for domestic quantitative investment. Many Chinese returned to China from Wall Street to start a business. In 2010, it was recognized as the first year of Chinese quantification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since the development, the data provided by a head quantitative private equity executive to the southern weekend is: domestic funds plus Shanghai -Hong Kong Stock Connect, QFII and other overseas funds. The ratio ratio is 25%-30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Father of Quantitative Investment&quot; James Simmons is the spiritual mentor of these practitioners. Most of the interviewees mentioned the book &quot;Conquer the Market&quot;. This book records the story of how Simmons successfully converts mathematical algorithms and computer transaction software into &quot;stock market gold rush&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The book mentioned that the origin of quantitative investment dates back to the late 1980s. Prior to this, no one believed that computers could invest like humans, but quantitative investors behind Simmons believed that &quot;there must be a way to model price.&quot; They do not think that the market is &quot;randomly walking&quot; unpredictable. Although there is a certain randomness, if it is distributed with a certain probability, it can predict the future price trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the believers in James Simmons, more Chinese are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. A high -frequency trader who returned to China in 2015 can&#39;t understand why there are so many Chinese people who do quantitatively in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Chinese account for at least one -third of the proportion. They are spreading all over the New York Stock Exchange and various institutions of Nasdaq, either IT or data models.&quot; He told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Sam, the founder of a domestic head quantified agency, believes that this is well understood, &quot;Chinese people are not outstanding in other aspects. Investment banks are also good, but do you know people?&quot; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; After graduating from Dr. SAM, he became a high -frequency trader on Wall Street. He tried a procedural transaction in the domestic market around 2006. &quot;But at that time, the domestic market data took 15 seconds to me, and the order was 15 seconds to the exchange. &quot;. SAM told reporters from the Southern Weekend that it should not exceed 3 seconds back and forth, and delay will bring price changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2013, the new &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Securities Investment Fund Law&quot; was officially implemented. Private equity was allowed to record and open an account. You can issue autonomous products without the need to use the securities firm channel. This year SAM returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When returning to China, the speed can reach within 1 second, and now the Shenzhen Exchange can achieve a few milliseconds. However, in the US market, everyone is pursuing microseconds (one millisecond is equal to 1000 microseconds). &quot;He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, some senior people of some overseas -top quantitative institutions began to return to China to start a business, including Ren Sihong of Jinyu Assets, Wang Chen invested by Jiu Kun, Xu Xiaobo, who invested in Ruitian, Qiu Huiming invested by Mingzheng, and Yin Yin, Yin Yin, Yin Yin Xu Shunan and others of Nuo assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2014, Cai Meijie, deputy president of CICC Sales and Exchange Department, founded the establishment of Lingjun Investment; in 2015, the three Zhejiang University Computer Department, including Xu Jin, shifted from the IT field to a versatile investment, and created a fantasy party to create a fantasy party Quantify. Fantasy Fang, Ming Hong, Jiukun, and Ling are all called the &quot;Four Great Kings&quot;, and each asset management scale exceeds 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2015, China ’s quantitative private equity is mainly hedge products. In the second half of 2015, the stock index futures were limited, and the overall scale of private equity in three years did not increase and fall. In 2021, quantitatively entered a period of rapid development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;2021 is the most lively year. The industry scale is basically doubled. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个阶段，明汯投资、幻方投资曾一度将管理规模扩张至千亿水平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“人才在哪里&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;，&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;我们在哪里”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;围绕着中关村、五道口一带，中国量化“四大天王”幻方、九坤、灵均、明泓等均设有办公地点。他们紧挨着清华科技园、中关村创业大街等地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样选址是因为“人才在哪里，我们在哪里”。这些公司集结了全世界名牌大学的高材生，包括斯坦福、剑桥、麻省理工。在一家机构的宣传墙上，清北浙大排在了最后三位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“头部量化公司里，有非常多来自姚班的人。”一位从业者对南方周末记者说。曾有量化投资机构招人时，提出“非清华姚班、奥赛奖牌得主不取”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2005年，世界著名计算机科学家、世界现代密码学基础奠基人姚期智创办了清华学堂计算机科学实验班，这个班被简称为“姚班”。有种说法是，“中国的英才在清华，清华的英才在姚班”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;姚班创立的初衷，是筛选和培养全世界最为顶级的计算机天才。一位清华大学毕业生对此形容，“这是全国第一的计算机系里，精挑细选的最掐尖的那部分人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些年轻人大多为90后，男女都有。他们在办公室里敲打着键盘，办公桌上均摆放着四块硕大的电脑屏幕。一眼望去，是一行行的代码数据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;传统主观基金一般的分工是，分析师提供情报，基金经理做决策，交易员按基金经理的指示具体去执行下单交易。 “量化基金已经没有操盘手或交易员的概念，而是被称为策略开发师、量化工程师。”思源量化创始人王雄对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;设定模型的人，是量化公司的核心人士。模型由人+算力组合而成。量化交易策略的开发，涉及数学模型、统计分析、机器学习等技术。工程师们会编写和测试代码，使用历史数据进行回测，以评估策略的潜在表现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，他们一天的工作内容可以总结为三个字“写代码”，“更像一个码农”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月，头部量化公司幻方量化与锐天投资对簿公堂，原因系锐天投资一位策略人员带走团队并入职幻方，由于该策略人员长期高度接触量化投资中的核心商业秘密——量化交易策略代码，锐天投资认为对方涉嫌商业秘密侵害和不正当竞争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了人才的争夺，量化基金之间还要进行算力的比拼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“中国持有高性能GPU最多的机构，不是人工智能公司，而是量化投资公司，幻方是第一。”一位国内GPU代理商对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;普通人熟悉的CPU是负责读取原始数据，将数据暂时存在内存中，GPU则是对数据进行计算、训练模型得到模型的参数，并进行推理和预测，不用依靠人脑的经验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位IT行业人士对南方周末记者表示：“CPU也就几十个物理core，GPU则拥有上万个CUDA core。”Core可以理解为运算核心，使用GPU训练一个大模型大概按月计，相对应地，如果用传统CPU大概要按年计，训练效率相差巨大，同时推理效率差距也在百倍以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;英伟达A100显卡就是一款专业级的GPU，算力十分强大，可达到19.5 TFLOPS(浮点运算每秒19.5万亿次)。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年，幻方量化成立了AI公司，搭载了1100块GPU。 2021年，幻方拥有的英伟达A100显卡，已经达到上万张。上述IT人士对这个数字感到震惊，这已经突破了国内某些互联网大厂的储备。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam解释，2016年开始，量化投资以中低频的Alpha加T+0（日内回转交易）为主要风格，2018年以后，则是全周期模型及深度学习模型。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“假设做深度学习模型的话，研究员需要不停地试，试不同的参数、结构、特征。一个研究员能配到几十张卡。当然你也可以把几百张卡都占掉，但一个人应该很难同时想到那么多idea。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于一个研究员可以配置到几十张卡，上述IT行业人士认为这是在吹牛。同为清华毕业，他在大厂进行模型量化，配置是一个人一张卡。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;覆盖近&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;2000&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;只股票&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;很少有人知道，量化投资是如何赚钱的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位购买了幻方量化产品的个人投资者，对量化巨头的风流故事了如指掌。但对于量化投资，她对南方周末记者坦言：“我不懂”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一位基金管理规模接近50亿元的私募基金董事长，将自己家庭资产很多投入到头部量化公司。他对量化的理解是，根据游资、散户的行为模式进行市场屠杀，并且量化本身的自营策略和交易均优先于资管。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前海开源基金首席经济学家杨德龙则用“遛狗理论”向南方周末记者解释。 “价值投资更多是关注人（基本面）行走的路线，但量化主要是通过发现狗（股价）的运动规律，来做超额收益。”杨德龙说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;量化交易，海外称为“Quantitative Trading”或“Quantitative Investment”，Quantitative（量化的）与discretionary（自由决定的）相对应。后者指依靠个人对一件事的判断与理解，决策流程依赖于个人判断，并拥有较大的自由度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“量化是以数据为基础、以数学模型（统计模型）为核心的投资方式，它完全基于数据说话。我们把它称为定量，主观投资则是比较定性。”Sam对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在他看来，无论是个人投资者还是机构投资者，每个人都有行为惯性，但思维方式不一定完全理性，在这个过程中就会犯错。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他把量化分成两部分，基本面的量化分析与主观很像，看盈利增长、现金流等公开数据。但另一部分，量化会去抓住市场的错误交易，即偏离了量化模型制定的合理价格的交易。 “抓到错误交易后，低于合理价格我们就买，高于合理价格就卖。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以茅台为例，主观投资可能判断股票会涨，但量化会明确地有一个预测：“我们会说，这只股票未来10天会跑赢市场1%，误差±5%，这完全是一个统计概念。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“量化依赖于各种数据（价量数据为主），公司股价呈现出一定规律的分布，这个合理价格指一个区间。”一位量化从业者对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨德龙认为，量化与价值投资有本质上的不同，“量化更多是靠股价波动来赚钱，所以被称为割韭菜。他们走的是短线，都按天算，而价值投资一般持有都是好几年”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;量化从业者也并不避讳，国内主流量化私募多以统计套利为核心策略，预测周期从日内到几天不等，一般不超过10天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;量化选股票没有标准和特性，不设置行业和领域，他们并不关注企业是否有新产品，也不关注董秘又说了什么。当个股股价根据模型计算属于“超买”，量化就会直接程序触动卖出股票，中间没有任何的人为情绪和主观判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位头部量化从业人员对南方周末记者表示，一个成熟的规模化量化公司，会对市场上5000多只股票进行全市场扫描，只要有机会就去做，流动性好可以做，流动性不好也能做，区别在于挣钱的多与少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们的底仓目前已经覆盖A股近2000只股票。”Sam对南方周末记者表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与之相比，股票主观多头持股50只已经算是很多。这带来了换手率的巨大差异，一位券商人士对南方周末记者表示：“权益类公募基金换手率一般是3-5倍，最多10倍左右，这已经比较活跃了。”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;量化从业者向南方周末记者提供的数据是，目前绝大部分量化私募的主流产品，换手率一般在50-100倍，另外有极小规模的小众策略换手200倍above.股票量化策略的年换手率约为100倍，相当于5天左右的平均持仓周期。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam在2013年决定回国创业，其中一个重要原因是,“当时国内个人投资者占比能达到90%，整个市场太投机了。我把美国的模型拿回来，美国的Alpha大概可以做到6%，但当时国内市场能做到近40%。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alpha和beta是诺贝尔奖得主威廉·夏普1964年提出的风险量化指标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;量化公司依靠的是几千个Alpha去寻找市场上的各种规律。南方周末记者在十一月中旬走访了国内多家头部量化公司，在他们的办公区内，Alpha的“a”被做成图标放在最醒目的位置。 Alpha和Beta也是从业者口中频繁出现的词汇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨磊是上海的一位90后私募量化主管。他对南方周末记者举例，如果是追求Alpha的策略，假设大盘（以wind全A指数为例）一年涨了10%，某策略涨了12%，那某策略相对于大盘的Alpha（超额收益）就是2%。如果策略能保持这个超额水平，第二年大盘跌10%，策略会只跌8%，还是有2%的超额收益。追求Alpha是指追求长期能够跑赢大盘。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果是追求Beta，就是一种倍数的概念，比如大盘今年涨了10%，某策略涨了1.5*10%=15%，但是如果大盘第二年跌10%，它也会跌1.5*10%=15%。等于策略放大了大盘的波动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;量化投资究竟能不能跑赢市场？私募排排网显示，截至2023年三季度末，有业绩更新的537家量化私募平均收益为3.36%，取得正收益的占比超过七成。百亿量化私募收益率均值为5.75%，正收益公司占比超九成。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Sam对南方周末记者表示：“量化在中短期的合理定价能力上比主观强，但在中长期的合理定价上不如优秀的主观基金经理。”主观的优势在于对个股的深度分析，这一点量化目前达不到。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;即便是詹姆斯·西蒙斯创立的文艺复兴科技公司，在多年高速增长之后，旗下三只基金也在2020年表现惨淡。据券商中国2021年2月援引彭博报道，文艺复兴旗下三只对普通投资者开放的基金自2020年12月1日以来遭遇了至少50亿美元（约合322亿元人民币）的赎回。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;争议量化&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年8月27日，“减半征收印花税、阶段性收紧IPO和再融资节奏、规范股份减持行为、调降融资保证金比例”，一天内利好政策四箭齐发。但次日，A股开盘冲高5%后快速回落，收盘涨幅仅剩1%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谁是砸盘元凶？量化成为众矢之的。很多投资者认为，开盘大涨触发规模庞大的量化基金卖出，后者是行情波动的“最大空军”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一场口水仗在投资大佬们的朋友圈展开。反对量化的投资者将《量化基金，今天的砸盘主力军》一文刷至10万+，多位头部量化机构创始人则转载另一篇文章——《量化才是大A的脊梁》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月1日，证监会指导证券交易所出台加强程序化交易监管系列举措。其中，对“最高申报速率达到每秒300笔以上，或者单日最高申报笔数达到20000笔以上的交易行为”等予以重点监控。并对高频交易做出额外报告要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但多位受访的量化从业者表示：“每秒300笔和一天2万笔申报的标准对量化影响并不大。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;单日最高申报笔数达到20000笔，账户小但换手很高可以做到。但如果换手低规模大，这个数字同样可以。 Sam举例：比如某公募有个几十亿的账户，换手并不高，一天单边只有5%，双边只有10%，但一天交易量有5亿，平均一笔单子大概2万块钱，那也有2万多笔单子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“开盘如果看到交易机会，5000只股票都有机会，理论上我们可以实现一秒发5000个单子。但国内交易柜台支持不了，券商不可能只有你一个客户，目前最多是1000笔。”Sam对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;量化从业者们反复强调，程序化交易并不单指量化交易，程序化交易是指与“手动交易”对应的投资工具，采用程序自动化决策来执行操作，可同时交易成千上万种资产，而手动交易无法做到。除了量化、私募，公募基金、主观投资也会使用到程序化交易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年A股巨幅波动，伊世顿操纵期货市场案轰动一时。该公司就是以程序化交易软件自动批量下单、自买自卖、利用保证金杠杆比例等交易规则非法获利20多亿人民币，伊世顿平均下单速度为每0.03秒一笔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam表示，股指期货是特别适合做高频的品种，伊世顿当年就是秒级，到现在也没有太大的变化。但“炒期货的人到底少，并且他们赌性大，主流还是以股票量化为主”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;思源量化创始人王雄对南方周末记者表示：“就股票量化而言，A股交易不可能有国外所谓的极致追求速度的高频”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从交易机制来看，由于征收印花税，公认的高频交易在中国的股票市场基本不存在。 “因为挣不了钱，几秒的速度优势，挣的钱覆盖不了印花税。”Sam对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据他介绍，目前国内最短的持仓周期也要5分钟到20分钟，在海外都不能算作高频，最多只是日内交易，美国的高频基本几秒钟就要换一次仓，慢的也只有几分钟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam还记得自己在华尔街担任高频交易员时，通过不停换手，1000万美元的资金最多能建到两亿美元的仓位。 “在国内，我们的持仓平均在5天左右，这5天追求的不是如何尽快抢到这个单子，而是追求一个比较好的超额表现。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，交易所的撮合速度也不支持。 “以上交所为例，你发个单子过去，等回报基本上要30毫秒，在美国大家追求的都是1微秒，所以你30毫秒±1毫秒的波动，追求那1微秒是没有意义的。”Sam对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但他们其实也在尽量追求速度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位量化机构创始人对南方周末记者透露，对一些对交易速度有要求的交易者，国内交易所都有自己的服务器托管中心，如上交所外高桥上证通托管机房、深交所南方中心深圳通托管机房、上交所金桥托管机房。只有证券、期货公司可以向交易所租用托管机房机柜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高端程序化交易团队通常自购设备，或指定硬件配置，由证券、期货公司采购，经证券、期货公司同意，放到租用的机柜内进行交易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年前后，华宝证券推出了LTS系统，这是行业内第一家极速交易柜台系统，此后，多家券商开始“火拼极速交易”，面向的多为量化私募客户，但对客户有着资金量的门槛要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“极速交易柜台的资金门槛没有硬性规定，但我们一般宣传是高净值客户专享。每家门槛不一样，有的100万元，有的300万元。”一位券商人士对南方周末记者表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位私募机构从业者对南方周末记者说：“现在规模较大的量化基金，高频都是用于自营，以自营资金加杠杆来操作，业绩是资管的好几倍。”但自营的规模数据无法查询。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求：Sam、杨磊为化名）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出生3个月被拐，25年后找回：新技术助力“天下无拐”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近日，河北“亿万富翁”解克锋找回被拐卖25年的儿子解清帅的消息，在网络上广泛传播，引起极大关注，网友纷纷为解家终于骨肉团圆而高兴。而这背后，离不开科技力量的加持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据媒体报道，此次解家团圆，某科技公司研发的“跨年龄同亲缘人脸比对算法”功不可没。解清帅被拐时刚出生3个月，家人手里只有他3个月时的照片。 Twenty years later, using this baby&#39;s photo to find people is obviously &quot;impossible task.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让不可能成为可能的，是用有亲缘关系的人脸进行比对，寻找疑似对象。以寻找解清帅为例，就用了他亲生父母及长兄的照片与警方的人口数据库进行比对。这种比对当然是比较模糊的，可能出现多个结果，但也大大缩小了查找范围，方便警方再通过DNA检测等技术进行精确的比对。 In this comparison, he found Qing Shuai in the top five suspected objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;寻找拐卖儿童所用的“黑科技”，最为公众所熟悉的当是DNA比对技术。这一技术最早被警方用于重大刑事案件中确定犯罪嫌疑人。随着检验和比对成本下降，DNA技术的应用也越来越广泛，在打拐寻亲中也发挥着最终“一锤定音”确定亲缘关系的作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但DNA比对也有很大的局限性，就是要有双方的样本才能进行比对。寻亲父母自然都会主动向警方提交自己的血样，但要获得被拐孩子的样本却没那么容易。 DNA信息是个人最敏感的生物信息之一，在没有足够证据怀疑的情况下，警方也不能随意强制任何人提交其DNA样本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;警方打拐DNA数据库中孩子的数据，有不少是知道自己被拐卖的人主动向警方提交的，希望找到自己的亲生父母。另外一些数据则来自警方在打拐行动中解救的被拐卖人员。那些不知道自己是被拐卖，也没有被警方注意到的被拐卖者，其DNA信息就不会出现在打拐数据库中，也就不会被找到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，警方在全国设立了三千多个免费采血点，并广为宣传，就是希望能有更多人主动提供血样，提高打拐数据库的覆盖面。但能被纳入DNA数据库的人数总是有限的。之前，寻亲家庭们常用的办法是“人肉”搜索。他们追随任何一条可能的线索，常年奔波在全国各地寻亲，耗尽时间精力和钱财，然而效果却很不理想，真正能找回被拐孩子的寥寥无几。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人脸比对识别等高科技手段的应用，大大提高了寻亲效率。早在2019年，警方就开始用上了腾讯开发的跨年龄人脸识别技术，用一张被拐儿童3岁时的照片，成功找到被拐10年的一名儿童。但当时的技术还不够精准。据其父介绍，当时每次识别都会找出100份疑似的人员，警方一般会采前5位进行DNA复核，没有命中的几率很高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着计算机视觉和人工智能技术的进步，比对的准确率越来越高了。 You can even compare it with a photo of your children without using a photo of close relatives.因为每个人都在警方的数据库里留存了身份证照片，用照片进行识别，大大提高了打拐比对的范围，也就更容易找到被拐卖的孩子。 “跨年龄同亲缘人脸比对算法”在短短半年时间里，就帮助警方找回了4个被拐卖的孩子，其中至少3人被拐已超过20年，其能力可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;先进的技术用于打拐寻亲，为善身巨。当然，也得承认，如果被用于作恶，其破坏力也是巨大的。比如DNA亲子鉴定，就可能被用来假造亲子鉴定证明，将拐卖来的儿童作为自己的“亲生”子女到派出所落户。当然这属于造假，或许还可以说与科技关系不大。但无所不在的人脸识别，涉嫌大量的滥用，可能侵犯普通人的隐私权，AI换脸等技术也可能被用于犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之前互联网有句话叫“有照片有真相”。但是随着PS技术的发展，照片已经不能代表真相了。有人用换脸术将色情照片中的头像换人，拿去敲诈勒索。而随着视频换脸技术的精进，“有视频有真相”也不再是真理。现在的AI技术，可以让特朗普说一口地道的汉语，音色、口型都毫无破绽，假造其他视频自然也不在话下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术本身是中性的。每一项黑科技，都是一把双刃剑，可以为善，也可能被用于作恶。不仅技术本身可能被用于作恶，甚至假托先进技术，也可以作恶。高科技的跨年龄同亲缘人脸比对寻亲技术刚引起关注，网上就出现了“收费版寻亲App”的谣言。那些急切盼望能找到自己骨肉的寻亲家庭很容易上当，被骗取钱财。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;先进科技蕴藏着巨大的力量，如何使用，为善还是作恶，全在掌握技术的人一念之间。只有尽可能让技术掌握在“好人”的手中，有好的制度进行激励与防范，才能最大程度发挥科技的善用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但随着成本不断下降，这些新技术也必然会被越来越多人所获得，被滥用、恶用的可能性也会越来越大。如何尽可能避免先进技术被用于作恶，也是必须探讨的严肃问题。前段时间开发出ChatGPT的OpenAI公司的“宫斗戏”，一定程度上就与对AI技术的态度有关。可见这已不是杞人忧天的话题，而是迫在眉睫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[厦门警方通报2名老师涉嫌性侵大四女生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 19:39:47&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2023年12月4日晚，“厦门知名中学的多名教师在酒后侵犯女实习生网帖引发关注。&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;12月5日晚，厦门湖里警方通报称，犯罪嫌疑人因涉嫌强奸罪已被依法刑事拘留。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;坐就坐着呗！已经一个多钟头了，但总比鞋匠好，看着他一会儿拉开鞋底，一会儿合上鞋面，又钉又锤，也够辛苦的，所以，虽然定做的鞋子，跟我的脚型毫不相配，有点“南辕北辙”“水火不容”，双脚一塞进去，就像“削足适履”般痛苦不堪，但是听到他一迭声说“没关系的，哪里不舒服？我替你弄好，一定弄好”，再看到他一脸的热切与自信，一边又在塞满杂物的工作室里晃来晃去，找找鞋垫，弄弄鞋楦，动作倒是慢悠悠的，他不着急，我又怎能着急？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为闲坐无聊，唯有举目四眺，这是一座工厂大厦的楼上，一长排房间，一格又一格紧紧相连，面对着门外一溜灰色长廊，长廊上不见人影，唯有鞋店是开着门的。若非定做鞋子找上门来，相信我永远都不会来到这个远在新界的偏静地区。从我住所过来要打车，一来一回， 得花上好几百块钱，不过，为了一双毛病多多的脚丫，拇指外翻加扁平足加筋膜炎，多年来一直找不到舒适的鞋子，唯有期盼着自己变成Cinderella（灰姑娘）, 某一天忽然有双天造地设的鞋子横空出世，一套上脚，就能健步如飞或翩翩起舞了，如果这样，那就什么也不顾不管，立马不惜工本去努力追寻了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是远在多伦多的大哥为了替我分忧，特地从网上找来的讯息，说是香港有个隐世奇人，专门替脚型特殊的人定做鞋子，但凡疑难杂症，都可迎刃而解，这位奇人已经年纪不轻，行将退休了，因此要定鞋得赶紧，否则机会错失，就追悔莫及了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多年来，要买鞋，都得去日本寻寻觅觅，也许是日本人经常穿和服配人字拖，以致很多人脚型不妥；又也许是日本的民族性特别细心周到，反正，要找双过得去能穿上脚的鞋子，对我来说， 日本是唯一的来源地。因为疫情严峻的缘故，三四年不出门，在旧鞋已报销、新鞋未得手的情况下，一听到香港竟然有此做鞋奇才，岂非令人雀跃万分，非寻而访之不可？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一次上门去做鞋，还是六月中的事。好不容易根据网上资料找到了那位隐世高人，彼此居然很现代化地连上了WhatsApp，约好了某个星期六上午登门拜访的。叫了车，兜兜转转，长途跋涉，兴冲冲地依时抵达，走进了全然陌生的工厂大厦，跨进了肮脏残旧的电梯，轰隆隆冲上了高楼，好不容易找到了相应的门牌，怎么大门紧锁、乌灯黑火呢？赶紧打电话联络，过了好一会，对方终于接听了，“我在医院呀！手受伤了，在排队看医生啊！”啊！ Is this okay?做鞋能手伤了手？这岂非跟钢琴圣手患了腱鞘炎差不多？这事非同小可啊！ “啊呀！你好好保重啊！手最要紧，等你好了，我们再约，再约！”电话里，是我忙不迭在宽慰人家，不但没有责怪对方失约，好像还充满了歉意似的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过了一阵，再次相约。当年刘备三顾草庐，才邀得旷世奇才诸葛孔明出阵相助，这世界上，好事多磨，要成就一桩心愿，哪有这么容易？于是，扰扰攘攘，第二次踏上征途。这一回， 终于看到高人本尊了。老实说，本地有些传统的手工艺，已经日渐式微了，如手制雨伞、手雕麻雀、手绘陶瓷、手造雀笼等，那些做旗袍、精于刺绣或纸扎工艺的老师傅，也逐渐凋零了，因此，看到一位数十年锲而不舍、坚守传统岗位的手作人，竟感到特别亲切和尊重。师傅瘦瘦弱弱的，脸上挂着恳挚的笑容，说起话来滔滔不绝，就像个稔熟的街坊，他一开口就告诉你各种各类的故事，谁谁谁的脚型有多糟，可是一穿上他的鞋就解决问题了；谁谁谁去了欧洲移民，还得赶回来找他做鞋等等。说了半天，终于想起要做生意了，于是啪的一声，抽出一张A4白纸，叫来客脱了鞋袜，把双脚放在白纸上，让他用笔团团画了个纸样，然后在旁边写下顾客的姓名、电话， 这就完成登记手续了。当时暗忖，怎么这么简单？曾经去过多家制鞋专门店，要不断用计算机、仪器测量脚形，甚至要打模型，才能定制，那用高科技制作出来的成品，往往还不合理想呢！这老师傅土法炼钢的方式， 能行得通吗？然而一看到他胸有成竹的模样，满腔热诚的言谈， 我只好把心中的疑团压抑下去，“试试也无妨！也许，有奇迹出现呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“先付五百定金，鞋做好了，再付一千元！”有收据吗？他说没有，于是急忙如数奉上，心想对于老一派的工匠，一切靠信用，不是靠字据的。他又说，“一切都清清楚楚，有根有据，你不必担心的。”那鞋什么时候做好呢？ “我只有一双手，天天不停做，也得轮着来啊！起码一两个月啦， 你别催我。”“好好，不催不催。”看来他的确没有助理也没有徒弟，总得体谅一下人家的辛劳呀！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那天我顺手带上了两双日本鞋，还是以前在日本旅行时到处搜购而来的战利品，因为鞋头嫌窄，没有穿过，这次希望师傅能顺便替我把鞋头弄宽，那就功德无量了。 “没问题，容易得很！”他一口答应了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就如此，从六月等到十月，其间我问过两次，每次都告知仍然在排队中，终于，来到了十月底，鞋子居然做好了！于是择日前往，准备去接受成品了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有幻想，不抱希望，因此，当天一脚套进新鞋，一阵剧痛袭来，我居然没有失落，也没有怨怼，这是意料中事啊！师傅当然也没有失望，他很有把握地说：“都是这样的，刚穿上有点紧，替你弄弄，马上就弄好的。”于是，他开始忙进忙出了。 And me?好整以暇地坐在走廊上，望着对面不远处小山坡上的景物，观赏起来。只见一座座公屋的窗口挂满了五颜六色的衣物，俗称万国旗，山坡下绿树掩映，蓝空中白云飘浮，突然，一群白鸽在眼前掠过，一片祥和，原来等待时，选择要心浮气躁或心平气和，也只存乎一念之间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这时候，想起还有两双日本鞋有待取回呢，问师傅拿鞋，他说：“啊呀！我的记性不好，不记得放在哪里了啊！鞋子是什么样子的呀？”他一边问，一边憨憨地笑，一脸无辜的样子，令我突然联想到高锟中大“脑智同护”计划的启动，对老年人记忆力退化的问题，不得不予以同情啊！接着， 他说，不如让你的菲佣进工作室去自己寻找吧！那地方可真是奇葩，与其说工作室，不如说堆填区，塞满了各式各样的材料和用具，只剩下一条可以侧身而过的羊肠小道，要在里面找到目标物，应该比迷城寻宝更难！菲佣努力绕了一圈，无功而返，到了门外，跟我相对一望，两人不由得哈哈大笑起来！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这边厢，师傅却不厌其烦、自顾自一次又一次地不断调校，鞋子也一次比一次宽松起来，每隔几分钟，我就得测试一番，站起又坐下，如此这般，十几个回合下来，虽然鞋子跟脚型始终没有和解的意思，我觉得该是时候鸣金收兵了。 “这鞋子的皮很软的，回去多穿几天，就不会痛了。”这辈子买鞋做鞋，哪一次不听惯这样的忠告？我笑笑，赶快点头称是，匆匆付了余款，准备打道回府。突然间，师傅对我宣称：“要是你的日本鞋找到了，我会用顺丰快递寄给你，那十几块钱的费用，不用你出，我来付了！”他说得派头十足，豪爽得很！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回程时，心中一算，那两双日本鞋，花了我好几千，三顾草庐，车费加鞋款，又是好几千，如果再加上满怀懊恼，岂非更划不来？还不如开开心心，安然释怀，假使有天鞋子竟然找到了，就当作域外来客，喜从天降；假使真打了水漂，那可不是又多了一个旅游日本的堂皇理由？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;
