I keep moving along the Jinjiang River, as if in the fog. I stop and go like a boat, not knowing where my heart is at home. Inadvertently, it moved from the original downstream to the current upstream. It was not until it was close to Huanhua Creek and adjacent to Du Fu&#39;s Thatched Cottage that the fog seemed to gradually dissipate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, in the past twenty-five years, Jinjiang has been the pillow that accompanies me to sleep every night. I didn’t realize it because it was so familiar. Just in June 2022, when I was able to calm down and look at Jinjiang again, I suddenly discovered that every time I moved before, it was a coincidence that the direction of my door overlapped with my sleeping posture many times, either facing Jinjiang or with my back to Jinjiang. , actually completely consistent. It turns out that all my uneasiness over the years was nothing more than impulsiveness, tossing and stubbornness when I was tossing and turning. The so-called conflict between survival and the so-called poetry and the distance was resolved tonight at the &quot;Hejiang Pavilion&quot; at the intersection of Fuhe and Nanhe, collectively known as Jinjiang River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinjiang, which used to be exclusive to Nanhe River, now also includes Fuhe River. Jinjiang River, whether it is the Nanhe section or the Fuhe section, except for spring tides and summer floods, rarely sees real rapids, and most of the time it always passes through the urban area of ​​Chengdu casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time I followed the famous literary group organized by the Jinjiang District Federation of Literary and Art Circles to revisit Jinjiang, from the December City Museum to the Shuijingfang Museum, and then from Hejiang Pavilion to Dongmen Market and Li Jieren’s former residence on the banks of the Shah River. Walking along both sides of the Jinjiang River, I discovered that it actually has many faces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/VV4GRYkoaUV6cISe3uPg3aUadwhsXxlRWk1AU9mw.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/VV4GRYkoaUV6cISe3uPg3aUadwhsXxlRWk1AU9mw.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205682&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wangjiang Tower on the South Bank of Jinjiang River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Moving like a dragon&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Rapid, turbulent, moving like a dragon, it should be the first face of Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to my fate with Jinjiang, I first read Du Fu’s poem in “Spring Night Rain” when I was in elementary school: “The clouds are all dark on the wild paths, but the fire on the river boats is only bright. At dawn, I can see the red and wet The place is full of flowers.&quot; But I didn&#39;t know at that time which river the &quot;river boat&quot; in the poem was. I grew up on the banks of the Jialing River. Every time I saw a wooden boat passing by the fast-moving Jialing River, I wanted to get on the boat immediately and rush to this &quot;river boat&quot; river written by Du Fu. I wanted to see if it could Also has a turbulent character. In 1997, I came to Chengdu to go to college. I saw the evergreen Du Fu Thatched Cottage by the Huanhua River and read more of Du Fu&#39;s Chengdu poems. Only then did I realize that this river that has been rippling in Chengdu for thousands of years was originally called Jinjiang. Today&#39;s scholars and old Chengdu people often regard Huanhua Creek as the starting point of Jinjiang River, but in Du Fu&#39;s eyes, the source of Jinjiang River is at the foot of Yulei Mountain in Dujiangyan. Therefore, he said in another poem &quot;Climbing the Tower&quot;, &quot;Jinjiang River The spring scenery comes to heaven and earth, and the jade barrier and floating clouds change the past and present.&quot; The water cultural gene of Jinjiang comes from the Minjiang River, which moves like a dragon at the foot of Yulei Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have traveled to Yulei Mountain many times and experienced firsthand the source of the Jinjiang River. The surging Minjiang River is in Dujiangyan. The majestic Puyang River flows out of the Baopingkou not far from the foot of Yulei Mountain. , the river is most unrestrained when it flows through the Dujiangyan South Bridge. From a distance, you can hear the sound of the raging waves hitting each other and violently beating the earth and rocks on both sides. After passing the South Bridge, near the &quot;Tianfuyuan&quot;, the Puyang River split into two, with a Zouma River sloping out from the side. Soon it split into two again, and a cypress river was cut out like a branch, and the Minjiang River flowed straight down. So far, the Zouma River and Baitiao River that branched out have run through the Chengdu Plain, nurturing the people of Shu and achieving the reputation of a land of abundance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Diverting the surging Minjiang River water to irrigate the Chengdu Plain, this huge credit certainly belongs to Li Bing, the prefect of Shu County during the reign of King Qin Zhao, who presided over the construction of the Dujiangyan Irrigation Project. When he governed Shu, he first controlled the floods, which solved the survival concerns of the people in Shu during the Qin Dynasty. He also paved the way for Chengdu to become one of the most prosperous industrial and commercial cities in the country during the Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/pQ2pzo7dXnWLSo3PaMNGE813avxx5fwOdX5CLScE.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/pQ2pzo7dXnWLSo3PaMNGE813avxx5fwOdX5CLScE.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205680&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Source of Jinjiang River: Minjiang River at the foot of Yulei Mountain in Dujiangyan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Peng Zhiqiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jing Like a Virgin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Calm, elegant, and as quiet as a lady, this is Jin Jiang’s second face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many sub-rivers of the Minjiang River, the Zouma River, especially the Huanhua Creek where the lower reaches of the Zouma River and the upper reaches of the Jinjiang River are located, are undoubtedly the clearest. Anyone who stops here will be impressed, not least because Huanhua Creek and its 600-acre Huanhua Creek Park have now become the largest green lung in Chengdu. The internal reason is closely related to the poem &quot;washing&quot; in the past dynasties. Especially after Du Fu settled here, Jinjiang gradually evolved into a river of poetry, with clear words and beautiful sentences constantly polishing its body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mighty Minjiang River has passed through the outer city in the west of Chengdu since ancient times and flowed near Du Fu Thatched Cottage, but its eager temper has created a gentle Huanhua Creek. No wonder Du Fu chose this place at the first sight when he came to Chengdu. In his poem &quot;Bu Ju&quot;, he praised &quot;at the west end of the Huanhua Stream, the owner is Bulintangyou&quot;. Later, due to the war in Chengdu, Du Fu, who had to flee the chaos in Zizhou &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Santai County, Sichuan)&lt;/span>;, was still writing &quot;Post a Question&quot; &quot;Jiangwai Thatched Cottage&quot; explains the original intention of settling by the Huanhua Stream, which is: &quot;I have a wild nature, and I want to escape from nature. I am addicted to wine and love bamboos, and I must live in the forest and springs.&quot; Today, by the Huanhua Stream, the Mian bamboos are slender, and the loving bamboos are kind. , bamboo cages are everywhere, and it is quiet everywhere. Being among them makes you forget your worries. As the upper reaches of Jinjiang River, Huanhua Creek has an ecological aesthetic quality. &quot;Fish come out in the drizzle, and swallows slant in the breeze.&quot; These natural beauties described by Du Fu in the Tang Dynasty can still be experienced frequently today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Tang Dynasty, if you took the waterway, you could take a boat from Huanhua River and turn into the Yangtze River to reach the south of the Yangtze River. Yes, it&#39;s Jiangnan. In his youth, Du Fu traveled to Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shaoxing and other ancient places of Wu and Yue. He has never forgotten the landscape of Jiangnan, such as the Qinhuai River in the sound of oars and the Cao&#39;e River under the awning boat. As the saying goes, &quot;Missing&quot; &quot;Wu Sheng Shi Fan&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Part 2 of &quot;Two Poems on Zizhou Climbing the Tower in Spring&quot;)&lt;/span>;, I often feel that &quot;the Yan River is beautiful and unique, You can’t forget it if you want to stop”&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;The Grand Tour&quot;)&lt;/span>;. Even when he came to settle in such an elegant and peaceful Huanhua River, and decided to live here forever, Du Fu would still think about it from time to time, except in the last sentence of &quot;Bu Ju&quot;, &quot;Thousands of miles eastward to enjoy the pleasure, one must go to the mountain shade in a small boat&quot;, In the last sentence of &quot;Quequatrains&quot;, &quot;The window contains the snow of Qianqiu in the Xiling Mountains, and the door is docked with ships thousands of miles away from Dongwu&quot;, I recall the Wuyue landscape rooted deep in my brain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the mountains and rivers of Wuyue and Bashan and Shu are the sources of Du Fu’s landscape poetry. In particular, the Jinjiang River in Chengdu and the Yangtze River in Chongqing also helped Du Fu reach the pinnacle of Chinese five-rhythm and seven-rhythm poetry, such as his famous five-rhythm poem &quot;Spring Night Joyful Rain&quot;, &quot;Look at the red and wet places at dawn, and the flowers are heavy in Jinguancheng&quot;, and his seven-rhythm poem. The famous poem &quot;Ascend the High&quot; &quot;The endless falling trees rustle down, and the endless Yangtze River rolls in&quot;. And as soon as he left Chengdu, Huanhua Creek became the most beautiful Jinjiang that Du Fu never forgot in Kuizhou &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (today&#39;s Fengjie County, Chongqing)&lt;/span>; on the Yangtze River. , for example, in &quot;Two Poems on Huaijin Water&quot;, one of them says, &quot;The water of Wu Gorge is coming towards Wu Gorge, and the waves of Jinjiang River are far away.&quot; Another example is that in &quot;Five Poems of Generals,&quot; the fifth one also says, &quot;The spring beauty of Jinjiang River drives people to Wu Gorge.&quot; Qingqiu mourns thousands of people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since ancient times, I have been traveling in captivity, why should I be sad?&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Chengdu Mansion&quot;)&lt;/span>; made Du Fu let go for a time Ji Lv is sad, thanks to Chengdu and Huanhua Creek in Chengdu. Chengdu and Jinjiang also have to thank Du Fu for his poetic talent of &quot;not surprising even if his words are not surprising&quot;. All this is, of course, because the sparkling Huanhua Creek provided Du Fu with a stable habitat. In the spring of 760, Du Fu was very satisfied with the thatched hut built by Huanhua Stream. He immediately wrote a poem &quot;Tangcheng&quot;: &quot;The back of the Guotang is shaded by white grass, and the road along the edge of the river overlooks the green suburbs. The alder forest blocks the sun and sings in the wind. Leaves, bamboo cages and smoke dripping from the dew tips. The flying crows will stop to count their eggs, and the swallows will come frequently to make new nests. Others mistakenly compare Yang Xiong&#39;s house, and he is lazy and has no intention of making fun of it.&quot; Since childhood, Du Fu said that he had a talent similar to Yang Xiong&#39;s. His talent and poetic talent were no less than those of Cao Zhi. Suddenly someone mistook his thatched cottage for Yang Xiong&#39;s old residence. What else needed to be explained? From then on, in addition to traveling to other places, he basically spent time on the riverside looking for flowers, asking for willows, meeting friends, drinking, farming, and growing medicine. He kept looking at Jinjiang from various perspectives and copying it. From the time I arrived in Chengdu in the winter of 759, I felt uncomfortable writing &quot;Chengdu Mansion&quot; because of &quot;the bustling city, playing the flute and the sheng&quot;. By the time I left Chengdu in the summer of 765, I wrote &quot;Go to Shu&quot; with tears in my eyes. ”, Du Fu wrote more than 200 poems during the 6 years he lived here. Almost every poem will be poetically inspired by Jinjiang. He wrote this repeatedly, and on the day he left, he finally turned Jinjiang into a river of poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/M2eXRG3uRZHUoae2J4hQkpVcalSEhI4McWxY0ezz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/M2eXRG3uRZHUoae2J4hQkpVcalSEhI4McWxY0ezz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The upper reaches of Jinjiang River: Huanhua Creek&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Peng Zhiqiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Du Fu’s worship Visitors and followers came from different dynasties one after another, and they were in an endless stream on both sides of the Jinjiang River. The rising and falling sounds of poetry can be heard everywhere. Zhang Ji is here, and his &quot;Chengdu Song&quot; is very lively in Chengdu dialect. The picture is: &quot;The smoke and water are green near the west of Jinjiang River, and the lychees are ripe at the top of the Xinyu Mountain. There are many restaurants near the Wanli Bridge, and tourists love to stay in whoever they want to stay at.&quot; Su Shi is here, After struggling in officialdom for many years, he was demoted to Huangzhou. His memories of Jinjiang are full of nostalgia, such as in &quot;The Red River: Sent to Ezhou Zhu Envoy Jun Shouchang&quot;: &quot;Coming west from Jianghan, the grapes under the tall buildings are deep green. I still bring them with me. Min&#39;e snow waves, the spring scenery of Jinjiang. You are the beloved guardian of Nanshan, and I miss the return guest outside the sword.&quot; Lu You came. He loved Jinjiang, especially the plum blossoms on both sides of Jinjiang. It can be said that &quot;Ten years of horse racing along the Jinjiang River&quot;. For ten years, he was &quot;on Jinjiang Road in front of Qingyang Palace, and I was drunk by plum blossoms for ten years.&quot; In his later years, the lingering aftertaste is still: &quot;Back then, when I walked to the west of Jincheng, I was drunk by plum blossoms. For twenty miles, the fragrance continued. , Qingyang Palace to Huanhua Stream.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinjiang starts from the intersection of Huanhua Stream and Modi River in the northeast of Caotang Primary School, all the way from west to east, passing Baihuatan, Jinguan Bridge, Rainbow Bridge, Wanli Bridge to Hejiang Pavilion, this section of the river is also called Nanhe. This is the only river that Du Fu must pass when leaving Chengdu in his later years, and it is also the spring river that Li Bai sang on the Sanhua Tower in his youth &quot;Building&quot; &quot;Evening rain goes to the Three Gorges, and the Spring River flows around the two streams&quot;)&lt;/span>;, during which time, we go retrograde from the Sanhua Building in Baihua Pond to the Shuangxian Bridge Antique Market on the bank of Huanhua Creek. There are also Yuxian Bridge, Wangxian Bridge, and Wangxian Bridge. Send Xianqiao. The Nanhe River starting from Huanhua Stream winds and meanders without any rush until it meets the Fuhe River running from north to south at Hejiang Pavilion. At the confluence of the two rivers, waves suddenly bloom, gradually returning to their turbulent nature originating from the Minjiang River. From there, he quickly rushed to Jiuyan Bridge, Wangjiang Tower, and Huanglong River, and returned to the mainstream of the Minjiang River near the Jiangkou Chenyin Site in Pengshan, Meishan, and went straight into the Yangtze River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My inspection of Jinjiang this time came along the Fuhe River with a group, and then I went back home alone from the Nanhe River. Although I have witnessed the spectacular confluence of the Nanhe River and the Fuhe River many times before, they are still there. The scene of hugging each other and recognizing relatives in Hejiang Pavilion is still seen often. It made me get to know Jinjiang and myself again. It seemed casual but in fact I was very committed to the original intention of living in Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/KdIn6CHecKafSHgXLMXmlpAEABQhI0PHW8DAAGfb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/KdIn6CHecKafSHgXLMXmlpAEABQhI0PHW8DAAGfb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205679&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;South Section of Jinjiang River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Peng Zhiqiang/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jin Ruo Shu Jin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Amazing, tolerant and with a bright future, this is the third face of Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First trace the whereabouts of the Baitiao River, a tributary of the Minjiang River. In fact, like the Zouma River, it also goes all the way east and divides many times in the north of Chengdu. The sub-rivers include Pihe, Dongfengqu, Shahe and Fuhe, among which , Fuhe River turns from north to east and then south into Chengdu City. Compared with the Zouma River, the Baitiao River has a greater mission. Especially in the Tang Dynasty, it passed under the Chengdu City and became a moat, protecting Chengdu from good weather and protecting Chengdu&#39;s prosperity for thousands of years. This section of the Baitiao River flows through and protects Chengdu Fucheng, so it is named Fucheng. Li Bai said in No. 7 of &quot;Ten Songs of the Emperor&#39;s Western Tour of Nanjing&quot; that in the Tang Dynasty, this moat was &quot;Jinshui flows eastward around Jincheng, and the star bridge hangs like a star in the north.&quot; This moat, which has been changed many times but still protects the city of Chengdu, is the Fu River that now meets the Nan River at Hejiang Pavilion. Yes, Fuhe was regarded as &quot;Jinshui&quot; by Li Bai, and Nanhe, which originally referred to Jinjiang, was also &quot;Jinshui&quot; in Du Fu&#39;s eyes. For example, &quot;Dan Ge Xing presented Wang Lang Sizhi&quot; said, &quot;The princes from the west drank Jinshui. Where do you want to go to get your pearls and shoes?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuhe River and Nanhe River, the two &quot;Jinshui&quot; surrounding the city, were once collectively known as Funan River. They were the gushing mother river among the Chengdu population. Fuhe and Nanhe, which have the same origin as the Minjiang River, are both &quot;Jinshui&quot;. Since they are collectively called Funanhe, why not call them both &quot;Jinjiang&quot;? Jinjiang, as its name suggests, is a river with a bright future. In 2005, with the approval of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Fuhe and Nanhe in the urban section of Chengdu were officially collectively called Jinjiang. After all, both Fuhe and Nanhe have made great efforts in flowing through, protecting and prospering Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about another important cultural source of Jinjiang: Shu Brocade. The history of Chengdu&#39;s construction has been more than 2,300 years since Zhang Yi built the city after the Qin State annexed the Shu State. Since Li Bing diverted the Minjiang River into the Chengdu Plain, Chengdu has been constantly changing the course of the river entering the city. It has been accumulating power like water since the Qin Dynasty. This power is the driving force that Shu brocade brings to Chengdu&#39;s economic prosperity. In fact, sericulture and brocade weaving have been the living customs of the ancestors of Shu since ancient times. By the Western Han Dynasty when the brocade industry was developed, the Shu brocade produced in Chengdu was sold all over the country and became famous because of its exquisite craftsmanship, variety of colors, and wide range of uses. In 2012, four Shu brocade Jacquard loom models were unearthed from archaeological excavations at the Laoguanshan Han Tomb in Chengdu. Their dates all point to the Western Han Dynasty. They are the most complete loom models from the Western Han Dynasty discovered in my country so far and the earliest Jacquard loom in the world so far. Model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to legend, as early as the Han Dynasty, the imperial court set up officials in Chengdu to manage brocades full-time and named them &quot;Jin Officials&quot;. During the Shu-Han Period of the Three Kingdoms, Prime Minister Zhuge Liang restored the &quot;Jin Officials&quot; to solve the problems during the war in one fell swoop. Due to the economic and military expenditure problems of the Shu Kingdom, Chengdu gained the reputation of &quot;Jincheng City&quot; and &quot;Jincheng City&quot;. When Du Fu was living in Chengdu, he wrote &quot;The Prime Minister of Shu&quot;, &quot;Where can I find the ancestral hall of the Prime Minister? There are so many trees outside Jinguan City&quot;, and &quot;Spring Night Joyful Rain&quot;, &quot;Looking at the red and wet place at dawn, the flowers are heavy in Jinguan City&quot;, which illustrates the Jinguan City in the Tang Dynasty. The ruins of the city are still there, and its official office is probably on the Jinjiang River between Rainbow Bridge and Wanli Bridge. In the Tang Dynasty, Chengdu, formerly known as Shu County and Yizhou, experienced great development in Shu Brocade and other handicraft industries. In addition, the Chengdu Plain nurtured by the Minjiang River was rich in rice and other grains. It became a more prosperous city than Chang&#39;an and Luoyang. It is known in history as &quot;Yang one benefits two&quot;, which means that Chengdu&#39;s economic power is second only to Yangzhou, which is known as a land of plenty and a canal hub. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I say Jinjiang is as stunning as Sichuan Brocade because it is really brightened by Sichuan Brocade. According to the fifth record of Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Nine Poems on the Waves and Waves on the Sand&quot;: &quot;The flowers on both sides of the Zhuojin River are washed by the spring breeze. The girl cuts off the mandarin duck brocade and sets the sunset glow in the middle.&quot; In the poem, Liu Yuxi vividly describes a Tang Dynasty A scene of Chengdu women washing Sichuan brocade in Jinjiang River. There is also Li Bai. Even when he was sentenced to Changliu Yelang in Xunyang, he still missed the Jinjiang River in Chengdu that was washed by Shu Jinhuan. Sixth of his &quot;Ten Songs of the Emperor&#39;s Western Tour of Nanjing&quot; said, &quot;The Qingjiang River flows thousands of miles.&quot; , Yunfan and dragon sailed down to Yangzhou.&quot; In the Tang Dynasty, the Jinjiang River was wide, running thousands of miles, and full of heroism. Why was the word &quot;毯&quot; added before &quot;Jinjiang&quot;? Because Jinjiang is also known as Zhuojin River and Zhuojin River. Zhuo Jin, the brocade color is fresher and more moist than usual, hence the name. The washing of Shu brocade by the Jinjiang River did not begin in the Tang Dynasty. Since about the Western Han Dynasty, Shu people have loved to wash the Shu brocade cut by textiles in the Huanhua River. Later generations euphemistically called this &quot;Zhuo brocade&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How could Du Fu, who lives in Huanhua Creek in the upper reaches of Jinjiang River, not know the legend of &quot;Zhuojinjiang River&quot;, as stated in &quot;Xiao Baming&#39;s Mansion Really Looking for Peach Plants&quot;, &quot;Although there are countless in Heyang County, the gardens along Zhuojinjiang River are not full.&quot; Zeng explained that during the Anshi Rebellion, there was a shortage of peach trees in Huanhuaxi, so he went to Xiao Baming&#39;s Mansion to find new peaches to plant. When Du Fu first arrived in Chengdu, he mainly made a living by farming and growing medicines, and his family often relied on Lumi from friends such as Gao Shi and Yan Wu. After that, he must also be dressed in brocade clothes, which he often washes in the Jinjiang River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greatest inheritance today of using Sichuan brocade to wash the Jinjiang River is probably the naming of a county-level district after Jinjiang. In 1990, Chengdu abolished Dongcheng District and reorganized its main part into Jinjiang District. The name of the district comes from the Sichuan culture of &quot;Zhuo Jinjiang&quot; that has been passed down orally for thousands of years in the poems of great poets such as Li Bai, Du Fu, and Liu Yuxi. In the Qin Dynasty, the location of Jinjiang District was called Chengdu County, which was the core urban area of ​​Shu County at this time. In the Tang Dynasty, whether Chengdu County was renamed Shu County or Huayang County, it was still Chengdu Prefecture&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (the capital of the Tang Dynasty &quot;Nanjing&quot; after the An-Shi Rebellion )&lt;/span>;’s core urban area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/mQVSufFdiyFuBN4jinfzt7rVA7pEN5fEb2pQgy54.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/18/mQVSufFdiyFuBN4jinfzt7rVA7pEN5fEb2pQgy54.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;205681&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Anshun Covered Bridge on Jinjiang River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinjiang River, from The &quot;Zhuo Jinjiang River&quot; that flows from the Min River to wash the city of Chengdu not only incubates Jinjiang District, but also flows southward from Hejiang Pavilion in Jinjiang District into the High-tech Zone, Shuangliu District, and Tianfu New District, continuing to expand Chengdu&#39;s arteries. Even like me, a &quot;Rong Piao&quot; who has lived for 25 years, was able to establish a business in the Jinjiangfu River section and then settle down in the Jinjiang South River section. It can be said that I was first inspired by Du Fu&#39;s poetic Jinjiang, and ultimately it was because of the economic boom. Given by Jinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a summer evening, the colorful clouds turned the face over Chengdu red, and also reflected the Jinjiang River passing through the city red. As the night gradually opened and the lanterns started to light up, I strolled along the Hejiang Pavilion on the Jinjiang River and returned to the upstream Huanhua Stream. I fell asleep on the Sichuan Brocade pillow late at night. I thought that I would never be able to stay away from the Jinjiang River for the rest of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走出村小的学生正在服务杭州亚运，让我看到教育的意义]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258148]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday will give you a few days to spare. While watching the replay video of the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, I remembered that Xiao Yang, who I had been in contact with before and was now in Hangzhou, might be serving the Asian Games as a volunteer at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I immediately sent her a message, but it took a few hours for me to receive her reply: She was on rest during service, not in the library, but still busy... Finally, while she was resting During the break, I learned that she was working with several other volunteers this time to provide information consultation for athletes in the e-sports stadium, issue game passes, arrange for athletes to enter the lounge, and check-in matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at some of the live pictures and work photos of the e-sports stadium that she posted on her WeChat Moments, the more I looked at them carefully, the less I could recall too many scenes of her as a primary school student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She was the first group of students I taught when I became a teacher ten years ago. At that time, compared with other students in the class, she was not necessarily very cheerful and lively, but she was serious, studious, and careful enough. She was selected as a &quot;study committee member&quot; very early. She lived right across from the school. Sometimes she would finish her homework in the classroom after school and then go home. She would also occasionally come to the school after dinner to chat with me and another young teacher who lived in the school. Although her grades in elementary school have always been among the best, even though she occasionally sent me holiday greetings after entering junior high school, and even though she heard my opinions when she filled in her application for the college entrance examination, I never imagined that the person who read the text aloud ten years ago A student who was not very loud and did not perform actively in public classes can now use fluent English to help e-sports players from different countries successfully enter the arena and complete the game and win their praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes me even more moved is that the starting point for her volunteer service for the Asian Games was an extremely ordinary rural primary school, a primary school with less than 300 people, a sports ground on dirt... A student can pass After ten years of study and continuous hard work, I entered the city, entered the university, and entered the Asian Games e-sports stadium with a sense of technology and modernity. I used my enthusiasm and professional ability to contribute to the Asian Games. I have always been in a township school. In my opinion, it is simply a miracle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not sure whether Xiao Yang could have imagined that he would have such a special situation when he was in elementary school ten years ago, high school five years ago, and college two years ago. But for me, a teacher who has taught her for two years, witnessed her growth, and followed her learning, there are too many surprises and too many gratifications. This surprise and relief was the result of seeing her continue to learn and receive education. It was so beautiful and good. Even the whole process and results were something that neither she nor I, who had experienced it, had ever imagined or expected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my tenth year of teaching, many of my students have already entered the workplace early, some are still studying on university campuses, some are still preparing for the college entrance examination, and some have just entered junior high school. Whenever I wonder how much positive role I, as their teacher, have played in their growth and learning, Xiao Yang’s experience in serving the Asian Games should be the best answer I can give at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a teacher in Suixian County, Suizhou City, Hubei Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010 ;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Since I left when I was very young, I have always regarded Pingxiang, Jiangxi, as my hometown. When I first heard that the capital of Anhui Province was called &quot;Hefei&quot;, I was as surprised as I was when I learned about the history of Pingxiang. Although this coal city in western Jiangxi is called &quot;Pingxiang&quot;, in fact, it has become a well-known industrial and mining city at home and abroad as early as the late Qing Dynasty with the rise of Anyuan Coal Mine; it is not only the birthplace of the Chinese workers&#39; movement, but also the autumn harvest. Why was the origin of the uprising named &quot;Pingxiang&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn’t it just Pingxiang? There are also many cities in China with interesting names. For example, the capital of Hebei Province is called &quot;Shijiazhuang&quot; and the famous porcelain capital of Jiangxi is called &quot;Jingdezhen&quot;. In the 1970s, a flood in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River washed out Henan Province. A prefecture-level city was named &quot;Zhumadian&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is either a town, a village, or a store. It is conceivable that most of these place names come from its history. But the combination of these two Chinese characters &quot;Hefei&quot; makes people feel strange. A cross talk once joked that it was &quot;two fat men sleeping&quot;. Later I learned that it got its name because it is located where the two Fei rivers in the north and south merge into Chaohu Lake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I went to Anhui, or the first time to Hefei, was in May of 1993, when the flowers were blooming. At that time, I was still working in Pingxiang City. The two places were separated by more than a thousand kilometers. Because of the inconvenient transportation, Hefei felt like a distant existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I spent two full days on that trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I set off early in the morning the day before. After taking the green train for most of the day, I first arrived in Nanchang and stayed at a small hotel near the long-distance bus station. The next day, I took a bus before dawn. Genius 1 bus bound for Hefei. Then, the car passed through countless villages and towns. The road was uneven and had potholes from time to time. After a day of bumps, the bones were falling apart. Lunch seemed to have been served at a roadside shop in Huangmei County, Hubei Province. It was probably the driver&#39;s personal designated restaurant. The food didn&#39;t look clean, and there was a strange taste in the mouth. This is nothing, the worst part is going to the &quot;bathroom&quot;. Although the car stopped twice during the journey, both times it stopped in the wilderness of Qianbuba Village and Hoububa Store; those two places were blocked. The sheds called &quot;public restrooms&quot; were only one person high and had no doors. The passengers were self-conscious at first and lined up at a distance, but the male compatriots who couldn&#39;t wait went to look for trees or grass that could provide shelter. To solve the problem, our female compatriots could only guard the toilet. The dirty floor in the toilet and the flying mosquitoes and flies made me retching uncontrollably. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order not to go to the toilet, I didn’t dare to drink a sip of water or take a sip of food along the way. By the time I arrived in Hefei, it was already dark and I was so hungry that my chest was touching my back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that terrible experience, I did not dare to return to my hometown. It was not until three years later that a railway was built between Hefei and Nanchang, and I began to return to my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, this special line was not included in the national railway system and was only a local railway between Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. It starts from Hefei&#39;s West Railway Station, passes through Feixi, Lujiang, Shucheng, Tongcheng, Qianshan, Susong, and Wangjiang in Anhui Province, passes through Huangmei in Hubei Province, and then crosses the Yangtze River and enters Jiujiang and Yongxiu in Jiangxi Province. , and finally arrived in Nanchang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I do remember that the first time I boarded that southbound train was one morning at the end of 1996. At that time, our financial situation was still very difficult, and all we bought was a seat ticket. When my husband and I got into the car carrying large and small bags, we were surprised to find that there were very few passengers in the car. Although some people started to get on along the way, they were always sparse and there were so many empty spots that people could even lie down and sleep. Looking out the window at the rolling mountains, the sleeping fields under the winter sun, and the fleeting simple farmhouses, I felt mixed feelings. Fortunately, I no longer have to endure the pain of long-distance buses where I dare not even take a sip of water. Switching to a spacious and comfortable train, the time is shortened by nearly half. What is worrying is that there are too few passengers and the passenger flow is so small. Volume, let alone making money, whether the cost can be maintained is a question, and the economies of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces are still underdeveloped. If they are always losing money, can this train be saved? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This train arrived at the terminal, Nanchang, in the evening. Since there were no more trains to Pingxiang that day, we had to stay in Nanchang for one night. I remember we chose a hotel called &quot;Da Guangming&quot; on Zhanqian Road. &quot;Da Guangming&quot; is a small hotel. The rooms are poorly furnished and there is no separate bathroom. A very funny thing happened in &quot;Great Light&quot; that day, and even today, twenty-six years later, I still remember it fresh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While packing the luggage the next morning, my husband suddenly discovered that an envelope containing 3,000 yuan in cash was missing! The door was locked and the windows were bolted, so it was impossible for outsiders to come in and steal. But after searching every corner of the room, as well as the corridors and public toilets outside, nothing was found. My husband then went downstairs to find the waiter, and soon a hotel security guard came up. He said that only the two of us lived on the entire floor that day, and even if it fell on the corridor, it would not be picked up by anyone. What he meant was that the envelope could only be left in the room. So, in front of him, I took off the quilt cover, lifted the sheets, took out the items in the box one by one, and rummaged through them again, but there was still nothing. At this time, my husband made a request to him, &quot;Maybe I accidentally dropped it into the toilet when I was convenient and it was washed away. Can you take me to the sewer to have a look?&quot; The man did not refuse. He agreed, &quot;It is possible. Not long ago, a traveler dropped a watch and found it in the sewer. There were not many people staying in the hotel last night, and the water from the sewer should still be accumulated downstairs. I will take you Go down and look for it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With a glimmer of hope, we followed him downstairs. He took out an iron rod with a hook from a corner, led us around to the small courtyard behind the hotel, and opened two The iron plate, underneath is the sewer. He bent over and rolled up his sleeves, completely ignoring the stench coming from the sewer. He held the iron rod and carefully raked it back and forth little by little. After raking it out three or four times, he still found nothing. He smiled at us apologetically: &quot;Nothing either!&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;If I really can’t find it, I can only admit that I am unlucky. We left &quot;Da Guangming&quot; sadly, took the train back to Pingxiang, and stayed at Dadi&#39;s house at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That year, my eldest brother was allocated a new apartment. This money was originally a gift to him, but unexpectedly something unexpected happened, so he had to owe it first. Unexpectedly, when my husband went to bed at night, he took off the black woolen jacket and something fell from his sleeve, and it was not the envelope containing the money! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for how the envelope slipped into the sleeves, there is no way to verify it; he didn’t even notice it when he was getting dressed, and he didn’t even notice when he put it all the way around, which shows that he doesn’t care about such trivial matters in life. He is a careless person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While I was blaming his Madaha for giving me a false alarm, I was also full of guilt for the Da Guangming Hotel. Think about it, in the middle of winter, I had to dig out the gutter early in the morning, and I still looked unhappy when I left. I always thought that the money was lost in the hotel, and I even suspected that the waiter had picked it up! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the Daguangming Hotel and the tall security guard have been deeply engraved in my mind. Even after our economic conditions improved, I still chose to stay in &quot;Da Guangming&quot; every time I was in transit from Nanchang. Once, my son had a high fever in the middle of the night, but I did not panic and gave him medicine calmly because I believed that this hotel would definitely lend a helping hand if needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years later, this Anhui-Jiangxi line was integrated into the national railway network. The trains from Hefei to Nanchang were also extended from Nanchang to Guangzhou, and a pair of trains to Dongguan were also added. There are many trains to choose from, but both trains depart from Hefei at noon or evening, and arrive in Nanchang either in the evening or in the middle of the night; and the train from Nanchang to Hefei departs in the early morning, either in the middle of the night or in the early morning. When traveling between Hefei and my hometown, I still have to stay one night in Nanchang. I have been riding this kind of train for more than ten years, so I have stayed at the Daguangming Hotel no less than forty times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I don’t have a good impression of Nanchang Railway Station. Every time I leave the station, there will be a number of people holding signs to solicit guests to stay in the hotel, and they will keep pestering you; in front of the station When dining in a small restaurant, if you don&#39;t agree on the price in advance, sometimes you will be charged an exorbitant price, and you will have to consider yourself unlucky if you get ripped off, because those people are very rude and seem to be ready to use their fists at any time. Fortunately, this hotel prevented us from being too disappointed in this city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 2010, my journey back home changed again: Hefei opened two direct trains to the southwest, one to Kunming and one to Nanning; Both trains pass through my hometown. The former departs in the morning and arrives in the evening, while the latter departs in the morning and arrives in the evening. The time it takes to reach Pingxiang does not exceed twelve hours. From then on, my journey back to my hometown suddenly became very smooth. I no longer needed to change trains midway. I only had to buy a sleeper ticket, get on the train from Hefei after dinner, and sleep all the way to Pingxiang in time for breakfast the next day; or I was still in Hefei in the morning, and before the sun went down, I came to the streets of Pingxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the convenient transportation, the number of times I return to my hometown has naturally increased. It used to be once or twice a year, but now it has become several times. Something happened at home. I got a call the day before and I arrived early the next morning. It used to be difficult to meet my classmates and friends from my hometown, but now it is easy to meet once or twice a year. Whenever there is a school anniversary or class celebration event, as long as I can spare the time, I will rush back to join in the fun. , although I have been away from home for more than 20 years, my former classmates and friends have miraculously recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Spring Festival, my husband and I went back to our hometown to visit my mother. When we purchased tickets online, we unexpectedly discovered that the train from Hefei to Kunming suddenly disappeared; the train to Nanning was also absent. Pingxiang stopped. But at the same time, I was even more surprised to find that there is a high-speed rail connection between Hefei and Nanchang! Moreover, the high-speed rail departs six times a day, and the whole journey takes just over two hours! Then, I also discovered that the passenger train that used to operate between Anhui and Jiangxi had also returned, but it had also changed from the earlier green train to a motor train, and the time was greatly shortened to two hours and forty minutes! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 12 noon on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, my husband and I boarded the train. Looking at the wilderness and farmhouses passing by outside the window, my mood suddenly returned to the unstoppable excitement I felt when I first took the train back to my hometown twenty-six years ago. In my impression, the speed of the green train at that time was only 60 kilometers per hour, and in order to prevent thermal expansion and contraction, there were gaps at the joints of each section of the rail. When the wheels passed by, a clear and audible &quot;thumping thump&quot; would be emitted from underneath the train. The sound of &quot;thump, thump, thump&quot; is especially loud when people are quiet at night; and now the speed of high-speed trains has reached more than 200 kilometers per hour. People sitting on the train can no longer hear the sound of wheels hitting the rails. It is so smooth that even the water in the cup can&#39;t be heard. It didn&#39;t move at all. As you can imagine, the rails today are obviously seamless. There are only twenty-six years before and after. Twenty-six years is not a long time, but it is enough to give birth to a generation. It is only a blink of an eye. In the past twenty-six years, China&#39;s railway transportation has indeed undergone earth-shaking changes. . In terms of speed alone, there used to be only local trains or express trains, but at the beginning of the 20th century, there were express trains and direct trains. By the 2008 Olympic Games, the first intercity high-speed rail line appeared between Beijing and Tianjin. The municipalities have implemented high-speed rail and public transportation, and it only takes half an hour to travel to and from each other. In terms of color, in the past, local trains were always green, while in the transition to express trains, there were red and blue. Later, high-speed trains and high-speed trains were all white. Now, high-speed trains have spread all over the country, and only Anhui Province has done so. Arrive at Shishitong High Speed ​​Rail. So, I discovered that the colors of the cars have been adjusted again: except for the high-speed trains, all ordinary passenger cars have returned to the previous green color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Green is the color of spring, which makes you feel refreshed and full of vitality. Of course, the bigger change is that today&#39;s rail transit has switched from burning coal to using electricity. This is a change of the times. It has not only become faster, but also cleaner and more environmentally friendly! So, I am guessing what kind of new energy will be used to drive high-speed rail and high-speed trains in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I searched on the Internet with great interest and found out that the high-speed railway between Nanchang and Hefei was officially opened to traffic this year, that is, in January 2022. I was earlier. One of the passengers who enjoys this benefit. There were not many passengers on the train that day. Just like the first time I took the local railway, most of the seats were empty. But I no longer have the worries I had back then, because the reason why there are so few passengers this time is not due to passenger flow, but due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Everyone is responding to the government’s call and trying not to travel if possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High-speed rail not only greatly shortens the time compared to ordinary trains, but the convenience of transfer is also a major advantage. I have transferred at Tianjin West Railway Station in a municipality directly under the Central Government, and at Bengbu South Railway Station in a prefecture-level city. Both times I could transfer without leaving the station. This time, the train entered Nanchang West Station. We got off the train and followed the &quot;Convenient Transfer&quot; signs to get on the elevator of the station&#39;s overpass. We crossed the overpass and entered the waiting room directly. Because there are as many as 26 high-speed trains running from Nanchang West to Pingxiang North every day, we only stayed at the station for a short time and completed the transfer easily. An hour later, we ended our journey back to our hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking about it, all this is incredible: from Hefei, between the Jianghuai River and the Huaihe River, to Pingxiang, the coal capital of western Jiangxi, the trip used to take two days and one night, but now it only takes four hours. Such speed was something I couldn&#39;t even dream of before. Many people have watched &quot;Water Margin&quot; and know that Dai Zong, the magical Taibo in it, can travel a thousand miles in a day and eight hundred miles at night. Everyone thinks that is just a myth. But with China&#39;s high-speed rail now, why does it take one day to travel a thousand miles? Two or three hours is enough! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the journey back to my hometown can be said to be a kind of enjoyment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一次历届最火的迷笛音乐节，和乐迷遭遇的65起盗窃案]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258172]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 19:50:39&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The classic scene widely circulated at the Nanyang Midi Music Festival: lifting a wheelchair man.

Unforgettable: &quot;I have heard of things being thrown away at music festivals before, but it was not as serious as this time. This time it is too exaggerated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the National Day holiday, &quot;Central Plains Midi&quot; in Nanyang, Henan &quot;Music Festival&quot; has been on the hot search topic list many times. Among them, according to reports from many music fans on social platforms, a large-scale property theft occurred in the Midi camping area on October 3. Videos and pictures provided by music fans showed that local villagers broke into the Midi camp and brazenly &quot;ransacked&quot; tents. , many computers, mobile phones, musical instruments and other valuables were confiscated. &quot;It&#39;s outrageous that my home has been moved away after I went to the bathroom. It was already an open robbery.&quot; A music fan told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the Nanyang Municipal Public Security Bureau. A police officer surnamed Lu responded: &quot;We are still registering the lost items of music fans. The specific situation needs to be contacted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, the official Weibo of the Midi Music Festival announced that the local police received a total of 73 reports and implemented 65 theft cases. After investigation by the public security organs, some thieves have been captured and detained, and some property has been recovered. On the same day, the WeChat public account &quot;Nanyang Radio and Television Station&quot; issued a notice saying that based on the current registration situation of music fans, 79 ID cards and 3 computers have been returned , 17 mobile phones, and the remaining items are being verified and contacted. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Because of the rain, few people live in the camping area&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is the first time Nanyang has hosted the Midi Music Festival, which will be held for four days from September 29th to October 2nd. In order to hold this music festival, the local government opened a large open space in Huangshan Village on the outskirts of the country, planted a large lawn, and named it &quot;Green Field Monologue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It rained for three days during the four-day music festival.” Liu Rui said that outdoor music festivals like Midi usually provide open spaces for music fans to bring tents for camping. At noon on September 29, the camping area was officially opened to music fans. However, during the past few days of the music festival, except for the sunny weather on September 30, it continued to rain for the other three days. After setting up their tents, many music fans only use them to rest during the day and choose to stay in hotels in the city and take a shower at night. For the sake of convenience, many people do not carry their luggage with them, but put it directly in the tent as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Rui said that the camping site is divided into three areas: A, B, and C. Among them, Area C where he is stationed is located inside. The theft was not serious. He only lost his power bank, The relatively low-value items such as power strips did not call the police. However, thefts in areas A and B near the exit, especially near the fence, are very serious. &quot;It seems that Shenzhen music fans put their things on the wall and suffered heavy losses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to him, he had not heard of any &quot;lost things&quot; in the days before the festival. On the last morning, he returned to After setting up camp, many people found their belongings missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have a (music fan) organization, and we all camp together.” Wu Siqi is from Shenzhen, and this is her fourth MIDI tour. She recalled to the Southern Weekend reporter that because of the rain, she only stayed in the tent for one night on the second night, and stayed in the hotel the rest of the time. She put her luggage in the tent and zipped it up. On the evening of October 2, I was in a very excited mood after watching the performance and found nothing unusual. When I returned to the camping area from the hotel on October 3, I found that the zipper of the tent had been opened, many belongings were missing, and some items were scattered beside the tent. It was obvious that There are signs of being picked up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After verification, she lost a mobile phone, several bank cards, some cash, and some souvenirs. &quot;They should have come in by climbing over the wall.&quot; Wu Siqi said that music fans can get a bracelet on site after purchasing tickets. There are staff on duty at the entrance, and they can enter and exit freely with the bracelet. &quot;There are people watching the entrance, and the security on the wall inside is poor.&quot; She said that the wall at the music festival venue is about two meters high and is not guarded by security guards, making it easier to climb over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wu Siqi communicated with friends from Shenzhen, they all suffered varying degrees of loss. She saw videos and pictures taken by music fans. Some people climbed over the wall and jumped into the camping area, while others were rummaging through tents in the camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Music fan Liu Ling lost her laptop, headphones, power bank, and goods used to set up a stall. When she went to the police station to call the police, she met a stall owner who claimed that more than 80,000 yuan worth of goods was missing. In order to find her lost items, she joined three music fan support groups. Each group has four to five hundred people, all of whom said they had lost their belongings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Liu Ling’s first time to participate in a large outdoor music festival.

She believed that this argument completely ignored the facts, &quot;They are just denying the facts, and this is not acceptable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Siqi said that her trip to Nanyang Midi originally left her with very good memories, but the final encounter ruined these experiences. She said that due to the continuous rain, some music fans&#39; plans to camp outdoors were scrapped. The organizers provided free accommodation for some music fans who could not find a hotel temporarily. They caught a cold after being exposed to the rain. They could also receive free brown sugar at the music festival. Ginger tea.

As a result, when I returned to the camp on the last day, I found that my house had been robbed and stabbed.&quot; Wu Siqi said that the experience of these few days was magical, &quot;It immediately took me back from Utopia.

We also later learned that one of the netizens, Chen, spread false information on the Internet after the night of the 2nd. The message indicates that the event is over, and no one wants many things.

It is a music festival IP with a long history in China and has a deep foundation of music fans. In recent years, Midi Music Festival has frequently moved out of first-tier cities and been held in third- and fourth-tier cities in the mainland, which also has box office appeal. However, the arrival of the Midi Music Festival in Nanyang is an initiative of the Nanyang local government to attract investment and attract traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to local media reports, in May 2023, leaders of the Wolong District Committee of Nanyang City led a team to Beijing Midi Music School to discuss cooperation. The leaders of the Wolong District Committee said that Wolong District has sufficient development space and activity scenes. , hoping that both parties will promote cooperation, jointly ignite urban vitality, release industrial potential, highlight cultural charm, and inject more young forces into Wolong District&#39;s &quot;urban growth&quot;. The person in charge of Midi Music School said that Wolong District has a beautiful natural environment and broad prospects for the development of the cultural tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 2, the person in charge of Beijing Midi Music School said in an interview with Nanyang Daily that this music festival was very successful and set a box office record for the 47th Midi Music Festival in 30 years. , the number of live audiences also broke the previous record. There were more than 20,000 viewers on the eve of the music festival, and the number of viewers was close to 40,000 every day for the other three days. All tickets for the music festival were sold out in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, Southern Weekend reporters called the Wolong District Culture and Tourism Bureau of Nanyang City. The staff on duty at the bureau did not provide any more information about the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Rui said that because there are more restrictions in big cities, the trend of large-scale outdoor music festivals developing in third- and fourth-tier cities is very obvious. Local governments choose to cooperate because of the considerations of attracting investment and developing tourism; From the perspective of music fans, it is also a good choice to travel to different cities and experience the customs of different regions while attending music festivals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the music festival ended on October 3, but the National Day holiday has not yet ended. Previously, the usual practice was that many music fans would choose to continue visiting the city where the music festival was held for a few days, and then return Make return arrangements. &quot;So many people come here to eat, drink and play, which can boost the economy.&quot; Liu Rui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liu Rui’s view, before the theft incident, the entire event was actually very successful and basically met the organizer’s expectations. He said that because the lawn of the music festival had just been laid not long ago, after continuous rain, the entire venue was muddy, and it turned into a large-scale &quot;mud war&quot;, which became a scene that went viral on major social platforms and short video platforms; in addition, A young man in a wheelchair from Hebei was lifted up by many music fans to pay tribute at the music festival, and it became a classic scene that moved many netizens. These many factors have caused the 2023 Nanyang Midi Music Festival to frequently fail to appear, attracting attention from the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It turned out that everything went smoothly, but I didn&#39;t expect that something like this happened.&quot; Liu Rui felt sorry for Midi and Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ Liu Rui, Wu Siqi and Liu Ling are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[特诺奇蒂特兰沦亡五百年祭丨古国多少事⑧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257368]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 19:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Flying from Atlanta to Mexico City, the scenery changes three times: first, from the flat and fertile southern plains of the United States to the sea and sky. over the Gulf of Mexico, and then crosses the Gulf of Mexico at a 45-degree angle, then enters the warm and tropical northern coast of Mexico, and finally reaches the rugged central Mexican plateau, which is the starting point of the northern end of the long volcanic belt that forms the Central American isthmus. The Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean connect the two continents of North and South America. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be clearly seen from the plane window that the moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is blocked at the northern foot of the Central Plateau, forming a continuous cloud belt, and finally turns into rainfall and moistens the northern coast again. The central plateau, with an average altitude of nearly 2,000 meters, is cloudless and the sun is scorching; there is little vegetation on the ground and it is very dry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flight arrived over the Valley of Mexico, where the capital Mexico City is located, with an altitude of 2,240 meters, ranking eighth among the highest capitals in the world. Historically, this place was called Tenochtitlan. The precious precipitation from the central plateau gathered here and once formed continuous mountain lakes. It prospered as a result, and it perished five hundred years ago as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;City of the Gods&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although Mexico is the largest country in Central America, it has the Gobi Desert that stretches to North America in the west and the warm and comfortable Baja California Peninsula, and Yucatan in the east The peninsula has lowland jungles and savannahs, as well as alluvial plains and swamps on the north and south coasts. The topography is very rich, but its country name comes from the almost isolated Valley of Mexico (Valle de México) on the central plateau. This is because when the Spanish came to this area in the early sixteenth century, the most powerful city-state Tenochtitlan was located in this valley. Later it became the capital of the colonists: Mexico City, and &quot;Mexico&quot; became the entire The name of the colony - &quot;x&quot; in Spanish is pronounced as &quot;h&quot;, and the Chinese transliteration of &quot;Mexico&quot; comes from this. If it is pronounced in English, it becomes &quot;Mexico&quot;, which does not match the local place name. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Valley of Mexico is actually a basin. The basin with an altitude of 2,200 meters is surrounded by volcanoes with an altitude of 5,000 meters, which is insurmountable. Therefore, there are no outflow rivers here, and all the rainfall meltwater completely flows to the bottom of the valley, forming a rare large mountain lake in history - Lake Texcoco. Its water area reaches 5,400 square kilometers, and it is the largest freshwater lake in my country, Poyang Lake. about 1.7 times. Due to strong evaporation, the water depth of Lake Texcoco changes greatly throughout the year, forming a wetland around the lake that is repeatedly submerged and then exposed. This is very similar to the Tonle Sap Lake (&lt;span style) reported by this edition in October this year. =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Cambodia: The Trisolaran World of Tonle Sap Lake&quot;&lt;/span>;). This wetland around the lake is a rare livable place in the vast plateau. Primitive agriculture was developed here, making it one of the important birthplaces of ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/Nf39MYflXfYxj5apLbXJpHlupSO19gKxLQIhwXey.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/Nf39MYflXfYxj5apLbXJpHlupSO19gKxLQIhwXey.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172829&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mexico Valley Location Map&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to archaeologists Excavations have shown that humans lived here 12,000 years ago, and the city was formed around 1200 BC. The specific location was on the west bank of Lake Texcoco, on the western outskirts of today&#39;s Mexico City - China at that time was still in the late Shang Dynasty. The Wuding and Zhongxing periods. The city was later destroyed by a volcanic eruption on the west side of the lake. The people migrated to the east coast of the lake and settled in a mountain depression called Teotihuacan by later generations, creating an ancient city with a thousand-year civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ruins of Teotihuacan are Mexico&#39;s first World Cultural Heritage and a must-see for travelers. I went to visit it on the second day after arriving in Mexico City. The main landscape is a north-south central axis of the city called &quot;Yellow Springs Avenue&quot;, with dense Mesoamerican-style trapezoidal pyramid buildings on the east and west sides. The two largest pyramids are almost equally tall according to visual inspection, but the Moon Pyramid located at the north end of the avenue is higher, so the Sun Pyramid located on the east side of the middle of the avenue is actually taller. The base of the latter is square with a side length of about 225 meters. The top of the remaining tower is about 64 meters high. Originally, there was a magnificent temple built on the top platform, but since the entire ancient city was abandoned 1,200 years ago, the temple has been completely lost. Now it is impossible to know which god this temple was built for. , and it is not clear what the exact height of this pyramid was in its heyday. What we can determine is that it was built around 100 AD using 3 million tons of boulders without metal tools, livestock for transport, or vehicles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/6VDvlpq1qBNnMXsYZMRHeDeKWNVKF6KeQanjxuBk.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/6VDvlpq1qBNnMXsYZMRHeDeKWNVKF6KeQanjxuBk.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172830&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Imagination of Central American indigenous people building pyramids&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;I came here in mid-January, and chubby local tourists wearing short-sleeves and braving the scorching sun were waiting in a long line to climb the Pyramid of the Sun: the tower has four floors, and you have to queue up again on each floor before you can finally leave. It takes 2 hours to climb the 248 steps to the top of the tower. I sighed and gave up my plan to check in at the world&#39;s third largest pyramid. Instead, I climbed up the Pyramid of the Moon with steep steps, opened a can of Mountain Dew, and breathed calmly while looking down at the Huangquan Avenue in front of me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teotihuacan means &quot;City of the Gods&quot;. Like the &quot;Avenue of Yellow Springs&quot;, &quot;Pyramid of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Pyramid of the Moon&quot;, they are all speculations of later generations about this thousand-year-old city - - Since the Teotihuacan civilization left no written language and the stones themselves cannot speak, historians do not know its origins. They only know that it was a city-state civilization that originated in 200 BC. Its heyday was about 20 years ago. With a population of more than 10,000, it declined before the eighth century AD, leaving only the magnificent buildings and exquisite stone carvings that amazed future generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/25/BDcWwdorOlRgNdGuxLJwAIiD4avXQN84Icp0YXyE.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1446&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/25/BDcWwdorOlRgNdGuxLJwAIiD4avXQN84Icp0YXyE.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172645&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The ruins of Teotihuacan are among the first batch of World Cultural Heritage sites in Mexico. The picture shows the Avenue of the Yellow Springs from the Pyramid of the Moon. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first wave of descendants of Teotihuacan were the Toltecs - the descendants were not Descendants, but those who come after. The Toltecs established a new city-state in Tula, not far to the northwest, and named this deserted but awe-inspiring ruins Teotihuacan, which means the place where the gods built: they obviously It’s hard to believe that this largest ancient city in Mesoamerica was built by humans themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second group of descendants of Teotihuacan were the Aztecs. They named the central axis of the ancient city &quot;Avenue of the Yellow Spring&quot; and named the two largest pyramids after the Sun. and the Pyramid of the Moon. They believe that the magnificent pyramids are mausoleums built by the gods for their ancestors, and these dead ancestors are the potential driving force supporting the movement of the sun - this is based on a method from Teotihuacan to Toltec to Aztec. Ke&#39;s consistent and unique world view is that the survival of the world depends on human sacrifice: nourishing the operation of the world with human life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs are the protagonists of this story, the founders of Tenochtitlan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Lake Country&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Tenochtitlan is often called the &quot;Aztec Empire&quot; today, with the name ranging from &quot;Aztec&quot; to &quot;Empire&quot; In fact, it is not appropriate. Let’s talk about the Aztecs (&lt;span>;Aztec&lt;/span>;) first. This is a legendary nomadic group from northwestern Mexico. They migrated south along the desolate Mexican plateau and finally arrived in the Valley of Mexico, which is rich in water and grass. They settled here and became vassals of the Toltecs. After the demise of the Toltec civilization, they integrated with other local ethnic groups for a long time and formed an alliance among three major city-states. They used a common language and called themselves Mexica (&lt;span>;Mexica&lt;/span>;). That is, the people who lived in the Valley of Mexico formed a national identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we use China as an analogy, this is equivalent to the alliance between the two tribes of the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor to build a national identity. Their descendants consider themselves descendants of Yan and Huang, and they call themselves China based on the middle land where they live. People - the &quot;descendants of Yan and Huang&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot; here can roughly correspond to the two concepts of &quot;Aztec&quot; and &quot;Mexican&quot;. But it is obviously not appropriate to call China the &quot;Yanhuang Kingdom&quot;, because &quot;Yanhuang&quot; is an ancient myth passed down from ancient times; similarly, the &quot;Aztecs&quot; are also an ethnic group that exists in ancient myths, and they combine the real It is also inappropriate to call the country of the Mexica &quot;the Aztecs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;empire&quot;, as mentioned earlier, this is actually a loose alliance between three city-states, and there is no unified empire. Therefore, the so-called &quot;Aztec Empire&quot; was actually an alliance of city-states led by Tenochtitlan in the Valley of Mexico. These indigenous people called themselves Mexica and believed that they were descendants of the Aztecs. The civilization they established is now called the Aztec civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/lWSWglsDOpKmCPaHu3pYwguCJR01ShDiYqOG5Ijl.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/lWSWglsDOpKmCPaHu3pYwguCJR01ShDiYqOG5Ijl.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Restored map of Tenochtitlan, with east at the top. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what kind of city-state was Tenochtitlan? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that when the Aztecs moved south, they received a message from the oracle to find an eagle sitting on a cactus with a snake in its mouth. That was their new breeding ground. When they arrived at a sandbar on the west shore of Lake Texcoco after a long journey, they saw this scene and settled on the sandbar. They named the sandbar Tenochtitlan after Chief Tenoch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs built three long embankments to connect the sandbar and the lake shore from the north, west and south. They also built a long embankment between the sandbar and the center of the lake to isolate the waves. and attacks from across the Great Lake; they diverted mountain spring water from the west coast and supplied drinking water to the sandbar through the causeway; because the volcanic ash is rich in minerals, the soil around Tenochtitlan is very suitable for farming, and they rely on corn as their main food , also grow pumpkins, beans and amaranth; they also invented a type of floating island agriculture called chinampa (&lt;span>;chinampa&lt;/span>;), which is somewhat similar to the polders in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, using silt from the bottom of the lake to create fields. , fixed with wooden stakes and wickers, to form fertile artificial islands and expand the planting area; there are no domestic animals such as horses, cattle, and sheep in the American continent, and there are no fish in Lake Texcoco. They mainly raise dogs, rabbits, chickens and ducks to obtain For protein, the way to cook is to bake it on a stone slab &lt;span>;——&lt;/span>; Because the Aztec civilization was still in the Bronze Age and did not have iron pots; they laid a sewage system and put a large pot at the pipe joint. The garbage in the sewage settles in the large tank and sends people to clean it regularly; they implement Spartan-style military education for all people, while the nobles and rich can learn cultural knowledge; because there is no iron, their weapons are made of obsidian Spears, swords and arrowheads - obsidian is the &quot;national stone&quot; of Mexico. It is a natural glass formed after the cooling and condensation of volcanic lava. It is obviously not very durable. The obsidian dagger I brought back from Mexico returned to Shanghai on the first day It broke while my son was playing with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/W9JLbcakm7OzBudPVGpVAOBHEaCV2ORjAbGGJAfh.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/W9JLbcakm7OzBudPVGpVAOBHEaCV2ORjAbGGJAfh.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;172834&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Obsidian arrow cluster&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Aztecs will witness The place where the oracle was spoken was designated as the center of the city-in their view, it was also the unquestionable center of the universe-and their temple was built here. This temple was later destroyed by the Spanish, and the first Catholic church in Mexico was built in front of it using the removed stones to suppress the &quot;evil spirits&quot; of the pagans. This is today&#39;s Catedral Metropolitana in Mexico City. ). 457 years later, municipal workers accidentally unearthed an important relic of the Aztec temple: the stone statue of the Moon Goddess. The Mexican government decided to demolish the building above the site and fully excavate the great temple so that the Aztecs could The gods are revealed again. So, today we can see two world cultural heritage buildings located side by side on the north side of Constitution Square in the center of Mexico City. On the west side is the Baroque Cathedral, and on the east side is the semi-open-air Tenochtitlan Cathedral. Temple ruins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Constitution Square has existed since ancient times. As early as the Aztec era, it was a large open-air market next to the Great Temple. The Spanish could raze the pagan capital to the ground, but they could not destroy a square into a primeval forest, so they left it as the central square in front of the cathedral. In &lt;span>;1821&lt;/span>;, in order to celebrate the promulgation of the Diaz Constitution after Mexico&#39;s independence, it was named Constitution Square. The government once planned to build an independence monument on the square, but due to financial reasons, it only laid a foundation. The Spanish word for &lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>;foundation &lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>; is called &lt;span>;zócalo&lt;/span>;, so this place is half realistically and half mockingly called &lt;span>;Zócalo&lt; by people from all walks of life in the capital. /span>;square. Unexpectedly, the central squares in other Mexican cities would also be called this name after the capital.

&lt;p>;阿兹特克人自认为是太阳的后裔，相信日出是太阳神战胜黑暗的结果。他们认为世界已经毁灭过四次，如今正处于太阳神与黑暗群神的第五次较量之中，太阳神需要子民为他提供滋养，那就是人血。因此，阿兹特克人不分男女，从小就习惯于使用尖锐的龙舌兰刺在耳垂、舌头、胸膛乃至生殖器采血祭神，祭司则从自己的太阳穴蘸血作画，敬献给太阳神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，采血祭祀只是个人行为，比采血更神圣的祭祀仪式是公开的活人献祭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;已故美国考古学家Patricia R.Anawalt曾在其论文《对阿兹特克人祭的理解》中开章明义地说过：“用活人作祭品，无论在新大陆还是在旧大陆都出现过。这样的例子不仅在中美洲找得到，在美索不达米亚、埃及和中国也都找得到。所不同的是阿兹特克的人祭早已为人所知，而对旧大陆的古老文化的认识则是最近的事。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以我国为例，上世纪二十年代末启动的安阳殷墟发掘工作让我们得以了解殷商时期的大规模活人献祭，仅殷墟一地发现的人祭尸骨即达到3684具。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而阿兹特克人的人祭行为在西班牙征服者的渲染之下更让人触目惊心，考古挖掘的新发现则证明西班牙人的记载并非对于失败者的一味抹黑。比如，墨西哥考古学家曾在大神庙附近意外挖出大批骷髅头骨，它们并不像一般的万人坑、乱葬岗，而是朝着同一个方向整齐地排成三维矩阵。经过清理，考古学家奇怪地发现，所有头骨两侧都有破洞，显然是被人为凿穿的。最后当整片遗址发掘完毕，大家才明白是怎么回事：原来这里曾经是一个三十多米长、四米多高的五排石架，架子上插着许多木梁，木梁上穿着成排的头骨——正如西班牙人的记载。后来这里被泥土掩埋，木梁朽坏，便形成了地下头骨矩阵。考古学家用阿兹特克人的语言将这片遗址命名为“骷髅之墙”，挑选了三具头骨用木梁串起来，展示于大神庙后侧的博物馆中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结合文字记录与考古发掘成果，如今已经可以大致还原大神庙的活人献祭：在广大国民的围观之下，被献祭的人牲在大神庙前列成长队，一个个被带上四层平台，仰面躺在双祭坛前的人牲石上；由主祭司手持黑曜石匕首切开人牲的胸膛，掏出尚在跳动的心脏，供奉给太阳神；尸体沿石阶扔下基座，由次一级的祭司将其首级割下，剥去头皮，在头骨两侧钻孔后穿在刚才提到的骷髅架上；人牲的四肢被肢解，交还给他们的提供者，躯干则被遗弃，人牲的鲜血会和玉米饼和在一起作为与神灵沟通的食物，以至于西班牙人来到大神庙时，首先注意到的就是石阶上积累近两百年的血迹和它散发的浓重气味。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;至于上文提到人牲的“提供者”，这涉及墨西哥谷的地缘政治。阿兹特克人近乎狂热地使用活人献祭来维持太阳东升西落，祈求农业风调雨顺，在一片干旱粗粝的高原上维续这座湿地城邦的有限农业资源。但他们并不想耗费自己的人力资源，因此热衷于四出征讨，获得战俘以供祭祀。后来周围部落都被打服了，不愿继续作战，甘心每隔八个月向特诺奇蒂特兰上缴一次贡品。但阿兹特克人依然不肯收手，继续发动其“荣冠”战争，也就是没有宗教、政治、领土和经济诉求，纯粹为了获得人口用于献祭的战争，类似原始部落“猎头族”的行为，最后演变为各个臣服部落定期向特诺奇蒂特兰献出人口，供其屠杀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了上述常规的人祭方式，还有两种特殊的人祭值得一提：一是为了献祭太阳神暨战神，更为“高端”的祭品是俘获的敌国将领，他被绳索拴在一块大石头上无法逃脱，使用羽毛棒与手持狼牙棒和盾牌的本族武士搏斗。如果他能够连胜四人，再与一个左撇子武士搏斗获得胜利，就可以重获自由——当然，这纯属赤裸裸的欺负人；二是为了献祭雨神，使用的祭品是儿童——阿兹特克人相信儿童在祭祀过程中流下的眼泪将会变成灌溉农田的雨水而带来丰收。作为一个父亲，我就不详述这项祭祀的过程了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/VOjzDzuXu2Y8ilgysMO5wzjd5jWj0bdrFK46AXj7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;638&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/26/VOjzDzuXu2Y8ilgysMO5wzjd5jWj0bdrFK46AXj7.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;科尔特斯首先在尤卡坦半岛东岸的Cozumel岛登陆补给，那里现在是加勒比海邮轮之旅中最重要的港口之一。然后他率领船队沿着尤卡坦半岛向西绕行，被沿途的原住民视为天神下凡：原住民没有见过马，也没有见过骑兵，所以认为骑兵是长着四条腿能够移动如飞的神怪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科尔特斯知道自己人单势孤，无法与人数超过五百万人的整个原住民阵营相抗衡，但他很快发现，这个阵营并非铁板一块，而是由特诺奇蒂特兰主导的三城联盟，统治着一群弱小的部落，对抗墨西哥谷以东的两个敌对城邦。特诺奇蒂特兰的敌国们深知其嗜血本性，坚决不肯屈服；特诺奇蒂特兰的属国们则长期匍匐于其暴政之下，不断付出供品和人牲，同样叫苦不迭。于是，科尔特斯明智地与这两个城邦结盟，共同对付特诺奇蒂特兰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在特诺奇蒂特兰这边，阿兹特克人非常崇敬统治墨西哥谷的前辈托尔特克人，全盘接收了托尔特克人的世界观。根据托尔特克人的神话传说，他们离开了墨西哥中部高原，在墨西哥湾下海前往东方追寻羽蛇神——中美洲多个文明所供奉的主神，并将于1519年跟随白色皮肤的羽蛇神从东方回归墨西哥谷。所以，当国王蒙特祖马二世听说一群“漂浮的城堡”从东方蹈海而来，在墨西哥湾登陆，他的第一认知是：神灵回归人间了！ &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;一年后的1521年5月，对特诺奇蒂特兰的地形与弱点已经了如指掌的科尔特斯带着九百名西班牙援军和十万名土著盟军卷土重来。天下苦阿兹特克久矣！过去的属国纷纷反戈一击，形成了墙倒众人推的态势。阿兹特克人孤军奋战，在错综复杂的河网中凭据一座座浮岛、一栋栋房屋负隅顽抗。 93天之后，整座岛城被夷为平地，特诺奇蒂特兰灭亡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联盟的中枢败亡后，整个墨西哥都被西班牙轻松控制。殖民者将这里命名为Nueva Espana，意为“新西班牙”。又过了三百年，到了1821年，墨西哥才获得独立。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这个网名叫“才哥（全国相亲)”的“婚介主播”长期在短视频平台发布相亲信息，明码标价彩礼价格。被介绍相亲女性中有多位是智障人士，视频中不乏“18.8万，交钱结婚”这种令人严重不适的内容。网友怀疑，该网红是个公开明码标价的人贩子。该主播则表示他们是“正规婚介”，有需求可以到线下婚介所相亲，交完彩礼另付2万元介绍费就可以把人领走，“先结婚后恋爱”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事掀起舆论波澜，不少网友认为这是“人口贩卖”。 10月4日晚间，云南省弥勒市政府工作人员告诉《上游新闻》称已关注到此事，当地已经成立多部门组成的工作专班，分组对此事进行核查。细审这起事件，除了令人不适之外，更显露出一些深层次问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一，这起事件带来的最大问题是，如此短视频婚介存在哪些法律与道德上的破口？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;婚姻应该遵循自愿原则。 “自愿”应理解为可以自主表达，有完全民事行为能力，可以做出有法律效力的意思表示。然而，残障人士的情况比较特殊，是否可以行使完全民事行为能力登记结婚，需要分情况看待。如果残障人士只是肢体残疾而不影响辨认自己行为，则具有完全民事行为能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而如果残障人士是精神方面的残障，那么还可以细分为“不能完全辨认自己行为”的限制民事行为能力人，以及“不能辨认自己行为”的无民事行为能力人。限制民事行为能力人只能独立实施纯获利益的民事法律行为，或者与其智力、精神健康状况相适应的民事法律行为，其他的情况与无民事行为能力人一样，需要由监护人来代为行使民事权利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题在于，监护人是否有权代替残障人士行使民事权利，做出登记结婚的重大决定？在这起事件中，“婚介主播”的短视频多遵循“年龄＋智力状况＋广告语＋彩礼”的套路，明晃晃打出“相亲”“闪婚”的广告字眼，一开始就冲着“收钱结婚”去的。残障人士在此期间有无机会表达自己的真实意愿？或者，婚介方与监护人是否会征询残障人士的意见？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些问题的答案当然是大有疑问的。尤其是在有利益驱使的情况下，监护人未必会尊重残障人士的真实意愿。甚至于从人性角度来讲，监护人面临“丢掉一个累赘，收到一笔大钱”的真实激励。在这条婚介产业链上，残障人士成了最没有话语权的相关方，沦为婚介方与监护人的摇钱树。这有悖于起码的人伦道德，也存在法律上的疑问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在2021年的“河南省泌阳县55岁男子娶20岁智障女子”事件中，当事女性父亲的所作所为曾经引发巨大争议。作为智障女儿的监护人，父亲与继母一手做主“包办”了这场“婚姻”。事后官方调查组的结论是，两人同居不违法，但不能办理结婚证。这个案例就显示，类似“婚姻”的法律效力是存疑的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二，“人口贩卖”的疑云在事件中挥之不去，尤其是与“彩礼”结合到一起的时候。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这名“婚介主播”在接受音频采访时表示，“正常的女孩子彩礼在15万以上，最低也得10多万”“我们要拿两万的服务费”“一对一服务，过来一个成功一个”“两星期内领好证把老婆带回去”。诚如网友所言，挂着彩礼名号的“明码标价”，确实令人直接联想到人口贩卖。这不仅是观感上的不适，也同样涉嫌真正的违法犯罪行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不论这位“婚介主播”多么强调自己的“合法合规”，“拿到彩礼两星期内领证”的操作怎么看怎么都像是变相的人口贩卖，“来一个成功一个”的表述更是让人完全看不到残障女性在其中的发言权，这在根本上已经违背了《中华人民共和国民法典》中“婚姻自愿原则”的法律条文，唯一可以作为补丁的就是监护人的同意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监护人的意见真的就可以代表残障人士的自主意愿吗？这是存疑的。同时，十多万的高额彩礼，最终可以用来改善残障女性的婚后生活吗？这笔钱最终会落到谁的手里，也是不问可知。如果监护人“收钱给人”，那么这无异于银货两讫的人口贩卖，退一步讲也是不折不扣的强迫婚姻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更有甚者，类似“婚介产业”还开发了针对残障女性的“细分赛道”。因为容易被操控，他们甚至还可以“反复回收”残障女性。 “买家”在结婚生子之后还可以“退回媳妇”，然后再“介绍”给下一家去怀孕生产，“婚介所”从中再收取一笔佣金，这又无异于直接倒退回已经进入历史垃圾堆的“生育奴隶制”了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;婚姻的基础应该是爱与道德，而不是买卖与算计。但如果加入残障人士这个特殊变量，买卖婚姻甚至买卖人口的性质就加倍地凸显出来。面对如此明目张胆的“标价征婚”，有关部门理应拿出不亚于“泌阳事件”的严肃态度，追查其合规性，保障残障人士合法权益，维护婚姻家庭价值观，不能让残障人士成为一手交钱一手交货的现代奴隶。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Haruki Murakami and his new book &quot;Murakami&#39;s Secret Collection: Nostalgic and Beautiful Classical Music&quot; record&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(CFP photo/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese writer Haruki Murakami likes to collect, and one of the things he collects is classical music records, especially Regarding vinyl records, the previously published &quot;Murakami&#39;s Private Collection: Nostalgic and Beautiful Classical Music Records&quot; is a selection of the records he collected. In this small book, the format of which is made like a record cover, he said that he has visited record stores around the world in the past 60 years and bought more than 10,000 old records. He specially selected some of his favorites. , write down why you like it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Murakami stated clearly at the outset that this book &quot;is at best a book of personal preferences and interests, without any systematic or practical purpose, and there is no such thing as &#39;This is a must-listen to this piece of music!&#39;&quot; recommendation intention”. This book is like a continuation of the earlier &quot;Murakami T&quot;. Readers like Haruki Murakami very much and want to know what clothes he wears and what records he listens to, that&#39;s all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, every piece of classical music has countless recording versions. Different conductors, orchestras, performance times, and even the same piece of music but different recording and pressing techniques make each record version unique. . In today&#39;s vast number of streaming music platforms, there are only the tip of the iceberg with different recorded versions. When reading this book by Murakami, I always think: Ah! It turns out that this song also has this version, and I really want to listen to it. However, it is not easy to retrieve the records introduced in the book according to the diagram. After all, many of the records introduced by Murakami in the book were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. You can either try your luck in old record stores or You can go to the famous record trading website discogs to hunt for treasures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Murakami said that his choice of records is based on personal preference, so many classical music fans have opinions on his choice, but when it comes to personal preference, naturally everyone has what they like. different. Just like Murakami himself said that he doesn&#39;t like pianist Alfred Brendel very much, but Brendel is liked by many people. Which version and conductor you like is often related to your own experience. Since Murakami is a good friend with the famous conductor Seiji Ozawa, he naturally prefers Ozawa Seiji’s version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond personal experience, another reason is the preference for interpretation of music. Sometimes musicians’ interpretation of music is very distinctive (even to the point of sensationalism), and music fans do not pay the price (or The reason why I like it (in turn) is relatively easy to explain. For example: Mahler&#39;s Seventh Symphony, if you listen to Otto Klemperer&#39;s version (compared to most versions, the whole piece is almost 20 minutes long), the extremely slow style feels like Watching the train in the distance enter the platform, the train gradually approaches but always seems to never arrive. Some people say this is a kind of tension, but I don&#39;t like it very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what, Murakami always has his own unique approach when writing these music reviews, so that even if readers are just reading Murakami’s short reviews of classical records, they still have the pleasure of reading Haruki Murakami’s words. For example, he said that Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 25 recorded by pianist Friedrich Gulda with the Vienna Philharmonic (conducted by Abbado) sounded “like eating clear soup udon at an Osaka udon shop” Such an incredible sense of security&quot;; or when Sir Thomas Beecham conducts Haydn&#39;s Symphony No. 94, there is always an impression of &quot;a graceful old-time British gentleman, even the &#39;surprise&#39; part of the second movement, The method of frightening is also steady and elegant. Even a woman holding a tea cup will not be frightened to the point where the black tea will overflow.&quot; These metaphors are very unique and very Haruki Murakami. How could Mozart or Gulda ever think that his work would turn into a bowl of Osaka&#39;s clear soup udon? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, back to an important question: Why listen to vinyl records when listening to classical music now? Or the bigger question is: How can vinyl records be brought back to life? The return of vinyl records is one of the most inspiring stories in the history of human development. It has obviously been obsolete by the times, heavy and fragile, and has a pitiful carrying capacity, but facts have proved that as long as it is valuable, even if it is full of shortcomings, it still has the meaning of existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haruki Murakami said in &quot;Murakami&#39;s Private Collection: Nostalgic and Beautiful Classical Music Records&quot; that listening to vinyl records is &quot;the kind of thing that will respond as long as you treat it carefully.&quot; In an age where everything is digital, giving and responding have long become a very formal exchange. Everything is just a button in exchange for a reaction, and the satisfaction gained by giving with heart has been lost. Just like no matter how carefully and gently you touch the streaming music platform on your mobile phone to play music, there will never be any difference in the music played (so in fact, we naturally don’t touch our mobile phones so gently). The quality of &quot;responsiveness&quot; has become rare in today&#39;s cold world, which is why vinyl records are enjoying a renaissance today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When listening to vinyl records, from buying the record to playing it, every step requires &quot;careful treatment&quot;. One of them is audio playback. Whether listening to vinyl records or streaming platforms, it is a knowledge as deep as the sea. For example, the most basic turntable, pre- and post-amplifiers (audio amplifiers), speakers, or the cartridge and stylus used in the turntable, the wires and connectors for connecting the equipment, and even the record pads on the turntable for placing records, are all very particular. Haruki Murakami also said that audio is a &quot;hobby that can only be cultivated if you have some spare time. There is nothing you can do about it, you can only have this awareness.&quot; Having said that, as long as you don&#39;t buy an all-in-one playback turntable that only costs a few hundred yuan and only looks good, a simple set of decent entry-level audio equipment is actually affordable, and it can already reflect the preciousness of vinyl records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not just audio equipment, buying (and finding) vinyl discs is also an activity that requires dedication. In places like Europe and the United States, there are stores selling second-hand items such as The Salvation Army and Lexi Club in different communities. In these thrift stores, there will always be a corner filled with boxes of old records. If there are some responsible people, The store clerk (or the neater owner) will sort the records and put them away. At this time, slowly squat down, flip through the records one by one, and take a look. Each one is unknown, and you can meet your favorites at any time. These old records are often only priced at ten yuan or eighty yuan, which is incredibly cheap. Unlike other used record stores, these used stores are non-profit-making. The people in charge do not have time to set prices slowly, and they usually do not understand the market and the value of the goods like an insider. So, it’s easy to find treasures in these thrift stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the records bought at thrift stores are in different states. It usually takes more time to clean them properly, and sometimes you get damaged records. There is no way to avoid these, so you have to Check carefully when buying. But as Haruki Murakami said, even if it is an old record, as long as it is cleaned carefully (cleaning records is also knowledgeable), there will still be a significant difference in the playback sound quality before and after cleaning. At least the stylus will not accumulate accumulation after the record is played. A pile of dirt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, stores that specialize in old records often do basic cleaning of the records and clearly indicate the condition and quality of the records. Correspondingly, the prices will be correspondingly expensive. Comparing different record stores around the world, Japanese record stores tend to be the neatest and cleanest. No wonder my good friend, Mr. Jiao Yuanpu, said that when he goes to a second-hand record store in Japan, he spends 7 hours every time there, and he goes there from dawn to dusk. Listening to his sharing, it is a very big sacrifice in terms of both mental and financial resources. Of course, it will be rewarded with a bumper harvest every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大城府：泰国那一抹“永恒的微笑”丨古国多少事⑦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257366]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;Dark red ocean&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, whether you charter a car from Khao San Road in Bangkok or take a train to make an appointment For an hour, when you can see the spiers and the splendid street signs in the distance, the strong historical atmosphere will come to you - Ayutthaya is located on the alluvial plain of the Chao Phraya River, above the tide line of the Gulf of Siam, surrounded by the Mekong River. Surrounded by the Nan River, the Lopburi River and the Pasak Canal, it forms a unique island city. There are waterways leading to the Gulf of Siam in the south, which can connect China and Southeast Asian countries. It also tightly controls the sea gateway of Sukhothai in the north, becoming a gateway for China, India, and The geographical connection point between Europe and the United States also gave it unique conditions in trade, military, and diplomacy: from the 14th to the 18th century, its developed water and land transportation and dazzling Buddhist architecture made its reputation famous in Southeast Asia and even the entire Asia, and was even regarded as Southeast Asia. The largest and most beautiful city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199733&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Buddha statues and relics at Wat Mahathat&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1350, the leader of the Luo Zhen (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;now Lopburi&lt;/span>;) regime on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River was Ramathetbodhi (&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ramathibodi I, King Uthong&lt;/span>;) defeated Thailand&#39;s first feudal dynasty, the Sukhothai dynasty, and Luo Zhen merged with Siam, the Supan regime on the east bank of the river, to establish A The Yudaya Dynasty is called &quot;Siam&quot; in Chinese historical records. When Bangkok was still a little-known fishing village, the capital of the Ayutthaya Dynasty was already a prosperous &quot;big city&quot; - Chinese people in Thailand thought this city was the largest, so it was called &quot;Ayutthaya&quot;, and even the dynasty was also called &quot;Ayutthaya Dynasty&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In historical documents, Ayutthaya is called &quot;Paradise&quot;. At its peak, the population was about 1 million. Three royal palaces, more than 2,000 gilded minaret temples and more than 4,000 gilded Buddha statues made this place full of charm. The dynasty, which lasted 33 kings and lasted for 417 years, brought Buddhist culture to its peak. In the middle and late period of the Ayutthaya Dynasty, Zhang Xie of the Ming Dynasty also wrote in his &quot;Siam Articles&quot; in &quot;The Examination of Eastern and Western Oceans&quot;: &quot;The soil is wet underneath, the climate is hot and humid, and the people live in high-rise buildings. The rattan system is very strong, with rattan mats and bamboo mats for sleeping in the middle. The palace is more than nine feet high, decorated with gold and carved with eight trigrams, which is extremely magnificent.&quot; Beginning in the 16th century, Ayutthaya&#39;s reputation spread far and wide to Europe, in 1512 The Portuguese first arrived here in 1988, and Ayutthaya gradually became a trade center in the 17th century, with envoys from various European countries arriving in droves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the main color of Ayutthaya a few hundred years ago was gold, now here, to be more arbitrary, the city center only has two colors: reddish brown and burnt black: reddish brown is the dusty bricks of the building. Scorched by the scorching sun and eroded by wind and rain, the uneven floors and walls turned into a dark red ocean. Many ancient temples in Ayutthaya appear to be replicas of Angkor Wat at first glance, but after careful inspection, you will find that unlike Angkor temples, which are mostly made of large stones, red bricks are mostly used here; there are no carved walls, There are thousands of corridors here, but many unique architectural styles of the Ayutthaya Dynasty are derived here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wat Lokaya Sutha (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Lokaya Sutha&lt;/span>;) can no longer be called a &quot;temple&quot;. In a piece of overgrown grass, a huge reclining Buddha is exposed in nature to accept worship; the Wat Phra Si San Phet built in 1491 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Phra Si San Phet (Temple of the Three Kings) The three remaining white Ceylon-style pagodas are lined up in a row and have become landmarks in Ayutthaya: In 1492, in order to enshrine the ashes of his father and brother, Rama Tepbodhi II built two pagodas in the temple. The pagoda started Thailand&#39;s funeral custom of using pagodas to store the king&#39;s ashes. In 1529, when Ramathebodhi II died, his son built another pagoda. Today, time has not completely destroyed them. Although the many small towers built by successive kings nearby are seriously damaged, they are still majestic and towering, like solemn guards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the east of Wat Pasi Sangbi is the Rajapurana Temple (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312) which is famous for the magnificent pagoda in the main courtyard. , STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Ratchaburana&lt;/span>;). This Khmer-style pagoda was originally Thai-style. It was built by the ninth king to hold the cremation for his two brothers who died in a duel for succession to the throne: in 1424, King Indraja died, and the two brothers fought each other on elephants. After the death of the first prince, the third son inherited the throne from Phitsanulok and became Borommarachathirat II (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat II&lt;/span>;). This temple houses the ashes of my brother. After passing through the gate with only one wall left like Ruins of St. Paul&#39;s, you are surrounded by fragmented Buddha statues and walls, as if you suddenly fell into the distant ancient times. On the main tower, which looks like a stick of corn, there are layers of corrugated tower decorations; surrounded by four small Ceylon-style towers, it is the most complete Khmer-style pagoda in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The oldest temple in the city is in the southeast corner outside the moat, Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho&lt;/span >;) Built in 1357 by King Utong to commemorate the birth of the dynasty. Different from the ruined temples in the city that are full of vicissitudes of life, traces of reconstruction can be seen everywhere here, but they do not make people feel obtrusive. They are not even as good as the yellow silk draped in the pagoda. The visual contrast with the mottled red bricks is strong. The 28-meter-long white reclining Buddha is the symbol here. Wearing a yellow cassock, he lies peacefully on his side under the hot white sun, looking indifferently at the weather-beaten land and rivers around him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Climb up to the Ceylon-style main tower. There are eight Buddha statues inside. What is even more unforgettable is that a strange mixed smell permeates it. The smell of gunpowder smoke is mixed with the smell of decaying plants, and more of the human body stench. , making it difficult to breathe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chaiwatthanaram Temple, the back of the Buddha statue&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;The dark reflection of prosperity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the tourists disappeared, only a piece of tranquility washed over the years remained around the reclining Buddha in Yacha Mengkong Temple - around the main tower, many headless Buddha statues stood silently , seeming not to want to tell the story of their experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The name of Ayutthaya comes from the birthplace of Rama in the Indian epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the place where Rama ascended the throne after his triumphant return (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ayodhya&lt;/span>;), Sanskrit means &quot;the invincible city&quot; or &quot;the city of eternal victory&quot;, but this name is just like the prophecy: as the second largest city after the Khmer Empire A &quot;superpower&quot; in Southeast Asia, when the Ayutthaya Dynasty reached its peak, the war between it and Myanmar also continued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All glory must come to an end. In 1766, King Meng Bo of Myanmar, who had coveted Ayutthaya for a long time, led his army to siege the city for 14 months. After 14 months of siege, he blew down the city wall and entered the city. After 15 days of burning, killing and looting, 30,000 people were taken prisoner and Ayutthaya was almost razed to the ground. Flat ground. The invincible city was destroyed in the war - the longest dynasty in the history of the Kingdom of Thailand, with all its splendor, came to an abrupt end in 1767, leaving only a dozen temples that had been &quot;washed away from the glory&quot;. ——There are many black fire stains on the red bricks, and the Buddha statues were also blackened by the flames. They stood silently in the city, testifying to the golden age of the Ayutthaya Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ayutthaya, the opposite of red is black. South of the Rajapurana Temple, Wat Mahathat (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Mahathat&lt;/span>;) is said to be the primary target of the Burmese army&#39;s attack on Thailand: This monastery was built in 1374 during the reign of King Borommarachathirat I (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat I&lt;/span>;) and had 10 In the remaining monasteries, there are more than 200 pagodas like a jungle. Now only the huge square pagoda base is left in the middle of the temple, and many of the smaller pagodas are seriously tilted and crumbling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rows of headless Buddha statues at Chaiwatthanaram Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In Ayutthaya temples, many of the Buddha statues &quot;sitting in rows&quot; have no heads. A pair of stone Buddha feet or a huge Buddha hand will be &quot;surprised&quot; in the corner on the ground. The look is very &quot;post-modern&quot; &quot;. Perhaps for this reason, many tourists like to bend their knees and hide behind the Buddha statue, and stick their heads out from the broken neck of the Buddha statue to take pictures. In fact, the Buddha statues and pagodas in Wat Mahathat were plated with gold or contained gold leaves, which led the Burmese army to behead the Buddha statues or burn them in fires, causing the gold to separate from the stone, causing expansion and contraction of the Buddha statues&#39; heads. , hands and feet were broken, leaving the remains of limbs and arms devastated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ayutthaya is like the Old Summer Palace. The sunlight paints the high tower of Wat Chaiwatthanaram (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Chaiwatthanaram&lt;/span>;) in golden color, giving the red bricks a fierce beauty. , taking people back to the war-torn era. When the red has turned to black, the pagoda stands alone. The mottled pagodas, broken brick walls, dark Buddha statues, and vast monuments ruthlessly cover up the prosperity and destruction. Only the remaining documents and oral stories are passed down from generation to generation, and the years are like a passing cloud - -The prosperity of the prosperous times will also become the reflection of disillusionment, just like the long-lasting lonely back of the Buddha statue sitting high on the almost collapsed base in Chaiwatthanaram Temple in the sunset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the army invaded, the Buddhist temples were completely destroyed. Wherever the knife fell, as the writer Ondajie said, &quot;the towering Buddha image with profound meaning fell to the ground and fell into the soil.&quot; Over a long period of time, a Buddha&#39;s head was tightly wrapped by the thousand-year-old Bodhi root, and the surrounding branches and vines entangled it, forming the wonder of a tree wrapping the Buddha&#39;s head. It is also the most famous &quot;eternal smile&quot; of Wat Mahathat. . Just like the &quot;endgame&quot; of the view of Ta Prohm Temple in Angkor Wat, the strangulation phenomenon of trees in Southeast Asia will eventually cause plants to replace their hosts. However, the Buddha statue is still smiling in the Bodhi tree with his eyes closed and saying nothing, as if he has watched the changes in the dynasty. , it is a kind of magical demeanor that is with everything and transcends life and death, allowing people to stand in front of it and stare at it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The wonder of the Buddha head wrapped in a tree at the Mahathat Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Thousands of people spent time building the Ayutthaya City, and the Ayutthaya City watched the world created by these thousands of people in the light and shadow. After the fall of the Ayutthaya dynasty, Taksin moved the Thai capital nearly 100 kilometers south to Thonburi. After only 15 years of the Thonburi dynasty, the Bangkok dynasty established its capital in Bangkok in 1782, writing prosperity on the new land, and Ayutthaya was Fading out of people&#39;s sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two hundred years have passed by, and now it is more like a small town full of rural atmosphere and leisure atmosphere. In the ruins park, lawns, green trees, and ponds create an idyllic scene; locals will spread out mats for picnics, or rent traditional costumes to imitate the popular TV series &quot;A Match Made in Heaven&quot; that was filmed here, and take photos in the ruins. The red and black ruins are close to the newly built houses and temples. The fireworks and water blend among the ruined bricks and stones, giving a sense of astonishment as if you have traveled through time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199734&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Elephant on the lawn of Bangbain Summer Palace&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Between Ayutthaya and Bangkok, Bang Pa-In Summer Palace was built in the 17th century (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Bang Pa-In Summer Palace&lt;/span>; ) is the largest and most beautiful royal palace in Thailand.

In many cases, it can reflect the history and present of a society. , China and foreign countries are no exception. Everyone who has traveled to Europe will have experienced the toilet dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are generally very few public toilets in European countries, and it is often only possible to find one within a few kilometers, so there are apps for finding toilets in Europe. In contrast, in China, the function of finding toilets is covered by map apps. It is not a popular feature and cannot support an APP alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being cheap, toilets in Europe also charge a fee. In many European countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and other places, you have to pay to use public toilets. For example, most of the toilets in high-speed service areas or shopping malls in Germany have to pay. Even the toilets in fast food restaurants, shopping malls, train stations, McDonald&#39;s, and KFC are charged. For example, in Cologne, Germany, there is a fee for using the toilets inside McDonald&#39;s. For another example, a KFC in Poland posted a notice: The restrooms in the store are only available to customers. People without consumption receipts need to pay 30 zloty (approximately 53 yuan) if they want to use the restroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also various forms of charging. There is a person sitting at the door to collect the fee, there is a gate that rotates after a coin is inserted, and some are trustworthy and put a tip tray. In some stores, the toilet door has a password, and the password is printed on the shopping receipt. Not every floor of German department stores has restrooms. They are usually located near the restaurant floor on the top floor. Using the restrooms is generally free, but if there are cleaners there, a tip of about 0.3 euros is usually required. If you are in a tourist area, we will also thoughtfully provide exchange rate conversion, and the prices in each country&#39;s currency are clearly marked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charges for European toilets are not cheap. The last trip to the toilet costs as little as 0.3 Euros and as much as 2 Euros. 1 euro is equivalent to 7.7 yuan, which is equivalent to between 2 yuan and 15 yuan. Even if the income is higher, going to the toilet in Europe is really not cheap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the richest regions in the world, Europe is also a region with the most complete &quot;social welfare&quot;. Why are there so few free public toilets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it’s because of history. In many European cities, such as London, England, Stockholm, Sweden, and Paris, France, there are semi-open open-air toilets on the streets. It wraps the lower body but can only be used by men. These open-air urinals are used very frequently in the local area. This strange street urinal has been around in Europe for nearly 200 years. This also reflects the historical origin of the lack of public toilets in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result of this historical path, people may not regard public toilets as a government obligation. In fact, public toilets in many places in Europe are basically privatized. In this case, solve the problem according to market thinking. Toilets require regular maintenance and repairs, and you also need to hire someone to clean them. Most European countries are developed countries, and labor costs are high. This has resulted in high maintenance costs for toilets. Businesses are unwilling to include it in a package of services, but charge separately. supply. Private toilets in European cafes, small bars and other commercial places assume some functions of public toilets. Of course, you must consume food first and then use the toilet. Europeans are also accustomed to paying to use public toilets, or go to a coffee shop to buy a cup of coffee to solve their internal problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in European countries is not exactly the same. In Denmark, which has high taxes and high welfare, the government believes that the freedom to use public toilets is a public service that the government must meet. Therefore, in the urban area of ​​Copenhagen, the capital city with a small population, there are sufficient public toilets, good environment, and they are free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Chinese toilets also used to charge fees. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, as the economy developed, cities in China began to build higher-grade public toilets one after another, implementing water flushing and mechanical pumping. As the level of public toilets has improved, the cost has also increased. Some cities have begun to charge for public toilets to alleviate the shortage of funds for public toilet construction and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the 20th century, with the further development of the economy, Chinese people began to have higher requirements for toilets. New residential areas were built, and toilets were increased from one to two bathrooms. However, public toilets are not free so early. In mid-tier cities like Qingdao, public toilets were not open for free until May 1, 2008, which is only 15 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free public toilets, after all, the government has money. After years of accumulation of reform and opening up, especially after joining the WTO, the economy has developed rapidly, real estate has taken off, and local governments have obtained sufficient funds from land finance, so they are able to bear the entire cost of public toilets. Therefore, free public toilets in China are mainly the result of economic development. Whether to charge or not is closely related to the economic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Toilet charges are essentially a matter of government revenue and the scope of government public services. If the situation of public toilets in Europe is very bad, it is because of historical, cultural and customary reasons. Society has also developed various alternative forms and people have adapted to them. In some countries, the benefit of free public toilets has never appeared, and naturally it is not felt much. But if you return from free to paid again, you will have a different perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
