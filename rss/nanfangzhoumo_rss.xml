This city has the best coffee in Italy, and the headquarters of Illy is here. Like many cities that were once glorious and then fell into silence, this city is half reality and half exists in words. Trieste was once the most important port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a blend of Slavic, Latin and Germanic cultures. More than a hundred kilometers away, Venice has kept the world&#39;s attention in a flashy way. Although every stone that built it came from elsewhere, and all the beauty is artificial, the first sight of Venice will make you wonder. One feels amazed and mesmerized. In comparison, Trieste is a sleepy city. She is located in the northeastern border of Italy, more than ten kilometers away in Slovenia. It faces the sea, backed by karst rocks, and under the mountains are checkerboard-like neighborhoods. There are many deep houses and compounds on the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;James Morris, an Englishman who served as a soldier here, later changed his gender and became Jane Morris. After World War II, she wrote full-time and became a reporter for The Guardian and a famous travel writer. In her book &quot;Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere&quot; (Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere), Trieste is an unforgettable city, but when she tried to remember it, she found that it was like an unforgettable city. Presented face. This city has no unforgettable scenery, no unique food, and it doesn’t even have an Italian flavor. In a 1999 survey, 70% of Italians didn’t even know that this city belongs to Italy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, Trieste also has her unique charm. This former free port chose to be included in Italy during the dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy in the last century. The chaotic past can stimulate people&#39;s imagination and reflection. She is more literary than any other city. At the beginning of the last century, Joyce lived in many places in this city. He worked as an English teacher and began to write &quot;Ulysses&quot; here. For him, Trieste was a particularly draining place for his liver. Joyce interacted with the melancholy Italo Svevo, encouraged the Jewish businessman to write, and highly praised his &quot;Zeno&#39;s Consciousness&quot;. Svevo&#39;s writing has a slowness that is rare in Italian. Most of the writing is about a businessman questioning his own conscience, which complements the thoughtfulness of a stream-of-consciousness novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a kind of continuity in the literature of this city. The writings of contemporary Trieste writer Claudio Magris also have the melancholy of Svevo, and his works are very similar to It was translated from German into Italian, which is not surprising since Magris is a professor of German literature at the university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a writer wants to present a city, it is actually difficult to capture its spirit and soul. Magris has been telling stories about the land. As the most important seaport in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste&#39;s once glorious history made her current situation look bleak, and the entire city was shrouded in a twilight. Magris&#39;s writing is, in a sense, a pursuit of Trieste&#39;s literary tradition and an attempt to get closer to reality. His &quot;Micro World&quot;, which won the &quot;Strega&quot; award but is difficult to classify, has many texts related to the space of the city and the literature of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult for a person with limited life experience to establish a deep connection with the vast world. Sociologist Xiang Biao proposed the concept of &quot;nearness&quot;. Magris is an example of practicing &quot;neighborhood&quot;. He lives in this city and uses the tenacity of a scholar to understand the place and penetrate deeply into the life here. His &quot;miniature world&quot; actually consists of cafes, parks and Sacré Coeur. After reading his &quot;Micro World&quot; and then seeing the San Marco Cafe, the park and the nearby Sacré Coeur, you will recognize everything and feel that the world is what he described. The San Marco Cafe, which opened in 1914, has a very high ceiling with leaves and coffee beans on the top. The ebony bar and the wine racks against the wall stand firmly there. You will recognize the mask behind the counter. There is a The golden coffee machine with the flying eagle logo and the lion-shaped table legs under the table are reminiscent of Saint Mark, the patron saint of Venice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The city’s ancient cafes resist the times in their own way. In the San Marco Cafe, the bar is still made of solemn dark wood, and the tables, chairs and wall decorations are still the same as a hundred years ago. One side of its &quot;L&quot;-shaped structure has been transformed into a bookstore, filled with nostalgic books. The most conspicuous place is Magris&#39;s &quot;Micro Worlds&quot;, which has dozens of pages describing the past and present of the San Marco Café. The café is the living room of the city, an open public space where some faces disappear and new ones appear. In this urban space, the history of literature here is recorded. Cafe San Marco is a place frequented by literary &quot;pilgrims&quot;. Everyone, in their own way, hopes that this cultural &quot;ark&quot; will continue to exist. In addition to drinking coffee, you can also eat exquisite pasta in this cafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After coming out of the cafe, you can go for a walk in the nearby park to get some fresh air. There are towering plane trees in the park, and the sun shines through the leaves, and the golden light falls on a pool in the garden, which Magris also described. There are benches everywhere in the garden, where people read newspapers, books, or just sit around. There is a children&#39;s playground and an open-air cinema at the end of the park. Statues of city celebrities are scattered around, including a bust of Joyce wearing a hat and glasses, which was erected on the centenary of his birth in 1982, and a bust of local poet Saba, a second-hand bookseller of Jewish origin. , a neurotic patient and the cultural soul of Trieste, once wrote a poem titled &quot;Trieste&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Italics , 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I walked through the whole city,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;climbed a large Slope,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It was crowded at first, but then the road became empty. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the end of the road is a low wall:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I am sitting alone in this small corner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Where the low wall ends,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is also where the city ends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Trieste has an inaccessible beauty. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you like, this city is like a rough, &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Greedy wild child, &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Having blue eyes and using a pair of overly large hands&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sent A flower;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Like a paragraph full of jealousy&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&#39;s love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;On this hillside, I see the city (Trieste)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Every church, every street, even the crowded beach,&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;And the top of the mountain is full of rocks&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The last house seems to be firmly rooted there. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Everything around me&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;all have a strange, tortured feeling,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is the smell of hometown (this is where I was born). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Every part of my city is full of life&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;She reserved a corner for me, suitable for me&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A worried and lonely life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone lives in the corners of the city, including poets like Saba. The city has beaches, hills, and therefore a hint of countryside. Watching life from above, but not participating in it, while not feeling like an outsider, is exactly what this city offers Saba. Magris lives in this city in another way. He exists in a strict ritual, as cautious and solemn as the black and white marble floor of the Sacre Coeur. For him, everything was close by, a trip to the park was like traveling around the world, the clear cistern of the Sacre Coeur was like a spring in the glade, and the dim light of the church was as deep as the sea at night. Unfathomable. His life permeates the San Marco Cafe, the Park in the Street and the Sacred Heart Church two steps away. Magris even designed a reassuring ending for himself: with the comfort of his two sons, he lives in the Sacred Heart Church. In the golden sky painted by the church, jump through the ring of fire held by two angels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Trieste described by Magris is a city of twilight. In 2019, when he was 80 years old, he published &quot;The Bent Time of Krems&quot;. This is a book about twilight. There are five short stories in the book, telling the stories of five men in their twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Concierge&quot;, there is an old man who is reluctant to advance but to retreat, a president who once owned several companies. He enters an unknown field to get rid of the reality of facing enemies on all sides. He is a Czech who walked from the interior to Trieste for development. When he was young, the world was beautiful and big. He played his role successfully, building himself a strong armor with checks and profits. However, one day, his desire for success and inner panic left him. He became relaxed, sold his company, and became a concierge of an apartment with a calm mood. Once the sea has returned to the waterside safely. He tries to avoid roads where he can see the sea in the morning, takes the bus, and then walks to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist of &quot;Music Lesson&quot; is a Polish Jew who has entered his twilight years, a survivor with shame. He takes a car to go up the mountain to the home of his former student. The student, who became a musical master, showed him a piece of music he had composed as a tribute to the tragedy of the Jews, and he accepted the piece with embarrassment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist in &quot;Bent Time in Krems&quot; is the closest thing to Magris. He gives a lecture on Kafka and has dinner in a city called Krems. At the dinner party, someone mentioned Noni, the goddess of his youth, and by chance, he actually contacted her later. The &quot;now&quot; changes the &quot;before&quot;, time becomes curved, and all that is left is &quot;his&quot; longing for the god-like Noni. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Awarding&quot; is about an old writer attending a literary awards ceremony, feeling melancholy and relieved as time passes. In &quot;Outing Day&quot;, an old man went to the set to see the actor who played him in his youth. Everything was different from the previous story, and the old man got a kiss that he missed when he was a teenager. The five fragments of life are all based on the theme of &quot;old age&quot;, allowing people to see the scene of the city&#39;s twilight reflecting on life: the sunset fills the sky, and everything tends to be relieved. Magris uses short words to accurately outline some life fragments. The past and present coexist at the same time, and death becomes infinitely gentle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Magris, there is also a world-class best-selling female writer Susana Tamaro among the contemporary writers in Trieste. Most Italian families have her book &quot;Where the Heart Guidance&quot; 》. It was also a woman in her twilight years who was reckoning with the past through letters. There is also a writer recently introduced to the country - Gianfranco Kaligaric, who has certain connections with Trieste. He was born in Asmara, Eritrea, Africa. His family is a &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; family from Trieste, and he carries traces of the city&#39;s ethnic mix. He lived and worked in Milan and Rome. In 1974, he wrote the highly praised &quot;Waste of Summer&quot;. There is an indelible trace of youthful debauchery in his style, which still exudes endless charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又一中管干部被点名搞“七个有之” | 时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260846]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 13, 2023, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission announced that Chongqing Xiong Xue, the former deputy mayor of the city, violated discipline and law and was expelled from the party.

In other words, there are those who try to win people&#39;s hearts and votes, there are those who appoint officials and make wishes and celebrate with others, there are those who do things on their own and act against the will, there are also those who try to make mistakes and make unreasonable comments about the central government, and so on.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before Xiong Xue was dismissed, many central management cadres had been characterized as &quot;seven qualities&quot;, such as Zhou Jiankun, former vice chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference, and former chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial People&#39;s Congress. Deputy Director Gong Jianhua and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is the second time this year that Xiong Xue’s name has appeared on the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Half a year ago, on May 11, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced on its website that Xiong Xue was suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and was undergoing disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission. This also makes him the 19th central management cadre to be dismissed in 2023, and the &quot;second tiger&quot; to be dismissed from Chongqing after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before Xiong Xue fell, more signs had been revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Failed to pass the National People&#39;s Congress qualification review&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Born in Xiong Xue, who grew up in Chongqing, is a typical &quot;local cadre&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from the Chinese major of Chongqing No. 1 Normal School in Sichuan Province in 1982, Xiong Xue entered the Chongqing Nan&#39;an District Committee and served successively as the mayor of Chongqing Jiangjin City and the Municipal Party Committee.

He knows that I like reading. I have given them away several times before, and each time they were several large copies. I was embarrassed to ask him to give it away again, so I politely declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have two major hobbies, one is walking and the other is reading. Walking refreshes me and reading makes my life fulfilling. If I don&#39;t take a walk for a day, I feel uncomfortable all over; if I don&#39;t read for a day, my life will be boring. Reading a few pages of books every day has long become a habit of life. If you don&#39;t touch a book on a certain day, you won&#39;t feel good even if you sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, most of the books I read were borrowed from the university library by my son. My son is studying in a local university. This has a great advantage for me, that is, I can use the university library as my own private library. This is all because of my son. Now that my son has graduated from college and is working, I have lost the convenience of studying. After my son left school, the source of books suddenly stopped. I had to rummage through boxes and cabinets at home and come up with the idea of ​​collecting books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the collection of books at home was too limited and could not meet my needs, so there was a book shortage. The days without books to read feel particularly long and endless. At this moment, Xiao Xu called and wanted to deliver a book. I was secretly happy, but at the same time, I felt that I couldn&#39;t always be in debt to others. Books are expensive nowadays, and Xiao Xu is just a working-class person, so how can he keep asking people to spend money? No matter how strong the relationship is, it must be measured. So I thought, it would be great if there was a place to borrow books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, it’s not that there is no borrowing office. You can borrow books from the city’s library, but it’s a pity that the place is not close to home. It’s more than ten miles away from home. In this way, it is natural to think, wouldn’t it be great if you could borrow books near your home? For example, community libraries, etc. But I couldn&#39;t find such a place, asked people, and said I have never heard of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son joked that if we buy a house in the future, we will buy it near the library. Even if this kind of joke can come true, it will only be a long way away. They say we want to create a scholarly society, but even borrowing books is difficult. What can we do to create a better society? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I admit that fewer and fewer people read paper books now. But even so, the public services that should be provided must be provided and cannot be omitted. We often say that we need to provide all-inclusive assistance to needy groups, and we also need to provide all-inclusive assistance for reading, because there are always people who cannot afford to buy too many books, and there are always people who face the high price of books and have to give them up after considering them again and again. Even if you can&#39;t let go, you can only reluctantly give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let reading enter our daily life and become an important part of life, thereby improving individual quality and the population quality of the entire society. This is the fundamental essence of creating a scholarly society. Not to mention anything else, just for this reason, we also need a place where people can borrow books nearby. Such a place does not need to be big, it just needs to be convenient for people to borrow. At least one community committee must have such a place. In large communities, the number of places must be determined based on population distribution. In addition, in order to save costs, books can be regularly transferred between different places to maximize the use of books and satisfy the needs to the greatest extent. The needs of readers.

It&#39;s like a big dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early April and early September 2023, in early spring and early autumn, I went to Niigata Prefecture in northern Japan twice, the Echigo country that often appears in ancient Japanese literature. Echigo Kingdom, one of the ancient &lt;span>;Reiji Kingdom&lt;/span>; in Japan, faces the &lt;span>;Sea of ​​Japan&lt;/span>; and is long and narrow from north to south. &lt;span>;Meiji&lt;/span>; Four years later, the feudal domain was abolished and a prefecture was established, named Niigata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Niigata in April, the car was driving among the continuous farmland. The brown rice fields in early spring have just been plowed and are waiting for a new round of sowing. The September trip is already in my plan, so I started imagining the scene of autumn. For large areas of solid color scenes, yellow is the most suitable, and the combination with the blue sky is pure and gorgeous. In the Chengdu Plain where I live, there is a spectacular scene every day in March. The spread of rapeseed flowers is spectacular, and the atmosphere of early spring is quite exciting. Chengdu people who stay at home will basically go out for spring outings at this time, not to let down nature or themselves. Fortunately, when I visited Xinxie in early September, the scene of Jinya Mano was enjoyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many swans in Niigata’s deserted fields in April. They are pecking at the grain that falls in the soil. After being fed and fattened, they will fly back to Siberia. It migrates like this every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at these beautiful big white birds from a distance. Has Basho seen them? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Probably not. Matsuo Basho and his disciple Soryo Kawai arrived in Echigo in the summer of 1689. Echigo is a stop on the &quot;Oku no Hosomido&quot;. The entire &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot; journey is a total of 2,400 kilometers of hiking. Starting from Edo, go north, then turn west. It is said that the most magnificent journey is the monk Kukai’s tour of the eighty-eight temples in Shikoku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the trip to Japan in the spring of 2023, the excitement and yearning were mixed with a different state of mind from the trips in previous years. During the three years of the epidemic, except for a few short trips within the country, I have not traveled abroad. Three years of isolation has had a psychological effect on me, leaving me with a faint uneasiness, but I don’t know where this uneasiness comes from. When applied to the body, the hands and feet feel sluggish and sluggish. Having been separated from the same rhythm for three years, the effect is really powerful. The body is heavy and the state of mind is also sinking. I asked myself, what would happen if I never went out again? It seems to be possible. For middle-aged people, three years makes them look older. This is probably an important reason. By September, after a trip to Japan in April, a self-driving trip to Yunnan in May, and several short trips, I felt that my mind and body were beginning to adapt to the journey again, which was very gratifying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My friend Ding Yuan settled in the village of &lt;span>;Niigata Prefecture&lt;/span>; and ran a B&amp;B called &quot;Four Seasons Inn&quot; with her husband, Mr. Nakamura Tatsuo. The couple also ran a local hotel. Various contents of travel. Regarding Basho, what Ding Yuan helped me find out is that Basho and Zeng Liang stayed in Murakami for two nights and three days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Basho accommodation in Murakami can be checked and determined based on local literature, but it has lost its former appearance and has become a salmon restaurant, so the curtain at the door is very interesting. This is a two-story Japanese-style house on Murakami Street. Three Japanese-style curtains are hung side by side at the door. They are written in black on a white background and in the middle are &quot;Izutsuya&quot;, which is the name of the restaurant. The one on the right is written &quot;Murakami&quot;. &quot;Salmon Cuisine&quot; and a book on the left reads &quot;Basho&#39;s Staying Place&quot;. There is a wooden sign at the door stating, &quot;In June of the second year of Genroku (1689), Basho and Zeng Liang arrived at Murakami during their journey on the &#39;Oku no Homichi&#39;. They stayed here for two nights and three days. , it was called &#39;Sukuzaemon&#39; at the time.&quot; In order to show that the brand was not the store&#39;s own words, the signature was &quot;Mura City Education Committee.&quot; Murakami&#39;s salmon industry is very famous. Every year, many salmon migrate here, and the output and quality are of high quality. Therefore, Murakami has a considerable number of salmon restaurants and processing workshops for curing and drying salmon. I asked Nakamura, is &quot;Izutsuya&quot; the most famous salmon shop in Murakami? Nakamura smiled and said, that&#39;s not necessarily true. It&#39;s because of the influence of bananas, but most people don&#39;t care about this, and only you cultural people care about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/MQzAIBoCpFBy1l4BFMplWcHVyGjQuJFUl4plJrQa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/MQzAIBoCpFBy1l4BFMplWcHVyGjQuJFUl4plJrQa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258620&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho and his disciple Kawai Sora went to the accommodation in the village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basho wrote in &quot;The Thirty-Five Echigo Road&quot; in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; , &quot;As soon as we passed the Mouse Pass, we entered the territory of Echigo from Dewa, and then we rushed to Shizhen Pass in Etchu. We walked for nine days in total. During this period, sometimes the heat was unbearable, and sometimes the cold rain poured down on us, which made us physically and mentally exhausted. Even getting sick was really miserable. So I didn’t record much of my journey.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because Basho was ill during Echigo, there are very few records about Echigo in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. Based on the results that Ding Yuan helped me check, I followed the traces in Murakami in early spring and early autumn. However, it is no longer possible to determine the location of this trace. We can only search for it based on the location of the Basho Sentence Monument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jizo-do Hall in Kamikata Town has the Basho sentence monument &quot;けふはかり人も年よれ&amp;nbsp;First Time Rain&quot;. It can be translated as: Only today do you know that you are old, this is the first shower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inari Shrine has a Basho motto stone, &quot;Cloud folds 々人をやすむる月见かな&quot;. The general meaning I understand is that the shadow of the cloud covers the moon, and the shadow of the moon covers the person. The latter is a sentence from Basho&#39;s seven-part collection &quot;Spring Day&quot;, written in 1685. Basho visited Murakami in August 1689. He probably left no works due to poor health. Next to the Bajiao Monument Monument, there is a haiku poet Su Xian&#39;s Monument Stone. The handwriting is blurry. The general idea I read is: Under the moonlight, the shore of the water is covered with pine leaves like umbrellas (I don&#39;t know if it is correct or not). According to the introduction on the standing plaque next to it, these two stone sentences were erected in October 1843, during the 150th anniversary of Basho and the 17th anniversary of Susen. The introduction also specifically said that there are two important remains of Basho in Murakami, one is the Inari Shrine where this place is located, and the other is the Iwafune Shrine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Iwafune Shrine built on the seaside is much larger in scale and momentum than the Inari Shrine. It has a red torii gate and a white torii gate. In front of the red torii gate, there is a Basho sentence stone, which is engraved with the sentence &quot;On the seventh day of Hanasaki, Tsurumi will see Tsuruga&quot;, which can be understood as &quot;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in seven days, and only Tsurumi can see such a beautiful scenery.&quot; The Basho stone in front of the white torii gate is engraved with &quot;Bunzuki や六日も长の夜には思ず&quot;, which means that the night of Bunzuki (July), when I am anxiously waiting for the letter, is also different from the ordinary night. The former Basho haiku has nothing to do with &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, and the latter line is taken from a line written in the Hokuriku section of &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April, the day before Basho’s tour in &lt;span>;Niigata Prefecture&lt;/span>;, we went to Kameoka Monju-in, the Daishoji Temple in Yamagata Prefecture. In the drizzle, there are still snow in the distance in the distance and the roof nearby. When I was going down the mountain, I suddenly found a Basho sentence monument standing on the roadside, which read &quot;春の夜は桜に明けてしまひけり&quot; (Spring night, cherry blossoms are in full bloom). Tateishiji Temple (Mountain Temple) in Yamagata Prefecture is an important place to visit on the &quot;Oku no Hosōdo&quot; tour of Master Basho and his apprentice. I visited in 2019. I don’t know if they have been to the Great Holy Temple, and it is not mentioned in the book. Someone may have studied the details of these travels, and the results of these studies must be carefully explored to know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to read a lot of haiku in Chinese translation, but over the years I slowly started to read the original haiku. It is true that poetry cannot be translated. Because my Japanese foundation is still shallow, and it also involves issues of ancient and modern Japanese, I can only read these haiku at a loss. But maybe it was in this confusion, after leaking some clear information, that I finally understood the extremely concise and complex semantics of haiku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of Basho&#39;s activities in this area of ​​​​Murakami is Otohoji Temple. During my two trips to Murakami in early spring and early autumn, I went to Otohoji Temple twice. The cherry blossom scenery in early spring is obviously much more beautiful than the scenery in early autumn before the red leaves appear. It is said to be Murakami, but Otohoji Temple is actually located in Tainai City next to Murakami. This temple was built in the 8th century AD under the order of Emperor Shomu who was in office at the time. The temple covers a vast area of ​​more than 80,000 square meters. There is a &quot;three-story pagoda&quot; built in 1620 in the temple, which is designated as a national important cultural property of Japan. This temple is the only ancient temple in Shinji that is included in &quot;The Story of Konsai&quot;, and it is also the temple where Matsuo Basho once visited when he wandered the &quot;Oku no Hosho Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/vg13uYiV1rkOS05OOYFWHKCIRA8y6dKAOdlxPhPL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/vg13uYiV1rkOS05OOYFWHKCIRA8y6dKAOdlxPhPL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258621&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho Monument in Otohoji Temple. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the topic, let me say a few words. It was almost noon after visiting Otohoji Temple in early autumn. Mr. Nakamura said that there was a steamed bun shop next to it that was very delicious and he hadn’t eaten there in a long time. We decided to leave it at that for lunch. When I arrived at the door, I looked at the description and found that it was founded in the first year of culture, which was 1804, and has a history of more than 200 years. The shop is really small, with a few stools and two or three tables. When the steamed buns arrived, they turned out to be red bean paste buns. Later, I looked up information and learned that in Japan, the so-called steamed buns are bean paste buns, and the outer shell can vary. There are white steamed buns made of commonly used flour, brown tea steamed buns made of wheat flour, and sweet potato flour, yam flour, and japonica rice flour. There are sweet potato steamed buns and wine steamed buns made from fermented rice flour, etc., but they are filled with red bean paste. Yiboji Steamed Buns are delicious, and I am even more impressed that such a snack shop has a history of more than 200 years. In Japan, I often come across various small shops that are hundreds of years old. I once ate at a ramen shop in Kyoto. When I came to the door after eating, I was shocked to see the signboard. It has a history of more than 400 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I posted photos of my visit to Yibao Temple in WeChat Moments, and a friend asked: Is it the Yibao Temple in &quot;The Story of the Past&quot;? It seems that its name first came from &quot;The Story of the Past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Story of the Past&quot; is a collection of folklore stories from the late Heian period in Japan, with a total of thirty-one volumes and more than a thousand stories. It is divided into Tianzhu (India) (volumes one to five), Cathay (China) (volumes six to ten), and Honchao (Japan) (volumes eleven to thirty-one). The current Chinese version of this Dynasty was edited by Zhou Zuoren. The stories in &quot;The Tale of the Past&quot; are all-encompassing, with Buddhist stories and secular stories mixed together. There are also many stories of gods and supernatural beings. Many creations of later generations come from this book, which is one of the source treasures of Japanese literature. It is similar to Chinese books such as San Yan Er Pai and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Because each volume contains the word &quot;present and past&quot; at the beginning, it is called &quot;The Story of Present and Past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among Japanese writers, Ryunosuke Akutagawa made full use of &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot;. It is said that about one-fifth of the material in the historical novels he created came from &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot;, including &quot;Rason&quot; Door&quot; and &quot;In the Jungle&quot;. Ryunosuke Akutagawa called &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot; a &quot;human comedy&quot; in ancient Japan. He said that &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot; is full of &quot;wild beauty&quot; and is &quot;a kind of beauty that has nothing to do with elegance and luxury.&quot; Many of the common Onmyodo and Onmyoji content in Japanese animations also come from &quot;Kanagi Monogatari&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spacious garden of Uhoji Temple, there is a Basho Sentence Monument, a round stone monument, the handwriting has been blurred. There is a wooden sign next to the stele, which records the content of the stele: &quot;In the second year of Genroku (1689), Matsuo Basho paid homage to the Ukiyo no Kita no Yamazakura Basho.&quot; I envy). Surrounding the Basho Sentence Monument are many echoing sentences from &lt;span>;Niigata&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;local&lt;/span>; haiku celebrities at that time. Otohoji Temple has been a famous place for cherry blossom viewing since ancient times. Basho admired the beauty of the northern cherry blossoms here, even though it was not during the cherry blossom season when he visited. Looking at Sakura Leaves, he also expressed his envious mood in his imagination. Two of the echoing haiku of other haiku writers were singled out and written in the description of the stele. They were probably the most famous haiku poets in the area at that time. One of them is not jade, &quot;Mitsukoshi Road や一の Temple の花ざかり&quot;, Mitsukoshi The road and Yi&#39;s Temple are filled with flowers. One song is by Yasuda Izabo, &quot;Different gods and Buddhas&quot;. Different gods and Buddhas all have the beauty of cherry blossoms. They are all sentences praising cherry blossoms. In Japan, the word flower, if not specifically mentioned, is cherry blossom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Niigata in early April, the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in previous years, but the spring of 2023 is coming fiercely, and when we arrived, the cherry blossoms were already a little overdue. In the garden of Otohoji Temple, on the round stone monument of Basho, there are several branches of cherry blossoms hanging down, on the eve of their withering. Behind the stele is a small hill, and on the steps are several red curtains from the temple, with the words &quot;Namo Guanyin Bodhisattva&quot; enshrined. The curtains fluttered gently in the sunshine and breeze. This sentiment and scene complement each other perfectly with the haikus tablet with unclear handwriting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Othoji Temple, like other Niigata landscapes, has very few tourists. I stood on the terrace outside the main hall, watching the yin and yang scene cut by the sun with the Buddha statues in the garden below. I have done this twice. Although the weather seems to be the same, there are obvious differences in the dividing lines between sunlight and shadow in early spring and early autumn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I visited Otohoji Temple again in September and suddenly discovered Kobo Daishi (Kukai) here. I didn’t notice it at all on that trip in April. There is a stone statue of Kobo Daishi Gozun here, which is a common standard shape of Kukai wearing a hat and leaning on a staff during his journey. This stone statue of Kukai is a bit cute, shaped into a pudgy little boy. I turned to the back of the base of the stone statue to read the description. The handwriting was a bit blurry, but I could clearly see the words &quot;Pursuing the eighty-eight sacred sites of Shikoku...to commemorate...&quot; and other words. It is estimated that someone went there before and erected a statue in Otohoji Temple after returning to Niigata. Benji was the monk Kukai&#39;s practice route. It later gradually became the most famous hiking route in the world, with a total length of more than 1,400 kilometers and 88 temples in Shikoku. Currently, more than half a million people from all over the world walk this road every year. This is also a strange fate for us. After seeing Kukai at Otohoji Temple, my friend Dr. Tan Weidong and I left Niigata the next day, flew to Osaka for a short stay, and then headed to Shikoku to start our plan Three years of preparation for the trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[格力电器：董明珠“绯闻”是造谣，已向公安机关报案]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260839]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 17, Gree Electric responded to a reporter from Nanduwan Financial News: &quot;Regarding the recent efforts of many self-media To obtain traffic, maliciously edit relevant videos, and use vulgar and filthy words to insult and slander company executives, Gree Electric has reported the case to the public security organs, which have accepted and filed the case.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanduwan Financial News reporter learned that recently There are rumors on social platforms that Dong Mingzhu, chairman and president of Gree Electric Appliances, is in love with Wang Ziru, the &quot;channel reform project leader&quot; of Gree Electric Appliances.

Wang Ziru appeared as the host many times, and together with Dong Mingzhu, they won 703 million yuan in sales. That year, Dong Mingzhu&#39;s 13 live broadcasts totaled 47.6 billion yuan, accounting for nearly 30% of Gree Electric&#39;s total revenue in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2021, Gree Electric confirmed the news of Wang Ziru joining Gree Electric. At that time, industry insiders said that Wang Ziru’s department was affiliated with Gree’s President Office and Cultural Training and Communication Center. During the same period, Wang Ziru resigned from his position at ZEALER, the media he founded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are rumors that Wang Ziru’s rank in Gree is equivalent to that of vice president, with an annual salary of more than 3 million yuan. However, judging from Gree Electric’s financial reports in the past two years, Wang Ziru has never appeared in the executive compensation table middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After joining Gree Electric, Wang Ziru rarely appeared on public platforms. Gree Electric did not disclose his specific work content. However, it is known from some public reports that he is currently in charge of the Gree channel reform project. In late May this year, Wang Ziru, who had been with Gree for two years but had not yet appeared, appeared publicly in Nanchang for the first time as the &quot;channel reform project leader&quot; and spoke at the 2023 Gree Electric (Jiangxi) new marketing model presentation conference. In October and November, Gree Electric Shandong and Hebei Sales Companies also issued documents, and Wang Ziru gave a speech at a new marketing model conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that at the beginning of this year, news appeared on social platforms that Gree Electric Chairman and President Dong Mingzhu was in love with his company’s post-85s male executive. The news originated from the big V Gong A screenshot posted by Wen Xiang on the Internet. In February this year, Dong Mingzhu took the initiative to mention and denounced in an interview with reporters from Nanduwan Financial News and other media: &quot;Vulgar, obscene, and boring! It is not an exaggeration to use these words to describe it.&quot; She clearly denied the love scandal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March this year, big V Gong Wenxiang apologized to Dong Mingzhu, chairman and president of Gree Electric Appliances, for his previous remarks in the Southern Metropolis Daily. Gong Wenxiang said in his apology statement that he made distorted remarks about Ms. Dong Mingzhu’s private life on Toutiao on February 26, which were widely disseminated and objectively damaged Ms. Dong’s reputation. &quot;I deeply regret and am deeply sorry to Ms. Dong. The special newspaper expresses my public apology and sincere remorse to Ms. Dong, and hopes to obtain Ms. Dong&#39;s forgiveness.

In 1980, lead singer John Lennon was shot and killed. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 30, 1969, on the rooftop of Apple Records headquarters at 3 Savile Row, England , the Beatles held a 42-minute impromptu concert. It was almost at the last moment that the idea was settled - they discussed it and then fell silent until John Lennon said, &quot;...let&#39;s do it!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Noon Around 12:30, the four people arrived on the rooftop. As word spread, people began to gather in the surrounding streets and on the rooftops of nearby buildings. That day, Lennon wore a fur coat, and Ringo put on his wife&#39;s red coat. In the biting cold wind of January, the members sang a total of five songs in a loop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert finally came to an end with the melody of &quot;Get&amp;nbsp;Back&quot;. Lennon said humorously to the audience: &quot;On behalf of the band and ourselves, I want to say thank you. I hope we have passed the audition.&quot; However, the public at the time may not have expected that this would be the last of the Beatles. A public performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, 2023, after a span of 45 years, a new Beatles collaboration called &quot;Now And Then&quot; finally came to the public. After the familiar &quot;one, two, three&quot; timer, the accompaniment sounded, and Lennon&#39;s voice slowly flowed out:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;I know it&#39;s true / It&#39;s all because of you / And if I make it through / It&#39;s all because of you&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;……&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lennon in the MV The faces of George and George were still young, wearing bright costumes from that time, playing in the same space as Paul and Ringo. Different from their youthful and fresh appearance, the wrinkles on Paul and Ringo&#39;s faces are clearly visible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It was incredibly touching to hear that they were still working together after all these years,” Lennon’s son Sean said. “It was my dad and Paul and George. , the last song we made together with Ringo.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;We&#39;ve been waiting almost a quarter of a century&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now And Then&quot; The story begins in 1978. Lennon recorded this vocal demo with accompaniment while playing the piano in his apartment in New York. By that time, he had focused on his family and had all but put his music career on hold, not touring or fulfilling any major label obligations. However, in his son Sean&#39;s memory, Lennon would always play music at home and record and make demos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, 14 years after Lennon’s death, during a chat with the Beatles, Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono said that she still had some of Lennon’s audio tapes. She gave them to the remaining Beatles. &quot;If the three of us were to do something, it would be fun, but obviously not as fun as when John was here,&quot; George said. &quot;We really have to cherish hearing John&#39;s voice. I&#39;m sure he would really enjoy being with us.&quot; A chance to be together again.&quot; Now, that chance has come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We can use Lennon&#39;s music to try to make a record. Since his death, this is the closest moment we have been away from him.&quot; Lin Ge said. In the face of Lennon&#39;s sample, Paul also thought about, &quot;Should we not do this?&quot; But whenever he thought so, he always interrupted himself, assuming that he had a chance to ask Lennon- &quot;Hey , Lennon, do you want us to complete your song? &quot; - What will Lennon&#39;s answer, and he believes, Lennon will say,&quot; Of course! &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The production is not as smooth as expected. At that time, there were no technologies that could separate human voices from the sound of accompaniment. To some extent, Lennon&#39;s voice was actually hidden. Whenever they want to adjust the voice of Lennon more clearly, the sound of piano accompaniment will increase, and the effect is actually worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They were frustrated, &quot;We have lost time and motivation.&quot; Paul said that it seemed that they should give up the song. &quot;The incident is not progressing, and it makes Lennon no longer this fact, and it is getting clearer in front of us.&quot; Linko said. In this way, &quot;Now &amp; nbsp; and then&quot; was put on hold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Until 2022. Prior to this, the team of &quot;Ring Rings&quot; Peter Jackson&#39;s team developed an artificial intelligence -based technology, which can separate specific voices and accompaniment sounds and repair. And this technology was proven to be successful in the documentary &quot;Get Back&quot; produced by Peter Jackson for the Beatles in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After technical help, Lennon&#39;s voice came out from the player again, &quot;as clear as crystal.&quot; &quot;We waited almost a quarter of a century until this moment, we can make&quot; Now and then &quot;again.&quot; Paul said. He called Lin Ge and told him that he wanted to continue the production of the song, and Lin Ge agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to Lennon&#39;s piano accompaniment, Paul also joined his bass part, and Link also added his drums based on this. They retained George&#39;s guitar performance in 1995. &quot;This is a tribute to George.&quot; Paul said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the help of Georgos, the son of George Martin, the old Beatles band producer George Martin, the string part has also joined. In the recording of this part, in order to keep confidential, they did not tell the string orchestra of the performance. This is a new Beatles, but pretended to be Paul&#39;s own new single. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;All those memories have flooded up, my God, how lucky I can appear in my life ... I am still doing the Beatles in 2023 Music, wow! &quot;Paul sighed,&quot; Now and then &quot;should be our last song.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Think of me from time to time, old friends&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/strong>; &lt; /H4>; &lt;p>; In February 1964, the Beatles played to the United States for the first time. With them take off, it was more than 4,000 fans at Henhero Airport waved away; they welcomed their landing, and it was another group of about 3,000 pick -up teams. On the 9th of that year, Beatles performed a live TV show on Ed Shalvan show, attracting about 73 million viewers to watch, which accounted for about 34%of the American population. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; That is almost the most days in the middle of the Beatles. However, separation and death have come between them prematurely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September of the same year when the Beatles band played the last public performance, Lennon notified his band members in a meeting with Link, Paul and their agent Allen Claine. We intend to exit the Beatles band. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, because of business, creation, feelings, and many aspects, frictions and differences have become increasingly serious, and it seems that it is only a matter of time. In that meeting, George was absent, and Claine persuaded other band members to remain silent about the dissolution, because some important business affairs were still in progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On April 10 of the following year, Paul publicly announced that he had withdrawn from the Beatles, which was also regarded as a sign of the disbanding of the Beatles. At that time, ten years before they were founded, a American media person claimed that it was &quot;a milestone for the decline of the British Empire.&quot; When asked whether his departure was temporarily or permanent, Paul replied, &quot;I really don&#39;t know.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many years later, in a media interview, Paul denied that it promoted the band to dissolve. Due to Claine&#39;s request, they had to stop the band&#39;s dissolution, and had to pretend everything was normal for a few months. He was just &quot;enough to hide&quot;, and in the end, &quot;put the cat out of the bag.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the later time, even if the Beatles have developed each other, there are still in the hearts of music fans, and they look forward to one day, they will fit again. However, Lennon&#39;s death directly smashed this hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On December 8, 1980, after completing the work of the day, Lennon returned to his residence with his wife Ono Yoko. The two came down from the car and walked to the entrance of the building in Dako&#39;s apartment. At this moment, the 25 -year -old Mark ∙ Davido appeared. He fired five shots towards Lennon, and Lennon stopped his heartbeat forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;For everyone who hopes to exist continuously, murder is another matter. This is a assassination, a ritual killing of something that is not famous, maybe It is hope, maybe idealism, or time. It is not only lost, but also suddenly misplaced and fragmented. &quot;Critics Jei Cosks wrote in the cover article of the&quot; Times &quot;magazine of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February of the following year, musician Karl Pakins wrote a song &quot;My Old Friend&quot; for Paul. The next morning after finishing, Carl took the guitar and sat on the old double -ranging bullet in Paul, singing this song for him: &quot;If we are hard to see us in our lives ... my old friend, will you from time to time? Think of me ... &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Paul and his wife Linda sat on the floor to listen. After singing the song, Carl found that Paul cried. After that, he got up and left the room. Linda explained to him, &quot;Since the incident of Lennon, he has been unable to really collapse ... But how do you know?&quot; She said, Lennon said to Paul in the corridor of the Dako building before his lifetime. It was -at the time he patted Paul&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;Now and then thinks of me, old friends.&quot; &lt;em>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/em>; &lt;p>; The key is to chemically react. It is very special to combine the four -person person&#39;s personality. When John lost John, we know that all this is really over. &quot;Paul said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2001, they once again realized the pain of the death of their friends. This time, it was another Beatles member George Harrison, who died of cancer unfortunately. &quot;Lost George, this is like we have no wind on the way.&quot; Paul said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In November of the following year, the commemorative concert organized by George&#39;s widow Olvia and his son Dani Harrison was held at the Royal Albert Concert Hall in London. turn up. Before the performance, Paul walked to the microphone and said, &quot;When Danny stands on the stage, it is like we are old, but George is still young.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; maybe they may still be young. music. On November 10, 2023, with the song &quot;Now and then&quot;, Beatles reached the top of the British music rankings again, which is their 18th champion single. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It not only continues the record of the Beatles in the history of the British official rankings, but also makes them the first and last time in history. The band -this song, &quot;From Me to You&quot;, the first top champion, has passed for 60 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern weekend interns Chen Quanxin also contributed to this article) &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[家政女工之死]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260737]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-17 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[94岁老人状告保姆：虐待自己还骗走200万养老钱]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260804]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-17 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/23/23/ 11/17/chqtyndsbis4falpoe4jglv3iamtpkyiookeqyy.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 691 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.cms/medias/i/i MAGE/23/11/17/Chqtyndsbis4falPoe4jglv3iaMTPKYIOOKEQYY. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258602 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; nanny abuse &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Lu Junjie /Figure) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Who is the defendant 2, I can&#39;t figure it out,&quot; Facing the judge&#39;s inquiry, Shen Yinan sat in a seat with &quot;the defendant&#39;s agent&quot; with doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The defendant 2 is your father,&quot; the lawyer reminded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The above -mentioned slightly absurd scene occurred together to give a pre -meeting meeting of the contract dispute. On November 7, 2023, the People&#39;s Court of Huangpu District, Shanghai, exchanged evidence on the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shen Yinan&#39;s mother Lu Delin is the plaintiff. The nagnic nagnic Jiang Aizhen in the family is the defendant 1, and Shen Yinan&#39;s father Shen Zongli is the defendant 2. According to civil prosecution, Shen Zongli once &quot;gifts&quot; a nagged nagnic Jiang Aizhen 2 million yuan, and now Lu Delin asked to return; at the same time, Lu Delin said that he was murmured by the nagged Jiang Aizhen, asking the other party to pay the mental damage to compensate 200,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shen Yinan&#39;s &quot;unclear&quot; reason is that this is not a single case. Civil contract disputes and criminal cases are in progress. Relevant legal documents show that Lu Delin&#39;s abuse has been criminally filed at the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and criminal cases are currently being handled. Shen Yinan has lived abroad for many years, lacks enough understanding of the Chinese environment, and returned to Shanghai to visit relatives every year since the end of 2019 that it has continued to interrupt the new crown epidemic at the end of 2019. During this period, the nanny Jiang Aizhen lived in the house to take care of Lu Delin and Shen Zongli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On June 29, 2023, Lu Delin, a 94 -year -old old man in Shanghai, released the first video on the Internet, saying that he was abused by nanny and was transferred away by nanny. Since then, the account has released multiple videos, and Lu Delin appeared in the photo to tell his experience: &quot;I will breathe a sigh of relief.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This is not an example. On the day of exchange evidence, a similar news in Shanghai rushed into hot search again. A nanny claims that the elderly who take care of the real estate should give himself a transfer of real estate. The staff found that the transfer process was suspended after the existence was inappropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Shanghai Health and Health Committee recently disclosed that as of the end of 2022, 5.536 million household registration elderly people in Shanghai were 60 years old and over, accounting for 36.8%of the total household registration population. In modern cities with severe aging, how to be decent -decent, the problem of home care of the elderly is attracting the attention of the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the court scene on the afternoon of the 7th, Jiang Aizhen did not arrive. The judge said that the court would announce the announcement and it is expected that Jiang Aizhen will be summoned again in two months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/c0jwqjhfwcourmaxryq1je8rzq5hcbreze.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/c0jwcourmaixryq1jrzq5hcbreze&quot; data- key = &quot;258606&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Lu Delin&#39;s bedroom, daughter-in-law Shen Allen has found cleaning and scaning &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Han Ruxue/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Life of 94 -year -old couples &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Pushing open the closed door in front of him, the first thing floating is a sour taste. This house should look well ventilated. The apartment is square. It is the other side of the living room. The balcony is wide and the windows are large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Here is a certain building 2401, Lane 118, Xindu Road, Liyuanxin Village, Huangpu District, Shanghai. The other side of dirty is the expensive value of this house itself. There are 4 buildings in this community, all of which are high -rise. They are located in the center of Shanghai. There are many subways and bus routes near Shanghai. Related information shows that this community was built in the early 1990s. At present, the price of the second -hand housing market exceeds 100,000 yuan per square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Master Xia, who has worked in the property in the community for many years, told &quot;Southern Character Weekly&quot; that there are many elderly people in the community and are &quot;decent people with identity&quot;. It is common for hiring clock or home nanny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The house in front of him belongs to an old couple, Lu Delin and his wife Shen Zongli. Both of them are 94 years old and have retired for many years. Lu Delin suffered from spinalitis and was paralyzed in the bed in the lower body; Shen Zongli was blind now, and only 0.25 vision was left with one eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The only son of the two, Shen Yinan, settled in the United States for decades, and relatives have basically lived abroad. Both have been to the United States to help their son take care of their grandchildren, but each visa time is only half a year. Several round trips, the higher the age of the two, and slowly had to stay in this house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Now, this house is vacant. On June 29, 2023, Lu Delin released his first video on the Internet, saying that he was murmured by nanny Jiang Aizhen and the pension was transferred away. At present, Lu Delin and Shen Zongli have been taken away by his son Shen Yinan and daughter -in -law Shen Allen and placed in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shen Ailun opened the door and displayed the layout in the room one by one. She was careful to take pictures, numbers, and retention in these traces of life. During the investigation of the case, multiple evidence came from this. On the corner of the living room, there are more than ten kinds of supplements and mountain goods such as fungus, lily, mushrooms, etc., and more than a dozen. Shen Ailun, who was standing on one side, said that she had been looking for the cleaning staff and cleaned it inside and outside. The sour odor that can be smelled at present is not much residual. Those supplements are &quot;left. Many, many have expired, nanny does not do it for the elderly. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This home was originally &quot;stable and decent.&quot; Lu Delin and Shen Zongli&#39;s monthly pensions were more than 10,000 yuan. With fixed financial interest, there were an additional 8,000 yuan in income per month. In addition to the house where the name lives, there is another real estate before. After the demolition in the previous two years, a lot of compensation was received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; His son Shen Yinan returned to visit relatives every year, &quot;7 years in 786 days, an average of 84 days per year&quot;. From 2013 to 2019, Shen Ailun compiled the entry and exit records in these passports one by one. However, such a connection was broken by the sudden new crown epidemic. After leaving China on November 29, 2019, Shen Yinan failed to come back for more than 3 years.

Shen Ailun told &quot;Southern Character Weekly&quot; that while Jiang Aizhen took this salary, he also did clock -oriented work at the same time in four other places.

During the new crown epidemic, the two elderly people were taken care of by Jiang Aizhen alone, pushing up and queuing to do nucleic acid, which was seen in the neighborhood committee. It is &quot;the thing that is locked in the door&quot;, and whether it is good or abused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the Shen Yinan couple returned to China, Jiang Aizhen repeatedly claimed that he &quot;saved the old man&#39;s life&quot; and took out the &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;attorney&quot; signed by Shen Zongli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A commissioned book on September 1, 2022 shows: &quot;Our current residence will live here by Jiang Aizhen in a hundred years.

Shen Yinan and Shen Ailun told the judge that passing by: Jiang Aizhen took out a certificate, including Lu Delin, Shen Zongli, Shen Yinan, and Shen Yinan signed in the corresponding location. Shen Ailun was present and stopped. At that time, I thought that the matter was ended. Shen Yinan and Shen Ailun went out to work. When I returned to Shanghai, I learned that the &quot;proof&quot; was actually written long ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The suspended proof is on March 9, 2023. In fact, as early as a week ago, on March 3, 2023, Jiang Aizhen got the &quot;proof&quot; signed by Shen Zongli. Shen Ailun found that Shen Zongli&#39;s Alipay was registered.

In order to ensure that the gift of this &quot;2 million yuan&quot; is legitimate and valid, one week later, she once again took out a certificate that the money was added to Shen Zongli and added &quot;Lu Delin Shen Yinan&quot;. &quot;Gift&quot; proof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The previous gifts of 1 million yuan, a gift of 2 million yuan, and three certificates that let the nanny live in the house.

The proof was handwritten. Shen Ailun said that the way of treating Shen Zongli and Lu Delin is different. &quot;I know which one should coax, and used such a brainwashing method to deceive the old man&#39;s money.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Initially, the family trusted the nanny. For the first time, I found out that there was something wrong. It was time for Shen Ailun to mail the food to her in -laws. When I talked about the phone, I found that the in -laws did not receive it and did not know it. Earlier, Shen Ailun sent a message to the elderly mobile phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The nanny will delete the chat history,&quot; this answer was found after Shen Ailun installed the camera. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2023, after about 3 years due to the new crown epidemic, Shen Ailun stepped into the door of 2401 again. The mother -in -law Lu Delin asked her to see her feet, saying that she felt potholes, and Shen Ailun found that the toenail was &quot;cut&quot;, and she realized that something was wrong. Shen Ailun went to check the account and found that 2 million yuan on his in -law&#39;s account was transferred to Jiang Aizhen&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From a wheelchair to the wall, Shen Ailun secretly installed 7 micro -cameras to &quot;monitor&quot; nanny. The couple falsified to return to the United States. . Her husband told her that this was to obtain evidence, and she had to hold back her temper. No matter what she saw, the primary purpose was to retain evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the next day, Shen Allen still quarreled with Jiang Aizhen. She recalled that Jiang Aizhen had a habit, a bit like a teacher&#39;s feeling of training children, &quot;What are you going to, what&#39;s going on&quot;, &quot;I can hear my head buzzing.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p >; The contradiction quickly erupted to the table. One day at noon, her mother -in -law Lu Delin said that she wanted to eat crabs and asked Shen Allen to do it. Shen Ailun said that she asked her aunt (referring to Jiang Aizhen). Jiang Aizhen said that she would not eat crabs and would not do it. &quot;I wanted to scold her at that time, but I held back,&quot; Shen Ailun continued to recall. &quot;The nanny asked my mother -in -law how to do it. My mother -in -law asked her to ask me. She was normal when she asked me. Didn&#39;t you ask my mother? You can do it according to my mother&#39;s method. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Patience seems to have disappeared suddenly. Jiang Aizhen suddenly became unwilling, and the volume suddenly became larger. Ask you, you asked me to ask your mother, I really don&#39;t understand you anymore. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; As soon as this sentence came out, Shen Ali couldn&#39;t hold back the fire. I started scolding her. I said you don&#39;t want to talk to me like this. One day I asked you to cry, and you rolled it out. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; At that time, Jiang Aizhen did not know how to install a camera at home, but Shen Ailun had already Seeing the normal behavior of the nanny through the video, it made her difficult to accept. &quot;She sprinkled all her breath on my mother -in -law, and her throat scolded the sound.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; After watching the camera On the night of sleeping in her in -laws, Shen Ailun was afraid that Jiang Aizhen did extreme things from the kitchen, and took away the large and small knives in the kitchen, put it in the room, locked the door, and put one of them. The knife is placed under the pillow to prepare the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; About &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Jiang Aizhen &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; It is another saying of Wang Wei, an introduced person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Wei also heard the gift of 2 million yuan, and she also saw the &quot;abuse&quot; picture circulating online video. But she always believes that the nanny is okay: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The video seen online is that the action is rude. In fact, the old man gets up like this. I used to have an old man before, and Xiao Jiang pulled like this. Jiang is also almost 60 years old. It is only a clockwork. He has not received professional training in nursing. It can only be that. We are used to this action in our house. She has a temperament and character. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>;&quot; There are toenails to cut bleeding, cut asylon nails, and gray -cut nails must be bleeding. The moldy bedding must have nothing to do with Xiao Jiang. This is Teacher Lu. Their old couple&#39;s personal habits. Their habits of their family say that they have entered their family, there is no garbage, all treasures, and nothing are thrown. /P>; &lt;p>; The Xiao Jiang who hired Xiao Jiang in this building was introduced by Wang Wei. She said that only the Lu Delin family said that the problem was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jiang Aizhen is the clockman introduced by the security guard earlier, and it will be done at Wang Wei&#39;s house since 2012. &quot;Before the daughter -in -law returned to Shanghai this time, Mr. Lu&#39;s family had a good relationship with the nanny. They said that this nanny was his own daughter. Fortunately, there was a nanny, otherwise his life was gone. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Wang Wei told&quot; Southern Character Weekly &quot;that the money of 2 million yuan was given to Jiang Aizhen twice, all for a reason: the first time was because of the epidemic control. Time does nucleic acid almost every day. The nanny push up every day and rely on her alone. Another time is that a house of Mr. Shen was relocated. He said that he could not negotiate with him. I commissioned this nanny to do it, and finally seemed to get some money. Mr. Shen said, &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for his aunt to help him, he would not get so much.&quot; In the end, he had to ask Xiao Jiang to give himself the end of his elderly. At that time, during the epidemic closure, I did not know when the son came back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But these two things are another situation in Shen Allen&#39;s eyes. In terms of physical care, Shen Ailun said that in May 2020, there was an old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia, and Jiang Aizhen was taken care of, but paid an additional salary at the price of 300 yuan a day. This is a contract, not &quot;love or help&quot;; It is that the nanny is not done well, and the demolition funds have taken a lot less ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, Lu Delin and Shen Zongli, which are taken care of by Shen Yinan and Shen Allen, asked Jiang Aizhen to pay for the money in the video. Before being taken away, when the elderly and nanny coexisted, &quot;Southern Character Weekly&quot; obtained a recording. It was a conversation between the problem of money because of the problem of money on March 22, 2023: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Babysitter: &quot;All the money is transferred.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Shen Zongli: &quot;My money is to keep.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; nanny: &quot;You keep it here &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Shen Zongli:&quot; Two. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; nanny:&quot; I want it. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Shen Zongli:&quot; You bully me. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; The helplessness of &quot;nanny housekeeper&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Is it voluntary to give nanny money? Shen Zongli&#39;s answer is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At first he said that he was voluntarily gifts. He didn&#39;t change his mouth until he saw the babysitter&#39;s flowing water, recording, and video. Related recording and videos showed that the nanny personally admitted that it took 70,000 yuan for the elderly&#39;s account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shen Ailun told &quot;Southern Character Weekly&quot; that Shen Zongli claimed that he had been told many times that his money was the same in the nanny account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For 3 years in the new crown, Shen Ailun only returned to China once. At that time, she was ready to visit her in -laws, but she received a note written by her mother -in -law when she received her mother -in -law, which reads &quot;Don&#39;t return&quot;. Considering that he was afraid of infection at that time, Shen Allen did not return to 2401. Afterwards, Lu Delin told Shen Ailun that the note was written by the nanny, &quot;forced.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In 3 years, the &quot;nanny housekeeper&quot; became the theme of 2401, and even the &quot;outsiders&quot; who dealt with it were seen. inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Master Xia of the property told &quot;Southern Character Weekly&quot; that the two elderly people could not take care of themselves, and they had to accompany the nanny. The nanny had been around. The old man couldn&#39;t say anything even if he wanted to say anything. Usually, the two elderly people are at home, and they have no relatives. Only Lu Delin&#39;s students occasionally come, but &quot;after all, they are not family members. Many words cannot be said. Their family is decent people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A nearby chain -to -foot shop is regularly gone by nagbles Jiang Aizhen and Shen Zongli. The clerk called Shen Zongli as a &quot;big white rabbit&quot;, because he loves to eat big white rabbit toffee, and sometimes he eats several pieces at a time. Shen Ailun turned on the mobile phone shopping app. There were many large white rabbit toffee purchases, which were mailing to 2401. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The clerk called the &quot;nanny housekeeper&quot;: the nanny brought the big white rabbit, the big white rabbit&#39;s foot repair and nanny also repaired, and did the same project. When they paid, the babysitter paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;This kind of nanny is rare,&quot; the clerk recalled the actions of the nanny Jiang Aizhen. Other families are often accompanied by their children&#39;s family. On the day of the reporter&#39;s interview, the 103 -year -old man was received by the niece, accompanied by a niece. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting from the community, a few hundred meters apart in a shop, Jiang Aizhen sometimes takes the Lu Delin couple to eat. After returning to China this time, the owner of the shop told Shen Ailun privately, &quot;Hurry up your nanny.&quot; The reporter learned from the boss and confirmed this, &quot;I have never seen other nanny speeches so fierce.&quot; &lt;/P >; &lt;p>; Elderly people like Lu Delin and his wife have many in this community. The staff of the Sangcheng neighborhood committee told the Southern Character Weekly that it is a common phenomenon to visit from time to time from time to time. It is rare to take care of the nanny alone. Earlier, the neighborhood committee tried to mediate after hearing the news, but the nanny did not come. &quot;The nanny has never appeared. The neighborhood committee cannot represent which government or relevant departments on behalf of the government or relevant departments. Power. Also, when the nanny is absent or is not present, we also recommend that they take the judicial way and report to the court or public security. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The staff who have worked in the neighborhood committee for many years told&quot; &quot; &quot;Southern Person Weekly&quot;, usually encountered a nanny Jiang Aizhen, and did not feel the &quot;abuse&quot; related matters in the contact. But many things are closed, and no one will do what excessive things will do in the court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This will not be an example. Shanghai is the most aging cities in the country. According to data published by the monitoring statistics of the elderly population and aging cause in Shanghai in 2022, the 60 -year -old population of Shanghai household registration in 2022 had 5.536 million, accounting for 36.8%of the total household registration population. Among them, the elderly live alone were 3.06 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Whether or not being abused or deceived, for 3 years, the &quot;nanny housekeeper&quot;, until the contradiction broke out and rushed to the hot search, many neighbors saw the news on the mobile phone. Some neighbors had previously seen the news of their daughter -in -law complaining about the nagged Jiang Aizhen, and more neighbors knew nothing about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (The requirements of the interview, the characters Shen Yinan, Shen Ailun, Wang Wei are a pseudonym.) &lt;/p>; &lt;/&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“清朗·网络戾气整治”专项行动启动，打击网络厕所、开盒挂人等行为]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260790]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-17 17:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; The Party Committee of the Provincial, Autonomous Region, and the Municipal Party Committee directly under the Central Government. /SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; According to the overall arrangement of the special action of the &quot;Qinglang&quot; series in 2023, the Central Cyberspace Office decided to start the one -month &quot;clear · Internet suffix improvement&quot; nationwide starting from time to time.
