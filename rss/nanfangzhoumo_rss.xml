A few days ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two new versions of the vaccine from Moderna and Pfizer. The new version of the vaccine targets a variant of the Omicron virus called XBB.1.5. , this strain is widespread in most countries around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccination remains the best way to prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Vaccines can also reduce long-term COVID-19 effects. According to recommendations issued by the CDC, anyone who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past two months can receive this new version of the vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have more tools to prevent the serious consequences of the new coronavirus.” said Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the US CDC. The reason for issuing this recommendation is that the new coronavirus is still mutating, new subtypes are emerging one after another, and the protective effect of the vaccine has declined sharply over time. Vaccination with the new version of the vaccine can better protect public health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CDC&#39;s independent advisory committee voted 13:1 to recommend universal vaccination of this vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the supporters, Dr. Sandra Fryhoffer, associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine in the United States, believes that severe COVID-19 may occur in people of all ages, including people without underlying diseases. , coupled with the fact that many people have not received booster shots before, this means that the overall immunity to the new coronavirus is declining, so vaccination should be recommended for all people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Should ordinary people take the vaccine or not?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It has been more than three years since vaccination was encouraged, but the vaccine strategy is quietly changing. Most countries have not done so like the United States. Likewise, booster shots are recommended for everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the British government announced that the new version of the booster shot would be provided free of charge to seniors over 65 years old, frontline medical staff and vulnerable groups. France does not recommend booster shots for non-vulnerable groups. Germany has no plan for a booster shot in the autumn, although it has previously recommended that high-risk groups should receive a dose of the new crown vaccine every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers generally believe that because the main role of the new coronavirus vaccine is to prevent severe illness rather than infection, high-risk groups will benefit the most from vaccination. There is still controversy in the scientific community as to whether low-risk groups and minors should be vaccinated again. “It makes a lot of sense to get booster shots for the elderly, people with underlying diseases and immune deficiencies,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In the past three years since the spread of the new coronavirus, many people have gradually become numb to the virus infection, and the number of people choosing to be vaccinated has also gradually declined. But in fact, whether in the United States or China, there are many people who are repeatedly infected with the new coronavirus. CDC scientists report that hospitalizations for COVID-19 have been increasing since mid-July, and while most of them are young children and older adults, half of children under five hospitalized do not have underlying health conditions, a reminder that Even otherwise healthy people may be at risk of severe illness from COVID-19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the upcoming autumn and winter virus epidemic seasons, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and new coronaviruses are likely to be cross-infected, which will cause serious consequences for vulnerable groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Prepare before winter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In our country, the overall epidemic situation is in a state of sporadic sporadic spread, but the new coronavirus has not disappeared. The phenomenon of transmission still exists, and there are many people around us who experienced &quot;two positives&quot; a few months ago and are now experiencing &quot;three positives&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Based on the fact that COVID-19 is extremely contagious, antibodies naturally attenuate after being infected with COVID-19, and there is no absolutely protective COVID-19 vaccine, most people will be infected 1-3 times a year.” The Third People of Shenzhen City Professor Lu Hongzhou, director of the hospital, explained, “It will not have a particularly big impact on people with normal immune function.” However, for people with low immune function such as the elderly, diabetes, and underlying cancer diseases, Lu Hongzhou recommends regular vaccination with the new crown vaccine every year. Vaccination strategies can include combined immunization with nasal spray vaccine and subcutaneous injection vaccine, and multivalent COVID-19 combination vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 25, 2023, the &quot;Recent New Coronavirus Vaccination Work Plan for Key Populations&quot; issued by the Comprehensive Group of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council proposed that targeted new coronavirus vaccination be implemented for key populations such as the elderly. It is clear that during the epidemic period of the XBB variant strain of the new coronavirus, focusing on the autumn and winter of this year, vaccination containing the antigen components of the XBB variant strain is recommended as a priority. Experts call on people who have been infected and have not completed basic immunity to receive one dose of vaccine 3 months after infection. This will help provide better protection for people at high risk of severe illness and death in possible subsequent epidemics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some experts predict that the number of new coronavirus infections will increase after the start of school in September. According to the immunity cycle, the next wave of the new crown epidemic may appear around November this autumn. At this time, it is also the flu season. The superimposition of COVID-19 and influenza may lead to an increase in severe respiratory infections. Therefore, it is recommended to receive both influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. This is also recommended by the WHO - superposition of the two vaccines can maximize the prevention of severe illness. and mitigate the risk of viral cross-infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The increase in hospitalizations and deaths shows that coronavirus disease is here to stay and the world still needs tools to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, in September 2023 Emphasized at the media briefing on the 6th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天降烟头烫伤女婴，DNA比对锁定嫌疑人：胜于住户连坐多矣！丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256968]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Some time ago, a baby girl in Zhengzhou was burned by a cigarette butt falling from the sky in a community. The police collected blood from all the residents upstairs and compared the DNA on the cigarette butts, and successfully identified the suspect who threw the cigarette butts. This is another case of using high-tech means to identify the suspect of throwing objects from high altitude. It also reminds you again that throwing objects from high altitude is extremely harmful and the probability of police intervention to solve the case is greatly increased. Don’t take chances and try the law yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to The Paper, at the end of August, Ms. Huang was taking her 4-month-old baby for a walk downstairs when an unextinguished cigarette butt fell from the sky and burned the child&#39;s shoulders and neck. Although the surveillance cameras in the community only cover one floor and there is no high-altitude surveillance, it is impossible to find out who threw the cigarette butts through the video. However, the police successfully found the suspect who threw the object at high altitude by collecting blood from all the residents upstairs to test DNA. Not only will this person be liable for civil torts, but he is also likely to be subject to criminal penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tall buildings provide us with more living and working space and have become a symbol of modernization. However, they also bring the risk of throwing and falling objects from high altitudes. Carrying high-speed kinetic energy converted from high-altitude potential energy, even an egg weighing tens of grams may cause serious injury, not to mention other dangerous items. In recent years, there have been constant news about vehicles being damaged by objects thrown and falling from heights, killing and injuring people. In 2016, an iron fitness ball fell from the sky in Suining, Sichuan, killing a baby girl under one year old; in 2020, another 14-month-old baby in Shaoxing, Zhejiang was hit in the head by a brick thrown from upstairs. Causing brain death...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is unlikely that an unextinguished cigarette butt will injure someone, the risk of causing a fire or scalding someone is not small. In addition to the recent case in Zhengzhou, a similar case occurred in a community in Luzhou, Sichuan in 2021. A cigarette butt dropped from a high altitude burned through the roof of a baby car and almost burned the baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, casualties or property losses caused by falling objects from high altitudes were usually dealt with as civil infringements, and the victims had to collect evidence on their own to prosecute. Unless the impact was extremely serious, the police generally would not intervene in the investigation. The individual&#39;s ability to collect evidence is naturally very weak, and in most cases the perpetrator cannot be found. What to do? The previous law stipulates that in this case, all &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; will be compensated. That is to say, once an incident involving a high-altitude object injuring someone occurs and the perpetrator cannot be found, all residents upstairs (except those who have evidence to prove their Those who are not the perpetrators (for example, if the building is vacant and no one lives in it, etc.) will be &quot;sitting together.&quot; Although this provision allows the victim to receive compensation, it is very unfair to those who did not throw things downstairs. It may even condone the perpetrators, because the consequences of the evil are shared by many people. This legal provision and related court decisions have caused great controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to solving the problem is to find the perpetrators and punish them severely. This aspect relies on technological progress, such as high-altitude video surveillance, DNA comparison and other technologies, which can help identify the perpetrators. On the other hand, there are changes in legal provisions. If you still let the victim collect evidence on his own, it will basically be impossible. Because individuals do not have the right to collect DNA from others for identification, there are no legal provisions, and properties have no incentive to install high-altitude surveillance systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Civil Code and Criminal Law Amendment (11), which will be implemented in 2021, has changed this rule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the civil side, although the &quot;simultaneous sitting&quot; provisions still exist, the Civil Code requires the police to investigate in a timely manner in accordance with the law and identify the person responsible. The &quot;continuous sitting&quot; rule applies only when the police are unable to find out. As a result, it has become the legal duty of the police to identify the person responsible for falling objects from heights. The police have greater power and ability to conduct investigations. For example, they can narrow the scope of investigation based on the mobile phone signal at the location of the incident, and can force &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; to provide biological samples for DNA comparison. Through these technical means, the police can basically make the perpetrators invisible. Especially the DNA comparison is extremely shocking. In the case of a cigarette butt falling from the sky in Luzhou, Sichuan, which almost scalded a baby, the perpetrator voluntarily surrendered after the police completed the DNA analysis on the cigarette butt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Civil Code also stipulates that property management companies and other building managers should take necessary safety measures to prevent infringement incidents of falling objects from high altitudes; otherwise, they will bear tort liability for failing to perform safety guarantee obligations. In this way, the property management company will have the motivation to do a good job in prevention, monitoring and other tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of criminal liability, the judicial interpretation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court in 2019 stipulates that intentional throwing of objects from high altitude and negligent falling of objects from high altitude can be classified as &quot;crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means&quot; and &quot;negligence causing casualties.&quot; Convicted and punished for crimes such as &quot;serious accident crime&quot; and &quot;major liability accident crime&quot;. The Criminal Law Amendment (11), which took effect on March 1, 2021, has added the crime of &quot;throwing objects from high altitudes&quot;. Although the penalty for this crime is lighter than the penalty for &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot;, the police must open a case to investigate the crime regardless of the severity. This also means that under the new criminal law, the threshold for criminal offenses for throwing objects from high altitudes has been lowered, and the police have greater legal responsibilities to conduct criminal investigations. In this way, the probability of the perpetrator being discovered will be greatly increased, the possibility and intensity of punishment will also be greatly increased, and the deterrence of high-altitude missiles will also be greatly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use technology to let the law grow teeth and form sufficient deterrence. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will be caught and severely punished. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will have nowhere to hide. With fewer people daring to test the law, the sky above our heads will be safer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[坚守大山十年，月薪不到三千：支教老师“中年危机”何解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国铁集团：不可能给第三方平台“优先购票权”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 18:31:42&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Today, the railway department began to sell train tickets for October 3, with sufficient tickets left in all directions. From September 28th to October 2nd, there are still votes left. For tickets sold during the pre-sale period on and before September 27, there are sufficient remaining tickets in all directions. Based on passenger flow demand, tickets for the more than 100 additional passenger trains that the railway department will open during the holidays have been on sale since September 18, which can increase the passenger capacity by more than 70,000 seats per day. From September 13 to 18, the railway department sold a total of 111 million train tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on passenger travel demand, the railway department has arranged to open more than 100 additional passenger trains during the National Day holiday. These trains will run on September 28, and tickets will go on sale on September 18. The main directions for adding trains are: Nanchang to Guangzhou, Wuhan to Guangzhou, Changsha to Nanchang, Nanchang to Shanghai, Xiamen to Shanghai, Shenzhen to Changsha, etc. Based on train ticket pre-sales, waitlist ticket purchase data and railway transportation capacity, the railway department will also open additional passenger trains in popular directions and hot time periods in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Passenger travel is highly concentrated during the holidays, and train tickets in some popular directions and hot periods are in short supply. Passengers can choose to buy tickets by waitlisting, transfer, etc., or according to the remaining tickets at different times and directions. , choose to travel during off-peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, EMU train fares have implemented a differentiated floating pricing mechanism, which is mainly based on market supply and demand and passenger flow patterns, with the published fare as the maximum price, and is implemented in time periods, seats, and sections. A multi-tier, high and low ticket price floating strategy. During this year&#39;s National Day holiday, high-speed rail still implements differentiated fares. For example, the fare for EMU trains between Beijing and Shanghai is as high as 667 yuan and as low as 404 yuan for second-class seats. Passengers can choose according to their needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Railway 12306 has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only do they have traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, and bundled sales services, but they may also risk personal information leakage. Passengers please be sure to purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[治理矿山安全：实时监测八十余万名入井作业人员]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256970]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/SOkEroGpwkCPUDcHjKEN2TlsHU9Tjaruh9apHTj2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/SOkEroGpwkCPUDcHjKEN2TlsHU9Tjaruh9apHTj2. png&quot; data-key=&quot;251165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the morning of September 18, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a meeting on further strengthening mine safety. Opinions on Production Work&quot; press conference. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Du Hansan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local regulatory and supervisory departments and national supervisory agencies have connected all normal production and construction coal mines to the Internet. Sensory data such as safety monitoring, personnel positioning, and video surveillance can monitor more than 600,000 sensors, more than 800,000 well workers, and 39,000 household operating video surveillance data across the country in real time, and develop a variety of risk analysis and early warning functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Mine Safety Production Work&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Opinions&quot;). Deputy Director of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau Zhang Xin said that the opinions &quot;strive to fundamentally eliminate hidden dangers of accidents and fundamentally solve problems&quot; and further promote the transformation of the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; is the first programmatic document in the field of mine safety production issued with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It proposes a series of measures around &quot;preventive transformation&quot;, which is the first time at the national level. It is clearly required that the headquarters of mining-related central enterprises and large and medium-sized mining-related enterprises be equipped with safety directors, and it is required to standardize the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; require standardizing the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. The contracting unit dispatches project leaders, technical personnel and special operations personnel to the project department, and proposes to strive to establish the unit&#39;s own mining operations in production mines by the end of 2025. (Peel) the construction team or entrust an enterprise with corresponding conditions for overall management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo, director of the Safety Basics Department of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau, introduced that after the issuance of &quot;Several Provisions on Strengthening the Safety Management of Metal and Non-Metal Underground Mine Outsourcing Projects&quot; in 2021, a total of 1,360 inspection teams were organized across the country. More than 6,800 people were dispatched, which lasted 7 months, to inspect 3,895 outsourced engineering mines, resource integration coal mines and managed coal mines, and 134 major hidden dangers were discovered, during which 461 outsourcing teams were dismissed or transferred to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo pointed out that through special rectification, the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines has been further standardized and the management level has been greatly improved. “However, there are still inconsistent management of personnel teams, illegal contracting and subcontracting, and suspended safety responsibilities. , issues such as insufficient investment in safety.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; further requires the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines, clarifies the safety responsibilities of non-coal mines, and regulates the number of contracting units for metal and non-metal underground mines, the staffing and academic qualifications of contracting units, and blasting operations. As well as establishing its own mining team, clear requirements have been put forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Without control of disasters, there will be no peace for mines. The management of major disasters is always the top priority in promoting advance prevention.&quot; Zhang Xin said that the next step will be to carry out regular and institutionalized surveys and management of hidden disaster factors in mines. To achieve the transformation from passive prevention to active management, from single treatment to comprehensive treatment, and from underground partial treatment to surface area treatment, &quot;anything that has not been identified, explored, and not treated in place shall be allowed to carry out mining operations, and we must not cooperate with it.&quot; Disasters &#39;fight with bayonets.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng, director of the Non-Coal Mine Safety Supervision Department, said that in the future, not only will the investigation and rectification of major hidden dangers not be in place, the companies and responsible persons responsible for the accident will be held accountable, and the investigation and rectification will not be in place. Enterprises that cause major hidden dangers to still exist must also be held accountable, &quot;reflecting the concept of transforming the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小城千人围捕鳄鱼：已追回69条，仍有两条或在逃]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256981]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 17:31:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/598242ea15.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/598242ea15. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Crocodile capture scene.

In the truck was a freshly caught crocodile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui, a 43-year-old crocodile catcher, pulled the crocodile by its tail and dragged it out of the pickup truck with his team members. They were about to transfer the crocodile to the van, where three crocodiles were already tied up. The crocodile was dragged to the back of the truck, its limbs were tied to its sides, and its long mouth was tied with tape so that it could not open or close. Qiu Gui and three other team members wearing headlamps stood on both sides of the crocodile, holding its limbs and pushing upward together: &quot;One, two!&quot; The people standing in the carriage pulled the hemp rope around the crocodile&#39;s head and also Together they exerted upward force, and the crocodile successfully entered the &quot;cage&quot;.

On September 11, floods destroyed the fence of a crocodile farm in Luocun, the northern boundary, causing some crocodiles to escape. According to Nanfang+ news, there are a total of 71 crocodiles in the farm. As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, and there have been no incidents of crocodile injuries.

This is a crocodile species commonly found in breeding farms in Hainan, Guangdong and other places. According to relevant literature, there are no wild Siamese crocodiles in China, only breeding populations, which can be traded and operated with a license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by the crocodile farm where the incident occurred is the Guangdong Yufeng Crocodile Breeding Professional Cooperative, which was established in March 2019. Its legal representative is Xu Jinwang. With tens of thousands of crocodiles being farmed and more than 20 years of breeding experience, Mao celebrity Xu Jinwang is known as the &quot;Crocodile King&quot;. Xu Jinwang&#39;s wife, Ke Yiming, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they were under great pressure and suffered a huge loss, amounting to two to three million yuan. &quot;The crocodile is very valuable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Liming, an 81-year-old villager in Luo Village, Beijie, the fish pond used by Xu Jinwang to breed crocodiles was rented to him four or five years ago, totaling more than 30 acres, with an annual rent of 2,000 yuan. /acre, rented for 18 years.

Regarding whether the use of plastic baffles can effectively ensure that the crocodiles do not escape, Qiu Gui, a professional crocodile catcher with more than 20 years of experience, explained to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;This The baffle is OK.

Although he was scared, Wu Yanxin had a way to comfort himself: as long as he didn&#39;t go into the water or go to the shore, &quot;crocodiles don&#39;t walk that fast on the ground.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin often cycled and ran along the road around Pengcun Lake, taking 70 minutes to run an 8-kilometer lap. This is the largest body of water around the crocodile pond. Standing on the road around the lake, Wu Yanxin can see the crocodiles living in the pond. After the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin could no longer ride around the lake.

On September 17, Zhou Hui told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they began to install protective nets along Huanhu Road. It took about three or four days to complete the installation, and then spent several days reinforcing it. One morning around 1 a.m., he and his colleagues were installing a protective net on the road to the crocodile pond. About 20 meters away, a crocodile surfaced and opened its mouth, then sank into the water; another weighed three to four hundred pounds. The crocodiles were lying on the shore 50 meters away. Zhou Hui took a light and found two yellow eyes staring at them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yahong, the person in charge of supervision of the Crocodile Farm Residents Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, the village committee actively participated in catching the crocodile and arranged on-duty duty to ask the villagers not to go out and pay attention to safety. Wu Yahong said that when there were heavy rains in the past, he would remind the staff in the crocodile farm to pay attention to safety: &quot;The water has almost reached your crocodile pond, and the crocodiles have escaped. But this time the water is too big, and the crocodile pond has been soaked.&quot; ), the crocodile ran out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the adjacent Dapo Village Committee told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, in order to ensure that there were no casualties, &quot;we launched There are more than 30 party members and volunteers, guarding various checkpoints 24 hours a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to capture the crocodile as soon as possible and ensure the safety of nearby residents, the 5-kilometer radius around the incident site is a key investigation area. A total of 51 outposts, 33 patrol teams, and nearly 1,000 staff were set up in the area to carry out arrests. On September 15, a militiaman on duty told Southern Weekend reporters that the day the crocodiles first escaped, the water level was still very high, and the farm was full of people. Everyone was busy pumping water and holding sandbags to block the water. &quot;If you are not afraid of the crocodiles appearing, then There are so many people, what are you afraid of, all the SWAT police are armed with guns.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;626&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to find crocodiles, the farm conducts water surveys.

The nearest gunshot to him was on the night of September 14, when a crocodile weighing two to three hundred pounds was found in a small drainage ditch near his family&#39;s paddy field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shooting a crocodile in the water is not easy. &quot;When you shoot it, it goes into the water. It&#39;s not like those on the ground, where it stays in place.&quot; A special police officer holding a sniper rifle said. A colleague on the side gave him an idea, &quot;Someone has to fill in the gun.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;SWAT searches for an escaped alligator. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with shooting crocodiles in the water, Qiu Gui believes that finding crocodiles is the most important and most time-consuming link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to find the escaped crocodiles, the local area used sonar detection, drone inspections, and even tied ducks to the shore to lure the crocodiles to prey. A staff member of the sonar team told a reporter from Southern Weekend that the difficulty in detecting crocodiles with sonar is that it is difficult to detect crocodiles when they are swimming. The sound produced by drones usually scares timid crocodiles. The duck trapping effect is even weaker. The water area within which the crocodile escapes is large and there are many fish and shrimps. The crocodile has no shortage of food at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui has his own methods after dealing with crocodiles for more than 20 years. In this arrest operation, including at the breeding farm, their team of six arrested a total of 56 animals, with the most on September 14, when 14 were captured. The remaining 13 were killed by special police and captured by crocodile catching teams from Zhanjiang, Yangjiang, Guangzhou and Foshan. Most of the crocodiles caught weighed more than 200 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui and his party usually go out at night, because crocodiles are more alert during the day and will quickly hide in the water after noticing any movement around them. At night, crocodiles often stay in one place and are relatively slow. You can catch them by moving slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike humans, crocodile eyes do not close from birth to death. Therefore, as long as you shine a flashlight at night, the yellow-glow eyes will reveal the location of the crocodile. At 2 a.m. on September 18, while searching for the last two crocodiles, Qiu Gui boarded the kayak again and searched for traces of crocodiles in Pengcun Lake. The night before, they found and captured three crocodiles here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui pointed the flashlight at the water and grass on the shore. He explained that the crocodile likes to come ashore at nine or ten o&#39;clock in the morning when the sun is getting warmer. Basking in the sun will make it easier for it to digest food in its stomach. A 200-pound crocodile can eat 10 pounds a day. After it is full, it will come ashore. If it is not frightened, it will stay until it has finished digesting and then go into the water to hunt. &quot;There is not much knowledge to find crocodiles, and there is no shortcut, just use a lamp to shine.&quot; Qiu Gui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Crocodiles at night are easier to find and catch. After Qiu Gui and his party discovered the crocodile, they would carefully move the boat closer and stun the crocodile within one meter of the crocodile. &quot;After the stun, the crocodile&#39;s body seemed to be stiff.&quot; Taking advantage of the 10-15 minutes when the crocodile was unconscious, the capture team The crocodile man drags the crocodile onto the boat and binds its mouth and limbs as soon as possible. &quot;As long as you tie its mouth and don&#39;t let it open, the crocodile will be 100% controlled.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the most important thing is teamwork, and nothing can be done without tacit understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A tied up crocodile is equally dangerous. After the crocodile wakes up, its head and tail can still attack. If it hits the leg, &quot;it will break the leg directly, no joke.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the crocodile has an attack range. &quot;We usually stand in the middle of it, which is equivalent to its blind spot. But we should also stay 1.5 meters away from it, which will be safer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text -align: center;&quot;>;A crocodile was captured near a fence.

One of the focuses of the search that day was several fish ponds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish pond is located in Helijing Village, only two to three hundred meters away from the crocodile farm. On September 15, the owner of a fish pond told Southern Weekend reporters that two crocodiles had been pulled into his fish pond. One was electrocuted and the other was shot. There may be crocodiles in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the fish pond is three to four meters deep and there are many fish, methods such as electric shock, duck trapping and even shooting are ineffective. A staff member of the Maoming Emergency Management Bureau told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The water is too deep to find the crocodiles. It would be best if they could be put into water about one meter deep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the village Negotiations between the committee and fish pond owners on the compensation plan after the water was released did not go smoothly. Cai Fang, the wife of the above-mentioned pond owner, told Southern Weekend reporters that tens of thousands of fry were put into her fish pond, as well as some fish feed. &quot;The total cost is tens of thousands of yuan. Now we propose to pump half of the water and compensate for 2,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Fang does not agree with the compensation plan. She believes that if half of the water is drained, the remaining fish will He died of lack of oxygen and was worried that the crocodile would not be found hiding in the mud at the bottom of the pond. &quot;What if someone is bitten later, will I, the pond owner, be responsible?&quot; Cai Fang hoped that a thorough search could be carried out and the pond water could be drained. , make sure there are no crocodiles in the pond, and also handle the fish in the pond casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several rounds of negotiations, on the evening of September 15, the two parties reached a compensation agreement at a price of 1,000 yuan per mu of water surface. Early the next morning, an excavator dug up the edge of the pond. After searching, no trace of the crocodile was found in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, but there are still two cases with no clues. After another two days of searching, this data has not changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/9f921aceea.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/9f921aceea.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The capture team searched the lake at night.

They suspected that the two crocodiles May have died during breeding. &quot;Crocodiles are the most ferocious during the mating season. They will fight for the right to mate. If they fight too hard, some crocodiles will die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of September 19, the scope of the crocodile search The crocodile hunter&#39;s team began to search along the lower reaches of Pengcun Lake, one kilometer away from the crocodile farm. The search was still fruitless all night long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the last two are not found, we will not stop the work.&quot; said the above-mentioned Maoming Emergency Management Bureau staff member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Zhou Hui and Cai Fang are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被指定居所监视居住者离世：公安称其余同案人员“不应当追究刑责”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256978]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/sA6bxukyIFAQtylG7MLw3gnjOtDGltCBo6F8Vjfv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/sA6bxukyIFAQtylG7MLw3gnjOtDGltCBo6F 8Vjfv. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251184&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bao Qinrui was once placed under residential surveillance at a designated location in Xinle Hotel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of September 19, 2023, Bao Qinrui has been dead for 426 days, but his wife Bao Linlin and her family have not yet received the conclusion of the death investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui was from Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province.

&lt;p>;病历显示，陪暴钦瑞到医院就诊的是新乐市公安局工作人员，“工作单位或家庭住址”一栏填写的是新乐宾馆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据新乐市公安局答复暴钦瑞父亲的说法，2022年7月19日，也就是事发当天，石家庄市检察院就介入此事，对暴钦瑞死亡进行调查。其间，他的遗体一直存放在新乐市殡仪馆内，没有火化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;死亡原因调查停滞&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;暴琳琳记得，2022年7月7日凌晨，暴钦瑞在裕华区的家中被警方带走。之后，她收到新乐市公安局邮寄的通知书，上面写明暴钦瑞被执行指定居所监视居住，原因是“涉嫌寻衅滋事”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴琳琳再次见到丈夫，是在新乐市殡仪馆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新乐市医院的抢救记录记载，2022年7月19日21点38分，医院接到急救电话，暴钦瑞随后被送到医院。连续抢救3个多小时后，暴钦瑞仍无意识，无自主呼吸及心跳，医院宣告其死亡。新乐市110警务人员于次日凌晨1时38分签字，并联系新乐市殡仪馆。医院建议进行尸检，进一步明确死亡原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴钦瑞离世8个月后，2023年3月30日上午，石家庄市检察院安排对暴钦瑞的遗体进行解剖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴钦瑞的父亲暴继业向南方周末记者回忆，2023年6月19日，石家庄市检察院向他出示了一份尸检报告，结论为“排除机械性损伤致人死亡，排除中毒致人死亡，不排除窦房结疾病引发心电活动紊乱、心脏骤停导致死亡”。暴继业没有在报告上签字，并申请由家属委托机构进行二次尸检。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于暴钦瑞死亡原因的调查就此停滞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴继业询问参与调查的石家庄市检察院检察官曹志，曹志答复，二次尸检需向新乐市公安局申请。新乐市公安局工作人员答复暴继业，这一申请应当与石家庄市检察院沟通，“公安局也是当事人，我们来做尸检，你也不信”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月18日下午，曹志在接受南方周末记者采访时表示，目前关于暴钦瑞的死亡还没有调查结论。至于是否可以进行二次尸检，“这是内部调查程序，不能对外公布”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最高检、公安部、民政部联合发布的《看守所在押人员死亡处理规定》中规定，公安机关、检察院委托机构进行尸检，应征求死者近亲属意见。近亲属提出另行委托机构进行尸检的应当允许。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，指定居所监视居住期间人员死亡，委托机构进行尸检时是否需要家属同意，目前尚没有出台明确规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;同案者&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;取保&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;暴琳琳至今不清楚暴钦瑞的什么具体行为涉嫌寻衅滋事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与暴钦瑞同一天被执行指定居所监视居住的，还有8人——暴钦瑞的父亲暴继业、哥哥暴韶瑞、叔叔暴记忠和暴纪涛、表弟暴卓瑞，以及3名同村村民，都涉嫌寻衅滋事，执行地点也在新乐宾馆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴钦瑞过世一个多月后，2022年9月1日，暴继业、暴韶瑞被取保候审。 9月28日，暴记忠、暴纪涛等其余6人被取保候审。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8人都表示在监视居住期间遭到了殴打、电击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴钦瑞死亡两天后，2022年7月22日下午，还在监视居住状态中的暴纪涛因发烧被送入新乐市中医医院治疗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据暴纪涛的住院病历，入院时他“双小腿疼痛3-4天，左侧胸肋部疼痛1天，左膝盖可见皮肤损伤已结痂，右下肢可见片状淤青，双小腿可见红色斑疹”。胸痛后经检查，确诊为左侧肋骨骨折。住院7日后，暴纪涛在7月29日出院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月19日，新乐市公安局解除对8人的取保候审，理由是“发现不应当追究刑事责任”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;举报人表述“反转”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在暴继业收到的解除取保候审通知上，写着他所涉案件为“5•25专案”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴继业、暴韶瑞回忆，监视居住期间，警方询问了他们是否殴打过前去讨薪的孙会强等人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;涉案的暴钦瑞等9人都是石家庄市高邑县南塔影村人。事发前，暴钦瑞在高邑县住建局工作。暴继业在高邑经营着一家瓷砖厂，暴韶瑞、暴纪涛、暴卓瑞都在厂里工作。暴记忠为南塔影村党支部书记。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙会强是一名包工头，曾在2013、2014年间参与暴继业的瓷砖厂厂区建设。他告诉南方周末记者，2022年5月22日，在一名工人家中，裕华区公安局民警给他和另5名参与施工的工人做了笔录。当时，他和工人的说法都是，2014年春天，他们去瓷砖厂讨薪，遭到暴继业、暴记忠等人殴打。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但2023年9月12日，孙会强在接受南方周末记者采访时称，自己当时做了假证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照孙会强的讲述，2022年年初，他和暴继业的确有经济纠纷，双方关于工程款数额有20万元的出入，当时正处在协商阶段。与暴继业同村的村民暴某某（化名）联系上他，说自己与在村里担任党支部书记的暴记忠有矛盾。暴某某许诺，只要孙会强按他说的做，不但工程款能要回来，甚至比他要求的数目更高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得知暴钦瑞出事后，2022年9月、2023年6月，孙会强和工人们又重新向公安机关作了笔录，重新说明情况，表明自己没有被暴继业、暴记忠等人殴打。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年4月，暴继业注意到，短视频平台上又出现了对他“涉黑涉恶”的举报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一人是66岁的张书科，同样和暴继业就工程款的数目有些争议。 2023年4月21日，网名为“窦娥冤”的用户在短视频平台上发布了一则题为“真人真事绝不骗人”的视频：张书科手持身份证讲述，“实名举报高邑县以暴继业、暴记忠为首的黑社会团伙，以欺诈手段恶意欠我工程款60万。我去要账，遭到多次殴打、辱骂，并扬言再到厂里要账，打死活埋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴继业以侵犯名誉权为由起诉张书科。 2023年6月7日，高邑县法院对此案进行调解。双方达成协议：张书科删除上述视频，并录视频向暴继业道歉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，目前短视频平台上仍能搜索到这条视频。张书科向南方周末记者解释，视频中所说内容并不真实，自己没有被暴继业殴打，视频是在暴某某建议下录制的。当时，暴某某告诉他，“把事情说严重点就有人管你，说实情就没人管。”法院调解后，他曾联系暴某某删除视频，但暴某某也删不了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月18日，南方周末记者联系上暴某某。他提供的说法与孙会强、张书科不同。他表示，是暴继业、暴记忠等人取保候审后，通过“威逼利诱”的方式，收买举报人，让他们翻供。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;什么是“住处”？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;儿子离世后，暴继业疑惑的是，自己是石家庄市高邑县人，为什么由新乐市公安局执行指定居所监视居住？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监视居住是刑事诉讼法中规定的5种强制措施之一。北京大学法学院教授陈永生解释，5种强制措施的强制力度是梯级结构，由弱到强分别是拘传、取保候审、监视居住、拘留和逮捕。监视居住作为一种过渡措施，意味着犯罪嫌疑人或被告人不需要像拘留、逮捕那样完全关押，但要求不能离开住所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对符合逮捕条件的犯罪嫌疑人或被告人，3种情况下可以采取监视居住措施，一是因自身因素，患有严重疾病、怀孕等；二是案件特殊性或者办案需要；三是羁押期限届满,案件尚未办结,为了避免超期羁押,实行监视居住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指定居所监视居住则是监视居住的一种特殊情形。刑事诉讼法中规定了两类可以指定居所监视居住的情况：犯罪嫌疑人或被告人无固定住处，或是案件涉嫌危害国家安全犯罪、恐怖活动犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国人大常委会法制工作委员会编写的《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法释义》对“住处”的解释是，犯罪嫌疑人、被告人在办案机关所在地的市、县内生活、工作的合法住所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而涉案9人都在高邑县有住所，暴钦瑞、暴韶瑞在裕华区也有房产。陈永生认为，只要当事人在石家庄市内有房产，按照法律规定，就不符合适用指定居所的情形。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月15日下午，新乐市公安局一位副局长告诉暴继业，此案由石家庄市公安局裕华分局、新乐市公安局和高邑县公安局三方组成专案组，联合办案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但为何最终由新乐市公安局对暴钦瑞等9人执行指定居所监视居住？ 2023年9月18日，南方周末记者短信联系新乐市公安局局长郭杰，截至发稿，尚未收到回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D重现利比亚极端洪水，上万人身亡，大量高楼被夷为平地]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256966]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从奥本海默到“核武之王”，这70年经历了什么？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256964]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/r6FiloQ2QNq1q67PqYHr7zhROxZiFIGrf2SP6ELu.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;从奥本海默到“萨尔马特”，这70年到底经历了什么？让我们回顾核武器的发展历史。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;奥本海默的“遗产”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;奥本海默，一个与原子弹和“曼哈顿工程”紧密联系的名字。这位犹太天才科学家自小就显示出不同凡响的天赋——幼年时,受母亲影响涉猎艺术、文学、哲学、历史、科学和语言等各个领域，11岁时因为在矿物研究方面的成绩成为纽约矿物俱乐部年纪最小的会员，18岁从纽约菲尔德斯顿文理学校以第一名成绩毕业（美国很多政商和文化界名人都出自这所学校）后，考入哈佛大学化学系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大学毕业后，奥本海默先是进入英国剑桥大学著名的卡文迪许实验室，之后，奥本海默受量子力学奠基人、1954年诺贝尔物理学奖获得者玻恩的引荐，去了著名的哥廷根大学。1927年，奥本海默以在量子力学方面的研究获得博士学位，没多久后决定回到美国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他一生中的高光时刻，是主持美国的核武器项目——“曼哈顿工程”。作为耗资25亿美元、最多时参与人数超过50万的“曼哈顿工程”总指挥，奥本海默充分展现了自己的科学素养和管理才能。在电影中，奥本海默将该工程称为“赌博”——他赌赢了，美国也赌赢了：1945年7月16日清晨5点30分，人类历史上第一颗原子弹在洛斯阿拉莫斯沙漠成功爆炸成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奥本海默的后半生，却因为这项为他带来巨大声望的工程而饱受屈辱与困扰。电影《奥本海默》生动地再现了他如何遭到麦卡锡主义和施特劳斯上将为代表的政客的迫害。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1967年2月18日，奥本海默因喉癌逝世，终年63岁。此后的半个世纪，他给世人留下了什么遗产？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至2020年初，斯德哥尔摩和平研究所的资料显示，美国、俄罗斯、英国、法国等国拥有大约13400件核武器，其中3720件已部署作战部队，其中约1800枚处于高度警戒状态。这些核武器专门由各种各样的运载系统所携带，包括陆基和海基远程弹道导弹、重型轰炸机、歼击轰炸机、空射和海射巡航导弹、空防和导弹防御拦截导弹、鱼雷和深水炸弹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国科学家联盟“核信息项目”主任汉斯·克里斯滕森认为，美国和俄罗斯均拥有规模十分庞大的核武库，以短程战术核力量为后盾，由洲际弹道导弹、海射弹道导弹和可携带核武器的飞机构成了“三位一体”的远程战略核力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他一些国家具备“二位一体”的中程核力量及（或）远程核力量（即具备“三位一体”三要素中的任意两个要素）。有的正向“三位一体”过渡，并有传言称以色列可能已经具备了“三位一体”的核力量。此外，巴基斯坦和印度还拥有短程核武器。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以说，经过70年的发展，核武器不仅改变了军事斗争的形式，还对人类社会与国际战略格局的发展产生了深远影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“核武之王”的诞生&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”洲际弹道导弹可谓诞生于危难之际。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏联解体之后，继承其衣钵的俄罗斯在武装力量建设方面与苏联相比不可同日而语。与苏联不同，俄罗斯是一个资源型国家，因此在常规武器方面远不及其对手北约。核力量因此日益成为俄罗斯军事力量的核心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陆基核力量是俄“三位一体”核力量的基础和支柱。俄核力量承袭自苏联，战略火箭军列装的SS-18“撒旦”、SS-19“匕首”和SS-25“白杨”三种老旧洲际弹道导弹系统占俄陆基核武器运载工具的一半以上，这三种老式导弹系统将达到服役期限。一旦退役，会给俄战略核力量的稳定性带来巨大影响。因此，俄罗斯决定研制新型洲际弹道导弹来替代即将退役的SS-18。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2009年，“萨尔马特”洲际弹道导弹由马克耶夫设计局开始研发，曾在2017年12月和2018年3月进行了弹射试验，并取得了成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从性能来说，这一被俄罗斯寄予厚望的“国之重器”，着实让人有种惊艳的感觉。“萨尔马特”长约35米，直径约3米，起飞重量约200吨，有效载荷可达10吨，射程可达17000公里。命中精度约为200米。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”采用冷发射方案，发射时先用火药蓄压器将导弹弹射到发射井上方20-30米高度，然后导弹自行点火起飞。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”能够携载多达10枚重型或15枚轻型独立瞄准的分导式核弹头，或者24枚“先锋”高超声速助推滑翔弹，可对不同目标实施毁灭性打击，并从多个目标中进行识别性攻击。携带10枚分导弹头时，每枚弹头的当量达到75万吨TNT。导弹战斗部采用了多种先进的突防技术，如隐身技术及材料、分导式多弹头及诱饵弹、高超声速助推滑翔弹头和机动灵活的变轨能力等。其打击威力相当于在广岛爆炸的原子弹的1600倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”有三大绝技。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是打得远。该型导弹的射程达17000公里。超远的射程让这款导弹从俄罗斯境内的任一地域发射，都可以有效打击全球预定目标。据推测，“萨尔马特”可以飞越南极上空，完全绕过美国当前所有的导弹防御系统，对美国实施打击。还有人推测，其具备部分轨道轰炸能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是打得巧。这个巧就体现在超强的突防能力上。在现代战争中，地对地导弹的突防能力日益成为衡量导弹综合技术水平的重要指标。该型导弹外形设计和涂料上采用了隐身技术及材料，导弹助推段较短，增大了敌方雷达和卫星发现、跟踪并实施拦截的难度。强大的动力使其具备超远的射程，能够飞越两极实施攻击，甚至可能具备部分轨道轰炸能力，可最大限度避开反导系统。导弹可携带十余枚分导式弹头，同时配合使用多个诱饵弹头，大幅提高反导系统的辨识难度和自身的突防概率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，“萨尔马特”还可携载“先锋”高超声速滑翔弹头，这种弹头具备极快的速度和超强的变轨能力，敌方防空和反导系统几乎无法拦截。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是打得准。“萨尔马特”采用惯性制导、星光制导和格罗纳斯卫星制导的复合制导方式。三种方式相互结合、优势互补，将导弹命中精度缩小至约150米，而采用惯性制导方式的SS-18导弹命中精度为350米。打击精度的提高就是打击威力的提高，在这方面，“萨尔马特”做得非常出色，处于世界先进水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”是一款液体燃料导弹。对于弹道导弹而言，使用固体燃料和液体燃料的差别在于比推力、毒性、安全性、易控制性方面。液体燃料比固体燃料比推力大，因此，使用液体燃料的弹道导弹段数比固体燃料少一级。而燃料的加注需要较长时间，因此不太适合作为核反击的手段使用——更适合进行“先发制人”的核打击，这无形中又增加了对北约的威慑力度。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;核武器的未来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;作为地球上最具毁灭性的力量，核武器的发展在未来将呈现出几个趋势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，投掷核弹头的手段将向高超声速导弹发展。随着现代导弹防御系统的不断成熟演进，如何提高核导弹的突防能力已经成为一个重要问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在当前的装备中，高超声速导弹这种新概念武器开始脱颖而出。高超声速技术是指飞行速度超过5倍声速的飞行器技术，是21世纪航空航天技术的制高点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高超声速导弹的突出优势主要体现在3个方面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是它基本在大气高层飞行，飞行高度仅有30-80公里，末段高度可能只有20多公里，极大地影响了传统弹道导弹防御系统的早期预警雷达的探测能力。以美“铺路爪”为代表的早期预警雷达对远程和洲际导弹的探测距离高达数千公里，但对数十公里高度飞行的高超声速武器的探测距离只有数百公里。因此，弹道导弹防御系统对这类飞行器的防御效果大打折扣。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是由于它在大气层内受控飞行，相比传统弹道导弹呆板的弹道，其具备不错的机动能力。加上高超声速的速度，导致对其拦截的难度大幅度上升，进一步削弱了传统弹道导弹防御系统的拦截能力。或者说，高超声速滑翔飞行器显著提高了突防能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高超声速滑翔飞行器还可结合传统弹道导弹使用，这样的结合虽然提高了飞行中段被拦截的危险，但大幅度提高了导弹的实际射程。这种技术趋势在“萨尔马特”导弹身上已经表现得非常明显。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来，深海将有可能会成为核武器投射的重要空间。深海由于其特殊的物理特性，雷达波无法穿透，因此开展军事行动非常隐蔽。俄罗斯开发的“波塞冬”核鱼雷就是基于这种逻辑进行研发的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据称，“波塞冬”最大时速将超过200千米（约110节），最大下潜深度超过1000米。在水下具备如此高的航速，无法对其实施有效拦截，目前服役的最快的核潜艇的最大时速为35节，西方国家装备最先进的鱼雷最大速度为55节，这样使得现有的鱼雷武器无法拦截“波塞冬”。该鱼雷能搭载200万吨TNT当量的核弹头或常规弹头。在敌方海岸附近爆炸时，可引发巨大的海啸，对港口、城市等造成毁灭性打击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经推算，其能够形成跨幅达550千米，最大浪高500米的巨大海啸冲击，任何停泊在港口中的船舶都无法幸存。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界上第一颗原子弹在试验场成功爆炸后，奥本海默曾引用印度教经文《薄伽梵歌》中的一句话：现在我变成了死亡，世界的毁灭者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着70年的发展，导弹技术的进步将倒逼反导技术进一步提升。高能激光、电磁炮等新概念武器将有可能运用到导弹防御体系中去。人类战争将因此拉开又一轮攻防博弈的序幕。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而片中奥本海默与爱因斯坦的对话，显示出对个人命运和未来的迷茫，依然没有答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为上海政法学院东北亚研究中心副主任）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人买金，老年人卖金？广州市民卖1公斤套现44万多元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:30:48&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I received an order last month, 1 kilogram, and gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot; One person Said an industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the price of gold in the domestic retail market has continued to rise, once exceeding 600 yuan per gram. Topics such as gold prices have been hotly searched. So far, consumers’ enthusiasm has not diminished. Amid the gold buying craze, gold The recycling market is also experiencing a gold selling boom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the working day of September 18, Nandu reporters visited the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou and the supermarket in Tianhe District, Guangzhou. They saw that many people still went to consult or buy gold. The gold price that day It has dropped from last week, and the gold recycling prices online and offline, and for different brands, are different, with big differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, most young people have been buying gold recently, and they are particularly fond of gold beans, which cost around 500 yuan each and weigh 1 gram, as a way to save, which has aroused heated discussion. It is worth noting that after visits, we also found that many middle-aged and elderly people are selling gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“People in their 40s and 50s come to sell”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At around 1:00 noon on September 18, Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou, Signs such as &quot;Recycle Gold and Silver Jewelry&quot; and &quot;Recycle Gold at High Prices&quot; are hung up. At the street intersection, there are many young people hurriedly entering the gold shop, as well as middle-aged and elderly people holding small bags in the store and looking around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen Shuibei is known as the &quot;barometer&quot; of the gold and jewelry market. Hengtai Jewelry, located in the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, is the Guangzhou branch of Shenzhen Shuibei. The reporter found that within half an hour, , the number of consumers in the store has always remained above 20, and most of them sit around the display cabinet to inquire about and buy gold jewelry. One row sells gold jewelry with smaller grams such as Jin Doudou, and the other row sells gold bracelets with larger grams. Waiting, &quot;We are getting married, so we came to buy during the lunch break. Today (September 18) the price is a little lower than before.&quot; A pair of young people are buying gold bracelets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1383&quot; height=&quot;1086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251166&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold recycling area in the corner of the store, there is an electronic screen showing the continuously fluctuating price: gold repurchase is 468.98 yuan, and the highest price of the day is 471.72 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The price of recycling at the end of last year reached more than 400 yuan.&quot; According to the staff of the store, the price of gold in the whole store that day was 471 yuan, the price of recycled gold bars or gold sheets was 468 yuan, and the price of recycled gold was 468 yuan. Accessories cost 5 yuan less, calculated as 463 yuan, which is 2 yuan lower than at the weekend. At present, most of the gold sheets on the market are mainly one kilogram, and such as gold beans and bracelets are gold jewelry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half an hour, two citizens over the age of 50 came to inquire about the gold recycling market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Recently, gold sellers have to line up outside, and the whole street is filled with gold sellers.” An industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years also opened a store in the gold wholesale business district. He opened a jewelry store specializing in gold recycling. On that day, he also recycled gold for 463 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many grams of recycling, and the recycling price can still be negotiated.” This industry insider said that the recycling price has risen to more than 460 yuan in the past half month, and the recycling price reached the highest level of 479 yuan per gram last week, maintaining the same level. In half a day, &quot;I received an order last month with a unit price of more than 440 yuan per kilogram, and I gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half a month, the recycling price increased from more than 440 yuan per gram. to more than 460 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, prices in the domestic gold retail market have continued to rise, driving the growth of the recycling business. According to an industry insider, he recycled one order that day and has made more than 20 orders in the past ten days. “They are all in the 40s or 50s. There are no young people to sell to people who are 20 years old.&quot; said the above-mentioned industry insider. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The price difference between the recycling of branded gold jewelry is more than 100 yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Unlike the wholesale market, the recycling market in supermarkets in Tianhe District, Guangzhou is relatively cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 3 pm, almost every gold brand store in Tianhe City in Tianhe District had people shopping. The listed prices of gold in different brand stores are different, all above 600 yuan per gram, and some are as high as 600 yuan per gram. The gold price is 610 yuan per gram, but there are basically price discounts ranging from 20 to 40 yuan. According to many staff on site, the price of gold has dropped by a few yuan from the peak last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for recycling services, only a few brands provide them and the recycling prices are low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Tianhe City China Gold Store, the gold price after discount is 568 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 405 yuan per gram. There are relatively few people coming to sell, &quot;Today (September 18) ) No one recycles it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The selling price of Jinzhizun gold is 609 yuan per gram, and only the investment gold bars are recycled, which is recycled at 430 yuan that day. Lao Fengxiang and Chow Tai Fook do not have on-site recycling services. Among them, Chow Tai Fook’s gold price is 608 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 451 yuan. According to a staff member of Chow Tai Fook, this store cannot recycle, and you have to go to the store on Beijing Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251167&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangzhou Tianhe City Chow Tai Fook Store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to offline platforms, many e-commerce platforms also provide gold recycling services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter randomly searched for &quot;Guangzhou gold recycling&quot; on Taobao, Tmall and other platforms, selected 4 stores with sales of 1,000+ payments, and inquired from customer service. They all said that the recycling price was 465 yuan per gram, and the price was 465 yuan per gram in the same city. You can come to your door for recycling and pay on the spot; but if the store is in other cities, it needs to be evaluated online. The consumer takes a photo of the store link and mails it to the merchant. After the merchant signs and checks the gram number, the merchant pays the consumer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the recycling prices of gold jewelry of different brands are different online and offline, and there is a big difference. For the wholesale market, it is generally 8-10 yuan less than the gold price sold; for brand stores in supermarkets , the difference is more than 100 yuan; while the online recycling price is 2 yuan more than that in the offline wholesale market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some supermarkets need to pay nearly a thousand yuan for redemption&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I just received a customer to redeem.” The reporter said Visiting supermarket brands also found that although many brand stores do not recycle gold and can only exchange old items for new ones, and the method is complicated, many consumers come to consult or exchange for the styles they like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trade-in means that the gold products in the hands of consumers are discounted according to the current gold price and then purchased in-store at the current selling price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251168&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hengtai Jewelry Store on Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Lao Fengxiang, if you want to exchange for gold that is not of this brand, based on the gold listing price of the brand that day is 608 yuan per gram, the discount per gram you want to exchange is 30 yuan, and the number of grams must also be calculated. 10% off, 30% more grams purchased. In other words, if you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, which is originally 6,080 yuan, you need to calculate the price based on 9 grams of 578 yuan, which is 5,202 yuan, and an additional 3 grams of gold, which is 1,824 yuan, for the total exchange price That’s 7026 yuan. In other words, you need to make a minimum payment of 946 yuan to redeem it, and the crafting fee is additional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, China Gold, Chow Tai Fook and other stores have different discounts for redemption. Among them, China Gold staff said that if you want to exchange for gold that is not of the same brand, you will have to pay a price difference of 40 yuan per gram, and there is no labor fee. You can choose the type and quantity of the exchange. According to the staff of Chow Tai Fook, there are two options. If you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, first, you need to exchange for a product heavier than 10 grams, and the discount is calculated as 85 yuan per gram; second, use the selling price of the day, exchange for a product with twice the gram, that is, 20 grams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, reporters also found that many consumers exchanged for gold products. At noon on September 18, two Guangzhou citizens in their 50s brought 10.06 grams of gold chains to change styles and walked into a gold store. A sign hanging outside the gold store read &quot;Old gold for new, one gram for one gram.&quot; According to reports, the gold chain is charged based on the recycling price of 463 yuan plus 15% handicraft fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[安徽十元“盒饭姐”爆火后流泪，围观的边界感在哪？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
