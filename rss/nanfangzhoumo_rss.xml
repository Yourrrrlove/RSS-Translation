According to reports on the official website of the Ministry of Science and Technology, this is Yin Hejun’s first public event after taking office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 7, 2023, the Ministry of Science and Technology held a meeting of leading cadres and announced Yin Hejun as party secretary. Yin Hejun’s predecessor Wang Zhigang was born in 1957 and served as Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Science and Technology for 11 years. In the State Council’s institutional reform plan released in March 2023, the Ministry of Science and Technology ushered in the second reorganization in five years. Yin Hejun became the first new party secretary after the reorganization of the Ministry of Science and Technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a scholar-type official, Yin Hejun has served in universities and scientific research institutions for many years. Many interviewed experts believe that compared with the institutional reform in 2018, after this reorganization, the Ministry of Science and Technology will focus on solving basic research and &quot;stuck&quot; problems. This is also a challenge that Yin Hejun has to face head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Multiple times filled gaps in the fields of science and technology and military equipment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a member of the 20th Central Committee, Yin Hejun was born in Gujiao, Shanxi Province in 1963 January. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, Yin Hejun worked in Taiyuan Institute of Technology and Taiyuan University of Technology after graduating from Taiyuan Institute of Technology (now Taiyuan University of Technology). In September 1986, he went to Xi&#39;an University of Electronic Science and Technology to study for a master&#39;s degree, and in 1992 he went to the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences to study for a doctoral degree. After graduation in 1995, Dr. Yin Hejun chose to stay at the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences until November 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his 20 years of working at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yin Hejun served as director of the Bureau of High Technology Research and Development of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was promoted to vice president in January 2008. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2015, Yin Hejun was transferred to the position of Vice Minister of Science and Technology, responsible for high-tech and international cooperation. Sixteen months later, in March 2017, 54-year-old Yin Hejun was appointed as a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and a month later he was concurrently appointed as the deputy mayor of Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, when introducing Yin Hejun to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, leaders of the Beijing Municipal Government mentioned that he was &quot;familiar with scientific research and technology management work, and has a relatively broad mind...mainly engaged in major national science and technology projects and strategic science and technology pilot projects&quot; , national defense science and technology innovation and other aspects of work... have repeatedly filled the gaps in my country&#39;s science and technology and military equipment fields.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office at the local level, Yin Hejun’s work was still related to science and technology, and he was in charge of the Municipal Science and Technology Commission, Economic and Information Technology Commission, State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, Quality Supervision Bureau, Intellectual Property Office, Zhongguancun Management Committee, Economic and Technological Development District Management Committee, contact the Municipal Association for Science and Technology and the Municipal Communications Administration Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2016, before going to work in Beijing, Yin Hejun mentioned in a speech that it is necessary to &quot;center on expanding the space for innovation and development, coordinate both domestic and international situations, and support Beijing and Shanghai in building global influence. Science and Technology Innovation Center”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as the leader of Beijing Municipality, Yin Hejun emphasized the need to make full use of the capital&#39;s scientific and technological innovation resources and coordinate the participation of universities, research institutes, enterprises and other forces in Beijing in the construction of a scientific and technological innovation center when he visited the Municipal Science and Technology Commission. , to promote the formation of greater synergy for collaborative innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Six years later, on May 26, 2023, the &quot;Beijing International Science and Technology Innovation Center Construction Situation Assessment Report&quot; was released. The assessment believes that Beijing has improved its original innovation and science and technology source supply capabilities, made exemplary explorations in establishing a new national system, and &quot;preliminarily built a scientific and technological innovation center with global influence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than a year in Beijing, in October 2018, Yin Hejun was transferred across provinces to serve as deputy secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee. When working in Tianjin, Yin Hejun mentioned &quot;technological innovation&quot; many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2020, Yin Hejun returned to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and served as deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group and vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The director of a state key laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Southern Weekend reporters that Yin Hejun attaches great importance to major national science and technology and military industry work and is in charge of the major task bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The reorganization at the central level has basically been implemented&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Five days after Yin Hejun assumed the new Ministry of Science and Technology, on October 12, 2023, China Organization and Establishment Network Five notices were issued in succession, informing the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the National Health Commission, the People&#39;s Bank of China, and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences of the responsibilities, institutions, and staffing adjustments. Among the five notices, three were related to the Ministry of Science and Technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice shows that the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology for organizing the development of high-tech development and industrialization plans and policies will be assigned to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology for organizing and formulating plans and policies for promoting the development of ecological environment through science and technology will be assigned to the Ecological Environment Ministry of Science and Technology; the Ministry of Science and Technology’s responsibility for organizing and formulating plans and policies for science and technology to promote health and health development will be assigned to the National Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the responsibilities divided into other departments, there are also corresponding staffing levels. Wang Futao, a professor at the School of Public Administration at South China University of Technology, has long been concerned about science and technology policy. In his view, the adjustment of the establishment also means that the Ministry of Science and Technology&#39;s &quot;reorganization at the central level has basically been implemented.&quot; &quot;This is completely consistent with the reform plan at the beginning of the year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 10, 2023, the &quot;State Council Institutional Reform Plan&quot; was released, emphasizing the need to strengthen the optimization and adjustment of institutional responsibilities in six key areas including science and technology. The plan mentions thirteen specific subdivided tasks, among which &quot;reestablishing the Ministry of Science and Technology&quot; is the first of the thirteen tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 16, 2023, the &quot;Plan for the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot; was announced, stating that the Central Science and Technology Commission will be established. The plan emphasized that the responsibilities of the Central Science and Technology Commission&#39;s office will be assumed by the reorganized Ministry of Science and Technology as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also in this reform plan, a time limit is given for the reorganization of the Ministry of Science and Technology: &quot;Reform tasks at the central level strive to be completed by the end of 2023, and reform tasks at the local level strive to be completed by 2024. To be completed before the end of the year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In summary, at the central level, the reform of the Ministry of Science and Technology involves the overlapping of functions between the Ministry of Science and Technology and other departments and the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Sun Yutao, a professor at the School of Economics and Management of Dalian University of Technology, scientific and technological work covers many aspects such as economy, society, ecology, culture, etc., and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Health Commission and other departments also have their own Science and Technology Division, both of which include the application of science and technology in specific fields. Through the reform, this part of the Ministry of Science and Technology&#39;s functions has been returned to specific functional departments, and coupled with the establishment of the Central Science and Technology Commission, &quot;the overall overall planning and coordination has been strengthened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of another scholar who has been paying attention to science and technology policy for a long time, the adjusted functions of the Ministry of Science and Technology have two typical characteristics: “First, these problems can basically rely on market mechanisms to solve the problems, or use It is more efficient to solve it through market mechanisms; secondly, these problems do not affect strategic issues.&quot; He added: &quot;For example, digitalization, of course, is better if it is faster, but if it is slower for a year and a half, it does not involve &#39;fatal matters&#39;. That is the &#39;stuck neck&#39; problem.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Major special projects such as &quot;stuck neck&quot; are still in&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;hands&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Put the timeline To stretch it a little further, in the past ten years, there have been three reforms and reorganizations involving the Ministry of Science and Technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yutao has long been concerned about China’s scientific research funding policies. He explained that in 2014, the reform of the science and technology system was mainly related to scientific research funding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaoxuan, a researcher at the Institute of Science and Technology Policy and Management Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, once wrote an article in Guangming Daily and pointed out that the &quot;Several Opinions on Improving and Strengthening the Management of Central Financial Scientific Research Projects and Funds&quot; directly addresses the oversides and deficiencies in fund management. The problem of coexistence of two places is the major reform measure in 2014. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The core content of this document is reflected in two aspects. First, in view of the duplication, dispersion, inefficiency, weak supervision and other problems existing in the original fund management, an overall reform idea aimed at promoting standardized management is proposed. The second is to follow the rules of scientific research activities, emphasize the preparation of budgets based on actual costs at the operational level, and cancel the requirement that personnel fees be simply set in proportion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Plan on Deepening the Management Reform of Central Fiscal Science and Technology Plans (Special Projects, Funds, etc.)&quot; indicates that China&#39;s science and technology planning system is about to undergo a &quot;major surgery.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly a hundred competitive science and technology plans originally scattered in about 40 departments have been optimized and integrated into the National Natural Science Foundation, National Major Science and Technology Projects, National Key R&amp;D Plans, Technology Innovation Guidance Special Projects (Funds) and Bases and Talents 5 categories including special projects. Government management is limited to the macro level, and project review and management at the micro level are left to professional institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The original national science and technology plan was divided into many scientific research projects. At that time, many people said that these projects were too scattered. All ministries and commissions had money to support the development of science and technology, and &#39;Kowloon water control&#39;.&quot; Sun Yutao explained, &quot; After the reform, these projects were concentrated in the Ministry of Science and Technology, so some people called this reform a &#39;reform to expand power.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reform of scientific research funding, in March 2018, the First Session of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress The first reorganization plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology was disclosed, and it was proposed to integrate the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs and reorganize the Ministry of Science and Technology as a component department of the State Council. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of the aforementioned unnamed experts, compared with the reform promoted by the Central Organization Office, the reform in 2018 is more led by the Ministry of Science and Technology itself. In the opinion of this expert, the reform at that time can be seen as an attempt at this reform: “In the international environment at that time, we still advocated taking the line of open cooperation, but made some adjustments in the way of resource investment. But the effect was not ideal. So this time the reform was upgraded and involved in-depth adjustments to the organizational structure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sun Yutao&#39;s view, the main purpose of the reform is to cope with the current challenges: &quot;Why Are we going to adjust like this now? This shows that the current problems we are encountering need to be solved through reform. In ten years, this problem will no longer exist. It is hard to say whether these functions will be transferred back to the Ministry of Science and Technology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;What the Ministry of Science and Technology will focus on solving after this reform is basic research and &quot;stuck&quot; problems. The aforementioned expert explained: &quot;The &#39;stuck neck&#39; problem includes major special projects. This part of the work is still in the hands of the Ministry of Science and Technology after the reform, and it has been upgraded to be handled by the central government.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yutao also said that from now on From the perspective of scientific research, the importance of basic research is very high: &quot;From basic research, to applied research, to experimental development, the further you go, the more money you have to invest; but the further you go, the more important it is. Without basic research , how can we do the following things?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to basic research, major national science and technology projects come from the &quot;National Medium and Long-term Science and Technology Development Plan (2006-2020)&quot;, including large aircraft , manned spaceflight and lunar exploration projects and other 16 projects. It is worth noting that Yin Hejun has previously participated in major special projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that on September 25, 2008, the Shenzhou 7 manned spacecraft was successfully launched, and Yin Hejun was the deputy commander-in-chief of the Shenzhou 7 mission headquarters; in December 2013, Chang&#39;e 3 The launch was successful. Yin Hejun once accepted media interviews as the deputy commander-in-chief of the lunar exploration project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海滩失踪女童遗体发现：“疏忽父亲入刑论”应慎议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258929]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 19, 2023, Shanghai police reported: On the morning of October 18, Ningbo police received a report from Zhenhai, Ningbo City The body of a girl was found on a tidal flat in the district. Her clothing and other characteristics were similar to those of the missing girl from Nanhui Xincheng Beach in Pudong. A working team was quickly dispatched to the local area. After forensic examination and comparison of the deceased&#39;s biometrics and identification by her family members, it was confirmed that it was the missing girl Huang Moumou. &quot;The body was fully clothed and had no violent injuries. It is consistent with the characteristics of death by drowning and is excluded from criminal cases.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This touching case of missing children on the beach has a clear conclusion. It is sad that a beautiful life died like this. For a family that has suffered the loss of a daughter, this is an unbearable burden and is likely to become a wound that will never heal. The father of the child who was negligent in the whole incident will probably live with guilt and self-condemnation for a long time, and this kind of mental torture will be lifelong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the child disappeared on the beach, there was a lot of criticism of the family and the father on the Internet. For example, they falsely accused the father of being a stepfather, spread rumors that the family favored sons over daughters, and deliberately caused the death of the girl. This kind of malice and lies in the name of &quot;justice&quot; has inflicted greater harm on this family and should be condemned. In addition, there are also voices on the Internet calling for the father of the child to be jailed for &quot;negligent death&quot;, so as to deter irresponsible parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the latter point of view? Nowadays, from the time a child enters kindergarten, there are various safety educations on preventing drowning every year. However, the number of children who drown in China every year is not large in absolute terms. According to statistics from the Chronic Disease Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Global Child Safety Organization, from 2010 to 2015, an average of 54,194 adolescents and children died due to injuries every year (148 people/day), with drowning, road traffic injuries and falls/falls being the top three causes. Bit injury cause of death. The &quot;2022 China Youth Drowning Prevention Big Data Report&quot; released by People&#39;s Daily pointed out that casualties caused by drowning rank first in China in the 0-17 age group, accounting for as high as 33%. &quot;As of the first half of 2022, many news reports have Instead of increasing, drowning accidents among teenagers occur frequently.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these incidents of drowning deaths of minors, some parents were present at the scene but were distracted and negligent, leading to tragedy; some swimming pools did not allow parents to enter but were unable to ensure the safety of their children; and others Older children go to rivers or reservoirs to play or swim without telling their parents and companions, and accidents occur. If the crime of &quot;negligent causing death&quot; is used to punish the first category of parents, I am afraid that there will be many cases, and it will be difficult to produce a significant &quot;deterrence and prevention&quot; effect. On the contrary, there will be many side effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although China has implemented the &quot;comprehensive three-child&quot; policy, the current total fertility rate is very low, and the number of newborns born each year is still declining. Under such circumstances, those who are still willing to have one or two children often really do so because they love their children. Because they have inherited their own genes, parents have a very strong love for their children and a very high willingness to give to their children. It can be said that in this world, the people who love their children the most and care most about their well-being are their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, it would be inhumane and inhumane to punish parents who caused the death of their children due to their own negligence. Children are the continuation of their parents’ lives, and most parents have no subjective intention to harm themselves. children or put their own children in danger. Of course, a very small number of beast fathers and beast mothers should be punished for intentionally harming their children. Secondly, it cannot improve the &quot;duty&quot; of parents. Are parents who carefully raise their children and are willing to do everything for their children? Are you afraid of being punished by criminal law when you create the best of everything? If this is the case, then his most rational consideration must be not to have children, instead of taking care of the children in front of the criminal law every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people take Western countries as an example: parents who leave their children alone at home or elsewhere will be deprived of custody rights. But objectively analyze the two possible situations: the child grows up with the parents and allows the parents to be occasionally neglectful; or the parents occasionally leave the child alone at home and then give the child to another family or a child welfare agency to raise the child. Which one is better? Beneficial to children’s physical and mental health and well-being? Respecting family ties is obviously better for children. Moreover, this approach is a gross interference and trampling on the family, a natural community of blood, and creates many more and bigger problems than the ones it claims to solve. Parents should only be deprived of custody rights when they intentionally harm their children and are clearly detrimental to the child&#39;s physical and mental health and well-being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called guardianship is not an arbitrary power. It is actually full of responsibility and dedication, with love behind it. There will be no financial gain until the child reaches adulthood. Parents should provide their children with all economic resources, including food, clothing, housing and transportation, so that their children can grow up healthily. They should also protect their children&#39;s safety from various natural and man-made risks. Don’t you see, how many parents don’t give up the pursuit of their children because they were kidnapped by traffickers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although tragedy has occurred, we should not require parents to become gods and saints. They should never make mistakes in their actions: parents must absolutely ensure the safety of their children, and any harm to their children must be held accountable. . This is harsh on human nature and is not consistent with reality. In short, respecting family ties, respecting the family, having empathy and understanding for parents, and maintaining the necessary modesty of power over the family are not only more conducive to the growth and well-being of children, but also defend the family as the foundation of civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子遭邻居砸门近一年：数十次报警为何换不来警方追责]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258902]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[洋葱狮子头丨云间夜话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258806]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/2TqgZmHogdWwNZBkP55vBJzgCDuzWX14PMr53ntg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/2TqgZmHogdWwNZBkP55vBJzgCDuzW X14PMr53ntg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254352&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lion head. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone knows what Yangzhou Lion Head is. Of course it is a famous dish and no one is stupid enough to think of a fishy and dirty lion&#39;s head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Cubans really think you are going to take a bite of a lion&#39;s head - when Tao Yan first introduced this dish to the &quot;Guard Captain&quot; in Spanish, the latter&#39;s severe facial twitching showed that he was So understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best Chinese restaurant in Havana is called &quot;Tiantan Hotel&quot;. The owner, Tao Yan, is my friend. He graduated from Shanghai Second Medical University and came to Havana very early. There are not many overseas Chinese in Havana. He has always The idea was to Cubanize his Chinese food. Cubans are very sweet and aromatic, so their Chinese dishes try to be as &quot;sweet and fragrant&quot; as possible, such as pig&#39;s trotters braised with sea cucumber, catfish stewed with tofu, and sweet and sour braised lamb chops, all with a large amount of Cuban sugar. Cubans can’t even figure out why Chinese food ingredients are so well matched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yangzhou lion head is the signature of the &quot;Temple of Heaven&quot;. After the captain of the guard knew that this &quot;lion head&quot; was actually a &quot;pig head&quot;, he came here often relying on his relationship with Tao Yantie. He was a tall man with a height of 1.9 meters. He was impatient with small dishes and specialized in picking big dishes. It’s a piece of meat, so I’m full of praise for the lion’s head in the “Temple of Heaven”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting next to the captain of the guard that day. We also ordered the lion&#39;s head and thought it was &quot;too un-Yangzhou&quot;. It was like &quot;noodles&quot;. The ratio of starch to minced meat was wrong. The meat was too little. The ingredients were not in place. The taste was &quot;wooden&quot;. My wife felt itchy and said, I Come and give it a try! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her cooking method was passed down directly from her neighbor, a woman from Yangzhou. The first thing is the choice of pork. You cannot overemphasize the &quot;essence&quot;, it should be &quot;mixed with essence and oil (fat)&quot;, but it cannot be pork belly, it must be sandwiched. meat, and remove the fascia; minced pork cannot be the product of a meat grinder. It must be cut into small pieces first, then finely diced, and then minced into minced meat, but not too fine, as it will &quot;stick to the knife&quot;. This takes effort. Then add salt (or soy sauce), sugar, monosodium glutamate, minced green onions, diced fried dough sticks, rice wine, and appropriate amount of starch, and stir in one direction, usually clockwise, also called &quot;shangjin&quot;, until it is thick and sticky, waiting for frying. There is another trick here that is ignored by the outside world, that is, &quot;fine diced water chestnuts&quot; must be included in the ingredients. Water chestnuts are called &quot;di pear&quot; in Shanghai and &quot;horse hoof&quot; in the north. You can only buy canned water chestnuts in Cuba. . As for fried dough sticks, they are not available in Cuba, but local fried dough sticks can be substituted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan looked on, his eyes widened and he was dumbfounded, and said, my lion head is just a mixture of minced meat, MSG, flour, onion, ginger, and soy sauce, and then deep-fried, you have to add so much Ingredients? ! My wife said that it is best not to add ginger, but out of habit I would add less ginger, as the flavor would be too strong. The last key is that the outside of each meat ball is not smeared with egg paste until before frying. The egg paste is made as follows: Beat eggs to one ratio of flour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be fried hard, braised in brown sauce and reduced in juice. The lion&#39;s head is delicious when it&#39;s hard on the outside and tender on the inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cubans are straightforward and came to taste the lion’s head the next day. As soon as he tasted it, he stood up and made a phone call. Not long after, a large group of relatives came. There were more than ten of them. They sat neatly like thugs all over the yard. They all looked at the dining table and sat in rows. , eat fruit. This is a Cuban custom. Once there is delicious food, the whole family comes to share it. However, Tao Yan was frightened and explained to the guard captain in Spanish that today was just a trial production and it was impossible to supply a large group of people at once. The guard captain blinked his eyes honestly and refused to leave. My family is here and I want them to go back. Where can I put my face? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was frightened. Please call my wife urgently. &quot;So many big eaters?!&quot; The wife couldn&#39;t help but groan. The lion&#39;s head was slightly smaller than a tennis ball. The captain of the guard could swallow 10 of them by himself. But what! How many &quot;noodles&quot; are there from the past? she asked. The answer is that there are many in the refrigerator. The wife asked to take them all out, defrost them, took a large bottle of mayonnaise, dipped the &quot;gnocchi&quot; in the heavy flavor, turned on the oil pan, and fried it over high heat. The aroma was overflowing, and served it hot to the relatives of the guard captain. Have to howl. The inside of the &quot;gnocchi&quot; is not that good, but the egg skin shell is especially crispy and salty when fried. This is a particularly pleasing thing for my wife. But the guard captain is not stupid. He knew that his wife&#39;s lion&#39;s head was better, and she knew the taste after eating the marrow, so within a few days he actually brought &quot;Whitebeard&quot;, a high-ranking official from Cuba. Of course, I didn’t forget to notify you in advance this time. &quot;Whitebeard&quot; is a close comrade of Castro. He drives a black Audi. As soon as he comes in, he says that he has brought a &quot;mysterious guest&quot; without permission. He heard that the &quot;Chinese Lion Head&quot; is particularly delicious and wants it. Have a taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was dumbfounded when he saw it. She was an old lady with a noble status! He also had a young grandson with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He turned sideways and leaned back as a habit. There was a large group of people in the yard, sitting in rows, eating fruits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is our custom.&quot; The guard captain explained again. He also said that the people who paid this time were all relatives of &quot;White Beard&quot;. When Cubans go to dinner parties, they like to bring their entire family. This time I really learned the lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the behavior of &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady is quite elegant. They gently bite open the lion&#39;s head, the inside is pink, and there is a slight gravy in the steaming heat, but the elegance does not diminish their elegance. Appetite, thumbs up while swallowing, the delicacies in the big basin are rapidly decreasing, and the guard captain&#39;s companionship has accelerated their disappearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was impossible to estimate the number of people who would &quot;sit in rows and eat fruit&quot;, there was a shortage of seats for the lion head, so my wife hurriedly took advantage of the opportunity to make it. Of course, it was too luxurious to chop the meat by hand, so I directly used a meat grinder, but The problem is, a catastrophic accident occurs unexpectedly. China runs out of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chives are a scarce commodity in Havana. The Chinese usually save on using them. Now that they are suddenly out of stock, where should they go to replenish them? Tao Yan suddenly caught a glimpse of the onions in the corner of the room. Isn’t an onion an onion? Although the taste difference is huge, it&#39;s hard to tell. &quot;The question is, what if Cubans happen to be good at this?!&quot; The wife asked Tao Yan coldly. The two looked at each other and understood. The latter immediately jumped into action and pulled out a large bag of onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can imagine, the whole room was filled with the smell of onions fried in a big oil pan, and &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady couldn&#39;t sit still. People in the compound couldn&#39;t sit still. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;White Beard&quot; said, why is it getting more and more fragrant? For the sake of the continuation of this fragrance, I am even willing to launch another cooking &quot;revolution&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people in the compound left their original positions like the mud of a barrier lake, and squeezed into the dining room bit by bit like toothpaste. They shouted in Spanish and pushed each other. No one dared. Head straight to the table. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final outcome is predictable. A famous dish was born in Havana. It is no longer called Yangzhou lion head, but has a more Cuban name: onion lion head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黑龙江省人大常委会原副主任宋希斌一审获刑14年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258838]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/8d32eea8c44f27b9b172302b6fc2430a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/18/8d32eea8c44f27b9b172302b6fc2430a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 17, 2023, the Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court of Liaoning Province publicly pronounced the verdict of the Heilongjiang Provincial People’s Congress Standing Committee in the first instance In the case of former party member and deputy director Song Xibin accepting bribes and embezzling public funds, the defendant Song Xibin was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting bribes and fined RMB 3 million; he was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzling public funds and decided to execute the term He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and fined RMB 3 million; the property obtained from bribery and the interest therefrom shall be recovered in accordance with the law and turned over to the state treasury. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;It was found after trial: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;From 2005 to 2021, the defendant Song Xibin successively used his position as the Daxinganling Prefectural Committee of Heilongjiang Province Deputy Secretary, Administrative Commissioner, Director of the Forestry Administration, Secretary of the Daxinganling Prefectural Committee, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission, Deputy Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee and Mayor, Member and Deputy Director of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial People&#39;s Congress, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, etc. With the convenience in the field, as well as the convenient conditions for the formation of authority and status, it provided assistance to relevant units and individuals in matters such as business operations, land replacement, project contracting, job promotion, etc., and illegally accepted property from others equivalent to more than 35.32 million yuan. In 2014, Song Xibin took advantage of his position as deputy secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee and mayor to seek personal interests and decided to lend 50 million yuan of Harbin&#39;s special fiscal funds to other units in the name of his unit for profit-making activities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court held that defendant Song Xibin’s behavior constituted the crime of accepting bribes and misappropriating public funds. In view of the fact that Song Xibin truthfully confessed his crimes after arriving at the case, and took the initiative to explain most of the criminal facts of bribery and misappropriation of public funds that were not yet known to the supervisory authorities. The crime of misappropriation of public funds constituted surrender; he pleaded guilty and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the bribes and stolen goods have been recovered, and the misappropriated goods have been recovered. All public funds have been recovered before the first instance trial, and there are legal, discretionary or mitigated punishment circumstances. According to the law, he can be given a lighter punishment for the crime of accepting bribes and a reduced punishment for the crime of misappropriating public funds. The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电梯事故频频发生，一图读懂如何自救？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258923]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;8581&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254649&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（上）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258853]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1TImi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1 TImi. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254579&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Between 1872 and 1875, initiated by Rong Hong and supported by Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang , the Qing government sent four batches of 120 students to study in the United States. The average age of these students when they went abroad was only twelve years old. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wedge&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The exchanges between China and the United States, if we start with the opium epidemic in 1840 It has been almost two hundred years since the war began. The young republic of the United States is making its first cry. In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, after receiving the mission of writing this article from Mr. Chen Fangzheng, I thought about it for a long time - I felt that I should write: Because this big topic is not only related to China and the United States, It can almost be said that the fate of the world in the past two hundred years has been inseparable from Sino-US relations in many cases. The turn in Sino-US relations often leads to a turn in world history - of course, China&#39;s destiny also changes accordingly, and similarly the destiny of the United States is also turbulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason I say this is because the basic pattern of Sino-US relations over the past two hundred years is: there is a host-object relationship between the strong and the weak. Because the United States has its own ideals, policies for founding the country, and choices it made to measure its position in the world at that time, if there are changes in its policy toward China, it will mostly be the United States that takes the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when discussing this issue, I often use the above perspective as a constantly changing clue to consider: Why did the United States do this in that specific time and space? In terms of Sino-U.S. relations, given the characteristics of time and space, how will the United States&#39; actions affect its own development direction and the overall international balance? Will the ensuing world situation lead to disaster or peace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I dictated this article &quot;China and the United States since 1840&quot;, I actually had mixed feelings in my heart. The relationship between China and the United States has its share of grievances and grievances, as well as unavoidable entanglements. Looking around the world, the help we receive from the United States is more significant and far-reaching than that of other countries. However, China is even more constrained by the United States and forced to go in many unexpected directions - this is not what China wants, and it also has a great impact on China&#39;s overall history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Trade between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1840, Britain and China fought the first Opium War. In fact, the opium traders operating in Hong Kong at that time were not only British, but also Americans. The United States, a recently established emerging country, has also followed the United Kingdom in participating in international trade—China trade is a piece of meat that it must get involved in. At that time, he was following Charles Elliot in planning how to use force to open China&#39;s trade door, and American businessman Thomas Perkins was also involved. To this day, the Perkins family is still an important part of the New England family in the United States. They did the same, bringing opium in ships and taking away Chinese porcelain, tea and other commercial goods. However, this kind of trade is not permitted by Chinese law, which means that Britain is already conducting trade while forcibly opening the door to China. Although it was Britain that launched the First Opium War, its sponsors also included American businessmen in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China was defeated in this war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing with Britain. In 1844, the United States sent envoy Caleb Cushing to sign the Treaty of Wangxia with Qi Ying, the general representative of China and the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi. Since then, China and the United States established diplomatic relations, and Gu Sheng was the first minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as minister, Gu Sheng said that he was very excited and felt that this was a difficult responsibility. This youngest country, which had just emerged from the civil war and was involved in world politics and international relations for the first time, actually officially established relations with the longest-lived Eastern Empire in the world. He believed this was an important milestone in human history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, and I would like to tell you something that is very meaningful to me. On February 2, 1784, the birthday of George Washington, the &quot;Empress of China&quot; sailed from New York Harbor to China. It was the first merchant ship sent by the United States to China. What they brought was not opium, but thirty tons of wild ginseng collected near Pittsburgh (known as &quot;American ginseng&quot; or &quot;American ginseng&quot; in China), as well as leather, pepper, cotton and other commodities; taken from China, It is porcelain, tea, silk and other commercial goods - these are the typical products sold by China to the United States in Sino-US trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On several occasions, as a staff member of Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Academia Sinica&quot;, I visited Harvard University to negotiate cooperation matters, and I stayed in Harvard hotels. This hotel is an old-fashioned New England residence, with a wooden house, ancient wooden beds, and the rooms are filled with Chinese porcelain shipped by American merchants in the early days. In addition to China&#39;s own porcelain, we can also see trade porcelain specially fired for the United States and Britain, and we can also see Chinese silk fabrics used as decoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a scene made me feel that time and space were reversed: a young Chinese man went to the highest university in the United States to discuss academic cooperation - and in the room where I lived, all the people surrounding me were ancient Chinese objects. . This is something worthy of commemoration and worthy of my lifelong memories and emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, American merchant ships have entered China one after another. Although there were already motorized ships at that time, many of them had a combination of motors and sails. The &quot;Queen of China&quot; is a fairly large mixed-aircraft and sail ship, and the &quot;Chinese Scissor&quot; is even larger and faster. By around 1860, there were three ports for trading ships to depart from North America: San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Vancouver, Canada.它们定期来往，穿梭于两岸之间的太平洋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十九世纪下半段，美国经历了内战。整体发展方向，从开发新土地转变为进入工业化。而且美国的开发，最重要的项目是向西建筑跨州的大铁路，以及在美国西半部开发农田、建设都市。这些工作，数十万中国劳工提供了重要的帮助。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;换而言之，美国之所以成为美国，从一个旧日的英国殖民地，转化为横跨两洋的大国，对于太平洋这边的东亚，这一过程具有重大意义；对于中美关系，也经历了一段很不正常的过程。例如，作出重大贡献的中国劳工，却受困于《排华法案》(Chinese Exclusion Act)，不能如同欧洲劳工一样，移民进入美国。而美国成为横跨两洋的大国，他们的工业产品，很自然比欧洲还要更方便地进入中国市场——此前中国日用品输入美国的贸易方向，却从此转为美国的产品进入中国市场，与欧洲人争夺这个地广人多的旧日帝国的贸易市场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从那时开始，这些往来的航船，带去了无数中国青年赴美接受教育。第一批是容闳带去的一百多名中国幼童，进入美国的中学，然后深造。这些当年的“留美幼童”学成归国后，在外交、商务、教育各个领域工作。中美关系的这一环起步，对中国人的意义无法估量。这些人带来的美国影响，延伸到后来所谓“庚款”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;庚子赔款&lt;/span>;）留美的学生——这其中，有一位非常重要的人物是胡适；当然，还有许多其他人物，包括我的恩师李济之。其中有一半以上的人，对中国现代化作出重大贡献，或者是开创性研究领域的学者，或者是开创不凡事业的奇人，也包括国民政府驻美大使以及在民国外交部主持对外事务的人物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;美国与近现代中国的教育&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;二十世纪初，世界的变化也很大。以机器工业生产商品的资本主义经济，迅速而大规模地吞噬了整个世界。白种人在这一剧变之下，不仅成为世界的主人，而且他们之间也要争夺剥削世界的“龙头”地位。在欧洲，出现了第一次世界大战。在那次大战中，资本主义经济第一次面临试验：国际共产主义的萌芽和茁壮，将世界带入左、右的划分；也在西方现代国家体制中，出现了共产主义制度，以及与之共生的社会公益和社会福利的理想。美国在欧战晚期才进入战争，潘兴（John J.Pershing）将军率领美国参战部队，向英法宣称：我们回来了，我们参加了旧大陆的共同事务。在中国历史上，“西方”二字也从此有左、右两方面的划分；而这个界划，使得中国脱离旧日帝国的挣扎过程，必须有所选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在输入西方理念的过程中，美国传教士在中国设立学校，是一个重要的过程。同时，美国的知识分子，包括旅行者、记者、商人与教育家，他们带到中国的理念，也因此至少有两条路线，作为他们自己的选择，而又使得中国人必须有所选择。同样地，他们从中国带回去的印象，也从此有左、右两种面貌和形象，出自他们主观的选择，也出自他们主观的描述。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国人在中国最早设立的学校，是来华传教士在教堂里开办的附属中学。我们已经很难说，究竟哪所中学开办的时间最早。北京的协和医学院是中国第一家现代医学院，还有湖南的湘雅医学专门学校、四川的华西协合大学、山东的齐鲁大学等，都是美国为多数的传教士所创立。协和医学院采用现代医学教育与全科医院结合的方式，在中国成为模范。他们的影响一直延伸到比较偏僻的省份，比如山西的铭贤学院，也是美国传教士设立的。民国时期，除了上述医科教学外，像燕京、东吴、金陵、之江大学等著名学府，都是美国传教士主持创办的，对近代中国的教育发展做出了贡献。在史学领域，燕京大学的《燕京学报》、中研院的《历史语言研究所集刊》及清华大学的《清华学报》并称“三大学报”。时至今日，海峡两岸的清华还是非常重要的学府，尤其北京的清华是中国大学的“龙头”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我读书的辅仁中学，是在上海的中国基督徒回到家乡无锡建设的。他们认为自己虽然不是传教士，但也以虔诚信徒的服务精神，按照英美中学的教育程度和教学方法来设立学校。这批辅仁中学的教员，对我的训练虽然只有两年半(从高一到高三上学期)，于我一生却具有极大影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从大学教育到中学教育，美国对中国的影响深远。医药与教育方面，都是传教士注目的地方。 1937年，美国医药援华会（American Bureau for Medical Aid to China）成立，这批与中国有关系的人，基本上都是来华传教士。他们回到美国，鼓吹在抗日战争期间要帮助中国，捐助中国医药、设备和医生。在中国被封锁、极端困难的时候，一飞机一飞机的美国援华物资，经由“驼峰航线”进入中国。这里包括刚刚发明的青霉素，正式出厂后的第一批就被运输到中国，对中国的伤兵有极大的帮助。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到今天，我们也应该感激他们。很多传教士留在中国，在此终老；很多传教士以中国为故乡，他们说“我的家乡在中国”；很多传教士在抗战期间保护中国的儿童，保护中国的伤兵，保护中国的逃难者。以南京大屠杀而论，金陵女子大学被划作“保护区”，成千上万中国妇女逃进去得到救助，避免了被日本人蹂躏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此种种，令我们感慨丛生。但是，我们也有纠葛。美国对华贸易之中，几乎永远是美国出超，中国入超。而且非常遗憾的是，早期的鸦片贸易中，美国一样扮演了可耻的角色：论输送到中国的鸦片数量，美国不见得比英国少——英美两国，是最大的鸦片贸易商人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1945年1月，第一支中国运输车队驶过滇缅公路。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;中美之间复杂的恩怨&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;中美之间更大的恩怨，是在战争中间出现。第一次美国介入中国的战争，是在太平天国战争时。当时上海租界里洋人很多，中国逃难过去的人也很多。 1860年，美国人华尔（Frederick T. Ward）领导组建了一支“洋枪队”，这批雇佣兵人数不多，非常精锐。最初是为了保卫上海租界，后来离开租界帮助李鸿章的淮军，以及湘军曾国荃的部队。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;清朝末年，孙中山先生领导的革命，在初期是以美国作为模式——虽然他没有认真地认识美利坚合众国开国以后内部种种的辩论和挣扎，也没有研究美国内战对美国政治制度的影响。后来对“三民主义”的“民权”，只是笼统地交代。可孙中山在广州开府之后，有一段最重要的挣扎，他摆脱了日本浪人“玄洋会”的影响，却又从欧洲新出现的国际共产主义获得支持，也接受了他们部分的理念。更重要者，孙中山为建设新中国而组织的第一支革命军，是以黄埔军校的名义，接受了在俄国的共产国际送来的八千支步枪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙中山的构想中，民生主义的原型是“耕者有其田”。这也是中国历史上的农民革命军，包括前述“太平天国”起义者，共同具有的梦想。而在广州开府以后，与共产国际合作，使国民党内部出现了左、右的对立，也使他的“民生主义”的内涵有了根本的改变：“民生主义就是社会主义。”孙中山理想的改变，也使得中华民国成立的蓝图，在日后国共斗争中，不仅造成理念上的左右对立，也导致重要党员之间的对立。在他去世后，所谓“宁汉分裂”，就是因此而起。而蒋介石领导的右派，从此失去了国民党左翼的支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二次美国介入中国的战争，是在抗战期间。抗战开始，中国在一个月内损失了八百架飞机，整个抗战期间损失了近三千架飞机。日本拥有当时世界上最好的飞机，但中国没有能力制造，只能从外国买来各种型号的飞机，将其组成一支空军战斗部队。所以，中国的领空被日本人随意糟蹋。中国军队作战时，天上下来的炸弹比地上的子弹更令人无可奈何。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国一个空中特技队员陈纳德（Claire L.Chennault），组织不怕死的美国空中健儿，以私人名义成立了一支中国空军美国志愿援华航空队（American Volunteer Group），号称“飞虎队”。他们的队员是卖命的特技飞行员，可以在飞行中的飞机上，从机舱里爬出来，到机翼上行走。他们可以在农田中起飞，可以降落在谷仓的屋顶，可以在空中翻筋斗而不掉下来，甚至可以在飞机上垂下一根绳子，在半空中荡荡秋千。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最开始，他们使用的是美国空军淘汰的飞机。 “珍珠港事件”后美国参战，将这支民间部队整编为第十四航空队，陈纳德任少将司令。自从有了这支航空部队以后，我记得从1942年开始，我们在重庆终于可以安然睡觉。我们的部队与日本作战，在天上也有了飞机掩护。中国在抗战中，损失的飞行员以千计。慢慢地，我们的飞行员也可以驾驶与美国一样的飞机，与“飞虎队”并肩战斗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然这些美国来的健儿也不是白飞：五两黄金出勤一次，打下一架日本飞机奖励十两黄金。每个人回去时，带着几十磅的黄金。要知道，那时候黄金的价值与今天不一样；但这些年轻人中，将生命留在中国大地的，为数也众多。如今估计，1942年到1945年，他们损耗了约四百个人。至于他们是为财而死，还是为义而死，我们可以不计较。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们特别要提及的，是中美间的商业来往。上海与其他通商口岸的租界，都有许多国家的银行，其中最大的是英国和美国的“银行群”，尤其是英国的汇丰银行和美国的花旗银行。汇丰银行现在还是世界上最大的银行之一，美国的花旗银行参与中国财政运作最多。原因在于，中国最早懂得现代财政的财政部长是孔祥熙和宋子文——宋子文就读于哥伦比亚大学，孔祥熙则毕业于耶鲁大学，他们将全美国最重要的银行设施带到中国。所以，中国第一个中央银行是按照美国银行设计、运作，并将花旗银行当做友行，透支的时候有花旗银行做后盾。假如没有这个后盾，蒋介石的中央银行不会有信用；而中央银行是蒋介石统治中国最重要的因素之一——不只是依靠他的军队，而且是凭借一个现代的金融体系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海证券交易所是东方第一个国际性交易所，和华尔街、伦敦以及东京证券交易所，成为四个重要的世界金融交易点。这个运作，将中国现代财政、现代经济运作，全部卷入世界经济网。这一点很少人注意。这期间，美国榨取中国财政的时候多，帮助中国财政的时候少。但以这个制度输入中国而言，可以说全世界没有任何第二个国家，能够整套地将自己的金融系统输入他国，而且将自己最重要的银行作为其后盾。蒋介石在北伐成功以后，如此迅速地建立中国的现代政府、现代工业、民族工业、国防事业，等等，都与美国背后的金融支持分不开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，因为八国联军侵入北京，击败了清军，从中国取得4.5亿两白银赔款——当时中国人口有4.5亿，相当于每人要出一两白银作为赔款。这笔赔款史称“庚子赔款”，俄国与德国所占比例最大，其次是法、英、日、美、意等国。日本将这笔赔款以及先前取得的甲午赔款，用作国内的经营建设，成为后来强占东三省，乃至发动全面侵华战争最大的本钱。美国将这笔赔款部分退还中国，作为后者发展教育的专用款；随后，英、法等国分别退还了部分赔款。清华就是在它的支持下建立的。每一家新的国立大学建立时，都从“庚款”中拨出费用来支持建设——从两江师范学堂改制而来的中央大学，以及各地的国立、省立大学都是如此。一直到最后，台湾清华复校，用的还是“庚款”中很小的一笔余款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1909年美国退回部分“庚款”支持中国的教育，到1964年台湾清华复校，如此长的时间里，“庚款”都对中国教育持续产生作用。但倒过来讲，“庚款”是中国背负的巨大的债务。这一批外国银行团向中国放债——中国没有巨资偿付赔款，只能向世界银行团借钱支付。等到退款时，当初的借款也存在世界银行团，我们只能支取利息，而且要扣除他自己需要用的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后一笔“庚款”付款，是先父伯翔公以海关监督的身份，转任财政部部员时经办。 1942年不平等条约解除后，他专责清理“庚款”余数以及赔偿方式。在艰难困苦的抗战期间，这笔债款西方人没有饶恕我们。先父那时五十岁左右，每次晚上回来，看着那一笔笔账，心里十分难过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1941年12月7日，圣诞节前夕，日本偷袭珍珠港，美国参战。终于，因为盟国成员的身份，中国取消了所有不平等条约。这就等于解除了中国背上数十年的包袱。此后，美国和中国的关系进入一个新阶段。原本民间身份的“飞虎队”变为美国第十四航空队，中国的远征军也从腾冲走出国门，去搭救缅甸的英国军队，这支军队被编入盟国中英美联军的指挥序列。美国还派了一位代表史迪威（Joseph Stilwell）将军，作为中国的战区参谋长——史迪威本想做中国战区总司令，指挥全中国的军队，但蒋介石不同意。此后，美国的军队介入中国的军事，也是恩恩怨怨纠缠不休。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抗战最后两年的作战，美国飞机飞越“驼峰航线”，给中国运来物资，也经由这条航线提供飞机予中国空军使用。在陆地上，还打通了印度经由缅甸通往中国的道路——史迪威公路，一车车的物资进入中国，这些都在史迪威的指挥之下。中国调用这些军队时，需要得到他的许可。中国军队在前线作战、分秒必争的时候，因为他要看作战计划，往往贻误战机——千里以外的战场，战况瞬息万变，如何提供作战计划？这使得中国最后一段作战，仍旧非常艰苦，因为旁边有人掣肘。当然，最后一次常德作战，若不是有美国军机远道运输援军赶到常德，我们挡不住日本人的长驱直入。这是抗战时期美国给予中国的很重大的帮助。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;史迪威公路的中国部分，是在云南群山之中，由各地少数民族的村民用手开凿出来的。两千多部卡车，从缅甸进入中国——其实美国赠送给中国的车大概有四千辆，有一半在史迪威公路上翻车了。这些车都是由马来西亚、菲律宾、新加坡等地的华侨青年，到缅甸投军、作为志愿者开进来的——他们没学过驾驶这种车，两千多人永远留在了山沟里。他们本想回祖国帮助抗战，却连祖国的土地都未曾踏足。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在抗战初期，为了争取美国的援助，国民政府驻美大使胡适在全美各地作了五六十次讲演。蒋介石夫人宋美龄女士也特地在美国国会发表讲演，使美国人对中国的印象，摆脱了中国劳工在美的形象。同时，美国的记者以及作家，尤其赛珍珠（Pearl S.Buck）和《时代》《生活》杂志的发行人路斯（Henry Luce，汉名路思义），不断向美国公众介绍中国在苦难之中的挣扎。另一方面，中国北方在日本的战线向西推进时，八路军派往敌后的干部掌握了农村。在那些地区的美国传教士以及访华人员，后来又包括美国大使馆、领事馆的职员谢伟思（John S.Service）等人，将北方的消息传送到美国。其中，斯诺（Edgar Snow）的新闻报道，具有无可估量的影响力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种舆论的分歧，再加上史迪威和蒋介石之间的对抗，使得中美之间在第二次世界大战最后一段的关系与配合，发生重要的冲突。二战以后，美国紧接着出现了“麦卡锡主义”，造成美国内部左右之间的严重分裂。那一裂痕，又导致了所谓“谁丢失了中国”的辩论。更进一步，美国以同样的心态，回头看二战后的欧洲。苏联的崛起与中国的国共内战，导致二战后近二十年，美国对自己领导的世界及与此相关的外交政策，都趋向对共产主义国家的抵制和围堵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抗战结束后，国共内战开始，美国莫名其妙地纠缠其中。美国派遣外交官谢伟思等人组成的“迪克西使团”(Dixie Mission)参观延安，他们回来说：延安是未来的希望，重庆是黑暗的地方；重庆是要没落的，延安要起来；帮延安，不要帮重庆。这其间的恩恩怨怨，我们很难说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（深圳行政学院副教授陈新华整理）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;22岁的程海燕是家中长女，她还有一个患白血病的弟弟。她刚通过专升本考试，在海口读大一。自从母亲投水自尽后，哀伤的父亲陷入消沉，加之弟弟病弱，作为家里唯一上过大学的人，她需要短时间内撑起这个摇摇欲坠的家。她觉得自己身上的担子太重，更多时候是硬扛。 “很累，但是没办法。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对文昌那个简陋到不行的家，程海燕是有心远离的，不仅因为出租屋物质条件差，更因为她早早地认清了家族和家庭里重男轻女的旧思维。所以除了在校学习，她会利用课余和假期在海口打工，“服务员、洗碗工、洗菜的、前台收银、宴席服务员、发传单、赛事保障、做防疫的民兵，能做的都做”。 2023年6月10日开始，到7月23日义永红自杀那天，程海燕都在海口一家超市当收银员，一个月赚2600元，不包吃住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕帮家里干活时，也是一把好手。她给番石榴套袋加包装，一天起码能完成2000个，换算成给别人家打工，相当于挣了200元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但命运却给程海燕开了一个残酷的玩笑。她想离家里远一点，但不得不成为没了妈妈的家庭主心骨，成为弟弟可以依靠的姐姐，成为给出决断、拿主意的女儿，还要以晚辈身份应酬亲戚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我能清晰地感受到，尽管她知道母亲任劳任怨，抚育她长大，可程海燕并不想成为义永红那样的女性。也许，程海燕不一定清楚她想要成为什么样的人，但她确实在努力不要重蹈母亲的人生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红也支持女儿这样做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在义永红自杀前几天，程海燕返回文昌陪伴母亲。当她在水房洗澡时，村里一个“男疯子”把头从门槛下伸进去偷窥，嘴里嘟囔着“好漂亮”。程海燕惊恐之下用衣服打他，然后报警，可对方拿出了精神分裂症的证明，程海燕愤怒又无奈。警察让她不要放在心里，可程海燕无法做到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;女儿被偷窥后，义永红催她赶紧回海口。程海燕至今感到遗憾的是，那次回去没有如愿将母亲带回海口，离开那个环境。如果离开了，或许她就不会自杀了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;整个采访过程中，程海燕讲述了两个对她来说极为残忍的场景。其一就是义永红在水库自杀后的情景。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月23日那天，程海燕赶到家时，发现门锁着，母亲不在家，看到床上放着母亲的手机和钱包，程海燕顿时慌了，因为母亲从来不会不随身携带钱包。她与父亲程善志分头找，边找边给大姨、大舅打电话，最后她循着父亲的哭声赶过去，“看到我爸爸一直在哭，衣服都是湿透的。我爸已经在那里哭得不行了。我妈妈人都硬了，像睡着一样，嘴巴张开的”。当时的程海燕“感觉很晒，头很晕，眩晕，看不到东西”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;整个采访中，我认为最沉痛的是程海燕用平静的语调，回忆第二个冰冷场景——为了发现新的证据，也怕妈妈冷冻太久，希望早点入土为安，她和弟弟决定给妈妈尸检。程海燕扶着痛哭的父亲站在一旁，目睹法医解剖、殡仪馆人员缝合母亲的全程，她要看母亲身上有没有伤痕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕提到一个细节，解剖前，一只蟑螂从义永红的裤脚那儿爬出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕哭着抠自己的手指甲，她说她不知道该怎么办，很害怕，因为解剖的是自己的家人。她学的是护理专业，所以能大致描述法医的工作流程，包括解剖刀在义永红遗体上行进的路线，以及解剖刀之下她妈妈的一点点“变形”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“人走了，还挨一刀，感觉很对不起她。”同时，程海燕也异常愤怒，“我感觉恨到骨子里了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报道刊发前，程海燕愿意实名。我相信，经历并处理过如此重大的人生跌宕，程海燕一定会比她自认为的更坚强。她能和七八个退伍军人朋友一道去到派出所，被偷窥后决意报警，她勇敢地追问警方，正面硬刚加害者，尤其是目睹母亲的解剖画面，程海燕一定不再是从前那个小女孩了，她将成为另一个不同的人。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;对比前一年的数据：截至2021年底，全国60周岁及以上老年人口26736万人，占总人口的18.9%，其中65周岁及以上老年人口20056万人，占总人口的14.2%。一年之内，60周岁及以上和65周岁及以上的老年人，分别增加了0.9与0.7个百分点，前者净增加1268万人，后者净增加922万人。中国社会的老龄化程度进一步加重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国老龄化加剧的原因有二，一是预期寿命的增长；二是新生儿出生人数的减少。 2016年是全面二孩政策落地的第一年，新生儿1786万，有可能是最后一个阶段性历史高点。次年即降至1723万，以后每年都向下突破一两个百万大关，至2022年降至956万，与2016年相比下降了46.5%，短短六年几乎腰斩。由此，老年人怎么样养老的问题就越发突出了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2005年，上海率先提出了“9073”养老服务格局的目标，即老年人90%居家养老，7%社区养老，3%的机构养老。 2021年4月，国家卫健委老龄健康司司长王海东表示，我国老年人大多数都在居家和社区养老，形成“9073”的格局，即90%左右的老年人都在居家养老，7%左右的老年人依托社区支持养老，3%的老年人入住机构养老。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，2023年北京市委社会工委市民政局通过调查发现，北京99%以上的老人选择居家养老，只有不到1%的老人选择机构养老。可见，无论从地方与全国层面的养老战略来看，还是从实际情况来看，老年人压倒性的养老模式仍是居家养老。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样看来，养儿防老并没有如一些人所想象的那样成为历史。从另一角度看，养育孩子也可以视作一种投资：不仅孩子长大后会工作，会给年老的父母转移支付，提供一部分养老资金；而且父母有大病需要就医与照料，亲儿亲女的作用是不可替代的：子女出钱出力、亲力亲为只是一方面，帮失能甚至失智的父母主张与捍卫权利也是重要的方面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哪怕出钱请人照料，有身体与智能健全的亲儿亲女随时监督，老人才有更高概率得到较好的照顾。当失能老人躺在家中床上不能动弹，请来的保姆有动机不尽力干活，如果没有亲儿亲女，失能老人主张与维护自己的权益都很难。儒家讲“慎独”，那是一种很高的道德修养，很难要求从市场上请来的保姆或护工有这么高的道德自觉与职业伦理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，子女也可能忤逆不孝，但子女与父母间有割舍不断的血缘与亲情。从人性的角度上，如果对子女照看、孝养自己都没有信心，那如何会对与你根本没有血缘关系也没有感情可言的外人产生这么大的信心？这是一个逻辑问题，也是一个人性问题。而且，如果对教育出一个有正常价值观、尊重敬爱父母的子女都没有信心，又如何对自己提前几十年设计的养老安排产生这么大的信心？这也是一个逻辑问题。既然谈风险，就要精算不同风险的大小。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外，许多人在城市工作与生活，缴纳社保，会产生一种“自己给自己养老，不需要子女养老”的错觉。其实，这种现收现支的社保模式，本质上是年轻人、工作者与下一代向老年人、退休者与上一代的代际转移支付，或者说“所有子女养所有父母”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即便看单个家庭，养老也不仅仅是一个养老金有无多少的问题。哪怕钱再多，无论是在家请人照顾，还是去住豪华养老院，也要确保在自己失能甚至失智的时候能把这钱花出去、花到自己身上、让自己得到很好的照看，这时候，有身体与智能健全的亲儿亲女在一旁，帮你主张与捍卫权利，他们的作用是不可替代的。如果没有子女，有天性纯良的年轻近亲属如侄子侄女、外甥外甥女代行子女的功能，或者有感情深厚的好友来帮衬，那自然也是可以的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自己投资金融资产、存钱养老看起来是不错的选择，但仍有同样的问题绕不过去。在能走能动的时候，住在养老院里，因为你能主张与捍卫自己的权利，所以能得到不错的照看；但当你失能甚至失智时，或者神智清醒但躺在床上动弹不得，或者神智也不清醒了，因而无法主张与捍卫自己的权利，你能不能得到必要的医疗与照看服务，那就要看养老院经营者与护工的良心了。当然，政府机构会有监管，但在力度与细致度上，恐怕代替不了亲儿亲女或天性纯良近亲属或好友的“监管”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上述意义上，我们不难理解居家养老、家庭养老为何仍是养老的主要模式，这背后仍是“养儿防老”的观念与实践在支撑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[儿科爆满，耐药棘手，肺炎支原体流行何时休？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258887]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年10月16日下午，上海交通大学医学院附属新华医院一楼急诊诊室外，家长带着孩子候诊。南方周末记者黄思卓/摄&quot;
