Many netizens lamented that this summer was the process of &quot;questioning my mother, understanding my mother, and becoming a mother&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How popular were the two &quot;Moms&#39; Selections&quot;? Why are today&#39;s young people attracted to them just like their mothers? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;How popular were the idols of &quot;Mom&#39;s Choice&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before this summer, many young people In the eyes, both Fei Xiang and Cai Guoqing are &quot;passed&quot; stars - at least among young people. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, when many mothers were young, the popularity of Fei Xiang and Cai Guoqing could rival those of today&#39;s top celebrities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fei Xiang was born in Taiwan, China, in 1960. In 1978, Fei Xiang graduated from Taipei Shilin American School and was admitted to Stanford University in the United States to study medicine with honors. A year later, he transferred to the drama department of Stanford University. In 1981, Fei Xiang returned to Taiwan and entered the entertainment industry by starring in the Taiwan TV drama &quot;Eleven Women&quot; directed by Sylvia Chang. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1982, Fei Xiang joined EMI Records (EMI Records) and launched his first solo album &quot;Lian Lian&quot; in Taiwan, which began to become popular. Fei Xiang was selected as one of the top ten Asian singers in Singapore. Together with Taiwanese singers Liu Wenzheng, Fei Yuqing, Feng Feifei and Jiang Ling, they were selected and ranked in the top five. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1986, Fei Xiang accompanied his mother back to Beijing to visit his grandmother. This opportunity aroused Fei Xiang’s deep feelings for his family and country. He moved to mainland China to develop and published books in the mainland. With his first solo album &quot;Songs Across the Four Seas&quot;, he became the first Taiwanese artist to cross the Taiwan Strait and enter the mainland music scene. The tape release exceeded one million mark in one fell swoop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1987, Fei Xiang became the first Taiwanese singer to return to the motherland and sang the songs &quot;Clouds in Hometown&quot; and &quot;A Day in Winter&quot; at CCTV&#39;s Spring Festival Gala. &quot;Fire&quot;, Fei Xiang&#39;s popularity in mainland China reached its peak overnight. Its foreign, open, free and unrestrained image, music style&lt;/span>;and performance style are refreshing and make thousands of girls crazy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Xiang has released multiple albums in mainland China, each of which has become a hit. In 1989, Fei Xiang held a total of 65 concerts in 12 cities in mainland China. CCTV and Central News Film Studio also specially made videos and films for broadcast nationwide. In 1990, Fei Xiang went to New York to develop on Broadway and successfully transformed into a Broadway actor with solid singing skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that Fei Xiang&#39;s status in the country in the 1980s was considered to be the top among the top. To the audience at that time, Fei Xiang &lt;span>; was not just a star, he also carried a lot of responsibility. It captures people&#39;s imagination of beauty, future and hope, like a fire in winter, lighting up many people&#39;s lives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1968, Cai Guoqing was born, and he became famous at a young age. He joined the Central People&#39;s Broadcasting Station Children&#39;s Chorus at the age of 7 and published his first album at the age of 9. In 1986, Cai Guoqing participated in the first National Hundred Singers Concert and began his singing career. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1990, Beijing held the Fourth National Young Singer Grand Prix. Cai Guoqing won the silver medal in the popular singing group with his song &quot;Beijing&#39;s Bridge&quot;. At the Beijing Asian Games of the same year, which was the first comprehensive international sports competition held in my country, Cai Guoqing sang &quot;Tonight&lt;/span>;The Stars Are Bright&quot; at the closing ceremony, further becoming well-known to audiences across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1991, Cai Guoqing appeared on the stage of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala for the first time, singing &quot;Going to the Distance&quot;. From 1991 to 1995, Cai Guoqing participated as a main actor for five consecutive years. Cai Guoqing is a frequent guest at the Spring Festival Gala. He has appeared on the Spring Festival Gala stage 23 times so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the new century, Cai Guoqing is still active in the music scene, participating in various important theatrical performances, and participating in some variety shows as a judge from time to time. Cai Guoqing&#39;s elegant and solemn image is still a favorite of his mother, but it also makes some young people feel a bit distant, so he is not very popular among the younger generation. Many people know &lt;span>; him and don&#39;t particularly like him. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/d8c7f22596c2ea307d89512e69702a61.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/d8c7f22596c2ea307d89512e69702a61.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253564 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;&quot;Understand Mom, Become a Mom&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The two &quot;Moms&#39; Choice&quot; were once very popular, but in the era of the Internet and the fan economy, they The influence is more limited to the mother’s generation. This situation has changed this summer. Why are young people attracted to &quot;Mom Strictly Selected&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First of all, let’s look at it from the perspective of a star. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;During the domestic entertainment industry,&lt;/span>;many young top-notch celebrities, such as sky-high salaries, poor acting skills, lack of professionalism, and poor personal ethics, have been repeatedly exposed. The emergence of &quot;Selection&quot; has made young people discover that the older generation of artists are so self-disciplined, dedicated and professional. These are the role models for stars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Yin Shou, played by Fei Xiang, had not stood up, there would not have been the success of &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;. The audience also saw Fei Xiang&#39;s figure in the movie. It simply didn&#39;t look like the body of a middle-aged and elderly man in his sixties. The muscle lines were so clear that there was no trace of fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To maintain a healthy and good figure, &lt;span>; self-discipline is indispensable. As soon as Fei Xiang joined the set, he strictly controlled his diet and carried out devilish training such as equestrian, martial arts, and fitness. The filming lasted for a year and a half, and his training also lasted for a year and a half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Xiang has strong business ability and is very dedicated. As early as 2012, &quot;Painted Skin II&quot;, which he collaborated with Wu Ershan, was released. He participated in many promotions of &quot;Painted Skin II&quot; and was responsible for the promotion of the film in Taiwan alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time the road show of &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot; &lt;span>; took place in 29 cities, 33 days, and 170 shows. Fei Xiang participated in the road shows in 29 cities, and participated in a total of 164 road shows. It was so intense. Big, he still works personally and fights on the front line. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the Venice Film Festival, he initially went alone on behalf of the entire crew. Fei Xiang even participated in the English subtitles of &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot; that was released locally all night long. Translator, I have to attend an event the next day... How many big and small celebrities in domestic entertainment can be dedicated to such a degree? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This time Cai Guoqing participated&lt;/span>; in &quot;Beyond the Troubles 3&quot;. Many people thought that he would sleep on his laurels, but Cai Guoqing had no airs or baggage at all. . On the first stage, he challenged Jay Chou&#39;s &quot;Mojito&quot;, allowing the audience to hear the lyrics of the song so clearly for the first time. However, Cai Guoqing&#39;s singing is also different from Jay Chou&#39;s flavor, and his business ability is still online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, whether he was practicing singing or dancing, Cai Guoqing maintained a positive and energetic state of mind. He worked hard, was humble and sober: &quot;After a breakthrough, it is heaven for me to produce high-quality works.&quot; It&#39;s a great thing; it&#39;s a great encouragement to be recognized by today&#39;s audience.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Young people pursue &quot;Mom&#39;s Strict Choice&quot;, and another one is that the younger generation looks at the elders perspective. For example, the reason why young people affectionately call Fei Xiang &quot;Fei Xiang daddy&quot; is not only because he plays a father in &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;, but also because he is the ideal father figure and ideal elder in the hearts of many young people. image. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In real life, many elders are often keen on preaching to young people as elders and dictating their lifestyles. From Fei Xiang&#39;s series of interviews, we can see that he respects everyone&#39;s lifestyle and has profound insights into marriage, love and other key life issues. He is non-interfering, non-preaching, wise and graceful. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are also some elders who are keen to rely on their elders as elders. I have the final say in everything, young people must listen to me, and young people must respect me. , You have to praise me...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Beyond the Troubles 3&quot;, many young people saw a so real and personal Cai Guoqing for the first time: he has no airs at all and is very He is free-spirited and able to mingle with young people. He is willing to &quot;listen to&quot; others&#39; suggestions and is extremely easy-going and friendly... Who wouldn&#39;t love to have sex with such an &quot;elder&quot;? Young people will not have the pressure, embarrassment and suffering of those in lower positions. They still have respect for their elders in their hearts, and they can still be themselves freely and easily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, the reason behind young people&#39;s pursuit of &quot;Mom&#39;s Choice&quot; is their dissatisfaction with the current internal entertainment ecology, and the fact that young people have been suffering from the pressure of their elders for a long time but are unable to do so. The helplessness of breaking free or daring to be angry but not speaking out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;While we hope that there will be more “Mom’s Careful Choices”, young people might as well follow “Mother’s Carefully Selected” as an example and grow into a better person. people can eventually become better elders. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从张亮和杨国福说起：特色县的产业聚集为何常常以乡情亲缘为纽带？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258299]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It was rumored on the Internet that the two hotpot giants Zhang Liang and Yang Guofu were relatives: Zhang Liang was originally working in his uncle Yang Guofu’s shop He worked part-time there, and later went out to work alone and founded Zhang Liang Malatang. Later, Zhang Liang said: &quot;There is no blood relationship, it is kinship.&quot; Yang Guofu also made the same statement as Zhang Liang. Therefore, one thing is probably certain, that is, Zhang Liang was indeed inspired by Yang Guofu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Liang and Yang Guofu also inspired the locals. Their hometown of Bin County in Harbin has developed into a gathering place for the spicy hotpot industry. In addition to Zhang Liang and Yang Guofu, there are many other brands that are worth mentioning. Known as the &quot;Capital of Malatang&quot;. In the words of the person in charge of production of Yang Guofu Company: &quot;If a village works, everyone will follow, and the industry will rise.&quot; It is not difficult to imagine that countless ambitious young people in Bin County have followed their footsteps and entered Mala. Start a business in the ironing industry to change your destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is not a special case. Many people will remember that when they were in high school, the print shops around the school were owned by Hunanese; in universities thousands of miles away, the copy shops in and around the school were still owned by Hunanese; when studying for graduate school, change places and print. The store is still owned by Hunanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These Hunanese are all from Xinhua County, Loudi City, a famous photocopying town. Xinhua County is located in the central part of Hunan Province, with mountains crisscrossing the territory and a harsh environment. The per capita cultivated land is less than 0.15 acres. The harsh natural environment forced Xinhua people to go out. As early as 1960, before the reform and opening up, Xinhua people Yi Daixing and Yi Daiyu brothers accidentally learned the mechanical typewriter repair technology in Fuling, Sichuan, and this became the Xinhua people&#39;s copier industry. The origin of. Xinhua people spread second-hand copying equipment from Japan and the United States to China through international trade, provide support for maintenance and consumables, and sell it to copy shops through professional markets, forming a complete industrial chain of &quot;international trade + professional markets + professional stores&quot; . With this industry chain, wherever there are new people, the price of copying will drop rapidly, driving people from other regions out of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many such phenomena, such as Tonglu Express, Chengdu Snacks, Shaxian Snacks, Fujian Putian Medical, Caoxian Hanfu, Guanyun Underwear, etc. To a certain extent, this is a unique phenomenon formed by the grafting of industrial agglomeration and Chinese-style interpersonal relationships: industrial affinity and geographical agglomeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The formation paths of these industrial clusters are similar. Initially, a local person becomes successful in a certain industry, expands his career, and attracts more relatives and friends to join; in the industry chain, he also follows the connections of acquaintances. Find a supplier or distributor. Later, relatives and friends may start their own business, or others may see it and imitate it, and more people may join. Finally, an industrial cluster was formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many reasons for this phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a theory of six degrees of separation in sociology, that is, any two people in the world can be connected through six people who know each other. Simply put, you know the President of the United States through six people. This may seem impossible, but in fact it is not difficult to put it bluntly. For example, one of the paths: anyone can easily get to know a college student, and connect to the principal through the college student&#39;s teacher. The university president is already a very high-level relationship, and through two or three more people, it can reach a higher level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the basis of six degrees of separation, some scholars have proposed the three-degree separation theory, that is to say, there are strong connections within three degrees of separation, and strong connections can trigger human behavior. A connection that is more than three degrees apart is a weak connection, and weak connections can only transmit information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to understand that strong connections can trigger action. Strong connections first broaden people&#39;s horizons and provide choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an up owner called &quot;African Fei Ge&quot; at Station B. He shoots videos about African customs and customs, and has caught up with the trend of short videos. His education level is not high, but because he has a father who has been working in Africa for more than ten years, he went to Africa to work. He is smart and hard-working. He first worked part-time, then went into business, and then discovered short videos. Obviously, without his father, it would be basically impossible for him to come into contact with the choice of &quot;going to Africa&quot; ​​in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strong connections can also stimulate &quot;people around you&quot; to pursue success. Even if you only make a small fortune, people around you will be very sensitive and will feel envious. On the other hand, the people around you may be your childhood friends, classmates, relatives, or friends of friends. They understand each other better and will not be deified. They will make people feel that they are objects that can be imitated and successes that can be achieved, which in turn stimulates people. Pursue this success yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This strong connection transfers resources. Once, I went to Nantong to attend an event and visited the Home Textile City. I met a young boss who was born in 1997. He was 24 years old at the time. He drove a BMW 5 Series and ran a large home textile store. After the activity, everyone had dinner together. The boss said that he had been working since he was 16 years old. I asked him when he switched from working part-time to starting his own business. The reason why I ask this question is: I started out to work at the age of 16. I don’t have a high degree of education. It must be because my family’s financial conditions are not good, so I started working early, accumulated the first pot of gold, gained industry experience, and then started my own business. Be successful. But he said: I have never worked part-time, and I started an independent business as soon as I came out. My parents, my brother, and my sister are all in this business. They took me and opened their own shop. This is a typical example of strong connections providing choices and resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business itself also pursues this kind of strong connection. Industrial agglomeration in economics refers to the highly dense gathering of several different types of enterprises that produce certain products within a reasonably large area, as well as the upstream and downstream enterprises and related service industries that support these enterprises. Companies in the same industry gather together to search for raw material products, the cost of obtaining supporting products and services, and the cost of transportation and communication all become smaller due to the closer geographical distance, resulting in greater competitiveness. industry agglomeration. In essence, cost reduction is the most basic driving force for industrial agglomeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to establish trust between strangers. The biggest costs for enterprises in the business process are communication costs and trust costs. Then, similarly, from the perspective of cost reduction, companies in the industry chain will gather along interpersonal relationships. This is also the reason why family businesses have flourished in various countries for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, from another perspective, this is what people call a circle. Of course, it’s up to you to benefit from the circle. Some people can’t do it even if their parents give it to them. Some people just hear about it and take action immediately, follow, learn, imitate, and finally achieve success. So, in the final analysis, the biggest factor is the people themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[百年广三铁路上的佛山火车站停运升级，市民游客前来打卡“最后的绿皮车”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258405]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财政部：停止销售“六六顺”等41款即开型福利彩票游戏]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The Ministry of Finance regarding the suspension of sales of &quot;Liu Liu Shun&quot; Waiting for approval opinions on 41 instant welfare lottery games&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Caizong [2023] No. 36&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;China Welfare Lottery Issuance and Management Center:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your Center&#39;s &quot;Request for Instructions on Stopping the Sales of 41 Instant Welfare Lottery Games including &quot;Liu Liu Shun&quot;&quot; (Zhongcai Fa Zi [2023] 111 No.) received.

Neither of us knew when we went there that Joshua Tree’s reputation came from a hallucination caused by an overdose of marijuana. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Joshua Tree is located deep in the desert in the outer suburbs of Los Angeles, so it can be said that this illusion is a type of mirage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ex-boyfriend is from South Korea, a devout Christian, and a scientist by profession. His favorite movie is Nolan&#39;s &quot;Interstellar&quot;, and his fascination with the stars can be said to be a combination of science and faith. On the one hand, he has an endless thirst for knowledge about space and areas unknown to mankind. On the other hand, if we borrow Mr. Qian Mu’s metaphor and regard the known human beings as these little bits of starlight, and the vast and endless darkness as the unknown realm, then the ex-boyfriend’s response to this is: There must be a creator who created All of this, and we humans must spend our entire lives searching for the goodness of everything He created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I love reading theology books, I do not believe in any religion. At that time, the starry sky was more of a natural wonder to me. It&#39;s a pity that the two of us put on down jackets and raised our heads like nestlings begging for food in the cold desert night. The starry sky that caught our eyes was not as charming as the one I had seen on the Iowa farm. Sitting on the tractor in the Iowa farm, I was really shocked by the Milky Way above my head: the stars were like the stone bridges on the streams in the Yunnan-Guizhou region, intermittently extending from one bank of the river to the other bank. I tried to Trace each star point with your eyes, imagining that the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are like this, carefully stepping on the stars to meet in the middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ex-boyfriend went stargazing for the first time, and the blurry starry sky over Joshua Tree captured his heart. He also became more convinced that it was the hand of God that created all of this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;——Perhaps, the different attitudes towards Xingguang have already hinted that this relationship is destined to end in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think of this past incident, it may be because I have been wandering around for these years. Some time ago, a teacher at Washington University in St. Louis asked me to write a letter of recommendation for her. Her resume was full of ups and downs in her academic career. She had held teaching positions in New York State, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Missouri. Now, After ten years of teaching in St. Louis, she finally had a chance to settle down. As a doctoral candidate, I also know that if I am looking for a teaching position, I am destined to face this kind of great migration experience every few years. To be honest, I&#39;m tired of this. The biggest difficulty with living a nomadic life is this: you never make lasting connections. It&#39;s not easy to make one or two close friends, or a lover who you thought would be a lifelong companion, but because of your own or the other person&#39;s migration, the relationship broke up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Separation, to me, is like letting go of two people and falling into the vast abyss of the universe at the same time without a trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no accident that many poems at home and abroad use starlight to compare separation. I have reached the age where my eyes well up with tears when I read Du Fu&#39;s &quot;If we don&#39;t meet each other in life, we will move like participating in business&quot;. When I was in middle school, the first time I read Xu Zhimo&#39;s &quot;Accidental&quot; I just thought it was romantic. I even thought it was a high-sounding excuse for a playboy because of various ancient moral prejudices. However, now, once again imagining &quot;you and me&quot; who &quot;disappeared in an instant&quot;, all we can remember in the end is &quot;the light that shined on each other when we met&quot;, and I feel more helpless. Because the lost relationship and friendship can no longer be traced in the dark night, the only thing that can be remembered is the memory as bright as the starlight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern psychology classifies &quot;death of relatives and friends&quot;, &quot;broken love&quot;, &quot;unemployment&quot; and &quot;loss of money&quot; as &quot;loss&quot;. Loss is difficult to digest, because no matter how much we mourn, how much we regret, how much we grieve, we cannot get rid of the reality that it is hard to recover. I have not been close to people since I was a child, so once I lose someone close to me, it is difficult to recover. Even today, seventeen years after my grandfather passed away, I still miss him and walk with him on familiar streets in my dreams. Even though I am clearly aware that I am in a dream, I still hope that this dream can last longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with losses, many people will eventually fall into the mentality of gamblers, constantly increasing their bets in order to win back everything they have lost before, so that they fall deeper and deeper into the trap. I have met friends who have always been in good schools. Because of a failure in an exam or failure in applying to a prestigious school, they kept applying year after year, so that all the meaning of life lies in whether they can get back this one. After falling out of love, many people will rush into the next relationship, eager to turn the previous failure experience into the next success. Unfortunately, this kind of eagerness for success will probably only suffer greater trauma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year, I also sat alone in the mire-like darkness, and almost fell into the never-ending gambler&#39;s mentality. Finally, the famous words of the ancient Roman Neo-Stoic philosopher Epictetus woke me up: &quot;Don&#39;t think of loss as loss, think of it as return.&quot; In other words, those dazzling moments when the stars meet are never It does not belong to me, but it is temporarily loaned to me by the universe. One day, I must return this gift. All I can do is try to cherish it while borrowing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is opening this generous &quot;library&quot; behind the world? I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have the answer. All I know is that those who believe in gods are blessed, and they can draw more strength from their faith to survive the dark night. Let&#39;s take the loss as an example. A devout believer will shed his attachment to himself. Without attachment, there is no need to go bankrupt just to save face. Without attachment, he will feel that when he walks in the world, all encounters and companionship are worthy of gratitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the British poet WH Auden&#39;s famous work &quot;More Love&quot; (translated by Huang Canran), Auden regards the burning of stars as &quot;the unrequited passion of mankind&quot;, because of this love Only with the admiration and gratitude of the stars can he say: &quot;If all the stars fall or disappear, / I will learn to look at an empty sky / and feel the solemnity of its complete darkness, / although it may take me a while .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浙江国祥 IPO申购前夕暂停，谁欲分享资本盛宴？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258403]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/EzqH3Y4F6QmiFFWlwVxyIw3QnpuhD4Fv75Ob7Szf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;845&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/EzqH3Y4F6QmiFFWlwVxyIw3Q npuhD4Fv75Ob7Szf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253745&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Retailers play cards on the exchange. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang, which plans to start subscribing in the secondary market on October 9, 2023, due to Public opinion surged, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange actually stopped the IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, the first day of resumption of work after the holiday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a response to reporters&#39; questions, saying that in the spirit of being responsible for the market and investors, it would respond to the situation reported by the self-media and treat Zhejiang Guoxiang Conduct a special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang was established in 2009 and is headquartered in Shaoxing City. It is mainly engaged in the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning special equipment. It has served Luxshare Precision, BYD, and Ningde Well-known customers and projects in various industries such as Times, Hangzhou Metro Group, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, and Beijing Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, Zhejiang Guoxiang was listed on the New Third Board, and submitted prospectus materials to the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Science and Technology Innovation Board twice at the end of 2016 and in 2020, but the IPO failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Zhejiang Guoxiang once again impacted the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It took 159 days to obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for its IPO registration, which was just one step away from success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, Zhejiang Guoxiang announced an issue price of 68.07 yuan per share, with an issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times. The plan was to open subscriptions on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, after a short holiday, the clamor that its issue price was too high has become louder and louder. In addition, there have been doubts about Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s secondary listing of the same asset in the past, and the controversy has intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again issued a response to the suspension of IPO issuance by Zhejiang Guoxiang, introducing the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s preliminary review and supervision of the company, and stated that in response to the market and the majority of investors, Concerned, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will seriously organize a special inspection of Zhejiang Guoxiang and will decide on follow-up work based on the results of the special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did Zhejiang Guoxiang cause public outrage? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Second listing of the same asset? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets come indirectly from Zhejiang Guoxiang Refrigeration Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Refrigeration), which is the first Taiwan-funded enterprise listed on the A-share market. , which is quite symbolic in the mainland capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taihai.com reported in 2008 that the parent company of Guoxiang Refrigeration was Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, which was established in Taoyuan, Taiwan in 1966. It was the largest manufacturer of industrial refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in Taiwan at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above report stated that in 1995, Chen Hegui, chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, went to Zhejiang to invest and established Guoxiang Refrigeration as a joint venture with Zhejiang Shaoxing Refrigeration Equipment Factory. After that, Chen Tianlin succeeded his father Chen Hegui and became the chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Guoxiang Refrigeration was listed on the A-share market in 2003 with the stock code 600340. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to subjective and objective factors such as poor operating conditions, Guoxiang Refrigeration suffered continuous losses in 2007 and 2008. In May 2009, it was issued a delisting risk warning and became *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2009, Guoxiang Refrigeration announced that it planned to sell out all its existing assets and liabilities through major asset swaps and the issuance of shares to Xingfu Foundation, and at the same time inject the shares held by Xingfu Foundation into Real estate development and regional development business assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month ago, Chen Tianlin resigned as chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration, and Chen Genwei served as chairman and general manager of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Chen Genwei has been working for Guoxiang Refrigeration since 1997, and has successively served as section chief of the Quality Assurance Department, Secretary of the Board of Directors, and Director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2011, Guoxiang Refrigeration Asset Restructuring received approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the real estate company China Fortune Land Development successfully used its shell to go public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since China Fortune Land Development’s main business is real estate investment and development and has no intention of operating central air-conditioning business, in 2012, Zhejiang Guoxiang Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Holdings) controlled by Chen Genwei and his wife used 80 million to acquire the transfer Zhejiang Guoxiang has 100% equity, and Chen Genwei has also been promoted to chairman of Zhejiang Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retailers therefore questioned Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO, which was considered a secondary listing of the same asset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, during the IPO application process of Zhejiang Guoxiang in 2020 and this time, the Shanghai Stock Exchange made inquiries about the source of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, the Shanghai Stock Exchange asked Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain the proportion of its assets from the original listed company in its current assets and the role of its production and operations in its inquiry. It also asked the company to combine Past cases in the capital market indicate whether there are similar precedents in which the assets of a listed company were reorganized and then relisted with the same assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang listed a number of similar cases in its reply, such as Sichuan Instruments (603100.SH), Leon Micro (605358.SH), etc., saying that their main assets came from listed companies’ acquisitions. out assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the secondary listing, the Shanghai Stock Exchange stated in its response to reporters on October 9 that after review, the transactions of this part of the assets occurred in 2011 and 2012, and the total book assets related to the acquisition at the end of 2022 The relevant net fixed assets accounted for 15% and 0.06% of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total existing assets respectively. Zhejiang Guoxiang has shifted from focusing on commercial central air conditioners to mainly industrial central air conditioners. Its business, products, and technology Substantial changes have taken place in research and development, personnel and sales models, actual controllers and management. At the same time, there is basically no overlap between Zhejiang Guoxiang’s sales customers and suppliers and *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding listing standards, the Shanghai Stock Exchange quoted Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, saying that its cumulative net profit in the past three years was 387 million yuan, its net profit in the most recent year was 186 million yuan, and its cash generated from operating activities in the past three years The cumulative net flow was 600 million yuan, and the cumulative operating income was 4.226 billion yuan. &quot;Zhejiang Guoxiang complies with the first set of motherboard listing standards.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 253746&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The closing stock index of the day is displayed on an LED screen outside a building in Lujiazui, Shanghai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Super Raising&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;1.4&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Billion Yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to the secondary listing, the trigger for IPO controversy is also the excessive issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s issue price is 68.07 yuan per share, and the issue price-to-earnings ratio is 51.29 times. Such a high issue price was also beyond Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that the company is expected to use 737 million yuan in raised funds for this fundraising project. Based on the issue price of 68.07 yuan per share and the number of new shares issued of 35.0234 million shares, if this issuance is successful, Zhejiang Guoxiang is expected to raise a total of 2.384 billion yuan, after deducting the issuance expenses (excluding value-added tax) of 227.8 million yuan, The net amount of funds raised is expected to be 2.156 billion yuan, with an excess of 1.419 billion yuan raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times is not only higher than the industry average, but also higher than the comparable companies in the industry it lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;special equipment manufacturing industry (C35)&quot; in which it is located, as of September 26, 2023, the static average price-to-earnings ratio of C35 in the CSI Index industry in the past month was 27.81 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang disclosed five comparable companies in the same industry. After excluding the extreme value Jialitu (180.3 times) and the loss-making Yimikang, the average price-to-earnings ratio of the remaining three companies in 2022 is 45.82 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market criticized Zhejiang Guoxiang’s operating performance as being unable to match the issue price. Within the industry, Zhejiang Guoxiang has not yet occupied a dominant position, and its sustained profitability has been repeatedly questioned by the Shanghai Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang stated in the prospectus that since its establishment, it has been focusing on the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning. After years of efforts, it has grown into a relatively large player in the industrial and commercial central air-conditioning industry. An enterprise with high brand competitiveness. However, the company&#39;s market shares in 2020, 2021 and 2022 are only 1.20%, 1.28% and 1.77% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that Zhejiang Guoxiang’s revenue increased from 470 million yuan to 834 million yuan from 2015 to 2019. However, its net profit fluctuated greatly, which were 53.3466 million yuan, 47.1391 million yuan, and 28.3440 yuan respectively. Ten thousand yuan, 43.937 million yuan, 67.3813 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years of the epidemic from 2020 to 2022, Zhejiang Guoxiang not only increased its revenue steadily, but its net profit also increased significantly, reaching 99.7907 million yuan, 101.3427 million yuan and 185.9114 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this IPO issuance process, the first question in the implementation letter of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Review Center required Zhejiang Guoxiang to disclose the matching of its net profit growth in 2022 with the company&#39;s revenue growth, and analyze the rapid revenue growth in 2022 The main logic of growth and the sustainability of future growth, and reveal the risks of unsustainable rapid growth and provide reminders of major matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Shanghai Stock Exchange Listing Committee meeting held on June 19, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again required Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain whether its ability to continue operating has been significantly improved and improved based on the fact that its assets came from the original listed company *ST Guoxiang. , whether the relevant risk disclosure is sufficient. At the same time, the sponsor representative is requested to express clear opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The motivation for institutions to create new products at high prices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The high issuance price is reported by institutional investors during the inquiry period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that a total of 8,732 placement targets managed by 800 offline investors participated in Zhejiang Guoxiang’s preliminary inquiry. The quotation range is 7.80 yuan/share-103.50 yuan/share, corresponding to the total number of proposed subscriptions. The total number of shares sold was 51.074 billion, and the overall offline subscription multiple was 2,700 times the initial offline issuance scale before the callback. Quotation subscriptions were relatively active. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After excluding invalid quotes and the highest quotes, there are still 733 investors, corresponding to 8,547 allotment objects. The highest quotes excluded refer to allotment objects whose subscription price is higher than 81.49 yuan/share, and allotment objects whose subscription price is 81.49 yuan/share and whose planned subscription quantity is less than 3.8 million shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lower of the average and the median quotes from offline investors is 73.6 yuan/share. Among them, the median quotations from public funds, fund management companies, insurance companies, securities companies, futures companies, trust companies and private equity funds are all around 74 yuan, which is higher than the final issuance price of 69.07 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among public funds, this is especially true for those who quote high prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seventeen products of Golden Eagle Fund quoted a high price of 92.52 yuan per share, a 33.9% premium to the issue price, and were all eliminated. 29 products under Harvest Fund quoted 81.94 yuan per share. They were eliminated because the number of planned subscriptions was less than 3.8 million shares. Another 122 products with the same quotation met the subscription quantity requirements and were shortlisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the valid quotes, Wells Fargo Fund (quoted at 80.75 yuan/share), Chuangjin Hexin (quoted at 80 yuan/share), Shenwan Lingxin Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share), ICBC Credit Suisse Fund and CCB Credit Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share) The quotations of public funds such as 78 yuan/share) far exceeded the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is a company whose performance is really not impressive so sought after by institutions? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity fund person explained to Southern Weekend reporters that the issue price pricing rules are relatively complex, involving the average and median of institutional quotations, and the average and median of quotations from social security funds, pension insurance, etc. Compare. The inquiry for new stocks only eliminates 1% of the high prices. As long as the quotation is slightly higher than the average price, institutions can be shortlisted and finally get the new stocks at the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If new stocks in the market have a good profit-making effect recently, or the subject of new stocks is popular, institutions will increase their quotations to ensure shortlisting. The person said frankly, &quot;Regardless of the finalists, we all point to other institutions to look at the fundamentals. In fact, no one looks at it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main board’s new stock inquiry and pricing mechanism originally had an invisible ceiling of 23 times the price-earnings ratio. After the comprehensive registration system reform was launched, the company&#39;s issuance price was liberalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, market voices generally believed that companies to be listed with good development prospects would obtain higher valuation levels in the issuance of new shares, and companies with relatively limited development space would see their valuations return quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Former senior sponsor Wang Jiyue told Southern Weekend reporters that after the new IPO policy, the supply of new shares was low and the risk of new shares was expected to be low, so prices went up. Not only the institutional quotations of Zhejiang Guoxiang are high, but the overall quotations of new shares are also high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are some irresponsible quotations.” Wang Jiyue analyzed that the reason why institutions quoted high prices was because they expected that the stock price would not break within a few days after listing. Loss is a small probability event and does not affect the interests of fund managers. , the quotation is not binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Institutional quotations have become based on transaction expectations, rather than based on the company’s true value.” In his view, the meaning of the existence of institutional investors is to guide correct quotations. &quot;The power to set the issue price is in the hands of institutions, and there are not many practical constraints on institutional quotations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Institutional investors who participated in the inquiry also attributed the motivation for high-priced new products to &quot;making money from new products in the near future.&quot; Private equity fund Shiva Mavericks has 6 products quoted at 73.65 yuan, which were shortlisted for Zhejiang Guoxiang’s effective quotes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Hong, the manager of Shiva Mavericks Fund who is known as the &quot;Ten Billion Private Equity Boss&quot;, responded to the quotation in Xueqiu and said, &quot;Monguli will have obvious profit-making effects in the future, and it will sell on the first day of trading.&quot; The average profit is 80%, so the main purpose is to seek finalists for quotations, and don’t care about the price. If you lose money after a few losses, then you have to be selective and quote a lower price.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liang Hong’s view, the problem lies in the high-priced IPOs, rather than in recruiting new ones. &quot;Some people say that this or that company is not worth the money, so why should they pay a high price? I want to know even more, why do they take over the market at a high price after there is so much money after listing? If not, why should I call you?&quot; At present, Liang Hong is Messages have been deleted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after the new shares are listed, who will take over? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xueqiu user &quot;Xiaye Guapeng&quot; cleverly discovered that for stocks listed at the end of each quarter, through the top ten circulating shareholders disclosed by them, we can know what the new shares will be after 5 trading days. Which funds are taking over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no limit on the price of new shares in the first five trading days, and they are subject to special regulatory attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this logic, he analyzed 9 stocks that were listed at the end of each quarter in 2022 and 2023, and found that securities companies, which are strongly related to the issuance of new shares, will use their own funds to make large-scale purchases a few days after listing. Buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Zhiou Technology (301376.SZ) and Guoke Military Industry (688543.SH), which were listed on June 21, 2023, the ten largest circulating shareholders disclosed in the interim report include the securities firm CICC , CITIC Securities, Huatai Securities, Guotai Junan Securities and China Merchants Securities, and they are all new shareholders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Jiyue’s view, high-priced innovation by institutions is not a single issue. &quot;New stock pricing rules, new stock supply and demand, stock circulation ratio, and behavioral finance under the tradition of new stock speculation all need to be taken into consideration.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of millions of underwriting fees are suspended&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Stock investors also have doubts about Orient Securities (600958.SH), the sponsor of Zhejiang Guoxiang, and believe that Orient Securities has not been diligent and responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities’ sponsorship fee for undertaking Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO this time is 2 million yuan. In addition, Orient Securities is also the underwriter, and underwriting fees are charged based on a certain proportion of the total funds raised. This is the more important income of Orient Securities in this IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus shows that the underwriting fees charged by Orient Securities vary according to the total amount of funds raised, and the rate ratio fluctuates in three levels: 7.50%, 7.70%, and 8.70%, and different fixed fees are also attached. cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total fund-raising of 2.384 billion yuan, Orient Securities can receive over 184 million yuan in underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the total revenue of Orient Securities’ investment banking business was 741.5 million yuan. Zhejiang Guoxiang’s underwriting fee of nearly 200 million yuan is of great significance to its performance in the second half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 10, Orient Securities issued an announcement on the investment banking project, stating that the underwriting rate for the Zhejiang Guoxiang issuance was 7.74% as determined through negotiation between the sponsor and the issuer. However, the specific calculation method was not disclosed. Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issuance has been suspended, and Orient Securities has not yet collected underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, the company also has indirect equity relationships with Orient Securities and its affiliates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities Hande holds 2.74% of the total pre-issuance share capital of Zhejiang Guoxiang, while Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, invested 11.11% in Orient Securities Hande. In other words, Orient Securities indirectly holds 0.03% of the shares of Zhejiang Guoxiang before its listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s controlling shareholder Guoxiang Holdings holds 16.34%, 14.71%, 4.44% and 12.51% of the capital contributions of Orient Securities Zhoude, Orient Securities Tangde, Orient Securities Xia De, and Orient Securities Hechuang respectively. share.

But for investors, entrusting their personal property through a bank is equivalent to psychologically receiving the bank&#39;s brand endorsement&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the past two years, the number of bank private banking customers and asset size have continued to grow, including the growth of wealth such as family trusts, which shows that in the face of an uncertain environment, high-net-worth individuals are still willing to invest in Wealth is held in the banking system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;2023 China Private Wealth Report&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; also&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;mentioned that as the &quot;first rich&quot; group,&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Private banking clients&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s comprehensive needs have expanded from focusing on individuals, families, and businesses to the fields of social responsibility, public welfare, and charity.

The survey shows that 73% of high-net-worth individuals have started or are preparing for wealth inheritance. In terms of intergenerational inheritance, the current first-choice method for high-net-worth individuals is to pass on wealth to their children.

This may be one of the reasons why many domestic banks still put private banking business into the large retail framework and do not conduct separate accounting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As for the development of domestic private banking business, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that we can start from the following three aspects&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; ：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, strengthen investment research and professional product design capabilities, and enrich the product system. Continue to track customer needs and market changes, and promptly adjust asset allocation strategies and product structures. Improve the level of asset allocation in major categories, achieve regional diversification and asset class diversification through overseas diversified asset allocation, and help investors ensure investment returns and asset value preservation and appreciation;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;The second is to use technology to help build a digital private bank. With the rapid development of technology, the integration of financial technology and wealth management continues to deepen, and its application chain will gradually penetrate from the client side to product development, investment portfolio, valuation management and other product-side links. With the help of financial technology, we provide investment advisors with investment advice, conduct operational warnings, track customer investment progress, and greatly improve the efficiency of private banking services and customer experience;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The third is to attach importance to non-financial businesses . &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Different from traditional wealth management business, the business scope of private banks&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; includes financial services and non-financial businesses, among which non-financial businesses involve very Extensive, including investment consulting, tax planning, daily consumption, medical health, tourism, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the international &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;mature private banking system, consulting management fees generated in the non-financial field are expected to account for 45% of the overall income&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Domestic private banks can use this as a starting point, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;link to various professional institutions&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;create more&lt;/span >;&lt;span>;Profit&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[上海女童海滩搜寻现“罗生门”，全国究竟有多少“蓝天救援队”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258417]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 20:06:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Blue Sky Rescue Team of Taihe County, Jiangxi Province is conducting a drowning prevention inspection. &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; Under the banner, brand controversies often arise.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same uniforms are also called the &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; by the outside world. These days, two &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Teams&quot; that do not recognize each other have appeared on Shanghai Nanhui New Town Beach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center (hereinafter referred to as the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center), after a 4 and a half year old girl in Shanghai was lost on the beach on the evening of October 4, 2023, they were rescued the next day. Received search and rescue requests from family members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 7, the center announced that the rescue team &quot;originally planned to carry out a search and rescue mission tonight, but it was suspended due to some reasons.&quot; The statement also stated that any subsequent activities carried out at the rescue site in the name of &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; will have nothing to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, another team &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue&quot; with the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; logo also released news to the media, saying that the above statement was issued by another group of people without authorization and did not represent the Blue Sky Rescue Team. Officially, the Blue Sky Rescue Team has been searching and rescuing the 4-year-old girl at the scene and has not stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters discovered that behind the conflict between the two parties was the &quot;separation&quot; dispute between Blue Sky Rescue Team that lasted for several years. Zhang Yong, the founder of Blue Sky Rescue Team, and Cao Weiwei, the current legal representative of Beijing Blue Sky Rescue, both advocated The legitimacy of himself and the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; - the &quot;Blue Sky&quot; brand, has become the focus of competition between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Simultaneous search and rescue&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center told Southern Weekend reporters that on October 5, they were entrusted by their families to go to Nanhui New City Beach to carry out search and rescue, and they The search and rescue operation was reported to the Pudong New Area Emergency Management Bureau. &quot;After dark, we also use drones (lighting search and rescue).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member did not reveal the specific reason for the evacuation on the 7th: &quot;It&#39;s not convenient to say, I just evacuated that area.&quot; At present, &quot;the government has been conducting search and rescue operations.&quot; But the staff member also said that he had also seen other &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; at the search and rescue site in the past two days. &quot;The other party started to think that we were together, but I said no. He also wondered, why is there another Blue Sky (rescue team)?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said angrily that at some disaster sites before, Some rescue teams will carry out operations under the name of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;, some will raise funds in WeChat groups, but the payee will be a personal account, and some will charge a fee to kill, so that they have to report to the police. Report the crime. &quot;When doing charity, do charity well. If you are really capable, don&#39;t use other people&#39;s names.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was indeed another &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; involved in the rescue at the scene. On the afternoon of October 9, He Dongping told Southern Weekend reporters that as the captain of the Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team, he had been involved in the search and rescue of the girl from the 5th to the 9th, entrusted by the family, and the search and rescue is still ongoing. He Dongping introduced that he is also a member of the &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue&quot; mentioned above. &quot;BSR&quot; is the English abbreviation of Blue Sky Rescue Team. However, he had a &quot;bad opinion&quot; about the evacuation of another team, the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center, from the search and rescue site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qichacha information shows that the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center was established in July 2014, and its legal representative is Yang Chunming. For a long time, this was the only social organization registered as Blue Sky Rescue in Shanghai until 2023. On September 21, 2019, a private, non-enterprise organization named &quot;Shanghai Baoshan Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; was registered and established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping introduced that Shanghai Baoshan Blue Sky Rescue Team is the name they registered with the civil affairs department. Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team, Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team, Shanghai Qingpu Blue Sky Rescue Team and Shanghai College Student Blue Sky Rescue Team are all The team under its jurisdiction. On weekdays, these four teams are coordinated by an internal organization called the &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Coordination Center&quot;, and each team carries out rescue work according to different functions and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping said that the brands of the four &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; teams in Shanghai were authorized from the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team. He and his teammates have been doing search and rescue for many years under the name &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; before. However, before 2023, the local civil affairs department cannot register non-governmental organizations ending with the word &quot;team&quot;. &quot;In order to justify their name,&quot; they officially registered in 2023. The civil affairs department registered as the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping believes that although the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center has exactly the same costumes as them, in fact, &quot;the authorization given to them was canceled many years ago.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to He Dongping, the search and rescue scene was stormy and the waves were strong. Staff from government departments once came to them to verify which team was the real Blue Sky Rescue Team, as well as the team’s skills and equipment. “We told them truthfully. After that, I asked them to leave.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Competing for &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters discovered that the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center is also a private non-enterprise organization registered with the civil affairs department. The difference between them is actually that they belong to different blue sky rescue systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The list of Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center and its team members is listed on the website &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot;; the list of personnel of the four blue sky rescue teams including the Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team is posted on the website &quot;Blue Sky Rescue .China” on. Through the domain name retrieval system and Tianyancha, the owners of the above two domain names are Chi Xiang, the legal representative of Guangdong Blue Sky Rescue Team, and He Dongping, the legal representative of Shanghai Little Savior Technology Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The information published on the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot; shows that Zhang Yong is the commander-in-chief of the Blue Sky Rescue Team; &quot;Blue Sky Rescue. China&quot; shows that Cao Weiwei is the person in charge and captain of the brand management of the Blue Sky Rescue Team . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the country&#39;s earliest Blue Sky Rescue Team was registered with the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, becoming China&#39;s first private, non-enterprise rescue team with independent legal person qualifications. Zhang Yong, who proposed the establishment of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, has long served as the legal representative of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Beijing Blue Sky&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253789&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two different national blue sky rescue platforms.

Internet screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 2020, Beijing Blue Sky’s board members underwent drastic changes. According to the minutes of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team board of directors released by the WeChat public account &quot;BJBSR&quot; (the name of the public account at the time was &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;), on July 27 of that year, Zhang Yong resigned as captain and legal representative at the board meeting. position, the board of directors also elected Cao Weiwei as vice chairman and legal representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Yong later did not admit the authenticity of the meeting minutes. According to the China Judgment Documents Network, Zhang Yong once filed a lawsuit against Beijing Blue Sky regarding the minutes of the board of directors that &quot;expelled&quot; him, requesting that the four meeting minutes be found to be invalid. Zhang Yong claimed that Cao forged the signature on the minutes of the board of directors. However, the court believed that the evidence submitted by Zhang Yong was insufficient to prove his claim and ruled that Zhang Yong lost the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the WeChat public account &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot; has become the account actually operated by Zhang Yong. On December 23, 2020, &quot;Yuanshan Theory&quot; explained the whole incident, saying that Beijing Lantian discovered huge financial loopholes during its audit at the beginning of that year. After investigation, the target was Cao Weiwei, who was the captain of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team at the time, and it was decided to expel Cao Weiwei from the Blue Sky Rescue System. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Yong ended up being the one who was &quot;fired&quot;. In February 2022, the legal representative of Beijing Blue Sky was changed to Cao Weiwei. In April of the same year, Zhang Yong posted a video on &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot;. In the video, he was wearing a dark blue uniform of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. He raised many questions about Cao Weiwei, who had served as his assistant, saying that he was seeking personal gain. By stealing official seals, forging materials, etc., the legal representative of Beijing Lantian was registered as an individual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 31, 2023, the official WeChat public account of the &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; issued a statement announcing the removal of Chairman Zhang Yong, the removal of director positions and expulsion from the team, and the election of Cao Weiwei as Chairman. On October 1, the public account issued another statement explaining that the reason why Zhang Yong was fired from Beijing Blue Sky was &quot;violation of discipline.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Weiwei explained to Southern Weekend reporters that there were many reasons for expelling Zhang Yong, including &quot;personal issues&quot; and his self-proclaimed &quot;captain&quot; who violated relevant regulations that social groups cannot be managed vertically. &quot;To put it bluntly, he is doing it outside with other people now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Relationship between the headquarters and local teams&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Behind the above disputes are Beijing&#39;s &quot;Blue Sky Headquarters&quot; and Blue Sky Rescue in various places. &quot;Brand licensing&quot; relationship between teams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s private rescue teams were originally composed of outdoor sports enthusiasts. After experiencing the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and the 2010 Yushu earthquake, the private rescue force gradually developed into a large scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Groups&quot; stipulates that social groups are not allowed to establish regional branches. Therefore, both Zhang Yongfang and Cao Weifang have stated that there is no hierarchical affiliation between the more than 2,000 registered Blue Sky Rescue Teams and Beijing Blue Sky. However, the Beijing Blue Sky dispute will still affect other Blue Sky rescue teams across the country through some intangible assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, &quot;BJBSR&quot; stated that the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot; that the National Blue Sky Rescue Team has used for several years has belonged to Chi Xiang&#39;s personal company, and Beijing Blue Sky terminated its cooperation with Chi Xiang in 2020 . Currently, Beijing Blue Sky holds the copyright and patent rights of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, which are well-known to the public, such as the &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue Round Logo&quot;, BSR Square Logo, and Blue Sky Team Uniforms. Information about Zhang Yong&#39;s Blue Sky Rescue Team is disclosed through the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure&quot; Published through channels such as &quot;Platform&quot; and &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 30, &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot; announced that the Blue Sky Rescue Team would change the VI logo system and rescue phone number. Many Blue Sky teams from various places, including the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center, responded one after another. The next day, the &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; issued a response stating that &quot;the relevant signs and logos of the Blue Sky Rescue Team have not been updated or changed,&quot; and once again emphasized that Zhang Yongshi was &quot;fired&quot; and &quot;removed&quot; from Beijing Blue Sky for &quot;violating discipline.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the &quot;separation&quot;, in 2014, Blue Sky Rescue Team formulated the &quot;Fuyang Convention&quot; and established the brand licensing model of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;. Beijing Blue Sky is the brand holder and maintains the national system through the structure of &quot;Beijing Team-Provincial Brand Supervisors-Local Blue Sky Teams&quot;. Places in various places that are willing to form a team submit an application, and Beijing Blue Sky will send liaison officers to review and inspect them. Those who meet the Blue Sky team building standards will be approved to form a team. Beijing Blue Sky authorizes it to use the name and logo of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, and sets up &quot;brand supervisors&quot; in each province, who are responsible for supervising whether the Blue Sky Rescue Team in each province carries out activities in accordance with the system stipulated by Beijing Blue Sky. If they fail to meet the standards, they will be removed. Local teams have the obligation to implement the various management systems of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and adhere to the development philosophy. However, people, finances, and materials are independently managed by the local rescue teams. The headquarters does not interfere with the regular operations of each team in normal times. It only requires that when conducting unified rescue. The unit obeys the dispatch and command of the headquarters and frontline headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the nearly ten years since then, the Blue Sky Rescue System has developed rapidly across the country. Some teams and personnel have chosen to withdraw, and more volunteers want to join. But from the actual legal status, the Blue Sky headquarters is equal to the Blue Sky teams across the country. Zhang Yong once explained that private rescue teams can register with the local civil affairs department to become a &quot;certain blue sky rescue&quot; organization. If this team does not want to join the blue sky rescue system after registration, or has withdrawn from the blue sky rescue system, it can still continue to use it. The registered name of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;. When they carry out activities, they do not need to assign tasks through the headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Weiwei explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;brand management&quot; is a kind of intentional cooperation. Unified trademarks and team uniforms are for resource sharing and common ideas among different team members. In addition, Beijing Blue Sky cannot restrict the behavior of teams from various places through other means, &quot;it all depends on the spirit of volunteerism.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But some civilian rescue team staff have different perspectives. Li Yanzhao, an early member of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and captain of the Qingdao Red Cross Rescue Team, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that many private rescue teams need &quot;Blue Sky&quot; because it has a high social reputation. Relying on this &quot;brand&quot;, many times they can &quot;protect yourself&quot;. Li Yanzhao left the Blue Sky Rescue Team in his early years because he disagreed with the Fuyang Convention. In his opinion, compared with the unified &quot;Blue Sky&quot; brand, what the private rescue team actually needs most is &quot;professional and standardized operation and rescue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[入职三天因“氛围不好”走人：要分清是公司不行还是自己不适应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258393]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a post viewed by more than 5 million people on the Internet has aroused heated discussion: A young man has been working for three days because of the atmosphere of the unit. It’s not easy to leave your job. As soon as this topic came up, countless netizens started a heated debate on the working atmosphere and salary and benefits: some said that the working atmosphere is very important and is the bottom line of being a human being; some believed that working is just to make money, and as long as the treatment is good, you should tolerate it. Just have to endure it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the working atmosphere or salary is more important is a matter of opinion. There is no unified standard answer. But everyone should pay attention: the working atmosphere cannot be defined simply as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. The key is whether it suits you personally. When considering whether you are suitable or not, you cannot rely on your own vague feelings, but must have measurable standards, such as: industry prospects, company development, leadership ability and charm, teamwork, nature of work, job division, your own suitability, and Salary level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is a sunset industry, a company that lacks a future, a strong bureaucracy, widespread flattery, team intrigues, a depressing working atmosphere, fierce competition and other truly bad operating conditions, there is nothing wrong with choosing to leave. And habitat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if the industry is booming, the company has a good future, the company is full of vigor, the leadership and business backbones are strong, the teamwork is close, the relationship between colleagues is harmonious, the competition is fierce but the system is fair, and rewards and punishments are clear... it&#39;s just that It is not good to easily give up a hard-won offer based on some vague feelings because you are temporarily unsuitable, unable to keep up with the rhythm, and your self-esteem is temporarily frustrated. After all, it is difficult to fully and objectively understand a company and related industries after only a few days of employment. Frequent employment and resignation within a short period of time will also have a negative impact on an individual&#39;s credibility in the workplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 years ago, when I was young, I had several experiences of leaving my job quickly after a short time in the job. This was because I felt that the company was small, the equipment was backward, and the business it undertook was also small. The lower end is not good for your future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I had the opportunity to join a 4A advertising company. I was very frustrated at first. The working atmosphere was not good. The &quot;senior creative&quot; was unwilling to teach a new &quot;design assistant&quot; like me. The creative director (Creative Director) was basically Don&#39;t look at me seriously. However, seeing so many award-winning works in the company, the advertising agencies of large companies, the profound insights of CDs and SCs in analyzing problems during meetings, and the many Apple &quot;Macintosh&quot; graphics workstations in the creative department... I feel that I am lucky to be in the company. As long as people don’t forcefully kick me out of this prestigious creative enterprise, I must stay and learn all their skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, when I became the creative director, I also faced the problem of new employees leaving within a few days of joining. The reason was: I felt that the big brothers and sisters in the company did not respect them enough. This new employee was in school. He had served as a cadre of the student union at that time, and other classmates were probably polite to him and were used to it. Suddenly he entered a company and became the bottom of the team. The psychological gap was too big. This is not a &quot;bad atmosphere&quot; in the company, but a &quot;bad mentality&quot; on his part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A HR friend from a headhunting company once said to me: Do you plan to be a part-time worker for a long time, or will you be able to do it yourself in the future? The way you deal with it in the workplace is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to be a part-time worker for a long time and eventually become a professional manager, then in the early stages of your career experience, you should change jobs frequently to enrich your experience and look for opportunities as much as possible. As you gradually mature, you will need to slow down the frequency of job changes in order to accumulate your own workplace personality. Because the headhunting market is now all connected to the Internet, the boss and the board of directors have increasingly strict requirements on the workplace ethics of senior managers. The previous &quot;meritocracy&quot; has gradually developed into &quot;both ability and political integrity&quot;. In the early days of starting a business, I was still rampant in an immature market, so of course I advocated &quot;meritocracy&quot;. Now, as those with successful careers are getting older, they have to consider whether their foundation will be passed on to the &quot;second or third generation&quot; in the future. Therefore, their employment methods have also begun to select harvest-type talents to avoid &quot;restless&quot; talents. People rise to the top. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to do it yourself in the future, you must find a company that is large enough and complex enough, fully understand how an industry operates, how a company operates, and understand the market and people in the workplace. How do you survive? The focus is on observing the market, understanding people&#39;s hearts, and understanding human nature, not &quot;working atmosphere&quot; or &quot;salary benefits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This HR friend also believes that &quot;college students&quot; should be cautious when starting a business. If they have just graduated from college and do not understand the market and have no insight into human nature, they will go into debt to start a business and even use up their parents&#39; pension. That&#39;s not good. Tens of millions of college students graduate every year around the world. How many Jobs and Musks are there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;College students should find employment first. Even if they change jobs a few times, experience some things in the world, get a preliminary understanding of the market, get in touch with complex human nature, and then start their own business, the probability of success will be higher. Even so, we do not advocate &quot;resigning after three days of employment&quot;, because in three days, you can&#39;t learn anything, you can&#39;t understand anything, and you can&#39;t even find out what problems the company has. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[往事琐忆丨人来人往]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258391]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/EsoGMZ7gxCvPcnc1mEkEuGnUkMgCc7JAfXCjhMRQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;539&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/EsoGMZ7gxCvPcnc1mEkEuGnUk MgCc7JAfXCjhMRQ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253655&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Campbell Soup cans. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Green Leaves&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Car driving on Prince Edward Road, Kowloon , during the afternoon rush hour, it was suddenly blocked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is nothing to do at this time, so I have to settle down. There is no way to advance or retreat anyway, so why be upset? Looking outside the car, there are trees on both sides, and all kinds of trees are fluttering in the wind under the sun. There are large clumps of green leaves with varying shapes, some pointed, some round, &amp;nbsp;some long, some short. Probably no one would pay attention to green leaves in normal times. Only in this season when there are no flowers to enjoy, only when the heat is overwhelming and you happen to be in an air-conditioned car, can you enjoy them so easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leaves, lush and small, swayed in the wind. Under the sunlight, they flickered in the sun, as if thousands of small mirrors were vying for beauty. How many times have I passed by this scene? Why do I always turn a blind eye to this scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As people grow up, there are many times when they turn a blind eye and turn a blind eye. The rigid daily rhythm has dulled the once sharp mind, and it is no longer possible to feel the subtle and wonderful gifts in life. I don’t know how to cherish everything I have, nor do I think it will be lost in an instant. I always think that everything is inevitable. What is there today will still be there tomorrow. When it is lost in an instant, I am shocked to realize why I didn&#39;t take advantage of it in the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greenery outside the window reminds me of the years when I was studying in Taiwan when I was young. Materials were really scarce at that time, and broken appliances were repaired again and again; watches had to be worn for a lifetime; there were only three or two pieces of clothing, and they were passed down from brother to brother and from sister to sister. Still, it was a good time. For example, when we were in art class, the teacher often taught us to be ingenious, develop our creativity, and create magnificent and colorful pictures with limited materials. Once, let us draw leaves. The method is to first go to the wild to collect all kinds of green leaves, and then lay out the various leaves on white drawing paper according to your own preference, then cut out a piece of the old screen window to use as a sieve, and lightly paint it with light and dark watercolors. The colors pass through the fine grid and fall on the painting paper like rain and dew. Then the green leaves were uncovered one after another, and each time they were painted with different colors. Finally, a masterpiece with vivid patterns and brilliant colors was finally formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, I have fallen in love with leaves. I like to look at flowers and don’t forget to admire leaves. At that time, I lived in a large courtyard on Heping East Road in Taipei. There were several simple bungalows built in the courtyard, and several families lived there. The martial arts novelist Gu Long also lived there when he was a child. He didn&#39;t like to study and only wanted to write novels. , everyone called him &quot;the son of the Xiong family&quot;. In the middle of the yard is a public open space where chickens are raised and dogs are let out. The remaining narrow corners are filled with some inconspicuous flowers and plants. I don’t know who planted them. There is an oleander tree next to the public toilet. It has bright pink flowers, pointed and long leaves, dark green leaves and light green backs. Several canna plants were planted beside the ditch, some red and some yellow, with egg-elliptical leaves. Although the variety is ordinary, it has swayed in the morning and sunset, adding a lot of interest to life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Taipei at that time, there was a lot of farmland and greenery everywhere. Before moving to Dazayuan, I lived in a place called &quot;Liuzhangli&quot; (what a pastoral name). There was only a fence between the residence and the large farmland. The fence is covered with morning glories. Every sunrise, the purple flowers are in full bloom, resembling trumpets, and the leaves are tender and green, smiling and waving in the morning breeze. No wonder this flower is called Morning Glory in English. In that rice field, you can see buffaloes working hard and farmers working hard all year round. Speaking of green, there is no more beautiful scene than the beautiful spring seedlings and the green color that fills the eyes! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way home from school, I often see piles of large green leaves on the streets and in puddles, similar in shape to lotus leaves, but I have never seen a lotus flower in bloom. When I asked an adult, I found out that they were taro leaves. Although taro leaves are ordinary, it turns out that this leaf has a special feature. Whenever it rains, the falling raindrops are sprinkled on the leaf surface, and they will condense into water droplets, rolling back and forth, just like diamonds. When the sun shines after the rain, It looks even more dazzling. I remember once I wrote this scenery into a composition &quot;After the Rain&quot;, which was greatly praised by my class teacher (called a grade teacher in Taiwan) Chen Wenbin. This inspired my love for words, and thus I embarked on a career in literature and translation in the future. the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, when I returned to Paris, I was introduced by a friend to the works of French painter Chen Jianzhong. He was good at painting all kinds of leaves. The green leaves in each picture were crystal clear and glowed with the brilliance of life. , exciting. It&#39;s a pity that I didn&#39;t have enough money to buy a treasure back then, and now I can&#39;t even afford the astronomical current price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter! Just look out and enjoy the greenery outside the window! The layers of green are soothing to the eyes and the mind. I am already very rich and contented. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Canned food&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the epidemic is not over and the lockdown is over, I don’t want my Filipino maid to go to the vegetable market often, so just ask her to buy it in the supermarket. As a result, there were more canned soups, luncheon meats, etc. on the table. I usually have no interest in canned food, the only exception being tomato sauce beans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time I go out with my daughter, we always order All Day Breakfast for lunch, and the must-have soybeans in tomato sauce in this dish is my favorite. Whenever my daughter watches me eating beans with gusto, she is always a little puzzled. What is so special about such ordinary food? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sour and sweet, glutinous and crispy, what you taste in your mouth is not just the melt-in-your-mouth feeling of beans in tomato sauce, but also the memory of hard work in your youth. When I was a sophomore in high school, I moved to Hong Kong from Taipei and was lucky enough to be admitted to Pei Ching Middle School. I was unfamiliar with the place and I didn&#39;t know the Cantonese language. I had to take the national college entrance examination a year later. I was caught off guard and I was in a hurry. Fortunately, the whole class did not exclude me, a transfer student from Taiwan. I hung out with everyone every day in school. Within half a year, I could speak Cantonese casually and became as fluent as I am today. At that time, I was only thinking about Taiwan&#39;s university entrance examination. I really didn&#39;t know much about Hong Kong&#39;s high school entrance examination. I only know that my classmates are nervously preparing for the exam, and I am also nervous. There were five or six girls in the class. Some time before the college entrance examination, we would meet from time to time to go back to school on Sundays to review their studies. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry were the highlight. For a new student like me, having someone to work hard with and solve puzzles with after school was certainly a blessing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life was simple and materially scarce at that time. Five or six young people got together to buy a long loaf of white bread and a can of beans with tomato sauce&amp;nbsp; (This was my first experience with such a thing. canned food), not even soda and juice, so it was our lunch. After reviewing, when my head was dizzy due to the difficult laws of physics, the thorny mathematics problems, and the complexity of biochemical terms, I opened the can, spread the orange soybeans on the white soft bread, and chewed it, but I felt Extremely luscious. I still remember the sour, sweet, crispy and soft fragrance of beans. Along with a cheering gesture and an encouraging look among my classmates, it immediately aroused the feeling of &quot;having the same hatred and the same enemy&quot; in the exam room. A little trouble before the exam, That&#39;s why it was wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another kind of can is something I can never forget. Before coming to Hong Kong, I studied in Beiyi Girls&#39; School in Taiwan, from the first year of junior high school to the second year of high school. At that time, I lived in a large courtyard on Heping East Road. The landlord&#39;s surname was Yan and he was from Sichuan. Their family has three daughters and three sons. My daughters are all older than me, so after we moved there, I suddenly had three more sisters when I was alone at home. Lucy, the third sister of the Yan family, is a happy girl. She greets everyone with a smile all day long, dances and has many strange thoughts. It was a period of growth at that time. Soon after dinner, my stomach would growl and I couldn&#39;t find anything to eat, so I would follow my third sister around. Lucy said that there is a good way to take the leftover cold rice from dinner and wash it with hot water to turn it into soaked rice. No side dishes, right? Open a can of &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dushan Salted Pickled Cabbage&quot; was a famous brand in Taiwan back then. When you open the can, you will be greeted by the aroma of garlic. I don’t know why, maybe it was because I didn’t have any other choice back then! I just remember that every time it was almost midnight, I would hide in the small kitchen with my third sister, top up the hot rice with sour and spicy &quot;Dushan&quot;, and devour it with great joy. My empty stomach would also make me feel incomparable. of satisfaction. Since then, I have fallen in love with peppers and garlic, which seems a bit &quot;deviant&quot; to me as a Shanghainese. However, when I went to Paris to study in the future, I came across &quot;garlic, butter, wine&quot;. For Sanbao’s French cooking, it feels like a fish in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Bei Yi was in junior high school, all students received Scout training. Once, the school asked everyone to go camping, but the camp was not in the countryside, but on the school playground. No matter this, the classmates are still happy and excited. Each class is divided into teams of six or seven people. After each team sets up camp, they have to be responsible for their own cooking. Each team shows off their skills and presents their specialty dishes, which the instructors can taste and rate to compete. I remember that our team had finally set up the tent and was already in a hurry. How could we still have time to cook? In desperation, someone came up with an idea, saying that it would be better to use a magic weapon like &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot;! It was almost dusk, and the instructor Shi Shiran came to the field. She may be like the Zao Lord Bodhisattva at the end of the twelfth lunar month. Along the way, she had tried big fish and meat in each team, and her mouth felt a little tired. As soon as she tasted our &quot; &quot;Dushan Salted Pickled Cabbage&quot;, he was so full of praises that he thought it was a supreme delicacy and almost gave us the first prize. This time, everyone was shocked. Isn&#39;t this behavior comparable to cheating in an exam? I no longer remember the result, but this unique experience remains firmly in my mind. I revisited the island many years later and wanted to find a can of &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot; in the supermarket. Unfortunately, this brand has long since passed away. As time goes by, the traces of fragrance are gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a kind of canned chicken that contains boneless chicken. I can’t remember the name. It’s a foreign brand. After graduating from university, he went to the United States to study for a master&#39;s degree. Not long after I arrived, I met Shi, a girl from Taiwan, in the dormitory of Washington University in St. Louis. The two hit it off immediately. The dormitory provides breakfast and dinner, and you can prepare lunch by yourself. In order to save money, the two of us decided to buy a loaf of white bread every lunch, open a can of boneless chicken, and eat it in my room. Shi is majoring in chemical engineering, and her hand strength is stronger than mine. She can do tasks like opening cans with ease. One day at noon, I went back late. When I entered the unlocked door, I found that the room was quiet and there was no one around. When I looked carefully, I saw a half-opened can on the small table with blood stains on the side. ,&amp;nbsp;A drop of blood first flowed to the ground, and then to the door. This scene was like a murder scene, so scary! I followed the bloodstains and hurriedly ran out. The bloodstains led me through the corridor and towards the room at the other end. When I rushed in, I was surprised to see Shi, who was usually tough, pressing his bloody fingers with a nervous look on his face. , at a loss! We hurried to the medical room, not remembering how many stitches she gave. Years later, whenever I think about the frugal years when I was studying in the United States, and the lifelong innocent friendship between our group of girls, I will accidentally think of this canned boneless chicken! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three kinds of cans carry three stages of life, from green to mature. Those years were quiet and peaceful, and we spent ordinary and comfortable days; what about now? The wind is blowing and the rain is blowing, and the weather is unpredictable. Looking at the future in the distance, I am speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[澳大利亚籍人员成蕾被国家安全机关依法执行驱逐出境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258395]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 11, 2023, Australian citizen Cheng Lei was detained by Beijing after serving her sentence.
