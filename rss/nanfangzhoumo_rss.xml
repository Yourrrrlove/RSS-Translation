Feedback from this round of inspections is carried out through a combination of centralized feedback and &quot;one-on-one&quot; feedback from the inspection team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, the Central Inspection Leading Group held a centralized feedback meeting on the first round of inspections of the 20th Central Committee. The meeting conveyed and studied the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech when he listened to the Central Committee’s first round of inspection reports, informed the common problems discovered during the inspection, and made arrangements for rectification during the inspection. Liu Jinguo, secretary of the Central Secretariat and deputy leader of the Central Inspection Leading Group, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From September 20th to 22nd, 15 central inspection teams conducted &quot;one-on-one&quot; meetings with the party groups of 30 medium-sized enterprises, 5 party committees of medium-sized financial enterprises, and the party group of the State Sports General Administration during this round of inspections. feedback. According to the Central Inspection Work Arrangement, each Central Inspection Team notified the principals of the inspected party organizations of the outstanding problems discovered during the inspection, and reported the inspection situation to the leadership team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feedback pointed out that in recent years, centrally managed enterprises and financial enterprises have faced the complex and severe external environment and the impact of the epidemic. They have withstood the test and bravely shouldered heavy responsibilities. They have been successful in winning the battle against poverty and promoting high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. It has made important contributions in building a new development pattern, promoting high-quality development, coordinating epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development, and has made new progress in building a sports power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback seriously pointed out the outstanding problems existing in the fields of state-owned enterprises, finance and sports. Some fail to implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, do not have a deep understanding of the responsibilities and missions they shoulder, and have gaps in their performance of duties; some do not coordinate development and safety, have weak risk awareness, and have insufficient prevention and control mechanisms; some implement party management The responsibility for party governance is not in place, the pressure transmission is decreasing layer by layer, the implementation of the strict tone is weak, the integrity risks of key positions such as &quot;top leaders&quot; are relatively prominent, the problem of &quot;depending on the enterprise to take advantage of the enterprise&quot; is common, the &quot;four styles&quot; problem is prominent, and it violates the eight central regulations Mental problems still occur; there are weak links in the construction of some leadership groups and cadre talent teams, and the political functions of grassroots party organizations need to be strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback requires that the inspected units should thoroughly study Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, conscientiously study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech when he listened to the inspection report, and fully implement the deployment of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Uphold and strengthen the party&#39;s leadership, firmly establish and practice a correct view of political performance, completely, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, adhere to functional positioning, focus on main responsibilities and main businesses, and promote high-quality development. It is necessary to resolutely implement the political responsibility to prevent and resolve major risks, establish bottom-line thinking and extreme thinking, comprehensively sort out and investigate hidden risks, plug leaks and fill gaps, resolve risks and recover losses, and effectively safeguard national interests. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the &quot;two responsibilities&quot; of comprehensively and strictly governing the party, strengthen the effectiveness of supervision of &quot;top leaders&quot;, intensify the investigation and handling of corruption cases, seriously correct the &quot;four styles&quot; problem, deepen the use of cases to promote reform, use cases to promote treatment, and integrate We dare not, cannot, or do not want to be corrupted. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the party&#39;s organizational line in the new era and effectively strengthen the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feedback emphasized that inspections and rectifications should be more serious and tough, and the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere should be passed on and carried out consistently. The inspected party organization must resolutely shoulder the political responsibility for rectification. The &quot;top leader&quot; is the first person responsible for rectification. Other members of the team must conscientiously perform &quot;one post, two responsibilities&quot;, strictly compare feedback opinions, and establish a problem list, task list, and responsibility list. Combining the problems found during the inspection with the theme education inspection issues and the problems that were not rectified in the last inspection, rectify the system and rectify the whole body, practice the &quot;two maintenances&quot; with practical actions, and reflect the loyalty and responsibility with the rectification results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The feedback requires that the responsibilities of all parties for rectification should be consolidated and efforts should be made in the same direction to solve the problem. Discipline inspection and supervision agencies must strengthen daily supervision of rectification, focus on key issues, focus on specific people and specific matters, strengthen on-the-spot inspections, grasp the real situation, and seize examples of those who deal with perfunctory or false rectifications and seriously hold accountable them. The organizational department should strengthen research and guidance based on the inspection situation, and promote the solution of outstanding problems in the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. Relevant functional departments must comprehensively make full use of the inspection results, strengthen daily supervision of common and deep-seated problems reflected in the inspection, deepen reforms in key areas, optimize policy supply, and improve systems and mechanisms. Inspection agencies must strengthen overall coordination and supervision, establish and improve rectification work mechanisms, and report important situations to the Party Central Committee in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the Central Inspection Team has also received clues about problems reported by some leading cadres, and has transferred them to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission, the Organization Department of the Central Committee and other relevant parties for handling in accordance with relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访胡歌：如果不做演员，生活里的我应该什么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257715]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Throughout September, Hu Ge’s work was fully scheduled. He had just attended related activities at the Venice Film Festival, and then flew back to Beijing to attend the premiere of the movie &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/i696A6YUsdAgCij7tPH3N2q1voWbuMVhpkbNsLQz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/i696A6YUsdAgCij7tPH3N2q1voWbuMVhpkbNsLQz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Ge (left) and &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; director Liu Jiayin at a business dinner at the Shanghai International Film Festival in June 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to promote this low-cost literary film, Hu Ge traveled to seven cities in nine days, non-stop to Group after group of viewers shared their feelings about the male protagonist Wen Shan. He said: &quot;When I meet a character I like, I am not playing him, but becoming him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film&#39;s director Liu Jiayin expressed his &quot;jealousy&quot; of Hu Ge: &quot;This character is obviously mine. But I feel like you understand him better than I do. Now I understand that the extra thing is yourself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan is nearly forty years old and was once a failed entrepreneur. The screenwriter, because he believes that &quot;ordinary people can also be the protagonist&quot;, has never been able to write a script that satisfies Party A. Over time, he gradually lost confidence in himself and gave up this career. The character that he could not write became a part of his heart, transforming into a boy named Xiao Yin, who often jumped out of his mind to talk to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wen Shan was in school, he liked to go to funeral parlors and zoos to take notes on his life, which later became a habit. After his life fell into embarrassment, he accidentally found a new job - writing articles for clients to commemorate their deceased relatives and friends. After completing an article, he could get 4,000 yuan, which could just cover his room and board expenses in the suburbs of Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan always wears baggy clothes that have been washed too many times. He is habitually hunched over and has long hair that covers his eyes. He cuts his nails frequently because of typing all the time. He likes to buy large buckets of mineral water and directly Lift it up and drink. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first glance, there is not much connection between the frustrated Wen Shan and Hu Ge himself, except that the latter has also come into contact with many screenwriters at work. Hu Ge told the Southern Weekend reporter with some regret: &quot;This industry is sometimes quite abnormal. Unless the screenwriter is a big shot, he has almost no power of expression. Most of the time, he can only wait to be evaluated, without even a chance to refute. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Ge’s eyes, Wen Shan is a person who is unwilling to compromise. It’s not that he doesn’t know how to write (scripts) to gain favor, but he is unwilling to do things he doesn’t want to do. &quot;I hope to be such a person, but often I can&#39;t. I envy him very much.&quot; Hu Ge said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, Hu Ge suddenly disclosed the news of getting married and having a daughter on Weibo. It quickly became a hot search list and there were constant discussions on the Internet. He did not hesitate to share the joy of becoming a father for the first time: &quot;When I held my daughter for the first time, it was like holding a piece of tofu. I was afraid that I would break her if I shook her.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Get married and have children. I have considered this before, but never took action. I made this decision after playing the role of Wen Shan. This role brought me a lot of changes and influence. After playing this role, I have a lot of confidence to do it. I think it’s a choice that should be made,” Hu Ge told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years after his debut, Hu Ge is no longer a young guy like Li Xiaoyao in &quot;Legend of Sword and Fairy&quot;, but closer to Mei Changsu who narrowly escaped death in &quot;Nirvana in Fire&quot;. Attentive viewers will find that whenever the shots of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; show a close-up of Hu Ge, the scar on his right eye is clearly visible. He has already been able to face the impact of the car accident in 2006. In the first two or three scenes after the car accident, Hu Ge used his bangs to cover the scar, but then he let it go: &quot;If I can&#39;t pass this test myself, how can I let others accept it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;After works such as &quot;Nirvana in Fire&quot; and &quot;The Pretender&quot;, the audience began to pay attention to Hu Ge&#39;s acting skills, and he decided to &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;put down some of his current work and concentrate on experiencing life.&quot; After a few years, &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; may be regarded as Hu Ge&#39;s answer. With this film, he won the Best Actor Award at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. At the award ceremony, he said: &quot; When an actor truly falls in love with a character, he will give himself completely to the character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/26/m0wYwiSsUoiV4OaxXvNhtGAIoiNsQ4VHZX5MklBS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 26/m0wYwiSsUoiV4OaxXvNhtGAIoiNsQ4VHZX5MklBS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Ge rests at the closing ceremony of the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival district. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One afternoon in mid-September 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend interviewed Hu Ge via online connection , the original interview time was only half an hour, but Hu Ge said: &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, I am willing to chat more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Hu Ge&#39;s self-report:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;He has me in him The Firmness That Is Not Possessed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; talks about ordinary people, allowing many viewers to see themselves in it. (I) traveled to seven cities to do road shows, and the audience was willing to share their own experiences of facing the death of relatives and friends when communicating. This is where I can most empathize. This script has many intersections with my own life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, my mother passed away, and I wrote the eulogy myself. So when I first read the script, I was not Wen Shan, but one of his clients. I still haven&#39;t fully recovered from this experience, and it will take me a long time to accept the end of my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this, I had never thought that there were people like Wen Shan in my life. In our traditional culture, we seem to be very shy about talking about death and the end of life. Therefore, when a loved one passes away, it is usually difficult to find someone to share and talk to. This script gave me a warm feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan has another meaning to me. In current terms, he is an &quot;i person&quot; (Editor&#39;s note: a result of the MBTI personality test that has become popular in recent years, and &quot;e person&quot; ” In contrast, the two are approximately equivalent to introverts and extroverts respectively), introverts. He is not good at expressing himself or getting along with others. To be honest, the real me may be such a character. But he has a firmness that I don&#39;t have, and he won&#39;t change his choices because of external evaluations and so-called worldly standards. This is something I envy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw in him a part of myself that I couldn’t achieve, my ideal look, and I really wanted to be him. Even though he is not a person with a strong sense of presence, he is still very dignified at heart. This kind of axis is a kind of courage, persistence and courage to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an i person at heart, but I don’t look like me. This may have something to do with my career and environment. As an i person, Wenshan is more able to stick to his own choices, but I often can&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a screenwriter, Wen Shan seems not to be that successful, not because of ability, but because of choice. He insists on his own aesthetic and is unwilling to change his creative direction. Throughout his career, he had almost no opportunity to express himself, and his works were always rejected by others before he could complete them. But what is rare is that he never said that he must seek the approval of others. This is an inner persistence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point in Wen Shan’s life was that by chance, he got the job of writing eulogies for others. Although this job is completely different from being a screenwriter, they are both creating with words. At work, Wen Shan found a sense of identity. This did not mean that everyone praised him for writing well, but that he used his kindness and sincerity to influence others through constant communication. For example, Mr. Wang in the film re-understood his deceased father through Wen Shan&#39;s eulogy. This is the meaning of Wen Shan&#39;s work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pf6D5BNM6E4lSzTB57y1Lxai5d60id3WlXYJbTCa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pf6D5BNM6E4lSzTB57y1Lxai5d60id3WlXYJbTCa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the movie &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, the son of client Mr. Wang reveals his secret to Wen Shan (right), played by Hu Ge, and Wen Shan discovers the mutual relationship between the family. The love without words. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I don’t think the main thing expressed in &quot;A Worthwhile Journey&quot; is death. Writing Death is about how we write life. Wen Shan has gone from being a screenwriter to writing eulogies. He is using his pen to create characters and write other people&#39;s stories. Looking back, we are writing our own lives with our daily lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People will change at every stage, but it has nothing to do with specific age, but has to do with experience. In 2019, my mother passed away, and then we went through another three years of the epidemic and saw a lot of separation and death. In this process, I think not only me, but many people will think more about life. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Most people are the protagonists&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What do you mean by ordinary people? Ordinary people are not particularly mediocre people as usually understood, but relative to those who have the aura of the protagonist. The latter often have particularly strong dramatic conflicts and many miracles happen in their lives. But ordinary people are the majority in life. It is difficult to meet people like the protagonists of idol dramas in our lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film emphasizes that &quot;ordinary people can also be protagonists&quot;, which means that most people are protagonists. Our definition of success seems to be too standardized, and everything has become very utilitarian. In fact, everyone&#39;s trajectory is different. Sometimes if we set our vision and goals too uniformly, it is easy to miss the truly important things in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For individuals, we are already in our own story and in our own growth trajectory. Of course you are your own protagonist. Why do you have to treat yourself as a supporting role? (Why) Do we have to call the character who conforms to the so-called concept of success the protagonist? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am a person who is often easily entangled, and my inner self is very close to that of Wen Shan. It is just because of my various good luck that my life is like an idol drama. From the inside, I do have question marks about my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan is different from the characters I have portrayed in the past. Almost all characters have the aura of the protagonist. Even if they have some flaws, they must have particularly powerful abilities. They are the so-called &quot;tragic heroes&quot; &quot;. In the past, when I created characters, I was doing additions. I had to superimpose various abilities on my body to reach the character. But this time I was doing subtractions. I needed to take off all the things attached to my body and return to my original self. To put it simply, if I don’t become an actor, what should I be like in life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time I did not deliberately design any actions. When I created Wen Shan, I was not trying to play this character, but to become him. Therefore, I did not use any special external methods, but got close to the character first. In my heart, other things are just a natural expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Yin is the mirror image of Wenshan&#39;s heart. As a listener, Wenshan is lonely and can rarely find someone to talk to. He has to learn to get along with himself. The existence of Xiao Yin is to use a special way to show how lonely people get along with themselves, so that at least he is not lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MC2AiDpZGMtuM4xiW492lOe04yepgJnApFZGdZ0L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MC2AiDpZGMtuM4xiW492lOe04yepgJnApFZGdZ0L.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the movie &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, Wen Shan (left) played by Hu Ge and his inner Xiao Yin (right, played by Wu Lei). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The really sad thing is that lonely people have to endure loneliness. Loneliness but not loneliness is a relative ideal state. Xiao Yin is the more active and bold part of Wen Shan&#39;s heart, but this side has been suppressed, and there has always been self-confrontation and entanglement in his heart. Xiao Yin has been pushing Wenshan to face reality more bravely. In the end, Xiao Yin disappeared, which meant that Wenshan found the confidence to continue writing as a screenwriter, allowing Xiao Yin to return to the script world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am afraid that there is more than one Xiao Yin in my body, and there are often some small divisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The actor is a gorilla in the zoo&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wen Shanhui often observes the surrounding environment and people, and takes notes on life. The two most important scenes in the film are the funeral parlor and the zoo. Wherever Wen Shan loves to go, he can quietly observe the people and things around him. I may also have a so-called occupational disease. I like to observe the people I meet. It doesn’t mean that I have to find some characters for reference after I play a certain role. It’s just like Sherlock Holmes, when I see an unknown person in front of me. As I walk by, I can&#39;t help but guess about the other person&#39;s career history and family relationships, and imagine what this person was doing just now and what he has experienced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not used to labeling past roles. Every role is meaningful to me. It is said that film and television are the art of regret, and there is no way to do it again, but I will often reflect on it. Whenever I finish playing a role, I will think about where I did not perform well. Maybe I am not that confident. Even if others say how good I am, I will still find faults with myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading the script of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, I started an online exchange with director Liu Jiayin that lasted for half a year. During that time, I had been on the set of &quot;Flowers&quot; and had to start work basically every day. I could only communicate with director Liu Jiayin through WeChat. The first time we met was the day when the makeup was set, and I had already joined the set and started working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have worked with so many directors, and each one has a different working method and a different way of communicating with actors. I think that for a director, how to inspire and guide actors is a special aspect of their work. important part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Kong Sheng will give actors a lot of space. He may give you a general direction, and then he will hand over the specific performance method to the actors with confidence. Director Jiang Wei is also a very good screenwriter. All the lines in his script cannot be adjusted, and even the modalities are very accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My feeling about Director Wong Kar-Wai is different from what some media reported before. His previous movies may not have had a particularly specific direction during the filming process, but this time I feel that he knows exactly what he wants. , will also express it very concretely. Of course, sometimes he will also ask you to make breakthroughs. If you can give him an unexpected spark, that is, a better improvisational performance, he will also appreciate it very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, the characters are bottles of different shapes and the actors are water. Every time he enters a different role, the actor becomes something different. So the performance is fluid, and the water is fixed into a shape after entering the bottle. I think what the director needs most is the flowing moment. From an artistic point of view, this moment is the most beautiful expression, not the fixed look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For actors, many times they forget how to keep a straight face on life because they become famous. It is very important to look at life with a straight face. Forgetting where you come from is a particularly fatal thing. When you are not acting or working, you return to life and forget about your career and identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I envy the kind of life where I can get rid of my identity as an actor, so when I have nothing to do, I always want to go somewhere far away. Every time I go to Qinghai to volunteer, some netizens say that I go to pick up garbage or something. In fact, I just want to wash myself and wash away some things that are not part of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times people have imaginations about actors, often with character filters, thinking that we are different from ordinary people. When you leave your career as an actor and return to life, the things I deal with on a daily basis are nothing more than the cat being sick today, the wall falling off tomorrow, the hot water in the bathroom not being hot... these constitute the In life, facing these daily routines, I often feel that my abilities are limited and I am not as good as many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I often think that actors are like gorillas in a zoo, and their every move is under everyone&#39;s attention 24 hours a day. Many times, everyone projects their own curiosity, scrutiny and supervision on the actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once thought about breaking out of this cage, no longer staying in this zoo, and wanted to run into the street. But you have to know that when the orangutans are in the zoo, they are separated by cages. If they run out on the street, they may receive more attention. Wouldn’t they be chased and intercepted?

Moreover, if there are many people and there are many people, will there be a situation where &quot;the law does not punish everyone&quot;? How does the law identify those who play a major role in cyber violence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 25, 2023, the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Punishing Illegal Crimes of Internet Violence in accordance with the Law&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Guiding Opinions&quot;), pointing out that cyber violence For illegal crimes, we must &quot;correct the erroneous tendency of &#39;the law does not punish the public&#39;&quot; and focus on cracking down on malicious initiators, organizers, malicious promoters and those who refuse to change despite repeated admonitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The guidance is clear: when the targets are minors and disabled people; organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to implement; fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics; use generative AI technology to publish illegal information; If a network service provider initiates or organizes any of these five situations, cyberviolence perpetrators must be severely punished. According to Yao Jia, a professor at the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, this represents the attitude towards controlling illegal and criminal acts of online violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Category of cyber violence for the first time&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Cyber ​​violence refers to the behavior of insulting others, spreading rumors and defamation, and invading privacy in cyberspace. It is not a legal concept, so when it comes to online violence, what are the crimes related to it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This issue is listed in the guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three categories related to the perpetrators of cyber violence: creating and spreading rumors on the Internet, derogating others&#39; personalities and damaging others&#39; reputations. If the circumstances are serious, they will be convicted of defamation; those who resort to wanton abuse, malicious slander, and disclosure privacy and other methods, openly insulting others, and if the circumstances are serious, they will be convicted of the crime of insult; organizing &quot;human flesh searches&quot; to illegally collect and release citizens&#39; personal information to an unspecified majority of people, and if the circumstances are serious, they will be convicted of the crime of infringing on citizens&#39; personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are malicious marketing and hype behaviors carried out through cyber violence incidents, which are subject to the crime of illegal use of information networks; network service providers who do not act on the information discovered about cyber violence crimes may be liable to This constitutes the crime of refusing to perform information network security management obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yao Jia&#39;s view, this guidance classifies online violence for the first time, &quot;at least it makes it a lot clearer&quot; and also emphasizes which behaviors may constitute crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, &quot;After the guidance is issued, cyber violence will certainly not be completely solved.&quot; Yao Jia believes that in practice, cyber violence incidents may involve the intersection of multiple behaviors, and judicial agencies, Law enforcement agencies should strengthen the identification of causal relationships and corresponding damage in cyber violence. In addition, the responsibilities of other social entities also need to be clarified. For example, when cyber violence occurs on campus, the school should also be an important player in participating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the guidance, the boundary between online violence and freedom of speech is also proposed: to report and expose other people’s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks, as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly If the facts are fabricated and spread intentionally, they should not be considered as defamation. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Clear standards for public prosecutions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Criminal Law stipulates that, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests, crimes of insult and defamation are “dealt with upon complaint.” crime. In other words, most of the time, this type of crime requires the victim to collect evidence to file a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, among the 587 criminal defamation cases concluded by courts across the country, 271 cases, accounting for 46%, were not accepted, and only 79 cases were judged, accounting for less than 14%. Among them, only guilty verdicts were 43 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a set of data provided by Zhou Jiahai, deputy director of the Supreme Law Research Office, at a press conference on the afternoon of September 25, 2023. He said that in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of criminal cases involving insults and defamation, but the proportion of guilty verdicts is very low. Zhou Jiahai believes that this is due to the difficulty faced by private prosecutors in collecting evidence. On the other hand, it is also related to the lack of detailed guidance and &quot;too high a threshold&quot; for public prosecution standards in criminal cases of insult and defamation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defamation case of a woman who picked up a courier in Hangzhou in July 2020 is a rare case that has been converted from private prosecution to public prosecution. It was listed as one of the top ten legal supervision cases of the year by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as Zheng Jingjing, the victim’s attorney, saw this guidance, she noticed the clauses detailing the circumstances of “seriously endangering social order” in the crime of insult and defamation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the situations is that &quot;the general public is arbitrarily targeted, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously damaging the order of the Internet, and having a negative impact on society.&quot;—— This situation is almost completely consistent with the defamation case involving the courier woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the press conference, Li Wenfeng, deputy director of the Legal Policy Research Office of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, said in response to reporters&#39; questions that the guidance did draw lessons from the Hangzhou woman who was defamed while picking up express delivery when stipulating the prosecution standards for insult and defamation cases. case experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Jingjing recalled that when she represented the case, according to the judicial interpretation on the criminal offense of online defamation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2013, more attention was paid to whether the determination of &quot;seriously endangering social order and national interests&quot; It may cause crises in real life, such as mass incidents, public disorder, etc. Finally, the court used the blanket clause of “other situations that seriously endanger social order and national interests” as the legal basis for transferring private prosecution to public prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the release of the guidance, there are more detailed guidelines for the application of public prosecution procedures to crimes of online insult and defamation. In addition to the above-mentioned situation, there are three other specific situations that cause bad social impact: serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives; insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times; organizing and instigating Personnel spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中秋节临近，广州的这条“灯笼街”充满中国人的节日浪漫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257661]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北京链家下调中介费率，买卖双方各担1%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257679]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 26, the reporter learned from Lianjia that Beijing Lianjia had recently lowered the agency fee standard and changed the order form The side commission is transformed into a bilateral commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Beijing link agency fee standard has been uniformly reduced from 2.7% to 2% of the total housing transaction price. On the other hand, the charging model has been changed from the unilateral payment of the agency fee by the buyer to a joint payment by the buyer and seller, with each buyer and seller bearing 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, on April 27 this year, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the State Administration for Market Regulation jointly issued a document to regulate real estate brokerage services. The document clearly states that real estate brokerage institutions should reasonably reduce the brokerage service fees for housing sales and leasing, and guide both parties to the transaction to share the brokerage service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Beijing Lianjia stated that this adjustment to the intermediary fee standards is Lianjia’s response to market changes, responding to ministry documents, proactively adapting to changes, and achieving stable development of the enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Housing Policy Research Center of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Urban Planning, said that under the guidance of the policy and combined with the current weak market trading sentiment, Beijing Lianjia has adjusted charging methods and standards, actively offered benefits to the market, and reduced Transaction costs boost market sentiment and confidence, which is a reflection of active response to national policy calls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia believes that Beijing Lianjia’s move will help reduce consumers’ home purchase costs, help expand the market size, better promote a virtuous cycle between new homes and second-hand homes, and promote the healthy and stable development of the real estate market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An intermediary from Beijing Lianjia told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that on the basis of lowering the agency fee standards and adjusting the charging model, his store currently has additional intermediaries for chain single customers and regular customers. There is a fee discount, that is, serial customers who sell and buy houses on Lianjia can get a 10% discount, and customers who have bought or rented a house on Lianjia in the past year can get a 9.5% discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang is a serial customer of Lianjia who sells old and buys new ones. She has just paid the down payment and agency fee for her new house. After learning that Lianjia had reduced agency fees, she contacted the house purchase agency on the morning of September 26, hoping to apply for a reduction in the agency fees she had paid. In response, Lianjia Intermediary responded that if the intermediary fee is lowered, it can apply, but it has not yet received a clearer answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang’s own house is still for sale and has not yet been sold. After Beijing Lianjia implements bilateral commission collection, she will also bear an agency fee of 1% of the total price. In this regard, she told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that if the seller needs to pay an intermediary fee when selling the house, she will add the intermediary fee to the total house payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang is not the only landlord who has similar ideas. Li Yujia said that theoretically, owners would have an incentive to pass on agency fees to housing prices, and this has also happened in the past. But whether it can be passed on, or how much it can be passed on, depends on the pricing of housing prices in the micro market. Second-hand housing is a highly decentralized and fully competitive market-oriented transaction. The market information is very transparent, and it is difficult to consider using information gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia believes that the current market competition situation is completely different from the past. The number of second-hand house listings in various places has reached a record high. Selling old and buying new, selling small and buying big, and asset transfer are very common. In more cases, owners Reasonable pricing, or even lowering the listing price, in order to sell the house as quickly as possible will make it difficult for the seller to transfer the agency fees to the buyer. If the seller passes the costs onto the house price, it is likely to affect the transaction efficiency of the house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianjia emphasized that Beijing Lianjia’s adjustment of intermediary rates is an independent adjustment by the company. As for whether other companies will follow suit, it is also the company’s independent market behavior. However, Lianjia is the leading intermediary institution in Beijing, and its adjustments will have a catalytic effect on other institutions and even the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia said that in fact, in most second-hand housing transactions in the world, the intermediary fees are shared by both parties, or the seller pays all costs. With the changes in supply and demand in the real estate market, some property owners in many places across the country have begun to be willing to share agency fees to facilitate transactions. In cities such as Chengdu and Dalian, bilateral charging has been implemented for more than ten years. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chongqing and other cities have also implemented bilateral tolling in recent years. It can be seen that this model has become more and more accepted by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 17:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[徐悲鸿 欲倾东海洗乾坤丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257692]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访15岁亚运冠军陈烨：“不要放弃，多去尝试”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257675]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/n6BzmUN9Dh6lZmOCtTVLbE7rL6I5BEPM9zP1aG3o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/n6BzmUN9Dh6lZmOCtTVLbE7rL6I5 BEPM9zP1aG3o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252196&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, champion Chinese player Chen Ye (middle) and runner-up Japan Contestant Yuro Nagahara (left) and third runner-up Japanese player Kensuke Sasaoka spin and jump at the award ceremony &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; , take the board, fly...

In the 2020 National Skateboarding Championships and the men&#39;s bowl pool event of the 2021 National Games, Chen Ye won second place; in the selection of the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games Skateboarding National Training Team, Chen Ye was selected with first place . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the preliminaries on September 24, Chen Ye&#39;s competition state was to seek breakthroughs in stability, and advanced to the finals with fourth place in the preliminaries. After the game, Chen Ye said that he would give it all in the finals and perform the most difficult moves, &quot;try to get into the top four, or even the top three.&quot; Facing a field filled with experts, Chen Ye competed with a learning mentality. Didn&#39;t put too much pressure on myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252192&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, Chen Ye in the finals&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the finals, Chen Ye continued to perform at a high level, breaking through the preliminaries in the first round, scoring 82.82 points, ranking first; in the second round, he set a new high score again, scoring 84.41 points, maintaining his advantage; In the last round, Chen Ye scored 80.62 points. Although it was not as good as the 84.00 points of Japanese player Yuro Nagahara in this round, he won the gold medal with the highest score of 84.41 points in the three rounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the media interviews and press conferences after the game, Chen Ye repeatedly thanked one person, his father Chen Wanqin. On the road to the championship, his father always supported him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye (right) and his father Chen Wanqin&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Father and son&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Learning that he won the championship After the news, Chen Ye excitedly put on the national flag, slid around the bowl with a bright smile, and waved to the audience. &quot;I didn&#39;t really think about anything at the time. I was just very happy and very excited.&quot; At the post-match press conference, Chen Ye sat upright in front of the stage and answered reporters&#39; questions unhurriedly with a slightly hoarse voice during the voice change period, acting like a Shy boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye emphatically thanked his father, &quot;He built two venues for me, thank him.&quot; Chen Ye only entered the national training team two months ago. Before that, he was his father. Chen Wanqin was guiding him. Skateboarding was only introduced to China at the end of the 20th century, and it was also relatively late to be listed as an Olympic sport. In 2016, the International Olympic Organizing Committee announced that skateboarding would be officially included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Therefore, when Chen Ye first came into contact with skateboarding, there were almost no professional players and professional coaches in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye fell in love with skateboarding by chance. On New Year&#39;s Day in 2016, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye to the sports mall. Chen Ye tried out the skateboard and liked it very much. Chen Wanqin said, &quot;I will take you to play when you want to play.&quot; A month later, Chen Ye He went to play every day, and Chen Wanqin bought him a skateboard. When Chen Ye persisted in playing for half a year, Chen Wanqin made up his mind to make skateboarding Chen Ye&#39;s longer-term hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with street skateboarding, Chen Ye prefers skating in bowls and pools. “It can fly higher and go faster.” When he first started practicing, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye on the Internet Find videos of skaters on the internet and practice whatever moves you’re interested in. Chen Wanqin&#39;s experience in learning dance allowed him to break down complex movements one by one and arrange Chen Ye&#39;s training in an orderly manner. They practiced at a public skatepark in Zhongshan City. At that time, there were very few people skateboarding. Most of the time, only the father and son were practicing. In order to communicate with more skateboarders, they would go to Hong Kong and Tokyo during holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2016, the International Olympic Committee voted to include skateboarding as an official event in the Tokyo Olympics. The mentality of father and son has quietly changed, from &quot;becoming a skateboard master&quot; to a more professional direction. It was also at this time that national skateboarding competitions began in China, and skateboarding was also included in the 2017 National Games. The first competition Chen Ye participated in was the 2018 &quot;U Series China Youth Skateboarding Tour&quot; and he won third place. They found that &quot;it turns out that if you practice like this, your skills are pretty good.&quot; Does that mean that as long as you work harder, you can achieve better results? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no professional bowl pool in Zhongshan City. The nearest bowl pool is in Guangzhou, which takes two hours from Zhongshan. In 2019, in order for Chen Ye to have a professional training venue near his home, Chen Wanqin made a bold decision to build his own bowl pool. Later in his self-report, Chen Wanqin said that he was afraid of failure before building the project. &quot;I was afraid that I would invest all the money and not be able to make it.&quot; He simulated it with 3D printing and then felt confident. &quot;At that time, I thought, just be I work for my dreams. If I fail, I will fail. Anyway, I don’t have much money saved.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Wanqin rented a warehouse of more than 200 square meters and about 4 meters high, and learned to saw wood. Start by building the structure of the bowl piece by piece. Half a year later, Wanchi was actually made. And Chen Ye lived up to his father&#39;s efforts, honing his movements and techniques to become increasingly sophisticated, and achieving a major breakthrough in Chinese skateboarding at the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Chen Wanqin built a larger and more comprehensive skatepark. While accompanying Chen Ye in training, he accumulated experience and became a professional skateboard coach to guide more skateboarders. Kids enjoy skateboarding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Chen Ye will continue to challenge a broader arena. After winning the Asian Games, Chen Ye admitted that he had no hope of participating in the Paris Olympics because &quot;the current speed and height are still not enough&quot;, but he will try to &quot;fly higher and accelerate faster&quot; during training and go to more places. The venue is slippery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1205&quot; height= &quot;855&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252193&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye is studying&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Conversation with Chen Ye&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said at the press conference, “When training, you should try to fly higher, accelerate faster, and overcome psychological obstacles. .&quot; So do you still feel scared when you skate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, if the speed (skating) is fast or very high, it is actually quite scary. When accelerating air (flying into the air), the faster the flying speed, the easier it is to shake and it is difficult to control. Should you jump in or out? It is also possible to jump very far and fall on the flat ground, which is a bit scary. It is necessary to accurately control the take-off position and landing position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then how do you overcome your fear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If you are afraid, start with the short one first and increase the height little by little.

If I cannot control it well at this time, it is possible It dropped so low that it hit my knees and feet. Wrestling is very common. When you first start practicing each action, you must &quot;practice&quot; wrestling first. This will be safer, otherwise you may be seriously injured if you fall. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You initially followed the video training on the Internet , but complex movements still require on-site observation and learning. What movements did you go to Tokyo to learn? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At first, my father and I watched some simple teaching videos, broke down slow motion, and tried to practice. I went to Tokyo to learn air, because at that time there were no professional bowl pools in China, and U-shaped pools were hard to come by. There was a 4-meter U-shaped pool in Tokyo, and there were many skateboarders, and you could watch their demonstrations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 980&quot; height=&quot;1709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252194&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye in daily training&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How long did it take you to practice to learn air? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the beginning, you grab the board to jump, and then you click on the board to jump. The most standard thing is to grab the board when you hit the pole. About half a year. There will definitely be boredom. It was okay when I was in Tokyo, there were more skaters practicing together, but there aren’t that many skaters back home. When the moves get boring, just change to another move. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You started skateboarding in 2016.

In 2019, in order to prepare for the National Games, my father built a bowl pond for me. The two of us decided to build it together. Because I participated in several competitions at that time and watched the performance of foreign players, I felt that if you want better results, you still need to have a professional venue. After building a professional venue, I felt that I should practice skateboarding seriously and professionally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your father said before that he took it out All your savings were used to build the bowl pool.

He wouldn&#39;t put too much pressure on me, just let me perform well during the competition, and he didn&#39;t say I must win any awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I asked about the training team training and father&#39;s training in the afternoon When talking about the difference, you said the styles are different.

The scene is crowded with pregnant women and expectant mothers. Obstetricians say: In order to allow their children to go to school a year earlier, many expectant mothers who have not yet reached their due date have given birth to &quot;school babies&quot; through caesarean section, which has become a common phenomenon in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents say: You will know when you have children! One day late, one year delayed! Some pregnant women have just completed 37 weeks of pregnancy (the standard pregnancy period is 40 weeks, 38-42 weeks is considered normal) and the baby is removed through a laparotomy. Manual intervention can advance the baby&#39;s birthday to before September 1, so that the baby can go to school at the age of 6. Parents hope that their children will be one step ahead of other children at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the fact is: there is no evidence that premature infants can win at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. Premature infants have not been seen to have an advantage in any human group, at any historical stage, or in any field. Not only that, but premature babies have a greater chance of being born with physical and mental deficiencies. Not only do they lose at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;, but they are also likely to fall behind step by step in life, lose for the rest of their lives, and even suffer from lifelong illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot; pointed out: Newborns between 39 and 41 weeks are considered full-term babies. In the absence of external factors, full-term babies have the greatest probability of being healthier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors generally advocate that caesarean section is not recommended unless it is difficult to deliver, and caesarean section is even more undesirable if the baby is less than three months old. Because any caesarean section carries risks for both the mother and the baby. There is a high probability that the child&#39;s lungs will not develop maturely, and premature babies are prone to accidents and stunted growth. For parturient women, performing a caesarean section before uterine contractions may result in incomplete uterine reduction and increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cesarean section when the baby is less than a month old or without signs of labor will also have varying degrees of psychological impact on the newborn. Child psychology research has found that children born by caesarean section have a significantly higher incidence of ADHD (ADHD) than children born naturally. They will develop symptoms of attention deficit, impulsivity, and hyperactivity later in life, which will affect learning and understanding for a long time (even lifelong). ability, while the situation of premature infants is even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Child psychologist Jean Piaget proposed the theory of &quot;stages of child development&quot;: at different ages, children&#39;s intellectual development grows gradually, and the order of each stage cannot be exceeded. Disruption, otherwise it will disrupt the normal development process of children&#39;s minds and even affect their adult personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old saying &quot;Children look the same every year&quot; is a simple summary of this objective natural law. Children aged 5, 6 and 7 are at different stages of psychological and intellectual development. Forcibly turning a child into a &quot;twisted melon&quot;, or even cutting it out of the mother&#39;s belly in advance, is &quot;stealing the seedlings&quot;, forcing the child to skip the normal development stage of life, forcing it to make a &quot;big leap forward in life&quot;, which not only affects the child&#39;s physical development It is unfavorable and will cause children under school age to be unable to keep up with their studies, resulting in low self-esteem and a dislike of learning. The outcome will most likely be counterproductive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous psychologist Gsell proved the &quot;maturity advantage theory&quot; through experimental data: through testing more than one hundred pairs of twins for many years, he found that regardless of race, gender, and regional differences, children with more mature development After training in a shorter period of time, you can get better learning results. It proves that a person&#39;s individual physical and mental maturity develops in an orderly and regular manner. Only when the individual matures, the learning effect will be better. Wait patiently, and when the time comes, the result will often be twice the result with half the effort in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a private group discussing &quot;school-starting babies&quot;, some netizens said: I went to kindergarten or school when I was a little young, and I was not welcomed by the teacher because I couldn&#39;t keep up with the progress, and I felt quite hurt inside; Some netizens said: I have regretted for half my life that I had a caesarean section in order to catch up with school in September. Little did I know that my child has resumed high school. After all the effort, I have given back all the stolen years. I, my husband, and my child are exhausted and scarred both physically and mentally. Tired...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some educationists have proposed that not only should children be born by caesarean section so that they can go to school early, but even full-term children born normally should not learn too early, but should ensure that children have enough education in childhood and adolescence. Play time. Play is not &quot;abstaining from one&#39;s duties&quot;, but an important way and stage for the normal and complete development of various brain areas in human childhood, the formation of imagination and creativity, the cultivation of curiosity and exploration spirit, and the shaping of personality and character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forcing children to read, read, and recite ancient poems too early will not only enhance the memory areas of the brain, but also suppress the excitement and development of imagination, creativity, exploration, adventurous spirit and other areas. As a result, I had a caesarean section and worked hard for my children in early childhood education. The result of the struggle in the first half of my life was to be a clerk, being assessed on KPIs with trepidation, and calculating how much more would be deducted from my already limited salary each month. And those &quot;bad boys&quot; who have more comprehensive minds, stronger personalities, and are more daring to think, venture and do become bosses and leaders... Assess your children&#39;s KPIs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In foreign countries, the standards for children&#39;s admission are relatively flexible. Many countries specifically select children for admission based on their actual development. In France, New Zealand, Australia and other countries, if a child prodigy who develops early and quickly is found, the school entry age can even be advanced to 5 years old. The regulations in the United States are 5-7 years old, and prodigies can enter school at the age of 5. It is usually very difficult for children to enter school again at 7 years old. Normal; South Korea stipulates that children can enter school at the age of 6, but the average child is still 7 years old. If the child grows and develops later, the school age can be pushed back further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, as early as 2017, the Ministry of Education had relaxed its policies at the policy level: it no longer imposed a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mandatory age limit for enrollment before September 1. In Hubei, Henan, Anhui and other places, the enrollment age has also begun to be &quot;relaxed&quot;, and &quot;flexible enrollment&quot; has gradually been realized, and the reforms have gradually become more reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As policies become more reasonable, people’s psychology must also keep up. They must treat themselves and their children’s lives more rationally, scientifically, objectively, and tolerantly, and view the world and life from a more modern and broader perspective. , don&#39;t make yourself and the child in your belly live too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
