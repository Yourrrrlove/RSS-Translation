He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before becoming an actor. work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren&#39;s voice came from the other end of the receiver. Like an old-fashioned man, he carefully confirmed the name of the newspaper and the reporter&#39;s name, and his tone sounded gentle and gentle. He is on vacation. When he is not working, he spends his time in the same way as ordinary people. He passes the time by watching anime such as &quot;Spells Come Back&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren may have been the actor with the broadest role map in the Chinese-language drama market. His images in movies and TV shows are so varied that it&#39;s jaw-dropping. In 2021, he dressed up in women&#39;s clothing, put on lipstick, and played the role of Mama Sang &quot;Baby&quot; in the highly acclaimed drama &quot;The Lights Are Coming&quot;. The character photo was published in Taiwanese newspapers, but no one reacted, &quot;It took two days to be discovered by others. Isn&#39;t this Wu Kangren!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 drama &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, he plays A pervert who is sexually harassed in the workplace has a female fan who is so angry that she wants to &quot;quit her fans&quot;. Wu Kangren is very calm about this. He told Southern Weekend reporters that he is not worried about the loss of fans of the drama and movies. &quot;The next role will be different.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These roles are a huge departure from the &quot;flower boy&quot; image he played early in his career. At the age of 27, he played Hana Takuya in the classic idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; - affectionate, broken, and in line with all the settings of a tragic male lead. But in the following years, he continued to break away from that image full of romantic arcs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, on the 54th Taiwan Golden Bell Awards stage, Wu Kangren took the stage as the award guest. Everyone looked at the thin actor with sunken cheeks and a bald head with some suspicion. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bald man?&quot; A barrage floated across the video. At that time, for the new drama, he lost weight to only 64 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become routine for him to adjust his body shape, skin color and accent according to the requirements of the role. Someone made an Excel polyline table of Wu Kangren&#39;s weight data from &quot;Termites&quot; to &quot;Love&quot; and found that his weight suddenly went up and down, showing a steep W shape. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him if he was not afraid of physical damage caused by drastic changes? He smiled and replied: &quot;I&#39;m still alive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fight&quot; is the key word that many people first think of when they mention Wu Kangren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Wu Kangren changed his appearance again in the Taiwanese drama &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; broadcast exclusively on Station B. He put on a Hawaiian shirt, revealing his dark skin, and became the 41-year-old frustrated middle-aged Gao Jiayue. As the eldest son in his family, he has been drifting away for a long time, running a restaurant named &quot;One Million&quot; with a rating of only 2.8 in Xiaoliuqiu. After several years of bleak business, his girlfriend couldn&#39;t bear the island life and cheated on him and left. His career went bankrupt, his love failed, and he tried to hang himself in a restaurant, but the rope broke. Dive to the bottom of the sea, take off your oxygen equipment, and prepare to drown yourself. He suddenly remembered that the oxygen equipment might be eaten by sea turtles and was not environmentally friendly, so he had no choice but to surface and returned home dejectedly to meet his family and have a &quot;long farewell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents ran a breakfast shop in Taipei to support their three sons. The mother struggled to endure her father&#39;s mental infidelity and continued to live under the same roof with resentment. The second son is an adopted son. He lives a regular life as an office worker and takes the initiative to take over the responsibility of taking care of his parents. The younger son is older and unmarried, and helps in the breakfast shop. The whole family is stuck in the inertia of the old life and is stuck in moving forward. Everyone is in a &quot;stuck moment&quot; in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren said that he doesn’t have much in common with the character, but as a peer of Gao Jiayue, he has also experienced Kaka moments in real life. &quot;What&#39;s the hardest time for an actor? The role you want to take is taken away, or people don&#39;t like your good performance when it comes out.&quot; Wu Kangren told a reporter from Southern Weekend. His response was simple and clear: keep eating, sleeping, and trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be a harvest year for Wu Kangren. Two of his films, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were screened at the film festival. Both films focused on the bottom class. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was filmed in Malaysia, with Wu Kangren playing a deaf-mute illegal immigrant. After getting off the plane, he intuitively felt the gap between him and the character. At first glance, he was a &quot;white and clean civilized person&quot;, while the character he played lived in a dirty place all day long. He began to starve and continued to bask in the sun until his skin was tanned by ultraviolet rays and the locals in the market stopped looking at him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 First Youth Film Festival, he won the best actor for this role. The organizing committee commented on his performance: &quot;Faced with unconventional character settings, Wu Kangren used all available physical resources such as expressions, body parts, movements, and eyes to perform, interpreting the emotions and emotions of the film extremely vividly. Hearing thunder in silence reflects the actor&#39;s great empathy for the character&#39;s situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren has a rare sense of relaxation. He has no agent or company and works for himself. Lasted nine years. There are no personal restrictions or team control. It&#39;s all up to you to decide what kind of scenes to take on, what roles to play, how much to talk to the media, and what the standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked a Southern Weekend reporter which episode of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; he had watched. After getting the answer, he conveyed his preferences as if he were a friend: &quot;Look further down, the back is really better. I really like it.&quot; I like it.&quot; Faced with the reporter&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; question, he also bluntly said: &quot;This question is too broad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the outside world, the different types of roles over the years have brought Wu Kangren Emboldened. But he said that when he was young, his sense of self-identity was very low and he felt that he was just a &quot;nobody&quot;. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before the age of 20. He worked as a rough laborer on construction sites, ran a street stall, and also worked in cafes and bars. Now that I am in my forties this year, the feeling of insecurity has subsided, and new questions have arisen in my heart. He said that in recent years, he feels that his life as an actor will not be too long, so he cherishes it more and increases the frequency of taking roles. This year, he has at least seven film and television works released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, he almost subconsciously revealed his expectations for his subsequent career. He said: &quot;I want to continue acting until I am old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot; In &quot;In This Lifetime&quot;, Wu Kangren plays Gao Jiayue, a frustrated middle-aged man. After his career went bankrupt and his love failed, he tried to commit suicide but failed and returned home in despair. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, Wu Kangren accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. The following is a self-narration compiled based on the interview content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the invitation from &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; At that time, I had just finished filming the movie &quot;May You Live Longer&quot; in Hong Kong. When I finished filming, I only weighed 53 kilograms, which was too light. So before joining the set of &quot;In This Life Time&quot;, I ate as much as possible and weighed 66 kilograms when I returned. Last year I went to Malaysia and Hong Kong to shoot a movie respectively. I was made thin and dark. I came back to play the role of Gao Jiayue, a kid who came back from the island. In fact, he looked quite similar. In addition, director Xu Zhaoren is here, and I also like the script. I knew beforehand that Brother Xixiang (Xi Xiang, who plays the father) and Sister Guimei (Yang Guimei, who plays the mother) would take the role, so I also wanted to act together in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director took the sad story very lightly, and made the sad things somewhat funny, even humorous. Gao Jiayue is a person who really wants to die. But if you take what Gao Jiayue said to his nephew, &quot;I jumped into the sea, I wanted to die, but I saw turtles again, and I was afraid that the turtles would eat my equipment and it was not environmentally friendly.&quot; People say that he must think you are lying or joking. But when the audience actually saw the picture, all this became no longer such a joke: it was true, he wanted to die. I think this is where life is ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is not about university knowledge. My own interpretation is, &quot;It would be good to grow this big in your lifetime.&quot; This sentence reflects a lot of feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When things don’t go as planned, it’s always a “stuck moment.” In our lives, sometimes things go against our expectations, and sometimes hard work may not necessarily pay off. This is a very cruel thing. You can’t get what you want, and you can get what you don’t want. How you can stabilize your mood, continue to live, continue to love the people around you, or make the people you love live happily is all a matter of subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people choose to escape, such as the parents in the play who have marital problems. Gao Jiayue came back to tell them not to continue evading. Some people tried to persuade them to make peace but not to leave. Gao Jiayue tried to persuade them to leave but not to make peace. Some people are always in his comfort zone, such as his two younger brothers, who complain about life but are unwilling to step out. How can a character like Gao Jiayue push them, but in such an annoying way? He has the courage to be hated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real-life family dramas are not as easy as genre dramas. It is very difficult to act in a very real-life way. We actors have been acting for so long and are very familiar with rhythm, technique, and movement. We are also very familiar with how to perform well on camera. But when we try too hard to show the good side, the sense of drama will be stronger and the audience can see it. Xu Zhaoren hopes to adapt it to life, so we revised the lines in the direction of life. Chatting with the director and imagining the characters every day before going on stage is actually very brain-burning and tiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is very well structured, and the relationship between everyone is clearly written. But we didn’t act according to the relationship between everyone in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We feel that we have put a lot of effort into it. In fact, at that time, I was so thin that I deliberately imitated Brother Xixiang. Since I wanted to play his son, did I have any similarities with him? We looked at his posture and sometimes imitated him in jumping and sitting. At that time, I had a lot of discussions with the director. Since you want to play a son and a brother, do you have the same attitude towards each family member, or is it a little different? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when you are getting along with your younger brother, you just love to bully him. How to bully him? The screenwriter will not teach you to hit them with your hands in the play. This kind of action must be designed by yourself. And it has to be connected to when you were a kid. The second brother in the play is not your biological brother. Your attitude towards your biological brother (reporter&#39;s note: third brother) may be different from that of the second brother. In fact, it is very subtle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the relationship with his father was not good in the script, but in fact when we acted it out, Brother Xixiang felt that he loved his eldest son the most because he was his first son. Child. It is a very straightforward way for parents to express their love for you verbally. Brother Xixiang’s method is the kind of love in which he scolds you the harshest and hits you the hardest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original way of quarreling with my father was to talk to each other, but now as the show continues, it has become that I can actually have a good chat with my father. You are a rebellious son, but you are always unwilling to take what adults say seriously, which means we are acting the other way around. So in the first episode at the beginning, the father guarded the drunk Gao Jiayue from getting up, saying that he was afraid that you would spit it out and choke to death. Therefore, the relationship between Gao Jiayue and his father was not a quarrel at the beginning, but a show of weakness, that is, I was homesick and came back to see it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the script, there is no drinking in the scene of returning home. We discussed with the director and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of state Gao Jiayue was in before he dared to step into this home again. A failed person, a person who is unwilling to start over, a person who dares not face himself again, but is so arrogant and thinks that I will succeed when I go out to start a business, and then returns to this home penniless, at this time, what should I do? How to do it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what I thought of was, otherwise we would have a drink, and he would have to get himself drunk before he dared to return to this house shamelessly. In the end we decided to use this method. How on earth would he face the truth? You can only get yourself drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that scene, I really drank sorghum wine. I&#39;m not that good at drinking, but I drank in a situation that I could control. After filming, I fell asleep, and the actors called it a day, leaving me alone on set. When I woke up, the only thing left was the lighting crew taking out the lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Wu Kangren&#39;s film and television image has been very varied, and he has played many impressive supporting roles. In 2023, he will have at least seven film and television works released. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At that time, I only wanted to take supporting roles&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;In recent years, Taiwanese dramas have become more varied in genre. Since they are so varied, of course actors have the opportunity to be varied. They just complement each other, from early idol dramas to later craftsman dramas, police and gangster movies, ghost movies, and now back to life. It&#39;s a big test for actors. You can&#39;t use your past skills to perform every play. When you encounter different plays, you have to make different adjustments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no particular pursuit to play various types of characters, I just want to accumulate different acting experiences. It should be said that I think the life of an actor will not be too long. I dare not say that for everyone. I think it is a question mark in my mind how long an actor can act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in my early 30s, I began to realize this, which may have something to do with my upbringing. In the past, my self-identity was not so high. The so-called self-identity refers to self-confidence and even the value of existence. You may feel that you are just a nobody, a child who grew up on a construction site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I really felt that I could only work hard, otherwise what would I do? That’s why I got so many roles later. The reason I take on so many roles is not because I want to make a lot of money. In Taiwan, I can’t make much money from film remuneration. I hope that within a limited time, I can see my own possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after I turned 35, I started to play different roles quite quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She and Her Her&quot;, &quot;The Lights Come on&quot; and &quot;Mom, stop making trouble!&quot; ” were probably all filmed at the same time, and during that time I only wanted to take on supporting roles. Because I think the burden of the protagonist is too heavy. The protagonist sometimes shoots for three or four months at a time. He is always immersed in a role or a long period of work. He is very tired and easily tired. I might as well play a supporting role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the epidemic was also going on at that time, I felt that filming supporting roles could be more fun and not be so stressful. You may say it&#39;s good to have more fun, but I have also reviewed it myself and found that those characters were really overplayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her and Her Her&quot; was a guest appearance to help, and I didn&#39;t think too much about it, because the role had to be played in a perverted way. I remember that the producer and director couldn&#39;t find anyone at that time, so they called me later. I had some friendship with the producer, so I went to help. I didn&#39;t want to attract everyone&#39;s attention, I just went to serve, serve. That role. I&#39;m not worried about losing the audience. The next role will be different. I&#39;ve never worried about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The First Light&quot; is another story. It was really because of good luck. I had a good role as the &quot;baby&quot; and he had a lot of space. He found me only after the filming started. I was free at that time and even Director Yi Qi asked you to act, and I said yes. I said you have to give me time to prepare, because I need to find a teacher to practice high heels and dance. In fact, we prepared everything in private, chatting with those drag queens, eating and drinking with them, and imitating their looks and voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So sometimes taking a role is not so calculated, sometimes it’s just a feeling, because the director is right, I go because the script is right, I go because there are certain actors, or I feel that If it helps this drama, I will do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When you are not acting, you are just a nobody&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In This Lifetime&quot; has helped me a lot in my life. I&#39;m really lucky to be able to film &quot;In This Life Time&quot; at this age. Xu Zhaoren is a very good director, and it is very difficult to perform his scenes well. It was the third time I worked with him that this time I seriously felt that I might actually have done a good job. In the past, I didn&#39;t feel like I was able to add points to his dramas, but this drama did a little bit, and I felt like I was finally worthy of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, I take myself very seriously. Sometimes the success of a drama is the result of the team, sometimes it is the credit of the marketing, and sometimes it is the accumulation of credits between the characters. It is absolutely impossible to do it because of one person. Man, this drama is hit or miss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always been confident in my life as an actor. The so-called confidence means that I am willing to do it, not that I am very good. This is a concept. In the past, it was a very simple and clear thing to work hard and be rewarded. This thing has a profound impact on me. If you work, work hard, and sweat for the construction site, you will get the salary you deserve. This is a must-have condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And be responsible. You really have to do your job well, otherwise the boss will scold you, fire you, or ask you to pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting is the same for me. Sometimes why you are so fat and why you are so thin is because no one has done it, and no one knows what can be gained from it. I want to know what I can gain from the state of mind of being hungry or obese. I think this is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard for you to tell others that I was hungry for 4 months from May to August last year. From &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; to &quot;May I Live Longer&quot;, I lost 53 kilograms. I was so hungry. , how I lived. People just say, wow. But it’s not because my character has to be so thin that you can see how great I am, no. It’s about putting the characters there and seeing the finished product in the end. Even if the movie doesn&#39;t go well, people will think you&#39;re just thin, so what&#39;s the big deal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because you will really experience it after you do it. We are not like the protagonist of the anime. Why is he almost defeated in the end and still able to wake up? Because he thinks about his family and friends. Like Luffy in &quot;One Piece&quot; and Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he suddenly doesn&#39;t know where he came from. strength. We are human beings, and we still have our own limits. Limits can only be reached through self-examination again and again. If people don&#39;t make mistakes, they won&#39;t know that they will make mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was acting, I often made mistakes, and I still make them now. It&#39;s just that sometimes someone will correct your mistakes, sometimes not, but I always hope to meet a director who can deny you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of each actor is different. Some talented actors need to retain their energy. I consider myself to be mediocre and I need to accumulate that energy. The growth process of each actor cannot be compared. Since it cannot be compared, there is no repetition. The lack of repetition means that only I understand what I am going through, and you will not understand. Only after each finished product comes out will you see the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an actor is not acting, you are just a nobody. At most, you will be exposed to fashion or commercial performances, and you will see the glamorous star appearance. In fact, if you take away those appearances, who you really are is very vague. Celebrities have a popular persona, and that persona is the persona that the audience likes, because now everyone likes to see good things, kind people, and even people with high moral standards. The actor&#39;s appearance is very blurry, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being blurry, it&#39;s just a different experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always felt that actors are people living in the past, and the works you see are all me from the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acting has never been free&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, I have always felt that my work experience, having worked 50 jobs before I was 20, was not of much help to me. big. The accumulation of work experience is very life-like, but sometimes drama does not require you to perform life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;Copycat&quot;. It is a genre drama, and genre dramas are not life-like. If you want to stick to a life-like performance and conform to the rhythm of the camera and the director, when should you react? This is the pull between you and yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing Guo Xiaoqi in &quot;Copycat&quot; was very difficult for me, very difficult, extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The skeleton of the genre drama is better written, but the portrayal of the characters may not be outstanding. Because it serves a crime and captures the real culprit, it takes the audience to see the reaction of each character. After watching it, the protagonist is actually empty. The so-called empty means that you can only accumulate some plots to serve the audience. How to put your own human flavor into it requires a lot of thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you want to play him very smart, but you don’t want to play him too handsome, a little quirky, but you don’t want to make him too mythical. If you just look at the ferocity of the supporting characters, the main character will easily disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;Copycat&quot; is about using all the things accumulated in the past into one film, &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is about forgetting all the things that I know. This is a transition between very skillful and unskillful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting has never been free. How can acting be free? Acting is very scientific, including lenses, camera positions, performances, types, and even opponents. Acting is very unfree but very organic. Any situation may affect the whole body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called lack of freedom is that you cannot perform exactly the way you want, sometimes because of the orientation of the camera, sometimes because of the rhythm, sometimes because of the opponent actor, and sometimes because of what the character wants to present. situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do you think you have to take on so many roles? Because I think acting is a very passive profession, I just hope to put some of my own initiative into acting work in a passive situation as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The passivity of an actor is to be chosen. You will be there only after the script is written. If the script is not written, you will not exist. You may just act in another play. What space is there to be able to choose and take the initiative? That means to become thinner or fatter, to make the character more internal or more external, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter what method you use, show your initiative. Those initiatives will affect the director&#39;s thoughts on the character, or the character can have a chemical reaction with other actors. This is the initiative that I think is valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s what acting is, you bring out your own life experience. If you don&#39;t have this life experience, you need to rely on a lot of field research and investment. Except for a few who can&#39;t do it, others can rely on self-study and hard work to accumulate the short one or two seconds on the screen to deceive everyone and say that I look like me. But when you go deeper, whether the performance is good or bad depends on each actor&#39;s own interpretation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, I like many senior actors, such as Mr. Li Xuejian from Mainland China, who can act at that age, or Mr. Jin Shijie, etc. Actors who grew up in Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Tony Leung Ka Fai, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Nick Cheung Ka Fai, and Andy Lau, each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas, leaving his own place. But for me, that kind of accumulation is very difficult. If I follow the current pace of actors, I will never be able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nine years without an agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had an agent for about nine years. In the early years, I was still looking for one, but because of one job after another Come, I will keep acting. If there is a job, I will take it, if I get it, I will act, and if I act, I will go on stage. If someone says hello, I will applaud. I will say thank you, and I will keep acting like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four or five years, it seems that people (agents) no longer come to me. They seem to think that I can do this. But in fact, I am very busy and have many things to deal with, including contracts and work. Time, schedule. I haven&#39;t taken on so many commercial projects, and shooting commercials isn&#39;t too complicated. Relatively speaking, my acting life is pretty simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I feel that every decision I made before was good. I did not sign for a big company, but signed for a small company, and I will live a happier life. Later, he left the protection of his original agent, and finally became an agent by himself for no apparent reason. I also have to be an assistant and carry my own bag, which contains travel supplies and stomach medicine. Be your own driver and drive to the scene, finish work by yourself, and borrow clothes by yourself. There are things to do and things not to do. There are some jobs that you can choose, and there are some jobs where you don’t have to make this money. If you don’t make this money, you won’t have so many burdens and baggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an actor, and what we talk about is what actors do. In fact, I rarely talk about conditions, because if you talk about conditions, it will be complicated and waste a lot of thought. Being able to act well is the first condition. I&#39;m not a person who likes to compare. I don&#39;t compare myself to actors of the same age and tell them what they are like. If you don&#39;t think about it, nothing will happen. If you think about it, something will happen. You feel you are at a disadvantage because you have a value standard and judgment: my salary must be so high, or my conditions must be so high. If you don&#39;t have this value standard, there is no such thing as suffering a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, last year&#39;s &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were both very low-cost movies, so why were they filmed? Because I like the script of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, I want to try to go out and experience life. Different environments will have different sparks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did go, it was very worthwhile, and I made a great movie. &quot;May I Live Longer&quot; is from Hong Kong, so it&#39;s the same. I just read the script and said I would go. I didn’t talk about where I would live, and I didn’t even talk about my salary. The producer was surprised and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask about the price?&quot; I said I don’t need to ask about the price, just call the contract. He called over the contract and it was this price. I laughed. I know they don&#39;t have money. If I think I can accept it, I will go, and I will be very happy in my heart, and you will be very relaxed, because you have nothing to ask for, so you will go, just asking for a good performance in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to now, I don’t want everyone to think that because my life has become easier, I am not willing to make progress. I also hope to accumulate something. At least the stuff coming out this year is above the level, and I don’t want to deal with the performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard to say fate. It’s unlikely that you will have a breakthrough in every drama, really. This is a market. To survive in this market, we can only rely on each drama and how to play the role well after joining. In fact, there is not much that actors can do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清远一所学校七百多名新生退学，官方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:48:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School’s blind expansion of enrollment in the fall semester of 2023 without approval and replacement with online courses In the case of face-to-face teaching, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau has set up a city and county joint working group to station in the school, ordering the school to actively respond to the concerns of students and parents, conscientiously rectify problems, effectively safeguard students&#39; legitimate rights and interests, and ensure normal education and teaching order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School is a private secondary vocational school with 3,981 students currently enrolled (including: 1,215 in the 2021 grade, 837 in the 2022 grade, and 1,929 in the 2023 grade). After a preliminary investigation, it was found that the school expanded its enrollment without authorization, resulting in insufficient teaching staff and an inability to meet teaching needs, resulting in online classes replacing face-to-face classes. After supervision by the working group, the new teachers recruited by the school for the autumn semester have been gradually put in place, which basically meets the teaching needs. The online teaching problems have been rectified and the education and teaching order is normal. At present, the school has fully refunded the fees to 730 students who dropped out. The Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau guided the school to handle the registration and filing of student status for the 2023 freshmen in accordance with regulations, and urged the school to strengthen teacher training and management to ensure teaching quality. At the same time, in order to ensure that students can transfer to other schools in a timely manner, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau provides information on secondary vocational (technical) schools with surplus places in the city for students who have dropped out to apply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next step, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau will urge the school to speed up the implementation of rectifications and run the school in accordance with the law and regulations. At the same time, an investigation will be launched into the school’s illegal enrollment expansion in the fall semester of 2023 and will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 26, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2024国考大数据：先考公，还是先考研？丨一图读懂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259400]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https:// nfcms-cos02.infzm.com/__asset/e4daf879f3/24c0231f40.jpg?t=1698290703661&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（下）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259266]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/1O6gFp3jfetG9KS1ecdoaHUmtMhhrC1Xfl5P4qmW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/1O6gFp3jfetG9KS1ecdoaHUmtMhhrC1 Xfl5P4qmW. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255337&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The expansion of the United States in Asia and the Middle East&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The impact of the two Vietnam Wars on the United States was actually greater than that of the Korean War Even bigger. The United States lost about 4.5 million soldiers in the Korean War, which was unprecedented in American history; and the United States did not get any benefits from the two Vietnam Wars. The two Vietnam Wars lasted for almost thirty years together. It lasted for a long time, especially the second time the United States retreated from Vietnam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Poison gas is not used in war. This is an international convention. During World War II, this principle was observed between the United States and Germany and between the United States and Japan. However, the Japanese often used poison gas on the Chinese battlefield. The United States also used poison gas during the Vietnam War. Today, among Vietnamese children, there are deformed and dystocia babies. The poison gas that the United States spread in the forests of Vietnam is still permeating the air. This is all evil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;587&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under Soviet control Within the scope, some countries in Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe made several attempts to break away from the Soviet bloc. Every time this happened, the CIA was deeply involved, causing turmoil. Some of the consequences were national restructuring and the emergence of new regimes, but the only regimes that could maintain stability were the Hungarian Spring and the Polish Spring (the Poznan Incident in June 1956 and the Hungarian Incident in October 1956). In addition, the &quot;color revolutions&quot; in a string of Muslim countries on the Mediterranean coast in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Algeria, and Libya, have always destroyed the original order; and the economic construction that those countries had started has almost stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a geopolitical perspective, the Middle East is a battleground, and this region is also the largest oil-producing area in the world. The United States has tried its best to control it, starting with controlling Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia was an independent emirate that the British separated from the Persian Empire. Later, it became a &quot;wealthy rich man&quot; with a hereditary chief, but it became the &quot;beloved baby&quot; of the United States - for their bases and oil resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, when the Jews returned to their homeland, they actually carved out a piece of land next to Jerusalem to rebuild Israel - could the exiled Jews alone have such power? In fact, it was the UK and the US that were behind it. Britain was in ruins after the war, and Israel&#39;s main supporter was the United States. This country has its admirable features. It &quot;made something out of nothing&quot; and quickly built the country into a decent one. The level of Hebrew University is no less than the top universities in China and no less than the top universities in the United States. Taiwan&#39;s military research institute often asks Israeli consultants to help solve missile problems and also asks them to help solve problems of building nuclear power plants. These people are top experts. I have been to Israel several times and the people are very disciplined, live a simple life and are hardworking. But over the past few decades, Israel&#39;s courage and mentality to try and learn when it built the communes have been lost. However, the United States must defend Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States has deeply intervened in Middle East politics and launched three wars: the Gulf War/Kuwait War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War. Then right after that, came the Iran War. Only recently did the U.S. military retreat from Afghanistan in disgrace. At the end of every war, there are ruins and ruins, and the place is completely destroyed. More than thirty years of war by the United States have devastated the Middle East. Countries on the southern coast of the Mediterranean and the northern coast of Africa have not recovered their strength to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the consequences of the extension of the &quot;containment policy&quot; - the United States is addicted to expansion, and every president has a group of generals who want to expand. Blackwater International, which has close ties with those in power in the United States, specializes in the mercenary business. They have killed thousands of people and destroyed countries one after another. They are not responsible.中东的阿联酋也是美国主导下的产物：将这一带几个小酋长联合在一起，建立“联合酋长国”——那里有全世界最奢侈的酒店，停靠着世界上最豪华的游轮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，战后的日本，相当于美国的“殖民地”。在朝鲜战争中，日本为美国提供后勤补给、维修保障，也借机将二战时的老旧设备全盘更新。 1970年代，日本的工业辉煌一时，其生产率全世界最高。世界上日本商货遍地，丰田汽车、松下电器、西田百货，等等——日本商人所在之处，当地房价能翻两三倍。东亚一带的经济，也随着日本起来了，所谓“雁行理论”——中国大陆沿海地带，也在这一波经济荣景之中占了一角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此情形，美国不能接受：“我将你扶植起来，现在你反而骑到我头上，将我的买卖都抢占了。”于是收紧银根、提高关税、专利索赔等手段齐施，三年之内将日本打到地下，到今天还没爬起来。所有著名的日本品牌，美国公司都占有股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台湾比日本聪明，当年的建设不用美国的品牌，像台湾集成电路制造股份有限公司这种企业，都是自己申请专利权——台积电生产了全世界80%的芯片。当初设计台湾经济模式时，就考虑到日本的前车之鉴。台湾的长荣海运公司，是世界上最大的航运公司之一。希腊的大船队现在被美国“卡脖子”了，挪威的大船队美国卡不住。所以，这个“龙头”不讲江湖义气。中国江湖上的龙头老大，是老大吃亏、小弟兄占便宜。美国这个老大是：“你做了我的小弟兄，就得听我的，随我处置。”如此行径，怎不令人失望？最近美国在提高中国的关税，又以台湾问题要挟大陆。从东方到西方，美国的如此行为，使得其领导的国际圈内怨声载道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“美人迟暮”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;数十年来，我们也见过美国曾经的荣景，百年繁华。 1957年我到美国，正好在报纸上读到：一个非裔小学生要进入白人学校而被挡住了；国家动员了该州的自卫队，以政府的力量，将民众的反抗压下去。这种“黑白”之间的纠纷，至今没有停歇过。因为黑人群体仍旧陷落于社会底层，即使金（Martin Luther King, Jr）作了多大努力，也于事无补——种族纠纷问题，如今变成“种族惰性”，弱势种族不再争自己的权利，反而去争政府的失业津贴。从数字上看，美国缺工120万，失业人口只有25万，差不多100万人在领政府的失业津贴，不愿意出去工作。生之者寡，食之者众，经济就走下坡路了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国科技迅速发展，今天的数字化、自动化、人工智能到此地步，厂房里面不见下层工人，只见工程师、检查员。 1970年，我从台湾到匹兹堡大学教书。当时一次大罢工，白宫震动，全国不知道怎么办。今天如果再有同样的事情发生，是否能同样撼动国家？一个国家假如有四分之一的人口，实质上是靠国家“社福基金”养活的，政府税收不够用时，只能靠印钞解决。支撑美金实质的力量，应当是国际贸易和国内的所得税——但实际上却是一团乱账。很多美国公司，收入在别处，富余的钱存在国际户头。如今美国的经济摇摇晃晃，所有货币发行限额等经济学上的定律，都不遵守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1980到2008年，两次巨大经济危机，都是信用问题、贪污问题、虚假抵押等问题所致。原本，这都是资本主义制度不容许发生的问题，因为健康的资本主义市场经济，是靠信用承诺。两次经济危机几乎让美国经济崩溃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;最近的美国经济，本该是大恐慌、大不景气的时候，居然出现物价回涨、股价回涨的情形——我们都看得出，其中有假。如此情形说明，美国这个国家在自我欺骗。但国内有如此多弱势群体在依靠国家的津贴生活，长此以往，怎么办？这些弱势群体，拥护不讲理的激烈右派，该怎么办？罗斯福当年倡导的“四大自由”很对，但现在“第五个自由”出现了：“别惹我”的自由。要不要工作、是否上学，等等，大家都认为是个人的事——如此“独立精神”，不是健康的独立精神。我希望中国的年轻人不要“躺平”——但是，世界的潮流似乎在这样发展，怎不令人担忧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，我写了一篇有关美国社会反思的文章，后来发展为一本书：《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》。那时候，我批判美国将要面临的危机：政府官僚化、社会涣散、铺张浪费——尤其浪费在军事、国防上。然而，政府该做的事情却并没有尽到责任：全国的硬件设施，桥梁、机场、公路、水泵很多坏掉了，却没人管。当前美国社会，最重要的问题是国家精神涣散：政府天天在争吵的，是堕胎是否合法、变性人的权利，等等——不是说这些问题不重要，而是说这些话题占据了大家的注意力，沦为政客哗众取宠的项目，真正关乎国计民生的事情反而没人管。这个国家正在掏空自己的精神文化、经济实力，这个国家正在走向浪费、走向懒惰、走向消耗、走向空洞化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“9·11”以后，美国以报复恐怖分子为口号，在中东介入无数纠纷。为了惩罚他们，美国在外战上消耗有多大？得到的丑恶名声有多少？国家多少的实力花在杀人上面？花在雇佣枪手上面？花在一架架无人机上面？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历史上最骄奢的罗马帝国、最浪费的法王路易十四、最野蛮的俄国沙皇，他们的骄奢、浪费，都没有美国如此严重。假如美国经济这条大船沉没，像我们住在美国的人会跟着被淹死，全世界经济会随之没顶。如此危机，该如何挽回，这是令人彻夜难眠，也想不到出路的问题。但是美国如此败象，确实已经很难弥补。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，有很多批评美国资本主义的书，但对于这些批评声音，美国的政客不愿意听，或者来不及听——对于他们，最要紧的是如何抓到选票，入主白宫。当年我开始写《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》时，至少有十二本书和大量批判美国的文章可用——今天我去查，这些自我批判的书没有了。可是，有识之士还是在批判，《纽约时报》《大西洋月刊》《星期六评论》，少数的几个记者和评论家，不断提醒：危机就要到了。 “火马上要烧起来了”，可没人注意。这件事令我不但感觉心酸，而且心伤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也劝告国内的“唯美派”，不要唯“美”是尚。 “美人迟暮”，会影响世界各处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾看见美国人奋发努力的时候，看见美国民主运作是许多人努力的累积，看见美国对穷国、小国的援助，甚至于教会在各地对当地教众的支持和教育，都是令我钦佩的。而且，我曾经盼望美国的政治体制，有不断的进步和因时的修改。因此，今天看见美国社会的涣散、政治的庸俗，在国际关系上又如此地骄横而不知点检，大家可以想象，美国这个社会，从记忆中的美好形象，居然一变而为现实中破碎的残镜，我的心情不言而喻。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;乘客称因试喝自带水致身体不适&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;将广州地铁告上法庭索赔48100元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年12月14日，因张某携带液体进站，安检人员要求张某进行液体检测，张某遂喝下其自带的瓶装水，后安检人员将其放行进入地铁乘车。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后张某主张因其所喝的瓶装水为自装白开水，而其自身患有肠胃疾病，导致其喝水后身体极度不适，且此事也给其造成严重的精神刺激和困扰，故向法院起诉认为被告广州地铁公司侵权，要求赔偿医疗费、误工费、营养费、精神损失费等共计48100元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;【法官说法】&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安检人员要求“试喝”不存在过错&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;乘客应配合、支持地铁安检&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州铁路运输法院经审理认为，本案系生命权、健康权、身体权纠纷。本案中，张某主张其身心健康遭受侵害，系被告广州地铁公司的安检行为导致，应提供相应的证据予以证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，广州地铁公司在进站处设置安检并要求乘车人如携带液体需通过液体检测仪或“试喝一口”等方式进行检测，是其作为城市轨道交通经营单位所应当履行的安全保障义务，因此安检人员要求张某对其携带的液体进行检测，并不存在过错。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，张某就其主张的医疗费、误工费、营养费、精神损失费等未能提供证据予以证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张某提供的检查报告单、门诊病历等证据也表明，其早在2020年底至2022年初期间就已被诊断患有肠胃疾病并多次检查就医，亦早在2020年就有失眠症状被诊断有睡眠障碍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此张某无法证明地铁安检要求其“试喝一口”自带水的行为与其主张的损害具有因果关系，张某主张广州地铁公司对其侵权，应承担赔偿责任的诉请，缺乏事实和法律依据，法院不予支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州铁路运输法院承办法官表示，安检是地铁公司履行安全保障义务的必要手段，乘客应尽可能支持和配合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;民法典明确规定地铁站、火车站、机场等场所的经营管理者，未尽到安全保障义务，造成他人损害的，应承担侵权责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;交通运输部公布的《城市轨道交通运营管理规定》也明确规定禁止乘客携带有毒、有害、易燃、易爆、放射性、腐蚀性以及其他可能危及人身和财产安全的危险物品进站、乘车。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在交通工具上发生恶性事件，空间非常有限，难以及时疏散降低伤害，所以安检作为公共交通工具经营管理者能够采取的可能是最有效果的预防手段，具有合理性、必要性，乘客应当尽可能理解并配合。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主张侵权，应当证明加害行为与损害结果间存在因果关系。一般的侵权行为，必须具备加害行为、损害结果、加害行为与损害结果之间具有因果关系、行为人主观上存在过错。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本案张某主张因安检行为导致其身体不适，精神遭受刺激，但现有证据只能证明此前其已经患有疾病和失眠，而不能证明此次安检行为后其身体受伤或疾病加重，因此张某主张地铁公司侵权并予以赔偿的诉讼请求没有事实和法律依据。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;可以说，诚实可靠和守法守序，在任何一个有着正常道德倾向的社会中都是不折不扣的优秀品质。然而从1990年代开始，“老实人”的语义迅速发生变化，逐渐和“人际交往能力差”“懦弱”“愚笨”“经济能力低下”等负面含义联系起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;进入网络时代后，“老实人”更是被无限解构，尤其是在婚恋市场上，“老实”直接与“情商低”“不能提供情绪价值”“无趣”挂钩，成了不折不扣的“减分项”，“老实人”在婚恋市场中被彻底边缘化。2017年的一项研究显示，“老实”超越“经济条件差”和“无正式工作”，成为某地35岁以上青年成为“光棍”的第二大原因（第一大原因是疾病或身体残疾）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前不久的一场网络直播中，一名网络主播因被粉丝称为“老实人”而勃然大怒，也许他并不能准确地把握“老实人”因变化而产生的复杂语义，但他本能地感到被侮辱了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从人品的质量保证，到网络社会中被无限解构的污名，“老实人”在现代社会的发展和变迁中，究竟经历了什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;在社会变革中彷徨的“老实人”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在改革初期，“老实人”由褒到贬的语义变化实际上并不难理解。在当时快速变革的社会环境中，市场经济和工业文明迅速改变着整个社会的方方面面。性格上倾向于循规蹈矩的“老实人”在传统社会生活模式中实践总结出的那些生活经验被迅速地颠覆。而他们又未能及时对社会变革作出适应性的变化和回应，自然会在一个时间段内在经济上处于相对劣势的层级和地位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，剧烈的社会变革在经济领域造成了相当多的“灰色区域”。在这样的混乱繁荣中，“撑死胆大的，饿死胆小的”一度成为社会上流行的生存信条。也确实有一批人在这些领域中捞到了第一桶金。而“老实人”性格中谨慎和守序的一面，决定了他们注定不可能是这些弄潮儿其中的一员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于以上两点，“老实人”的语义在上世纪末出现的一系列变化，实际上是社会变革中，对个体价值评价标准变化的一种正常体现，并不难以理解。在社会经济秩序趋于稳定之后，“老实人”的口碑与风评又发生了正向的偏转，尤其是在二十一世纪最初十年的高速增长期中，“老实人”在建设和发展中表现出一系列工作特质，又让老实人具有了“脚踏实地，勤劳肯干”的光环，让“老实人”的形象得到了相当程度的提升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比之下，“老实人”的语义在网络社会遭遇的无限解构和形象滑坡，原因要复杂得多。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;被文化资本排斥和边缘化的“老实人”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;从上世纪末到本世纪初，先是电视，然后是网络对社会价值观造成重大冲击。随着电视和网络的普及，现代社会的文化中心效应开始凸显，一种以文化中心的生活方式和价值观念为蓝本的文化范式被制造出来，并通过无数的电影、电视、娱乐和综艺节目向整个社会传播。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当无数生活在七、八线城市、城乡接合部和广大农村的年轻人沉浸在那些在北上广深制造出来的文化产品里的时候，实际上也在不知不觉中接受了这些文化产品所倡导的生活模式和价值观念。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简而言之，文化资本用一种现代化的方式，使绝大多数人沦为观众，自觉不自觉地观看位于中心的少数人演绎他们的生活。屏幕里的喜怒哀乐、恩怨情仇大都发生在北上广深的钢筋水泥森林之中。当“小城青年”“小镇青年”们作为观众注视着屏幕的时候，也就意味着他们潜移默化地接受了这些文化产品所表现和传递的那种“中心范式文化”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种基于超级都市的文化范式具有相当鲜明的特征——商品经济高度发达的社会环境、消费主义和享乐主义的价值观念，以及一种城市中产阶级的恋爱观念和择偶方式。文化中心效应是如此强烈，以至于某些影视作品试图改变题材或场景时，往往陷入尴尬的境地，在某影视作品中，出身贫寒的主人公身穿一万多元的某北美品牌羽绒服，使用七八千元的苹果手机，被人引以为笑谈，显然是编剧陷入了这种文化范式不能自拔的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;文化资本一方面不遗余力地推广着中心的生活方式和价值观念，另一方面又在边缘化和排斥着其他的生活方式和价值观念。而文化资本所推广的这种文化范式的核心，实际上就是后现代社会的基本特征，即对消费欲望的予取予求和随时随地的情绪索取。前者是个体在高度发达的商品经济社会中所能达到的最理想物质满足状态，后者则是高度原子化的社会中对抗个体孤独的基本要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简而言之，在这种文化范式之下，一个样本式的成功社会个体要么有花不完的钱，要么有随时随地取悦他人的能力，最好二者兼有之。而“老实人”的问题正在于，他们往往既不具备这样的经济标准，也不具备这样的性格条件，因此成为被排斥和边缘化的人群，这就理所当然了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在影视作品和娱乐、恋爱综艺中，“浪漫、幽默、多金”才是“完美人设”，“老实人”的优点被有意无意地忽略或遗忘了。相反，因为“呆板木讷”“情商低”“不能提供情绪价值”，“老实人”经常沦为被嘲弄、被揶揄的一方。这种有意无意营造出的刻板形象，实际上在潜移默化中改变着公众认知。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如文章开头所言，诚实可靠和守法守序，在任何一个有着正常道德倾向的社会中都是不折不扣的优秀品质。将消费欲望和情绪索求奉为最高价值的社会，必然是投机遍地、骗子横行的社会，毕竟前文提到的那种浪漫幽默又多金的“完美个体”最多的地方，除了韩剧里，就是杀猪盘了。&lt;/p>;

There are one lost letter each to Mr. Zhang, and each of them is accompanied by a note of poems and a note of music. Following the elegant wishes of Teacher Zhang Yan, Hui Yu compiled and published it, writing a short essay and a brief explanation, for the benefit of others, and at the same time, it can be used to preserve the origins of a passage written by a senior scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhongpu (1912-1987), courtesy name Zhanyun and nickname Oubo, was born in Yugan, Jiangxi. He studied engineering at an early age and studied at Jiangxi Polytechnic College, determined to save the country through science. He then changed his studies to law and graduated from the Law Department of Peking University in 1937 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in law. He then specialized in literature, loved classical literature and was good at writing poetry. Dedicated to education throughout his life, he served as a Chinese language teacher at Nanchang Normal University, Linchuan Simple Normal University, and Yuqian Yuting Middle School. In 1934, he taught at the former National Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Normal University, and Hangzhou University, mainly taking charge of modern Chinese literature courses. He is the author of &quot;Guo Moruo&#39;s Historical Drama &quot;Qu Yuan&quot;&quot; (Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, 1959), &quot;Analysis of &quot;The New Story&quot;&quot; (co-authored with Wang Rongchu, Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House, 1983), &quot;Yan Milou Poetry Manuscript&quot; ( Northern Literature and Art Publishing House, 2004), &quot;Notes on Xia Wanchun&#39;s &quot;Ode to the Great Sorrow&quot;&quot; (Threadbound Book Company, 2016), &quot;Modern Patriotic Poet Huang Zunxian&quot; (Tianhe Press, 2016), etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth volume of &quot;The Complete Works of Zhan Antai&quot; contains nine letters from Zhan to Long Yusheng, Chen Zhongfan, Yang Shuda, Luo Xianglin and Liu Baiduan. &quot;The Complete Works of Wang Jisi&quot; contains nearly 50 letters by Wang. At the end of his letter to Zhang Hanqing in October 1987, he wrote: &quot;I used to occasionally write some prose, but lately I have been immersed in ancient books and have rarely experienced new life experiences, except for relatives and friends. Outside of letters and letters, they rarely write.&quot; It can be imagined that Mr. Zhan Antai and Wang Jisi still have a lot of letters and letters lying around, waiting to be compiled. The two lost letters disclosed in this article can be regarded as a source of inspiration, or they can be regarded as A little bit of celery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/e6YB0i4iq3BTklJMlxLz0Qr0K9bOPi21KNDlq5Y4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;804&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/e6YB0i4iq3BTklJMlxLz0Qr0K9bOPi21KNDlq5Y4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255545&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhan Antai&#39;s letter and words to Zhang Zhongpu. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Letter from Zhan Antai to Zhang Zhongpu&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Zhong Pu Written by: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Hui Shufeng It is reported that the great work is pure and healthy, and the workmanship is greatly admired. &quot;If you avoid the soldiers, you will face the water of Aotang.

According to the &quot;Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot;, Mr. Xia and Zhang Zhongpu went to Guangzhou to participate in a scientific research seminar at Sun Yat-sen University on January 5, 1957. On January 14, the two of them, accompanied by Zhan Antai and Wang Jinguang, visited Huanghuagang. The diary stated that they were &quot;majestic&quot; and &quot;taken a photo&quot;. This is the so-called &quot;Photography in Huanghuagang&quot; in the lost letter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the previously published lost letters and the relevant contents of &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot;, it can be seen that after Zhang Zhongpu returned to Hangzhou from Guangzhou, he wrote to Zhan Antai and attached his own work. Check his &quot;Yan Mi Lou Poetry Manuscript&quot;, the sentence &quot;avoiding the soldiers and leaving the water in the Aotang, leaving the country is still the new willow shoots&quot; comes from Zhang&#39;s 1944 work &quot;The accumulated rain uses the Du Gongbu Hall to form a rhyme&quot;, the whole poem is: &quot;The accumulated rain and moss cover the grass, and the barbarian suburbs are temporarily stagnated by the smoke. The soldiers are left facing the water of the Aotang, and there are several new willow shoots in the country. The flying kites in the sky are startled by the meteorites, and the Peng in the clouds laughs at the nest. Zilan Ning It has the meaning of curing hunger, and the spirit of Yanjian Mountain is full of laughter.&quot; However, in the &quot;Poem Manuscript&quot; version, &quot;Yue Kun&quot; was changed to &quot;Ji Kun&quot;, which made the emotion even more intense. Zhan Antai said that &quot;it is pure and healthy, and it is extremely admirable for workmanship&quot; and &quot;it is still painful to recite it over and over again.&quot; Of course, he has the ancient etiquette of the older generation of scholars, but he also has a gaze like a torch, which illuminates the advantages of Zhang&#39;s poems. In his letters to Zhang Zhongpu in the 1960s, Miao Yue repeatedly said that &quot;great poems are fresh and elegant, and can integrate new ideas while maintaining the style and charm of old poems.&quot; , &quot;Great poetry can reflect reality, express new thoughts, and be admired after reading it.&quot; The two contrast each other, and the style and characteristics of Zhang&#39;s poetry can be seen better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Yuan Ri Occasionally Small Ci&quot; written in the poem &quot;Begging for Correction on a Separate Paper&quot; also survives in Teacher Zhang Yan&#39;s home. &quot;Yuan Day&quot; is January 31, 1957, the first day of the first month of the Dingyou year of the lunar calendar. &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot; mistakenly refers to New Year&#39;s Day of the &quot;Renshen Year&quot; of Xia Zheng. The full text of the Ci is as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qi Tianle&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It would have been twenty years since I had talked with Qu Chan.

Drunk and drunk. He also painted a river city with hundreds of dragons dancing. When I saw Fangcun, there were clusters of wild flowers competing with flutes and drums (the plan to go to Fangcun to see flowers did not bear fruit). &amp;nbsp;It’s so wonderful to travel everywhere, old friends are thousands of miles away, can we come again? The ridges and flat pavilions, the lakeside survey, are not wasted time. Thinking about you. It is necessary to make a new start with style and make a grand gesture.

The poem mentioned in the self-note is &quot;I heard that Qu Chan (Cheng Tao) will have a poem to welcome Guangnan&quot;: &quot;Looking at the mountains, I can no longer be proud, and I love you so much that you live next to the raging waves.&quot; (Professor Qu Chan&#39;s River University, the door is opposite the Qiantang River.)

Appendix 3 of Volume 6 of &quot;The Complete Works of Zhan Antai&quot; contains Zheng Xiaoyan&#39;s &quot;Chronology of Mr. Zhan Antai&quot;. In 1956, Zhan wrote three words in a row due to Xia Chengtao&#39;s trip to Guangzhou and commented: &quot;At that time, Mr. Zhan didn&#39;t write much anymore.&quot; Read &quot;Wu&#39;an Ci&quot; shows that Zhan Antai wrote very few lyrics after 1949, less than two poems per year on average, so this lost letter and lyrics are extremely precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Vpnngr5arg5KE3jozSk9lsrSUGAIpFRDjMnKOhTn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Vpnngr5arg5KE3jozSk9lsrSUGAIpFRDjMnKOhTn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255546&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Letter from Wang Jisi (pictured on the right) to Zhang Zhongpu. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Letter from Wang Jisi to Zhang Zhongpu&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mr. Zhongpu:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Seven-day benefit letter received .

It lasted for more than three months. 120 teachers, cadres and a group of students were wrongly classified as rightists. Professor Ren Mingshan of the Chinese Department was even wrongly classified. For &quot;extreme right&quot; elements. After October, it entered the rectification movement, that is, the stage of rectification with the main forms of speaking out, speaking out, discussing, and big-character posters. Then, in line with the policy that &quot;education must serve proletarian politics and education must be integrated with productive labor,&quot; a large number of teachers and students went to work in the countryside. &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot; records that on December 20, 1957, the Chinese Department held a celebration meeting to celebrate the approval of Lu Moye, Gao Houzai, and Yu Shi to go to the countryside. It mentioned that the first batch of 56 people were approved to go to the countryside that day (&quot;Hangzhou University&quot; &quot;History 1897-1997&quot; stated that the first batch of decentralized faculty and staff was 144). Mr. Xia also wrote a couplet to congratulate him: &quot;If you can go down to work, you can grow up, and when you go to the countryside, you can get home.&quot; Wang Jisi said in his letter that &quot;Zhejiang Normal University saw off all his works&quot;. Zhang Zhongpu&#39;s &quot;Yimilou Poetry Manuscript&quot; contains a poem &quot;Sending Friends to the Rural Areas&quot;: &quot;Mountains are moved by nine ridges. It is common, but a fool of a thousand years will not expect anything extravagant. The truth is The barnyard grass is diligent in checking things, and the mulberry trees are planted by hand to make a home.

Moreover, the handwriting of this song is very different from that of the aforementioned letter, so it must have been written by two hands. Wang Jisi said in &quot;The Vicissitudes of Half a Study Room&quot; written in 1986: &quot;My former lover Xu Bixia was a wonderful partner in my life. In addition to doing housework, she also helped me receive guests and copy manuscripts.&quot; Just like Mr. Chen Yinke wrote a letter in his later years. The signatures were often ghostwritten by Mrs. Tang Yun, and Wang&#39;s piece may have been handwritten by Mrs. Xu. But in the same article, he wrote: &quot;The good times did not last long. After 1957, due to the well-known facts, I praised the &#39;joy of friends&#39; of the previous generations of poets in class and introduced the &#39;joy of the boudoir&#39; in their love works. &#39;, was criticized. Bixia died of illness soon, and the family lost its joy. Political avoidance caused the alienation of friends. This was another small change in half of the study.&quot; Mrs. Xu found out in early 1957 Suffering from a serious illness, he unfortunately died in September 1958. Therefore, there is still some doubt whether the copyist of this essay was Mrs. Xu or other family members or students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The draft of &quot;History of Literature&quot; has been put away since the second big announcement, and I don&#39;t know when it will be completed.&quot; Wang Jisi was involved in the matter several years ago, and Mr. Xia was slightly involved. According to the &quot;Complete Collection of Xia Chengtao&#39;s Diaries&quot; on September 8, 1953: &quot;I received a letter from Ji Si from Sun Yat-sen University, saying that he went to Beijing during the summer vacation and met He Qifang at the Qing family in Pujiang, Peking University. He said that the Institute of Liberal Arts of Peking University wanted to concentrate its efforts on compiling it within two or three years. The first draft of &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot; was completed. Ji Si has been sent to work by CUHK for one year, and He Jun also wants to transfer me to participate in this work. Ji Si hopes that Yu can work for one or two years.&quot; September 30, 1955: &quot;Bu Kui Jiao came to the Song and Yuan parts of the literary history written by Ji Si. After reading and discussing the sections of Su, Mei, and European schools, there are many new ideas.&quot; December 24, 1957: &quot;Received from You Guoen, the editorial board member of the &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot; of the Institute of Literature , He Qifang, and Yu Guanying wrote a chapter of &quot;The Rise of Ci&quot;, 8,000 words.&quot; May 25, 1958: &quot;Sent &quot;The Rise of Ci&quot; to Yu Guanying of Peking University in the afternoon.

Although the public officials involved have been detained by the police and may be subject to disciplinary action thereafter, the reflection on this incident cannot stop there. The top priority is for local governments to strictly protect the interests of foreign agricultural investors in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 21, a video shot by a drone spread online. In the video, a man wearing a hat and plainclothes is cutting sorghum ears with scissors, while a uniformed man stands not far away and watches. After discovering that they had been photographed, the two walked towards a parked vehicle nearby. The man wearing a hat put the bucket containing sorghum ears into the trunk of a family SUV and walked towards a car in front of him with the word &quot;Patrol&quot; painted on it and equipped with police lights. car. The men in uniform got into the family SUV and started the vehicle. The poster of the video questioned that law enforcement officers from Sanhejian Town drove people to steal sorghum in patrol cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the video attracted attention, Sanhejian Town government propaganda staff said in an interview with the media on October 22 that the uniformed person in the video was indeed a public official of the town, but he did not participate in pinching sorghum. He was filmed while patrolling to &quot;stop&quot; people from picking sorghum, which caused a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot; The publicist also said that in order to eliminate everyone&#39;s doubts, the public security organs have intervened in the investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public security agency’s investigation results quickly slapped the propagandist in the face. A notice issued by the Sanhejian Town Government on the evening of the 22nd showed that after police investigation and verification, the uniformed person in the video was Yin Moumou, a staff member of the Sanhejian Town Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Brigade, and the other person was Zhang Moumou, a villager of Sanhuai Village. The two went to Gaoliang. The thieves cut sorghum ears on the ground; the two have been administratively detained by the police. Next, the Sanhejian Town Discipline Inspection Commission will seriously hold the party members and cadres involved accountable and deal with them in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public officials who are supposed to patrol to stop sorghum theft, drive patrol cars and lead people to cut sorghum and participate in the theft. It is really magical. What&#39;s even more magical is that after the incident was revealed, local officials immediately defended &quot;their own people&quot;, claiming that public officials were not involved in the theft, but to stop theft by the masses. If it hadn&#39;t been later verified by the police, many netizens might have truly believed this statement: Look, the person who stole the sorghum cuttings walked to the patrol car and was about to be taken back for questioning. The law enforcement officers drove away the car that stole the cuttings. There is absolutely nothing wrong with bringing back stolen goods, crime tools, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, they are not just facing netizens. Because the sorghum they stole was not ordinary sorghum. That is the local raw material production base of Moutai Group. As one of the most well-known brewing companies in China, Moutai Group has a high influence. In order to ensure the supply of brewing raw materials, Moutai Group has established raw material production bases in many places, and Gushi County in Henan is one of them. No matter where Moutai Group builds its raw material base, it will undoubtedly receive great attention from the local government. The Gushi County Government has set up a special Moutai organic raw material base construction office, which shows that the local government attaches great importance to this matter. Therefore, when the theft of sorghum cuttings attracted attention on the Internet, the local government would not dare to fool them. The public official literally hit the steel plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, even for agricultural projects that the local government attaches great importance to, public officials dare to participate in theft, which shows that theft of crops is common in the local area. Some netizens said that many local farmers have a large amount of sorghum drying in front of their homes, but they do not grow sorghum themselves. So where does the sorghum come from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant information released by Moutai Group, Moutai uses a specialized sorghum variety &quot;Hongyingzi&quot; for brewing. In Renhuai, Guizhou and other places, Moutai Group has purchased Hongyingzi sorghum at a protective price and will acquire it in 2022. The price is as high as 11.2 yuan/kg, much higher than the price of ordinary sorghum on the market. The sorghum grown at the Moutai raw material base in Gushi County is claimed to be organic sorghum, and its purchase price may be higher. Perhaps each thief may not steal too much, but if many people steal, it will cause huge losses to the growers. Perhaps this is why sorghum farming companies have to use drone patrols to detect and stop thieves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is a common problem faced by foreign agricultural investors. Just a few days ago, news broke out in Dancheng, Henan, that hundreds of farmers were robbing corn. News about people stealing peanuts, pumpkins, watermelons, and fish and shrimps emerged one after another across the country. These incidents all have one thing in common. Most of the people who steal things are local farmers, while those who are stolen are mostly people who transfer land for agricultural investment. Of course, there are also people who return to their hometowns to start agricultural businesses, and they are also stolen. After the incident, the local government often excused the local farmers by saying they were &quot;picking up&quot; crops that their owners had missed and discarded. But in fact, these so-called &quot;pickings&quot; often occur when growers are in the process of harvesting. The owner&#39;s harvesting machinery was still working, and the &quot;picker&quot; ran in front of the machine. Is there such a &quot;picker&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Allowing farmers to steal crops will not only harm the interests of investors, but may also cause serious injuries. Recently, there have been many incidents in which farmers were seriously injured or even killed by large harvesting machinery while &quot;picking up&quot; crops. Propaganda staff from Sanhejian Town in Gushi County also said in response to the media that patrols were organized considering that it might be unsafe for people to pick up sorghum during the sorghum harvest. As for the losses caused to growers by farmers stealing sorghum, the propagandist did not seem to care too much, &quot;Rural people just love to take advantage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is not a trivial matter that some farmers &quot;love to take advantage&quot;. The local government&#39;s &quot;harmony&quot; excuse for local farmers instead of safeguarding the interests of agricultural investors in accordance with the law undoubtedly embolden the thieves and makes agricultural investors feel disappointed. If things continue like this, who will dare to invest? Farmers who steal crops shall be subject to public security penalties and criminal penalties. Only in this way can this trend be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, an urban management law enforcement team member from Sanhejian Town, Gushi County was arrested for stealing sorghum. He hit a large steel plate. The interests of small agricultural entrepreneurs should also be protected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
