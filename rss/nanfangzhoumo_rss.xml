Although Zhao Rui hit two three-pointers at the beginning and scored a total of 8 points, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team did not quickly widen the point difference and fell behind 21:29 in the first quarter.

In China, luxury goods sales reached 956 billion yuan, accounting for 38% of the global luxury goods market. Chinese people are still the most important force in global luxury goods consumption. According to the international consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, the personal luxury goods market is expected to grow by 5%-12% in 2023, which is another peak after the record growth in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why the global economy is slowing down, but the consumption of luxury goods is not affected at all, and even grows against the trend. This is an interesting question. Moreover, some luxury brands have bucked the trend and raised prices to maintain the competitiveness of their brands. For example, LVMH, Hermès, and Kering Group have all raised prices in the past three years. Among them, LVMH has raised prices more than five times from 2019 to March 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this phenomenon, American economist Veblen proposed a concept called &quot;conspicuous consumption.&quot; He believes that to obtain and maintain a lasting sense of glory, it is not enough to have money; you must also let others know that you have money. Therefore, the main purpose of conspicuous consumption is not the product itself, but to use this consumption to distinguish oneself from others. For example, if you want to wear a particularly expensive watch, it is obviously not just to tell the time, but also to show off to others and demonstrate your economic status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For luxury goods, it happens to have such a show-off function. Many times, luxury goods are the buyer’s proof of wealth. At the same time, rising prices make fewer people able to afford it, and those who can afford it feel more superior. This is a bit like the mentality we had when we were young: &quot;I can&#39;t live without what others have.&quot; But when we grow up, this mentality becomes &quot;I don&#39;t want what others have.&quot; I must maintain a certain sense of superiority and cannot let myself be reduced to The level of those people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what we see is that the higher the price of some luxury goods, the more popular they become, because at this time the higher the functions they show off, the stronger the isolation effect. In 2022, Rolls-Royce only delivered a total of 6,021 cars in about 50 countries around the world. This is the first time in the 118-year history of the Rolls-Royce brand that sales have exceeded 6,000 vehicles. But with this sales volume, they have never worried about survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to conspicuousness, luxury goods have several other characteristics. It will place special emphasis on scarcity, such as emphasizing that it is a limited edition, emphasizing the use of precious and scarce materials, or emphasizing the complexity of craftsmanship such as pure handcrafting. In addition, luxury goods also have social attributes and are imitable. People who own the same luxury goods are more likely to recognize each other and form a circle. People are also happy to imitate the lifestyle of people of a higher class than themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consumption of luxury goods is not only an economic issue, but also a social issue. The so-called luxury brand is a modern concept, but luxury goods themselves are not exclusive to modern people. Even in primitive societies or today&#39;s primitive tribes in the Amazon rainforest, their leaders will be different from other people in their clothing. These clothing decorations are symbols of their status and power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time in human history, luxury goods were mainly linked to power rather than wealth. The &quot;etiquette&quot; of Confucianism is a direct reflection. There are clear regulations on what clothes, clothes and etiquette should be worn by monarchs and ministers, fathers and sons, and different social classes. All must follow the rules without chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only in modern times, with the process of industrialization and the prosperity of material production, the social form has generally shifted from a power society to a market society. The level of consumption is gradually decoupled from power and linked to the level of wealth. The role of luxury goods has gradually changed from a symbol of power to a symbol of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, luxury goods have always shown their top-down characteristics. It can be said that they have always been at the top of the aesthetic order, defined and spread by the upper class of society. In societies where the original power order was stronger, this power of definition came from the top of the hierarchy. In modern society, this aesthetic definition also comes from the top, but it is more reflected in the conceptual design of companies or designers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entrepreneurs continue to explore people&#39;s deeper, richer and more diverse needs, and then the market forms differentiation in the process of continuous stratification. At the top are today&#39;s many luxury brands. Luxury cars, watches, diamonds and jade, luxury brand clothes, shoes, cosmetics, everything is available. The difference in personality and identity is highlighted through the brand and tone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rich or powerful label themselves through luxury goods. They can neither escape from this circle nor allow others to enter it casually, so as to maintain their social status. Therefore, even if the price of luxury goods increases, as long as it is within their affordability, they will show no mercy or blink an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the formation of this luxury culture has also satisfied the fantasies of some ordinary people, who mistakenly believe that owning a brand-name bag and high-end clothes will truly enter that class. At this time, luxury goods become a prop for one class to get closer to another class. Sometimes this prop is useful, but many times it has little effect and is just a deliberately guided high consumption demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all know that to make a lie, you need to create a complete set, and one lie needs to be completed by another hundred lies. Similarly, if you are wearing a brand-name bag, the rest of your outfit should not be too shabby; and if you are wearing a brand-name outfit, your car should not be too ordinary. When these things are added up, if you don&#39;t really have a certain amount of financial resources, you may really be trying to make a fool of yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Young people need to be careful of this carefully constructed illusion and not be led by the luxury culture. Many times, just because you own a brand-name bag, others will definitely look up to you. These things may be helpful in establishing a first impression, but what is more important is the true strength of the person behind the bag. When masters compete with each other, they may be able to understand the depth of the opponent in just a few words, and they will not be easily confused by external things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, any individual, like any social and economic entity, must go through the stages of savings and investment if a society wants to develop its economy. If a young person wants to achieve himself and reach a higher platform, he often needs to save and invest in himself to prepare for success. As a luxury product, designer bags can be used as a means, but they should not be the ultimate goal and goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[教育的基础，在于如何理解“人”丨议教]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258210]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-07 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/07/AsoQGwZYVctwwR0mp5ZTs1EoJZsltI3cB1m4DK4e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;906&quot; height=&quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/AsoQGwZYVctwwR0mp5ZTs1EoJZs ltI3cB1m4DK4e. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253243&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 6, 2023, Lushan Township Central Primary School, Changxing County, Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, Students are playing hide and seek. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of his work in educational media, he is an education scholar living in the United States and the Department of Asian/Asian-American Studies at the University of Miami. I read the article by former director Huang Quanyu from 2014 to 2023, and I still have different feelings from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Education&quot; actually has very complex dimensions. If you touch on education issues from different dimensions, you will have a completely different way of looking at education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The educational media I first worked on was a type of educational media that discussed educational topics for parents. My confusion or reflection on education at that time came entirely from a parent’s perspective: Why do children suffer in education? Why are parents so anxious? If education is about easing the panic of &quot;not being eliminated&quot; through self-repression and constant hard work in a long countercurrent, then when this road ends, what kind of people will our children grow into? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a position, Huang Quanyu&#39;s article opened a window for me: Maybe there is an educational paradigm that advocates children&#39;s freedom, happiness, and disorganization, but it also has good results, and this This relationship between freedom and achievement is not &quot;accidental&quot;, but has an educational connotation that is completely different from our understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first &quot;reading&quot; of his article for me: education has different perspectives. Then comes the second dimension - can we learn it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We did learn a lot of new concepts, such as STEM, PBL project-based learning, interdisciplinary, big concepts, metacognition, inquiry-based learning, etc. With the influx of these new concepts, I myself have also gone through some transformations, from media for parents to professional media for education policy research, school organization or strategic research, because I am really curious about the issues that parents complain and question. , what does the school think? Amid the vortex of concepts trying to “optimize” education, what exactly are schools doing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as I stepped into the professional field, I soon discovered that schools may be more helpless and innocent than parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Schools today are indeed in a dilemma. On the one hand, quality education has been promoted for decades, and in the past two or three years, it has evolved into &quot;literacy&quot; education: In April 2022, the country released new curriculum standards for compulsory education. The description and requirements for students&#39; literacy are basically in line with the world&#39;s most leading educational concepts. consistent. In other words, whether at the level of educational ideals or the implementation of educational policies, our education seems to be moving closer to the scene he described. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is &quot;on the other hand&quot;. Our school education requires examinations at every node. The exam itself is not a problem, but the result of the exam is a ticket, which determines which door a child will enter next and which path he will take. Perhaps for the post-95s and post-00s, the meaning of &quot;doors and roads&quot; no longer has the fate-determining meaning of the post-70s and post-80s, but an inertial social mentality does not think so, but instead gives the exam a more important meaning. Stereotype meaning: educate in order to get high marks, study in order not to lose points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are literacy and examination contradictory? This is actually a difficult question to figure out. Doesn’t the development of literacy require the evaluation of staged results or examinations? no. Huang Quanyu made it clear in his article that he was not against exams, but against &quot;examination-oriented thinking.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the exam is just an academic assessment, it is like a questionnaire sent out by the students themselves. Take it back to see where they still need to work hard and where they need help to solve problems. . Test-oriented thinking is actually a kind of judgmental thinking. It is issued by teachers, parents, schools, society... in short, everyone except the students themselves, and then decides whether you are a successful student or a failed student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an organization composed of education professionals, the school does not understand the contradiction between literacy learning and test-oriented thinking, but the problem is that the school must also do a test question that is not issued by itself, such as this A typical question: &quot;Can your project-based learning (or quality education, interdisciplinary learning, etc.) make students achieve better results?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This question seems quite reasonable, right? In fact, this problem is enough to knock down a school that has ideals and sentiments and hopes to make some educational reforms. Because once exams, scores, and grades become the criteria for &quot;literacy,&quot; the calm, patient, supportive, and accepting educational mentality that &quot;raises&quot; students will be wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The test-oriented thinking that pursues results essentially requires some &quot;anti-human&quot; exercises, such as mechanized accuracy and high-density time management, all of which require this kind of exercise. Literacy requires an ecology that respects the rhythm of children&#39;s growth. It may seem like doing nothing for a long time, but growth will eventually move toward &quot;natural maturity.&quot; However, entrance exams can cut off the natural rhythm at any time. Countless examples tell us that in the search for certainty, the child&#39;s nature and will have become the most easily ignored link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the matter of educational involution, the pros and cons are easy to see clearly, but the difficult part is the choice. Yes, it’s hard for the child, but the child got into 985; or “You all go ahead and leave my children to study quietly”; the same goes for schools, “Parents only care about the admission rate, so the admission rate is king.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crux of education, as Huang Quanyu mentioned in his article on STEM education, &quot;What China&#39;s education currently needs to solve is the background problem of quality education, not the specific curriculum problem of STEM&quot;, let alone The problem of &quot;addition, addition, subtraction&quot; of various educational concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Continuously reflecting on education will inevitably lead to an ultimate question: What is the meaning of education? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If education is to enable a few children to get ahead, what kind of society will we have? If education is for the good and well-being of society as a whole, then what benefit does such a moral ideal education have to &quot;my children&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of my work field, I will read all kinds of education articles. After reading more, I found that there is a tension between individual and society in education itself. If you only focus on the perspective of parents, look at wins and losses, and calculate gains and losses, &quot;creating anxiety&quot; will be the inevitable outcome; and if you only look at the perspective of experts and scholars and look at theoretical deductions and introductions to teaching methods, the concepts are often not grounded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book &quot;The Foundation of Education&quot;, there is a sentence that particularly touched me: &quot;On the one hand, we say that the future of the world belongs to children, but on the other hand, the world does not belong to children.&quot; Why so? Because our education often relies on adults&#39; strategies, calculations, imagination and designs to regulate children&#39;s actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I recently talked with some experts and principals about the topic of &quot;cultivating top innovative talents&quot;, which is also the next national talent strategy. So, will cultivating top innovative talents become the task of schools and the test question of students? Probably. Will it become the target of a new round of parental anxiety? It&#39;s also very possible. So how can we avoid this from happening and cultivate top innovative talents in a positive environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Quanyu wrote clearly: &quot;Creativity is not a skill, but a trait latent in people&#39;s physical and psychological levels. It cannot be taught, let alone trained!&quot; &quot;Only when scientific thinking revitalizes scientific knowledge, knowledge can It is power. In this sense, &#39;burden reduction&#39; is to cultivate scientific thinking, to reduce the burden placed on children by the authority of elders and artificial standards, and to activate dead knowledge into youthful innovation power.&quot; &quot;Children&#39;s wisdom is not Use it not to repeat others, but to create your own!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These golden sentences are scattered in the book. Innovation is essentially a kind of breakthrough, breaking the existing pattern to explore the unknown world. Innovation ability cannot be taught, but it can be cultivated. The way to cultivate it is to create an environment that allows teachers to &quot;teach less&quot; and children to explore and then &quot;enlighten more&quot;. From fragmented insights to systematic cognition, personalized judgment, and ultimately creative action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Education does not mean forcing your children to stand on a trend that does not belong to you. This can be seen as the third &quot;reading method&quot; of this book - understanding the value of people from education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The author is the editor-in-chief of &quot;EnsightEdu&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is the personal opinion of the author and does not represent the position of this newspaper) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[让纳米技术拥有绚丽色彩——透视2023年诺贝尔化学奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258218]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-07 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/07/FQYbemG8URIyG2yv7slZL84HQntDr Xd8lGABUf3o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253262&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 4, 2023 local time, Stockholm, Sweden, announced the 2023 2023 When he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, he used flasks in the laboratory to explain. French-born Mongi Bavandi, American Louis Bruce and Russian-born Alexey Yerkimov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for their research on tiny particles known as quantum dots . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 4, 2023, Beijing time, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Awarded to Moungi G. Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louis E. Brus&amp;nbsp; of Columbia University, and Alexei Ikimo of the Nanocrystal Technology Company of the United States. Alexei I. Ekimov for their contributions to the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What are quantum dots? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots, also known as semiconductor nanocrystals, are semiconductor crystal particles composed of thousands of atoms that are generally less than 20 nanometers in size. Quantum dots have a specific three-dimensional structure, usually spherical or ellipsoidal. Generally, quantum dots are composed of a &quot;core&quot; made of semiconductor materials such as cadmium selenium or lead sulfide; sometimes the core of the quantum dot is wrapped by another material to form a &quot;shell&quot; ” to improve its optical and electronic properties. Quantum dots are one of the smallest building blocks in nanotechnology. Generally speaking, the properties of an element depend on how many electrons it has. Quantum phenomena appear when matter shrinks to the nanometer scale. This means that the properties of an element will be determined by the size of the substance, not by the number of electrons it possesses. Comprised of just a thousand atoms, a quantum dot is to a football what a football is to the Earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, physicist Herbert Froehlich predicted that once particles were small enough (so-called nanoparticles), they would be affected by the strange magic of quantum mechanics. . To explain this quantum phenomenon, Judith Giordan, president of the American Chemical Society, told AFP, &quot;Think of it as a small box. When the particle shrinks small enough, the electrons will hit the sides of the box. .&quot; In a larger box, electrons hit the sides less frequently, which means they have less energy. For quantum dots, the larger box emits red light, while the smaller box emits blue light. That means by controlling the size of the particles, scientists can turn their crystals into red, blue and any color in between. But it would be 40 years after Froelich predicted it before anyone could actually observe the phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The great discovery of ultra-small particles&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots are a new type of material different from molecules. Due to the effect of quantum mechanics, as long as these nanoparticles are adjusted Their size can change their properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, physicists speculated that size-related quantum effects might occur in nanoparticles. At the time, however, it seemed impossible to recreate this effect in the real world. To do this, researchers need a perfect crystalline material, and they need to control the size of the nanomaterial very precisely, sculpting it layer by layer, so few believe this research is possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the early 1980s Ikimov and Bruce respectively proved that it could be done. Ikimov created a size-dependent quantum effect in colored glass. By changing the temperature and heating time of the molten glass, he found that he could change the size of the resulting particles. The smaller the particles, the bluer the light they emitted. This colorful experiment allowed Ikimov to successfully achieve size-dependent quantum effects in colored glass. His experimental results proved that the size of nanoparticles can control the properties of materials through quantum effects, laying the foundation for subsequent research and applications. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about the same time, Bruce became the first to discover this colorful quantum effect in liquid solutions, demonstrating the size and color of nanoparticles floating freely in solutions and gaseous compounds. the relationship between. These findings have sparked intense interest in how these tiny dots can be exploited for a variety of applications. Bruce also became the first scientist to demonstrate that free-floating nanoparticles have size-dependent quantum effects. His research provides important experimental evidence for understanding and exploiting the quantum properties of nanoparticles and advances the development of nanotechnology. His work has broad application prospects in fields such as electronics, optics and biomedicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for quantum dots to be truly useful, you need to be able to make them in solution and precisely control their size. In 1993, Bawendi revolutionized the chemical production of quantum dots in his lab at MIT. He developed a method to precisely control the rate at which crystals grow in solution and figured out how to stop the crystals when they reached the desired size. He first injected chemical reagents into the solution to instantly form tiny crystals, and then quickly adjusted the temperature of the solution to prevent their growth. Bawendi revolutionized the chemical production of quantum dots, which greatly improved their quality and paved the way for their use in a variety of applications. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Wide application prospects&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots are a representative material of the &quot;size effect&quot; of nanomaterials. They are used in more and more fields. It has been applied more widely and deeply, from optoelectronic devices to photocatalysis to biological detection, almost covering people&#39;s current and future daily life needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots now glow in computer monitors and television screens based on quantum light-emitting diode technology. They also add nuance to the light of some LED lights, and are used by biochemists and doctors to map biological tissue. Quantum dots, for example, make it possible to change the color of LED lights very precisely and significantly increase their efficiency. The glowing fluorescent dots are injected into the body and attach to immune cells that aggregate into cancerous tissue, helping surgeons distinguish tumors that are even hard to see. Tuning the ability to absorb different wavelengths of light could also create customized solar cells that are highly efficient in different situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots have brought huge benefits to mankind. In the future, they could contribute to flexible electronics, tiny sensors, thinner solar cells and encrypted quantum communications, so we&#39;re just beginning to explore the potential of these tiny particles. Through the selection and issuance of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, we can find that the Nobel Prize Committee not only pays attention to past contributions, but also pays attention to the possible impact of a discovery on the future. The ability to modulate nanoparticles by changing their size or surface properties could lead to a variety of as yet unexplored possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江西省人大常委会原党组副书记、副主任殷美根被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258198]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-07 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;With the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission reviewed the former deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial People’s Congress , Deputy Director Yin Meigan conducted a case review and investigation on serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, Yin Meigan lost her ideals and beliefs, deviated from party principles, had no sense of discipline and law, resisted organizational review, and engaged in superstitious activities; ignored the spirit of the eight central regulations, accepted gifts and money in violation of regulations, and entered and exited Private clubs; failing to report personal matters as required, failing to explain problems truthfully when organizing interviews and correspondence; borrowing money and housing from management and service recipients, being morally corrupt, and engaging in power, sex, and money transactions; violating regulations and intervening in market economic activities. and disciplinary and law enforcement activities; neglecting the education of spouses and children; forming a community of interests with unscrupulous businessmen, collaborating with relatives to engage in power and money transactions, taking advantage of the convenience of one&#39;s position to seek benefits for others in job promotions, project contracting, etc., and illegally accepting Huge amounts of property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yin Meigan seriously violated the party’s political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, work discipline and life discipline, constituting a serious job violation and suspected of bribery crime, and did not restrain or stop after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. , is serious in nature and has a bad impact, and should be dealt with seriously.

He doesn&#39;t like revising drafts or attending meetings, and he doesn&#39;t endorse or talk about the discourse system that may be a mixture of film screenwriting reference book theory and Internet platform &quot;playing methods.&quot; He didn’t even meet the actors, go to the set, or compare the differences between his script and the final product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a writer, I really empathize with his approach: he only does what he wants to do, and doesn’t do anything he doesn’t want to do; at the same time, I feel that he can live in a small world with his own rules. , how difficult it is to make money, and how lucky it is at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing an interview with Director Li Xiaofeng for this topic (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;he has collaborated with Wang Mu several times&lt;/span>; ), I envy that kind of atmosphere even more. Everyone has a consensus on the concept of creation and trusts each other&#39;s personality and talents. This is the basis. On top of this, Li Xiaofeng gave a popular description, &quot;Whoever holds the knife eats the meat.&quot; Whoever writes this draft Write with your own characteristics. We don&#39;t need to be screwed together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng said that creative freedom is particularly important. It may be unstable, but it can ensure physical and mental health. I can understand what Li Xiaofeng means by &quot;unstable&quot;. &quot;Girl Nezha&quot; and &quot;Rebirth from the Ashes&quot;, which he directed and Wang Mu co-wrote, did not receive particularly high Douban ratings, but I liked them very much. Fully respect everyone&#39;s opinions and creative temperament. The effect may not be good enough, but the participants will definitely feel comfortable and some viewers will also enjoy watching it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Mu and Li Xiaofeng collaborated once more. The script &quot;Hypnotized by Water&quot; written by Wang Mu won a screenplay award at the Busan International Film Festival, but was not filmed due to lack of funds. But of course, success is not the most important, at least not the only valid criterion. At this point, I think their creations have returned to the essence of creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview with Wang Mu did not go as smoothly as I expected. He is not a cinephile director, and I am a layman in theater. When interviewing him himself, after several back and forths, I still couldn’t fully understand what it meant that drama held far more weight in his heart than movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peripheral interviews helped me. Li Xiaofeng said that Wang Mu is a serious creator. He likes Chekhov. His novel writing style is very static. There is a bust of Lu Xun in his home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng also talked about their first collaboration on the script for &quot;Rebirth from the Ashes&quot;. In this play, people in the 2010s have to look back to the 1990s, when ethical relationships changed dramatically and shocks occurred in people&#39;s hearts. The script was previously called &quot;Chasing&quot;, and there were already seven drafts when Wang Mu joined. Xu Feng and Li Xiaofeng, one of the protagonists, have imagined several identities, including repair shop workers, postmen, etc. Wang Mu changed Xu Feng&#39;s occupation to worker. Li Xiaofeng immediately felt that it was accurate, &quot;That movie actually contains a lot of thinking about social forms. Wang Mu wrote Xu Feng as a young man who was greatly affected by family and social changes, and he was also very innocent. He made Xu Feng&#39;s purity and ours The emotions for the working class are unified.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think of &quot;The Tender Shell&quot; again. Wang Mu looked for image references for the young male and female protagonists who were traumatized and redeemed each other. Dai Chun was Peter Sheff. Allen in &quot;Ikus&quot;, Juexiao is Antigone in the Greek myth written by Sophocles. Li Xiaofeng said that when he watched &quot;The Gentle Shell&quot;, he felt that &quot;there is a little bit of stagnation. The characters in Wang Mu&#39;s works have a relatively high quality and density of souls.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think about it, as the first work of a young director, it has no popular stars and does not have endless road shows like the movies in the past few months. It can get more than 12 million at the box office, which is pretty good.

She has been missing for more than 10 years. 60 hours. The local police, firefighting and private rescue teams have been searching for days. On the 7th, Li Chenguang, the captain of the Shanghai Dandelion Rescue Team who participated in the search and rescue, told Nandu reporters that after the water receded on the evening of the 6th, the rescue team searched along the breakwater along the low-tide coastline. The girl was found but has not yet been found. According to the introduction, the beach where the girl was lost is a mud beach impacted by rip currents, and is not a scenic spot. &quot;We have always discouraged everyone from entering, but when the weather is good, people do play here every day.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About Regarding the controversy over how far the girl was from the coast when she was lost, Li Chenguang analyzed it to Nandu reporters. If the girl was lost around 17:30, the girl’s father was not as far away from the shore as he said when he left. According to recent hydrology It is estimated that the location of the incident is about 100 meters from the shore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Pudong police report, the girl’s father said that when the incident occurred, he returned to the shore to get his mobile phone and left the girl alone on the beach. He returned more than ten minutes later but did not find his daughter. Surveillance footage showed that the girl waited in place for about 10 minutes, then walked towards the water, fell down at the water&#39;s edge and disappeared into the waves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/fdedb3e1be01a5c599cb91d2793c8e42.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/fdedb3e1be01a5c599cb91d2793c8e42.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253229&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The lost girl. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;4-year-old girl disappeared in the waves&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of October 5, the girl’s parents posted a message for help on social platforms, saying that their daughter died in October. Lost on Nanhui New Town Beach at around 17:20 on the 4th, 4 and a half years old, 108cm tall, wearing a blue Elsa princess dress, no shoes or socks, with a bow on each side of her head and two small braids at the end of her hair. , wearing a yellow butterfly headband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the police information report issued by the Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau on the 6th, at about 18:40 on October 4, the girl’s parents went to the Lingang New City Police Station of the Pudong Public Security Bureau for help, saying that their 4-year-old daughter Lost while playing at the beach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl’s father said that he took his family to the beach that day, and he took his daughter Huang Moumou to the beach about 20 meters away from the sea to play. During the process, he went back to get his cell phone and left the girl alone on the beach. More than ten minutes later, he returned to the beach but could not find his daughter. Because it was dark and the search failed, he asked the police for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving the report, the Pudong police immediately organized a large number of police forces to conduct a dragnet search along the coast. The fire department dispatched infrared sensor drones. Relevant personnel searched throughout the night, but no trace of the girl was found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, the Pudong police, together with the Fire Rescue Corps, organized nearly 200 people from 6 rescue teams including Lantian and Houtian to carry out a comprehensive search. At the same time, the organization personnel checked more than 20 surveillance probes around the beach one by one, and initially ruled out the possibility that the girl was taken away from the beach by others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the on-site probe is far away, people can only appear as blurry white dots in the image. It was not until evening that his father finally pointed out the exact location of the girl when he and the girl were separated on the surveillance. Based on this, the police found the suspected girl&#39;s figure among the nearly 100 people in the image. After waiting in place for about 10 minutes, she walked towards the water. Go, fall down by the water and disappear into the waves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report stated that at present, Pudong police have coordinated with hydrology experts from Shanghai Ocean University and Maritime University to analyze the flow direction to further carry out search work.

The subsequent search work focused on searching in the breakwater along the low-tide coastline after the tide ebbed at around 6 p.m., because the girl might have been swept away. He rushed back and got stuck in the breakwater.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Chenguang told Nandu reporters that local police and fire fighters had searched the girl on the night of the 4th, but the search on the nights of the 5th and 6th still did not find the girl. &quot;The Coast Guard also arrived at the scene yesterday. Maybe the government will have more power in the next step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Chenguang, the beach where the incident occurred is a mud beach impacted by rip currents, and the sand quality is not good. It&#39;s not a scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This tidal flat is not allowed to enter now. In fact, everyone has been discouraged from entering, including the victim. They also climbed over it. The coastline here is relatively long. When the weather is good, there are indeed people there every day. We play here, including ourselves sometimes, but the sea water is still quite dangerous. This time I also remind everyone to pay attention to safety, especially to watch the children.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About the distance when the girl was lost Regarding the controversy over how far the coast is, Li Chenguang analyzed to Nandu reporters that if the girl went missing around 17:30, the girl&#39;s father was not as far away from the shore as he said when he left. &quot;Because according to the recent hydrological conditions, the exposed beach surface during this period is only one or two hundred meters in total.

The feeling of being worse spans time and geography and is a common social phenomenon that can even be traced back to more than 2,000 years ago. If such a feeling is real and accurate, it may mean that human moral standards have been steadily declining and reaching new lows for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is also another possibility, that is, the general moral decay and declining social order are just people&#39;s illusions. There is a certain pattern behind it that causes people in different eras and different regions to always have such similar feelings. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, researchers from Columbia University and Harvard University used more than 12 million related scientific data to verify people&#39;s views on moral development trends. The results found that the subjective feeling of &quot;the world is declining&quot; is indeed not an individual time. , a phenomenon that occurs in individual places, but is extremely universal. However, through more objective comparisons of survey data over decades, researchers are also convinced that these subjective feelings of &quot;the present is not as good as it used to be&quot; are actually an illusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Universal and lasting feeling&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This study was published in the magazine &quot;Nature&quot; in June 2023 and relied on data from recent times around the world. Sixty countries and a time span of more than 70 years. Through these horizontal and vertical comparisons, the elders have a more scientific explanation for the criticism of young people that &quot;one generation is inferior to the other&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For most people, morality mainly refers to the way people treat other people in daily life, such as whether they are honest, polite or even willing to help others, etc. The researchers used a series of survey data dating back to the 1940s to understand people&#39;s attitudes toward moral changes. The surveys included direct questions about trends, such as “Do you feel our society’s integrity and ethical behavior have changed more, less, or the same over the past few decades?” “Now do you feel the moral values ​​of the country as a whole have changed?” Better or worse?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that in more than 80% of the survey items, most people believe that the moral level of the entire society is declining. Specifically, people are more likely to experience moral decline when the comparison period is longer. For example, when comparing the longer period of the past ten years to the past year, people are more likely to feel that the level of social morality is declining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some recent surveys, researchers have also found that age is also an important factor in how people feel. People will feel that people today are less friendly and less sincere than the people they saw when they were 20 years old. Similarly, they will also feel that the people they saw at 20 years old are not as moral as the people they were born in. And overall, older people feel more morally bankrupt than younger people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But has social morality really been declining? Some more concrete and objective investigation shows that this is not the case. In addition to asking people generally about their feelings about moral changes, decades of survey data include direct questions about a wide range of people&#39;s specific moral behaviors. For example, &quot;Were you respected by the people around you yesterday?&quot; &quot;In the past 12 months, how often did you give up your seat to strangers, give directions, look after things, or lend money to others?&quot; The results of a number of surveys on specific moral behaviors are clear. By comparing people&#39;s records of their own and their peers&#39; moral behaviors in different eras, the moral level is actually relatively stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when evaluating some specific social and moral issues, people may feel moral improvement. For example, when the survey asked about how to treat people with disabilities and sexual minorities, many people believed that society was making progress. These data all show that although when people generally evaluate social moral changes, they will feel from the bottom of their hearts that morality has been declining or even getting worse. However, by comparing relatively more objective specific moral behaviors, the subjective judgment of moral decline cannot be held up. foot. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Happier and more ethical&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I do often hear people say that people are becoming more and more selfish and less generous. Etc. I hear this statement both from the public and other academics. However, I always point out that the data shows this is not true. This latest study is very convincing and I agree with the author, though Many people feel that this is the case, but there is no objective evidence that moral standards are actually declining.&quot; Abigail Marsh, a professor in the Department of Psychology at Georgetown University, told Southern Weekend reporters that some of her own research shows that , some forms of altruistic behavior are actually on the rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, she collaborated with researchers from the Department of Psychology at Harvard University and other institutions to conduct a summary analysis of survey data on altruistic behavior in a large number of countries. The results found that a country’s altruistic behavior is related to the subjective happiness of local people. There is a positive correlation. When the material resources and cultural value of a place support people from both objective and subjective conditions, and people feel happier, altruistic behavior will also increase. Moreover, the more individualistic values ​​prevail in places, the greater this effect will be. obvious. Relevant research was published in Psychological Science, and similar conclusions were also included in the latest edition of the 2023 World Happiness Report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Some data suggest that altruistic behavior, especially toward distant strangers, generally increases over time. This may be because happiness increases, and as happiness increases Altruistic behavior appears to be increasing as well. These studies also show that around the world, where subjective well-being is higher, there are also higher levels of various altruistic and generous behaviors, such as being more likely to donate to charity and volunteer. Serve, help strangers, donate blood, donate organs and bone marrow, and treat animals humanely.&quot; Of course, ethics is more than selflessness and generosity, but these are important components of ethics, Abigail Marsh explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The findings of the latest research highlight this paradox about morality. On the one hand, human society has been developing in terms of material and spiritual culture, and there is no reasonable explanation for the continued decline in morality. On the other hand, there are differences in the level of development, cultural traditions, and people&#39;s happiness in various places. Under such circumstances, the widespread moral decay is even more unreasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analysis, Columbia University psychologist Adam M. Mastroianni and Harvard University psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert, who participated in the latest study, believe , two common psychological laws may explain this strange social phenomenon. One is an attention bias and the other is a memory bias. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Psychological biases that are prone to occur&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A large number of psychological studies have found that humans are fascinated by negative information about others and always tend to search for and pay attention to negative information. It&#39;s such a good thing that negative information in the mass media has received more attention. This creates an attention bias. When recalling past events, people tend to forget those bad experiences and are more likely to remember some good memories, showing a memory bias. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, when people look at the current society, they may pay more attention to the dark side of society, including immoral people and things. When comparing the past, it is easier to remember the good people and good deeds and forget the immoral behavior, thus feeling that the world is deteriorating and people&#39;s hearts are not as old as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to verify the influence of these two psychological effects, the researchers also changed the participants&#39; attention through experiments, asking them to focus on familiar people such as family and friends in their social circle. The results were obvious. Double answer. People believe that the moral level of people in society as a whole is declining, but the moral level of their acquaintances and relatives has not only not declined, but has improved. Similarly, when people put aside the influence of memory bias and compared two eras that they had never experienced, the phenomenon of moral decline also disappeared. Generally speaking, people believe that the moral decay of society begins when they are born. These different answers are indeed intriguing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that there are still some limitations to the latest research, including inaccuracies in historical data measurements. The combined effect of attention and memory biases is only an explanation that the latest research attempts to give, and it is not enough to scientifically prove the reason behind the phenomenon of moral turpitude illusion. People all over the world, both ancient and modern, lament the deterioration of society. There may be other reasons behind this social phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, some scientists have indeed given slightly different explanations before. Researchers from the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara believe that personal characteristics play an important role in this phenomenon. In real life, a considerable part of the scenes of lamenting the deterioration of society and moral decline are caused by the elders blaming the younger ones. In the eyes of these elders, today&#39;s children are incomparable to them in the past and have lost many beautiful moral qualities. Research has found that in such accusations, elders can easily form a series of biased opinions based on personal characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if you are good at something, you will be more likely to focus on other people&#39;s shortcomings in this aspect; if you have advantages or preferences in a certain aspect, you will assume that everyone was like this when you were a child. This self-centered attention bias and memory bias may have given rise to the impression that &quot;one generation is inferior to the other&quot;. In this impression, the shortcomings of young people are so glaring, and the qualities that everyone in the older generation has now been lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Difficulties in changing moral behavior&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;These discussions on moral changes also reflect the complexity of moral issues themselves. In 2019, Jenae M. Neiderhiser, a professor in the Department of Psychology at Pennsylvania State University, and others analyzed the moral development of children in a large number of families and found that moral quality is not entirely determined by the upbringing environment, but rather There are also genetic influences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The study, which lasted for nearly ten years, focused on two moral indicators: social responsibility in adolescents and responsibility in early adulthood. Because it also included twins of all types and brothers and sisters in recombined families, it was possible to compare genetics and The role of environmental factors in moral development. Research shows that genetic factors and the upbringing environment provided by parents jointly shape children&#39;s moral character in the early stages of adolescent growth, but after adulthood, the role of parental upbringing weakens. Relevant research was published in Behavior Genetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Professor Abigail Marsh, who has long studied altruistic behavior, moral behavior also has a physiological basis. Compared with the law of survival of the fittest driven by selfishness, altruists are willing to help others even if their own interests are harmed. This is a unique problem from the perspective of evolutionary theory. Abigail Marsh and others have used magnetic resonance imaging to study the brains of a group of extraordinary altruists and found that these people who are willing to donate kidneys to strangers can be identified by characteristics such as an increase in the size of the right amygdala. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People often refer to these extraordinary altruists who are willing to risk themselves to help others as &#39;patron saints&#39; or &#39;saints.&#39; But our research suggests that biological phenomena may help explain why some People engage in extraordinary altruistic behavior. This may be because they have specific neurological and cognitive characteristics that make them more concerned about the well-being of others than the average person.&quot; Abigail, who is also a professor in the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience at Georgetown University Marsh told Southern Weekend reporters that morality is fundamentally about weighing the consequences of oneself and others in behavior, and a series of studies have shown that there are biological differences behind some people choosing to value the happiness of others more. &quot;The brain is designed to learn and adapt. In general, I believe that people help others based on their true values ​​and that they genuinely care about the well-being of others. If people generally become more selfless over time, then It must be because we have learned to value the happiness of others more. What we don’t quite understand, however, is how to increase the importance one attaches to the happiness of others in some targeted way.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This It also means that understanding and changing moral behavior itself may be more difficult than the common delusion of moral decay. More importantly, for the real society, if people in a society have formed a consensus of moral decay and believe that the social moral level is declining, then both the direction of public policy and the development of interpersonal behavior will have a negative impact. produce a negative impact. After all, a society with a declining moral level contains the motivation to restore tradition and return to the past in the public arena, which may trigger a series of socially regressive behaviors. And once people believe that the world is in decline, the way of interpersonal communication may also develop in the direction of mutual distrust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many psychological surveys have found that because they underestimate the kindness of strangers, people are more hesitant to ask strangers for help, and they are less afraid to take the initiative to say hello to strangers. This interpersonal environment of mutual distrust has greatly affected people&#39;s happiness and sense of belonging to society. The illusion of a declining social moral level may be one of the reasons for this phenomenon. What’s even more frightening is that people are often very sensitive to changes in social norms and behavioral norms. Once they make a mistake in judgment, it may lead to truly unethical behavior in the subtle process. These highlight the significance of a correct understanding of this illusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
