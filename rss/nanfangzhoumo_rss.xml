The female writer seems to be good at avoiding questions, and once turned into the guest and became the questioner. The young reporter sitting opposite her seemed a little overwhelmed and had no choice but to follow her wishes and start chatting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly, the music played by the writer&#39;s husband came from upstairs, which was deafening, and his dissatisfaction was obvious. The interview was terminated and the female reporter left. Shortly after she left, the writer&#39;s husband was found dead in the snow outside the cabin by their son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question is, who is the murderer? According to previous suspense narrative strategies, the plot always has to go through multiple reversals before the truth comes to light. The film &quot;Anatomy of a Death from a Fall&quot;, which just won the Palme d&#39;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023, provides another solution. Director Justine Trier does not seem to care whether the plot is reversed, and it does not even matter who the murderer is. unimportant. Putting aside the cloak of suspense, Trier is more interested in how people use their own narratives to complete the analysis of a death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film cleverly sets up the court trial, so that the intimate relationships that should be in the private realm are laid bare and presented to the public. One party wants to prove murder, and the other wants to prove her innocence by proving that her husband committed suicide. Both parties are trying to use their own narratives to get closer to the truth, and all clues may become evidence in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a novelist, Sandler Voight&#39;s writing has become the object of scrutiny by the prosecution. &quot;Her life is in the book, especially her relationships.&quot; In the novel, the wife&#39;s disgust for her husband, the possibility of her husband&#39;s death, and the imagination of how to kill are all understood as reflections of the real motivations for killing. Under this kind of scrutiny, the narratives in the book are no longer complete. They are cut into fragments or even sentences, and then the narrative is reconstructed using human will to connect it with reality in the mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the key pieces of evidence in the film is the recording of her husband Samuel before his death. Samuel is a former teacher who also enjoys writing. Out of guilt for being partially responsible for his son Daniel&#39;s permanent vision impairment, Samuel spent a great deal of his time on various family matters and on Daniel&#39;s company. He seemed unapologetic and willing, but the recording revealed another side of the family&#39;s close relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recording, Samuel asked his wife to reconsider the division of labor in the family, believing that he had sacrificed too much personal time on family affairs and that he wanted more time to write. After listening, Sandler mocked him coldly, saying that a writer would not stop writing just because he had children and housework. No one forced him, and he did not owe him anything. The director seemed to have intentionally reversed the genders. What Samuel experienced was actually the helpless and struggling situation of many women in married relationships in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, the dispute between the two in the recording became more intense. Sandler&#39;s bisexual identity, cheating and other private information were revealed one by one from Samuel&#39;s mouth, and fell into the ears of everyone in the trial. In the view of the prosecution, these are the motives and reasons for the unbalanced relationship between husband and wife and the wife to murder her husband. Here, the recording, which originally only recorded a certain dimension of the relationship between people, is also used to refer to the whole picture, helping the prosecution complete the deduction and reconstruction of the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sandler attempted to deny this ever-reconstructed narrative, telling Samuel&#39;s psychiatrist, who was one of the witnesses, &quot;You&#39;re only telling a small part of the whole situation. A pair of Husband and wife are like a mess...&quot; She believed that this did not prove that she was the murderer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paradox is that Sandler himself is also consciously or unconsciously self-narrating the truth, including her husband&#39;s unusual behavior in taking medicine six months before his death, seeing a psychiatrist, and being depressed in writing, etc. , all became her reconstruction of the reasons for his suicide during the defense process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the evidence fragments presented by both the prosecution and the defense are real, perhaps no one dares to confirm that the suicide or homicide story reconstructed based on these fragments is the truth itself. As director Justine Trier said, &quot;This is very modern, this is how we live today. In the trial, various things change and are given extra weight, resulting in new fictions.&quot; &quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The evidence was not only presented in front of the prosecution and defense, but also slowly unfolded in front of his son Daniel, who also began to look at his parents again. At first, he had no doubts about his mother, but as the two sides narrated at the trial, his attitude gradually became swaying, and he even had an image in his mind of his mother hitting his father hard and pushing him downstairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, he also tried to give medicine to the dog to verify the fact that his mother said that his father had vomited after taking medicine. He also recalled the conversation his father had with him when he sent the dog to the doctor. He thought This revealed his father&#39;s suicidal tendencies. From various swings to his own selection of factual fragments after review, Daniel finally constructed his own narrative version of the truth in his mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/HSp4I05LqVgIERt0uszA4B1zVAGtWR6wapo1Ubgq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/HSp4I05LqVgIERt0uszA4B1zVAGtWR6wapo1Ubgq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256875&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A still from &quot;Anatomy of Death from a Fall&quot; (also translated as &quot;Judgment of a Fall&quot;). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Justine Trier once mentioned in an interview, &quot;These trials have a profound impact on people.&quot; It&#39;s a nightmare to say because your own life is being taken away from you. Everyone is creating a fiction and not really trying to get to the truth. I&#39;m very fascinated by truth and trying to find it through stories and I find that very interesting .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director also wants to draw the audience into the search for the truth and the construction of the narrative. Under the shell of suspense, we as the audience have naturally been thinking about who the murderer is since Samuel fell from the building. In the battle between the prosecution and the defense, every time they list new evidence, make new statements and excuses, we, like Daniel, can&#39;t help but turn our eyes to Samuel and Sandler, trying to learn from the evidence provided by both sides. Find your own narrative from factual evidence and their narratives to deduce the truth of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But outside the film, we are more passive. All narratives are always based on the characters&#39; interpretation of the truth in the film, which also means that our perception of the truth is more uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film ends with Sandler being found not guilty. Since there are elements of fiction on both sides, why does one narrative prevail over the other? Perhaps it was the emotional power of it - Daniel&#39;s monologue about his father moved the judge and helped his mother win. After Sandler came home, Daniel hugged and kissed her. In the silence of the room, a rare warmth lingered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this the truth? Not really. In the previous narratives from all parties, the director has successfully planted the seeds of doubt in the hearts of the audience. Even if Sandler was found not guilty, people&#39;s hesitation and uncertainty about the truth have not disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sandra Wheeler, who plays the heroine, once asked the director about the script, whether her character was guilty or innocent. Trier told her, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I hope You act as if she is innocent&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She could be responsible but not guilty, or she could be guilty but not responsible. She could be responsible for driving him to suicide but not guilty of killing him, or she could be guilty of killing him without wanting to. to kill him - either in an impulsive way or in a way that we can try to imagine. The truth is there, but it is too complex to grasp here.&quot; Director Justine Trier said in Said this in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But looking back, the truth may no longer be important. Fiction is a human talent. As long as you are willing, you can construct your own narrative with the help of a few keywords. However, if the relationships between people are like this death, being scrutinized and reconstructed, then in fact, no relationship can withstand such rigorous and detailed analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[亚太安全专家谈：中国发展红利被周边国家共享]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259863]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After the end of the Cold War, despite some geopolitical tensions or regional hot issues, the Asia-Pacific region has still maintained peace Stablize. In Europe and the Middle East, wars broke out one after another. How to interpret such an international situation? Why has the Asia-Pacific region been able to maintain peace and stability for decades? How to continue to maintain a prosperous and stable Asia-Pacific? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 29, 2023, at the &quot;Dialogue of Chinese and Foreign Experts&quot; at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, many Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in-depth discussions on topics such as &quot;China&#39;s role in maintaining Asia-Pacific security.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying, former vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#39;s Republic of China and founder of the Tsinghua Institute for International Security Strategy, said at the meeting that after the Cold War, the Asia-Pacific region seized the opportunity, quickly opened up to the outside world, and quickly entered regional integration. In the past few decades, there have been no major wars, political conflicts, or major social unrest in the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed peaceful development for more than 40 years. In this process, China has played a central role. The dividends of China&#39;s rapid regional development have been shared by neighboring countries. China is also the largest international player in most Asia-Pacific countries. trading partner country,&quot; Fu Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 29, 2023, many Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in-depth discussions on topics such as &quot;China&#39;s role in maintaining Asia-Pacific security.&quot; src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/3e0785ae47.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/03/3e0785ae47.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256830&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;October 29, 2023 , many Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in-depth discussions on topics such as &quot;China&#39;s role in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific.&quot; (Yao Yijiang/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Economic Development Miracle&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t know if you remember that in the 1980s (of the last century), when the Asia-Pacific region began multilateral cooperation, China also joined the regional integration At the time of globalization, many countries are still walking on the edge of development and poverty.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying said in her speech that over the past long period of time, the Asia-Pacific region has achieved extremely rapid economic development, surpassing There are many countries and regions in the market. Citing data from the Bank of Asia, she said that in the past 42 years, Asia&#39;s GDP has grown sevenfold. This phenomenon is also called the &quot;economic development miracle in the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying believes that peace and stability, regional focus on cooperation and dialogue, and economic globalization are important reasons for the economic development of the Asia-Pacific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the unique driving forces behind decades of stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In order to maintain long-term stability and security in the Asia-Pacific, we need to discover a unique &#39;Asia-Pacific model.&#39;&quot; Chen Dongxiao, president of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said that &quot;open regionalism&quot; is an important driving factor , and this concept contains many contents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First of all, economic development cooperation is the focus. It transcends ideologies and government differences. Secondly, under regional openness, no matter big or small, all countries need to abide by relevant rules and regulations and should Follow social rules in an equal way. It is very important that we should not have double standards,&quot; said Chen Dongxiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, wars have been raging in Europe and the Middle East in recent years. During the forum discussion, two European and American scholars also expressed their thoughts on the &quot;differences between China and the West.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why is the Asia-Pacific region different from Europe? There are many reasons behind it.” Michael Swain, chief director of the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute of National Affairs in the United States, believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sergei Karaganov, dean of the School of World Economics and International Affairs at the Russian State Higher University of Economics, agreed with Shi Wen’s point of view, saying that “it is still in the early stages and we still have to remain cautious.” . At the same time, he also emphasized the &quot;cultural factors&quot; in Europe that were different from Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;European history is filled with many wars. European peace or war is always closely related to Europe&#39;s internal problems.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The risks of U.S. leadership are growing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As for the role of the United States in Asia-Pacific security, Huang Jae-ho, director of the Center for International Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said, &quot;Although there is no perfect leadership in the world ( model), but the risks of U.S. leadership are growing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the U.S. policy toward China as an example, he said that from the Trump administration to the current Biden administration, the United States has undergone many changes in overall strategy and economic details. &quot;The United States has not seen the overall situation clearly, and its strategies and tactics are unclear. Therefore, the United States lacks a consistent vision and policy, which has caused instability in the current international order.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the meeting, Michael Swan, chief director of the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute of National Affairs, mentioned in his speech that &quot;China&#39;s ultimate security role in Asia is still uncertain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying directly refuted this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t quite agree with this type of view. Mr. Michael Sven&#39;s logic is very confusing.&quot; Fu Ying said that China has actively promoted economic development in the Asia-Pacific region, and the United States has also benefited a lot from it. . This &quot;unconvincing&quot; logic probably originates from the theory of power change in the international community for hundreds of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, you know that China’s development background is completely different.” She said that there are big differences between China and the United States. But it does not affect China and the United States in pursuing their own development and supporting and benefiting from each other. If you think that China&#39;s strength has become a &quot;threat&quot; in the Asia-Pacific region, how should you view the rise of emerging countries such as India and Indonesia in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying also pointed out that the United States is currently anxious about its declining global influence, but this is not a problem caused by China, but the result of &quot;economic globalization and the United States itself making too many mistakes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The United States&#39; own problems make it difficult. Look at what benefits the United States has gained from the trade war? The trade war has caused the U.S.-China trade deficit to continue to increase, but has it reduced China&#39;s exports to the United States? In fact, it is not, on the contrary, the data is still increasing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She proposed that the United States should be an active contributor to the development of the region, rather than trying to use competition to prioritize and define the region&#39;s agenda and &quot;hijack&quot; A long-term agenda for successful cooperation, dialogue and economic development in the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Finding balance and crisis management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In their speeches, many scholars unanimously stated that the old balance in the international order may be broken and new changes are about to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sergey Karaganov said that as the United States and Western society began to exert influence to change globalization, the so-called era of globalization has ended. He said that we must have a new theory or a new global governance model, and this model must be decided by all partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For so many years, we have been saying that we want to achieve a win-win situation and that we want to benefit all parties involved. But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world. Sometimes we need to be shocked and we need to and reach a balance with different countries,” Sergey Karaganov said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Michael Swan said that any international system must balance the needs of different countries and cooperate after balancing. (Countries) need to seek common interests, have the same demands for economic development, and whether there are the same issues left over from history that need to be resolved, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He insisted that the current uncertainty still exists between countries and cannot be controlled. Countries large and small will be affected by changes in power, and there will undoubtedly be uncertainty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It cannot be said that China believes that all countries are unified and we can do this. It cannot solve many basic problems. Moreover, this is not caused by the United States, but due to structural changes. Yes, it will also trigger changes in the international order.&quot; Shi Wen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how to maintain security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region before the new international order is formed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Dongxiao proposed the &quot;three no&#39;s&quot; principle - that is, not to divide the group camp, not to initiate military war, especially nuclear war, and not to use double standards. &quot;In the past few years, the Chinese government has repeatedly reiterated on many occasions that war is not a good way to deal with differences between countries. On the contrary, it brings more crises.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Dongxiao believes that Sino-US relations are an important factor in regional security. At the same time, the role of small countries in the Asia-Pacific region cannot be ignored, and they should not be divided into any faction. &quot;Some neutral countries, such as ASEAN countries, can play an important role in dealing with differences and achieving related cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Zaihao pointed out that compared with other regions, the Asia-Pacific region is relatively stable and China and the United States can maintain a relative balance. There are currently outside voices claiming that China and the United States have entered a &quot;new Cold War,&quot; but he believes this is more like a &quot;complex competition.&quot; Moreover, the two major countries have now begun crisis management and set up communication channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, there is no war now, only fighting, so it can still be controlled.” Huang Zaihao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[九名市州长“进京检讨”：自然资源部组建以来首次高规格集中、公开约谈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259895]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/03/kcNAdYfHnmy6jaVIfdtcKIgbeorhtPCG5wZylf9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/kcNAdYfHnmy6jaVIfdtcKIgbeorhtPCG5wZ ylf9D. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256894&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 24, 2023, at the Yinlian Potted Flower Market, there were still flowers placed on the edge of the land with potted plants for sale. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Li Gui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the largest fresh cut flower trading market in Asia, Dounan Flower Market in Kunming City, Yunnan Province It is crowded all year round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the north side of Dounan Flower Market, across the road is another flower-related market - Yinlian Potted Flower Market. Unlike Dounan, which mainly sells fresh cut flowers, the Yinlian Potted Flower Market, built in 2012, sells mostly green plants and potted plants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years ago, there was a potted flower market where various seedlings and succulents were grown in the greenhouses, and now some vegetables are also grown there. This has to do with natural resource inspectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 15, 2023, on Funei Street in Beijing, the Ministry of Natural Resources reported on the main violations of laws and regulations discovered during routine inspections in 2023. Among them, the problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; in Yinlian Potted Flower Market was named. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to reporting on typical issues, the Ministry of Natural Resources also held an interview meeting: Entrusted by the Chief Inspector of National Natural Resources, Chen Chenzhao, the full-time Deputy Chief Inspector of National Natural Resources, reviewed the violations of laws and regulations discovered by the inspectors in 2023. The main leaders of 9 municipal (state) governments held face-to-face interviews when the problem was highlighted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The nine cities (states) are Shijiazhuang City in Hebei Province, Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province, Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province, Chuzhou City in Anhui Province, Linyi City in Shandong Province, Hechi City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Qianxinan Guizhou Province in Guizhou Province. Prefecture, Kunming City, Yunnan Province, and Lanzhou City, Gansu Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the mayors of the cities (prefectures) who represented these cities (states) in the interviews, the deputy secretaries-general of the provincial (autonomous region) governments where these cities and states are located, and the &quot;top leaders of the natural resources departments at the provincial and municipal levels&quot; ” was also asked to attend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An article published by the Office of the General Inspector of Natural Resources stated that the interview was to “face-to-face point out the outstanding problems discovered by the inspector, urge the local government to increase rectification and investigation efforts, resolutely curb illegal activities on farmland, and firmly guard the Cultivated land protection red line”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first large-scale, high-level centralized and public interview held by the Ministry of Natural Resources since its establishment in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;Illegal occupation of cultivated land&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;77 acres&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Enter from Gate 1 of Yinlian Potted Flower Market , the first thing that comes into view are various shops with the words &quot;flowers&quot;, &quot;seedlings&quot; and &quot;horticulture&quot; printed on them. In October, osmanthus, bougainvillea and various camellias are still in bloom at the entrance of some shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these shops exist in the form of greenhouses: the open air outside the house and the roof made of transparent film are covered with a black sunshade net; there are few cement and ceramic tiles on the floor inside the house, and most of them are smoothed. Yellow soil - the flower pots with plants are placed on the ground, and the roots come out from the bottom of the pot. The soil will provide them with moisture and nutrients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Go northwest along the main road for about 300 meters. The shops, greenhouses and sunshade nets have all disappeared, and both sides of the road have become empty and open spaces. There were many bulging white woven bags lying on the open ground. The word &quot;feed&quot; was printed on the outside of the bags. You could smell the stench of feces if you got close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The workers wearing sun hats tore open the bags and spread the black fertilizer on the yellow mud ground, and someone else opened it with a hoe. An excavator in the distance was working in another open space, and there was a rumbling sound. If it weren&#39;t for being in a city, the scene here would look no different from autumn sowing in the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before it became a vacant lot, it was also a greenhouse selling green plants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About a month ago, in September 2023, the greenhouse was demolished after an inspection by leaders of the Chenggong District Committee of Kunming City. On October 25, 2023, a greenhouse owner who once opened a shop here said that before the shed was demolished, he moved to the current greenhouse in August 2023. The two places are about 500 meters apart, and both are managed by Yinlian Community The established Kunming Qiding Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Kunming Qiding) is responsible for leasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greenhouse owner said that although the lease contract between the two parties was signed once a year, he had been operating the original greenhouse for nearly ten years. Talking about the reason for moving the store, he thought it was &quot;policy adjustment&quot;: &quot;That piece of land was not approved for commercial use at the time, so it was demolished.&quot; When signing the contract, Kunming Geding &quot;wasn&#39;t sure&quot; about the nature of the land. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, in a notification from the Ministry of Natural Resources, the aforementioned open land was classified as cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report shows that in February 2019, the Yinlian Potted Flower Market in Chenggong District, Kunming City was included in the scope of rectification of the &quot;big shed house&quot; problem and passed the rectification acceptance; in July 2022, the Yinlian Community will have been reclaimed The agricultural greenhouses were rented to 76 merchants for selling potted flowers, agricultural supplies, pesticides and other business activities, illegally occupying 77 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strictly speaking, the focus of the &quot;big shed house&quot; issue is not the form of building the house, but the nature of the land where the house is built. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Agricultural Engineering Technology&quot; magazine, which is under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, once explained in an article that the &quot;big shed&quot; problem refers to the illegal construction of agricultural facilities or agricultural parks by some industrial and commercial enterprises, individuals and organizations. The essence of illegally occupying cultivated land or even permanent basic farmland for non-agricultural construction is to change the nature and use of the land, change the agricultural production function, and touch the red line of cultivated land protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Information released by the WeChat public account of the &quot;Chenggong District Natural Resources Bureau&quot; shows that in May 2023, the Chengdu Bureau of National Natural Resources Supervision inspected the cleanup and rectification of &quot;greenhouses&quot; in Kunming City in 2019. It was found that two cases involving the rebound of &quot;greenhouses&quot; in Chenggong District were involved, one of which was the Yinlian Potted Flower Market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, 2023, a staff member of the Chenggong Branch of the Kunming Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that the &quot;responsibility for rectification of the &quot;greenhouse&quot; problem involved lies with the street, and he can report it to the Street to understand the relevant situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yinlian Potted Flower Market is located in Dounan Street. On October 25, 2023, a person in charge of the Dounan Street Office said: “(The contents in the shed) were vacated before, but last year due to the epidemic and villages were demolished, some green plants for sale were placed in the shed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the street said that during the inspection in May 2023, the Chengdu Bureau of National Natural Resources Inspection pointed out the existence of Question: &quot;According to the (inspector&#39;s) requirements, it is required to see loess inside the shed, but if there are things on the soil, it is considered a violation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Chenggong District Natural Resources The Planning Branch and the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau jointly issued notices ordering rectification of illegal acts and time-limited rectification notices to multiple land users. The person in charge of the aforementioned street stated that in accordance with the requirements of the rectification notice, they need to &quot;restore the problematic greenhouse to the state of 2019&quot; before the end of September 2023, that is, empty the contents of the shed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the specific implementation stage, the rectification requirements have been repeatedly refined. The person in charge of the street remembered that in June 2023, after the things in the shed were vacated, the soil was also loosened, but the relevant departments “will put forward different requirements for every different inspection.” “So we have repeatedly asked, and today we have to Remove the house number, and tomorrow I will tell you that there is still an advertisement on the door and I want to remove it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of August 2023, only the empty shell of the greenhouse remained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/s1YruHxfKE3KYlsmm4kD2GMkegXzl5ryT78fz4fl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/s1YruHxfKE3KYlsmm4kD2GMkegXzl5ryT78fz4fl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Jing (second from left), Secretary of the Chenggong District Committee of Kunming City, is at the rectification work site of the &quot;greenhouse&quot; at Yinlian Potted Flower Market in Dounan Street. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(&quot;Chenggong Release&quot; WeChat public account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Multiple common issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nearly a month after the greenhouse was vacated, on the afternoon of September 15, 2023, 9 cities (states) including Kunming were interviewed by the Ministry of Natural Resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Natural Resources has 9 local natural resource inspection bureaus in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Xi&#39;an. At the interview meeting, the directors of the nine local inspection bureaus reported the violations of laws and regulations discovered by the inspectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The information disclosed on the official website of the Ministry of Natural Resources shows that the inspection found that the responsibilities for protecting cultivated land in some areas have not been implemented in place, and prominent problems that hit the red line such as &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; and &quot;non-grain conversion&quot; of cultivated land still exist. Non-agricultural construction problems such as parks, development zones, and urban municipal roads without approval are more prominent. The problem of illegal occupation of permanent basic farmland and general farmland for turf planting exists in some provinces to varying degrees. The problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; continues to be prohibited and illegal. The problem of occupying farmland, digging lakes and landscaping still occurs in some places. In some places, minerals are illegally approved and illegal mining violates the ecological protection red line control requirements and seriously damages the ecology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The briefing disclosed more details. Taken together, the number of illegal land use problems in the nine cities (states) interviewed ranked high in the provinces where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Wenzhou, Chuzhou and Lanzhou &quot;ranked first in the province&quot; for problems with laws and regulations, Linyi and Guizhou Qianxinan Prefecture &quot;ranked first in the province&quot;, and Kunming &quot;ranked first in terms of the number of problems&quot; Ranking first in the province and second in the province in terms of cultivated land area.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, this inspection also found a number of common problems in many cities. Such as the &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; and &quot;non-grainization&quot; of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report shows that there are 51 &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; problems in Harbin, involving 900.68 acres of cultivated land; there are 111 &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; problems in Linyi, involving 1,065.56 acres of cultivated land; and there are &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; problems in Hechi. 150, involving 2,629.55 acres of cultivated land; 207 &quot;non-agricultural&quot; problems exist in Qianxinan Prefecture, occupying 1,649.65 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More specific manifestations of the &quot;de-agriculturalization&quot; of cultivated land include the problem of &quot;greenhouse houses&quot;, the indiscriminate occupation of cultivated land to build houses in rural areas, and the construction of some engineering projects and infrastructure without approval. Not only in Kunming, but also in Harbin, Wenzhou, and Hechi, the problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; has appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, among the 9 cities (states) notified, 6 places including Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Chuzhou, Linyi, Qianxinan Prefecture, and Lanzhou all have illegal mining problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Wuchang City, which is managed by Harbin, failed to supervise the illegal mining of granite for construction by Yingze Sand and Stone Co., Ltd. from January 2022 to May 2023, and failed to promptly file a case to investigate and stop it. Reporting illegal mining activities as &quot;false changes&quot; and reporting false information should be subject to inspection. Harbin City has failed to supervise Wuchang City’s untruthful reporting practices, and the audit control is not strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 9 cities (states), Wenzhou, Zhejiang is the only city that has been notified of &quot;continuous frequent petitions in the field of natural resources.&quot; The report shows that since 2021, Wenzhou has been ranking high in the province in terms of the number of petitions in the field of natural resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rectification outside the meeting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the director of the local inspection bureau reported the violations of laws and regulations in 9 cities (states), the city (state) chiefs spoke separately , &quot;State your position one by one.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Voice of China report, Kunming Mayor Liu Jiachen said that the problem of &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; and &quot;non-grainification&quot; of cultivated land in Kunming is very prominent, and he &quot;feels deeply self-blame and guilt&quot; for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the speech session, many mayors also said that some problems have been rectified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to the problem that the Lai’an County Government in Chuzhou City illegally acquired land for the construction of the supporting landscape water system for the Jinling Water Town Project and occupied 400.4 acres of cultivated land to dig out lakes and landscape, Wu Jin, mayor of Chuzhou City, said that the Lai’an County Government The key issues of the illegal land acquisition to build the supporting landscape water system of the Jinling Water Town Project have been rectified and reclaimed in place on June 30, 2023. They have been upgraded in accordance with the requirements of &quot;concurrent personnel management&quot; and handed over to the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision for accountability. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the interview, several city (state) mayors held meetings to deploy relevant work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, September 17, 2023, Hechi Mayor Wang Jun presided over a government executive meeting, demanding that the bottom line of farmland protection and food security be resolutely maintained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, 2023, Wenzhou Mayor Zhang Zhenfeng emphasized at the city&#39;s farmland protection and food security work conference that we must tackle the rectification of problems reported by inspections and follow &quot;one problem, one plan, and closed-loop promotion to the end.&quot; According to the requirements, we will formulate targeted rectification plans, promote the elimination of problem accounts within a time limit, and simultaneously carry out &quot;look back&quot; on rectified problems and draw inferences from one example to make rectifications of the same standard and quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Kunming held a city-wide rectification meeting on illegal land use and farmland outflow. Kunming Municipal Party Committee Secretary Liu Hongjian presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. Mayor Liu Jiachen conveyed the spirit of the Ministry of Natural Resources’ centralized open interview meeting. At the meeting, the Kunming Municipal Natural Resources Planning Bureau reported on the city’s rectification of illegal land use and farmland outflow issues and made a review speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five days later, on September 23, 2023, Chen Jing, secretary of the Chenggong District Committee of Kunming City, led a team to conduct an on-site investigation on the rectification of &quot;greenhouses&quot; and the rectification of farmland outflow problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An article published on the WeChat public account of &quot;Chenggong Release&quot; shows that at the rectification work site of the &quot;greenhouses&quot; in the Yinlian Potted Flower Market in Dounan Street, Chen Jing learned in detail about the overall rectification work of the &quot;greenhouses&quot; in the district situation, work progress and existing difficulties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article published by &quot;Chenggong Release&quot;, there is a photo of Chen Jing standing in a greenhouse. Behind him is the greenhouse that has been demolished to only its frame. Shortly after Chen Jing&#39;s investigation, the frame of the greenhouse was also demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of Dounan Street mentioned above said that they had already made plans to dismantle the greenhouses before, “mainly some details and standards (not yet determined), which were formulated just after the leaders arrived. We It was rectified quickly and thoroughly.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the reason for demolishing the greenhouse, the person in charge said that it was to avoid the problem from recurring again. &quot;If the shed is still there, whoever moves the things in next time will say (there is a problem) during the inspection.&quot; He explained, &quot;In the end, we have done the work of the community and the masses, just to make it one-time The renovation is in place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the land where the potted flower market was located was managed by Yinlian Community. After the problem of &quot;big sheds&quot; rebounded, due to &quot;inadequate community supervision&quot;, more than 70 acres of land have now been returned to the streets. Now, the land planted in the place where the greenhouse was demolished is a third-party company commissioned by the street. The person in charge added: &quot;Our street cadres don&#39;t know how to farm and have a lot of work, so we currently entrust a third party to complete the planting task first, and then discuss the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The street person in charge also It said that in May 2023, after it was discovered that the problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; had rebounded, relevant street officials were also transferred from their original posts. &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;核心职能，仍和土地相关&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;自然资源部约谈地市级政府负责人，与自然资源督察有关，这是上级政府对下级政府行政监察的形式之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家土地督察是国家自然资源督察的前身。为了遏制土地违法、落实耕地保护，2006年，国务院正式出台土地督察制度，主要督察对象为省、自治区、直辖市、计划单列市政府。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年3月，自然资源部成立，“随着自然资源管理职能的转变，为适应自然资源管理需要”，国家土地督察转型为国家自然资源督察。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年6月，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅发布《中央生态环境保护督察工作规定》，以党内法规形式明确了中央生态环境保护督察的制度构成、程序规范、权限责任等内容，同时确立了中央和省级两级督察体制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在武汉大学环境法研究所教授陈海嵩看来，即便自然资源部整合了多个部门的职能，但和土地相关的职能，仍是核心。 “自然资源的核心是土地资源”，陈海嵩说，因此，自然资源督察应该聚焦于最为成熟的土地督察业务，不断深入发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月1日起施行的《土地管理法实施条例》则首次明确了自然资源督察的范围和工作方式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;条例规定，国家自然资源督察机构根据授权对省（自治区、直辖市）人民政府以及国务院确定的城市人民政府的耕地保护情况、土地节约集约利用情况、国土空间规划编制和实施情况、国家有关土地管理重大决策落实情况、土地管理法律、行政法规执行情况、其他土地利用和土地管理情况等进行督察。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家自然资源督察机构还可以约谈被督察的地方人民政府有关负责人，并可以依法向监察机关、任免机关等有关机关提出追究相关责任人责任的建议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和此次9个市（州）长被叫到北京约谈不同，此前，国家自然资源督察机构的约谈大都在地方进行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年10月至11月，国家自然资源督察机构对31个省（自治区、直辖市）和新疆生产建设兵团开展了耕地保护和矿产资源实地督察，发现了一些违法违规问题。针对督察发现的突出问题，经国家自然资源总督察授权，派驻地方的国家自然资源督察机构对部分违法违规严重的地市政府进行约谈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，成都局约谈云南大理，北京局约谈河北邢台、山西晋中，南京局约谈江西九江，广州局约谈广东清远、广西南宁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次在北京约谈地方政府主要负责人的深意，在陈海嵩看来，依然和粮食安全有关，“接下来很长一段时间内，耕地保护、粮食安全都是非常重要的问题”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在约谈会上，国家自然资源专职副总督察陈尘肇表示：“耕地保护任务没有减轻，而是更加艰巨了。要采取坚决有力的措施，持续加强耕地保护，牢牢守住18亿亩耕地红线。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这位负责同志指出，教育部将进一步督促地方和学校严格落实国家有关规定，遵循教育规律和学生身心发展规律，坚决纠正以“确保学生安全”为由而简单限制学生必要的课间休息和活动的做法；将指导地方和学校科学实施管理和安全防范措施，加强室外场所设施排查和人员值守，加强学生安全常识教育，把安全事故风险降到最低，让孩子们快乐放心活动。同时，将要求学校密切家校社协作，争取家长理解和社会支持，共同努力保障学生课间正常活动，促进学生健康成长和全面发展。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;11月1日早晨9:00，该案在马鞍山市中级法院开庭审理。马鞍山市检察院提请以投毒罪追究朱某林、付某阶的刑事责任。被告人及被害人亲属四十余人旁听了庭审，未当庭宣判。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;投毒130余人报复馆长&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;午间休庭时，杨习平告诉南方周末记者，“上午审的是姓付的，他就说自己收了姓朱的500块钱投了毒，自己脑子稀里糊涂，还有话要说。”杨习平称，法庭下午将继续审朱某林。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据上游新闻报道，在法庭上，两名被告人否认预谋作案。公诉机关建议判处两人十年以上有期徒刑、无期徒刑或死刑，7名遇难者的家属提出近770万元民事赔偿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开庭前一天，杨习平把随身带的弟弟照片拿出来看，一个身穿红色运动服的小男孩，长相清瘦，永远定格在了11岁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨习平姊妹四人，杨长伟是家中幼子，也是唯一的男孩。杨习平作为家中的老大，为了供弟弟上学，早早出去打工。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;马鞍山市检察院的起诉书显示，这起投毒案发端于两家武术馆之间的竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1994年左右，被告人朱某林和彭某伟在和县乌江镇卜集镇经营和县少林武术馆，朱某林任馆长、彭某伟任主教练。在经营过程中，二人发生矛盾。彭某伟离开了该武术馆，并在西埠镇重新开设和县南北少林武术学校，还带走了大部分师生，朱某林因此对彭某伟怀恨在心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1996年8月，被告人付某阶到彭某伟经营的和县南北少林武术学校任教，在任教期间，因琐事逐渐对彭某伟心生不满。朱某林和付某阶二人经他人介绍后认识，在相处过程中，两人都表达出对彭某伟的不满，遂决定一起报复彭某伟，把彭某伟的武校搞垮。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;次年6月，付某阶、朱某林商议决定使用投毒的方式报复彭某伟，付某阶实施后由朱某林支付给付某阶5万元，朱某林当场支付付某阶500元。月底，付某阶从武校辞职，回到湖北监利老家购买了两包老鼠药。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事发前夜，6月29日晚，付某阶从和县南北少林武术学校南边窜至武校厨房内，将两包老鼠药投放在厨房南侧桌上红色塑料盆内的咸豇豆上，搅拌后从原路逃离，离开和县。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2013-2017年、2017-2020年，我国分别实行了《大气污染防治行动计划》（“大气十条”）、《打赢蓝天保卫战三年行动计划》。自2013年以来，PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>;年均浓度整体一直保持下降趋势，达标城市数量也在增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月，据亚洲清洁空气中心发布的《大气中国2023：中国大气污染防治进程》，2022年，全国达标城市比例由70.2%增长至74.6%；全国重度及以上污染天数比率为0.9%，同比下降0.4个百分点。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;气象条件是此轮污染天气的外因。李培表示，我国大气污染治理虽然取得了一定成绩，但成效还不稳固，总体上来说，目前还未摆脱气象影响型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家大气污染防治攻关联合中心专家团队分析，10月22日以来，京津冀及周边区域冷空气活动偏弱，地面气温、低层大气相对湿度较常年均偏高，易形成区域性污染。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据中国气象局科普，秋冬季节更易发生雾、霾，与静稳天气有关。静稳天气中的“静”，指水平方向上的风速较小，“稳”指垂直方向上的大气层结比较稳定，低层大气和中层大气相互间垂直交换少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;静稳天气形成与地形、环流等因素有关。山地、丘陵、盆地等特殊地形会阻碍空气的流通，京津冀地区受西北高东南低的“簸箕形”地形影响，污染物容易在太行山和燕山前累积。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在环流因素下，大气层结若存在逆温（下层冷上层暖），导致较重的空气在下层，较轻的空气在上层，大气结构稳定，垂直扩散。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;空气质量不只是受短期的气象条件影响，也与长期气候变化相关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据中央气象台首席预报员方翀解读，一般来说，10月中下旬已进入冷空气活跃期，但2023年冷空气明显偏弱，气温显著偏高。目前，共有237个国家级气象站破10月下旬最高气温历史极值，情况罕见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2023年，加拿大的森林大火对纽约的空气质量造成了严重影响。在纽约人可能已经忘记了空气污染为何物的时候，山火提醒他们，气候变化会带来非常严重的空气污染，并会对人体健康产生危害。”朱彤在会上表示，除野火的案例以外，未来气候变化还将带来更频繁的极端高温、干旱、沙尘天气等极端气候事件，所带来的危害也将成倍增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/5354fa2010.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

新华社/路透&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家气象中心高级工程师迟茜元在会上介绍，首先，空气污染与气候变化均与人为源排放密切相关，从温室气体(如CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;、CH&lt;sub>;4&lt;/sub>;、N&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;O 等)与大气污染物(如SO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;、NO&lt;sub>;x&lt;/sub>;、PM等)的产生原因看，两者具有高度同源性，大多是由矿物燃烧排放生成，所以当出现空气污染时，可能也代表温室气体排放的增加；其次，PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>;的很多组分会影响大气辐射，进而影响能量收支平衡，造成气候变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迟茜元称，气溶胶粒子可能也会参与云雨形成过程，进而影响天气系统与气候条件；另一方面，气候变化本身可能会导致空气污染加剧，比如升温可能会造成臭氧浓度的升高，再如大气环流形式的变化，可能会影响大气稳定度，影响扩散条件，导致PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>;浓度的变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;减污降碳协同增效&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;贺克斌表示，2013年以来，“大气十条”“打赢蓝天保卫战”时期，大气污染物排放量下降，但年度减排幅度在逐渐收窄。这体现出大气污染防治的边际效应，“好干的、利润大的、减排潜力大的都干完了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本轮京津冀及周边地区的污染过程，内因仍然是人为排放。国家大气污染防治攻关联合中心专家团队解读，机动车、工业炉窑等排放是京津冀及周边地区PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>;污染的主要来源，秸秆焚烧等对局地PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>;污染贡献突出。京津冀及周边区域内工业企业、重型货车活动水平和秸秆火点数量环比上升，污染排放呈增加趋势。在工业源方面，10月下旬以来，区域工业用电量较10月上中旬增长约5%；在移动源方面，京津冀及周边地区重型货车交通流量处于秋冬季以来的高位，较10月上中旬偏高约14%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大气污染治理需要找到新的动力，减污降碳协同增效是重要抓手。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“到2030年碳达峰之后，末端治理的作用会越来越小，要逐渐转到四大结构（能源结构、产业结构、交通运输结构、用地结构）调整和减污降碳协同增效上去。”贺克斌认为，无论对经济发展还是对改善空气质量，减碳是近期的压力，亦是未来的动力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年6月，生态环境部、国家发展改革委等多部委联合印发《减污降碳协同增效实施方案》，称“协同推进减污降碳，实现一体谋划、一体部署、一体推进、一体考核”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生态环境部环境规划院副院长严刚在会上介绍，从空气污染物和碳排放角度来看，2/3的城市在“十三五”期间都没有实现协同改善；从行业角度来看，目前虽然大部分行业污染物排放呈明显下降趋势，但碳排放仍然处于增长态势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;严刚称，减污降碳协同治理，并不像以前其他污染治理工作那样，有很多国际经验可借鉴，目前我国减污降碳协同增效工作面临一些挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，在理论体系方面还缺乏支撑，应强化污染排放表征研究，识别排放同源性和异质性；在调控方面，目标分配、智慧调控、治理技术等方面仍需开展一系列研究；相关政策也需进一步协同等。挑战的另一面也意味着机遇，若积极应对，大气污染治理与碳排放控制可以取得双赢。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;October 27, 2023, Myanmar in Lashio, Gwei and other places in northern Myanmar Government military positions were attacked by armed forces and fierce fighting broke out. According to Myanmar&#39;s &quot;Kokang Information Network&quot;, the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army issued a statement on the same day claiming responsibility for the armed attack and that the operation was to &quot;clear out the electronic fraud militia.&quot; At about 4 a.m. local time on the 27th, the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army launched attacks on military deployment areas, police posts, toll stations and other strongholds in Qingshui River, Gunong, Lashio and other places in Shan State. At about 5 o&#39;clock, many strategic strongholds including Qingshuihe and Gunong were occupied by the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, when the war broke out, at a regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spokesperson Mao Ning said regarding the military conflict that broke out between the Myanmar military and the Myanmar Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA): &quot; China pays close attention to the relevant conflicts and calls on relevant parties to cease fire and end the war as soon as possible, insist on resolving differences through dialogue and consultation through peaceful means, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure the security and stability of the China-Myanmar border.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In addition to the Myanmar Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA) also participated in attacks against Myanmar government forces. According to information from the Kokang Allied Forces, the three anti-government armed forces have a total participation of more than 15,000 troops, and the fighting is mainly concentrated in northern Shan State. This is the largest battle that has broken out in the region since the Kokang War in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the fighting site is close to the China-Myanmar border, there has been a wave of refugees at the border ports.

However, for most Chinese, Myanmar is still a relatively unfamiliar country, and its presence is quite limited. There are far fewer Chinese people traveling to Myanmar than to neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam or Cambodia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past two years, Myanmar has gained notoriety in our country&#39;s public opinion due to telecom fraud and &quot;Gayaozi&quot; (illegal organ harvesting and trade). With the dissemination of relevant social media information and film and television works, more and more Chinese people have learned that the northern region of Myanmar adjacent to Yunnan is an area where telecommunications fraud and criminal gang activities are rampant, and the local government is helpless and even complicit in this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day when the conflict in northern Myanmar broke out, the Kokang Alliance Army&#39;s social media immediately released a statement titled &quot;Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army, and Arakan Army &quot;10.27&quot; Action Statement.&quot; mentioned, &quot;We will eradicate telecommunications fraud, fraud dens and their protective umbrellas across the country, including the China-Myanmar border areas. The three coalition forces decided to jointly carry out this military operation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement After the release, the propaganda of these three ethnic and local armed forces continued to contain content about destroying telecom fraud gangs and saving trapped compatriots. Among them, the Kokang Allied Forces even released a pre-war mobilization video of a unit of the Allied Forces on the short video social platform. The brigade commander who issued the mobilization order said in a solemn tone: Our mission is to eradicate the electronic fraud group, eliminate drugs, and rescue our compatriots. no confidence! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the soldiers in uniform shouted in unison: Yes! have! have! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are not just a bunch of people who shout loud slogans. When it comes to fighting, the Kokang Allied Forces have always been good at attacking. As early as the Kokang War in 2015, the Allied Forces launched an attack under the eyes of the Myanmar government forces. Not only did the vanguard troops enter Lao Cai, the capital of the Kokang region, on the day the war started, but they also later sniped and killed a Myanmar Army deputy from a distance behind enemy lines. brigadier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the last moment of the Kokang War that year, the Kokang Allied Forces defended the Nantianmen Highlands at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters in the north of Lao Cai for two months despite the artillery fire and aircraft bombings of the Burmese army. In the end, the Burmese army launched a general offensive. , none of the more than 20 defenders who held on to the end surrendered and all died in the battle. Their fighting will shocked even the opponent Burmese army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict on October 27, the Kokang Allied Forces performed even more rapidly. Within just a few days of the war, they quickly occupied the Qingshui River area adjacent to Lao Cai and an important port with China. , captured more than 60 Burmese army strongholds, successfully relied on light infantry to destroy 6 armored vehicles, and completely wiped out the Burmese airborne special forces who came to provide parachute support. Under the rapid offensive of the Allied Forces, a battalion of Myanmar government officers and soldiers organized and surrendered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, which cooperated with the Kokang Allied Forces, fought on the outside. The Ta’ang Army not only attacked Denni Town, but also successfully destroyed the nearby Nanda River Bridge to prevent the Burmese army from using the road to reinforce the Kokang. area. The Arakan Army and the Ta&#39;ang Army attacked the Lashio area and once shelled the most important Lashio Airport in northern Myanmar, causing the grounding of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the current situation, the Burmese military strongholds outside Lao Cai, the capital of Kokang, have basically been cleared. The attack and defense of Lao Cai will probably begin soon. Once the Kokang Allied Forces successfully regain control of Lao Cai Right, then this battle can basically be declared a victory. Compared with the Kokang war in 2015, the current Kokang Allied Forces are closer to their goal, which is to retake Lao Cai and regain control of the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the political narrative of the ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar, they are the positive heroes, and there are also evil villains accordingly. The villains this time are the four Guogan families. The four major families are the Bai family represented by Bai Chengcheng, the Wei family of Wei Chaoren, the Ming family of Ming Xuechang, and the Liu family of Liu Abao. The representatives of these four families are all powerful figures in the Kokang area and are the mortal enemies of the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of the anti-telecom fraud narrative, the four major families are well-deserved as the villains. The companies of these four families have been operating telecom fraud businesses under the name of entrepreneurial parks for many years. , thus gaining a lot of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real international politics or regional disputes, the image of justice is part of the application of power. War is a continuation of politics, and politics often requires the blessing of morality. Destroying telecom fraud to save compatriots is not necessarily just talk. For the Kokang Allied Forces, as long as they successfully recover Kokang and completely eliminate the disgusting industry of telecom fraud, it is not a problem. After all, this is not their source of income. However, if it is said that the Kokang Allied Forces are only going to war to eradicate telecommunications fraud, that is not consistent with the facts. After all, this is not the first war between the Kokang Allied Forces and the four major Kokang families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early on August 8, 2009, before northern Myanmar became a den of electronic fraud, Bai Suocheng, one of the later leaders of the four major families and deputy commander of the Kokang Alliance Army at the time, joined forces with the Myanmar army and other Three major families launched a coup and drove Peng Jiasheng, the first leader of the Kokang Alliance Army, out of the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, after six years of dormancy, the Kokang Allied Forces launched a counterattack against the government forces in the Kokang region during the Spring Festival. At that time, the Kokang Allied Forces launched the attack in the name of returning home for the New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, not only was the last war not successful militarily, but it also did not have a high enough voice politically. It was even easily regarded by bystanders as a battle between warlords and interest groups. This time, the Kokang Allied Forces have grown for more than eight years. Their military, political, and propaganda capabilities are far better than before, and the results are likely to be very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regardless of whether it is counter-terrorism or not, for the Kokang Allied Forces, being able to fight back their hometown of Kokang and regain control of the old street is the basis for their survival. The leader of the previous generation, Peng Jiasheng, died of illness in February 2022. The current Kokang Allied Forces, under the leadership of the current commander Peng Deren (Peng Jiasheng’s eldest son), has left his homeland to fight guerrillas for many years. But this is not a long-term solution. Without the support of their hometown and a solid base, it will be difficult for the team to develop and grow. Therefore, the military conflict that broke out on October 27, 2023, is equivalent to a battle for survival for the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/njM3JUYhKJyfESN1197AS2088mFAwDbyciHIGs5A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/njM3JUYhKJyfESN1197AS2088mFAwDbyciHIGs5A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 4, 2023, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Chairman of the National Governing Council of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing attended the military parade&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Looking at the Kokang from across Myanmar&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of those familiar with the background of the war in northern Myanmar, the Kokang Allied Forces this time It is expected to be invincible on the battlefield, because as early as 2021, an enemy far more deadly than the ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar appeared in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 2021, Myanmar political leader Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested by the Myanmar military at her home and was eventually sentenced to 33 years in prison. For Aung San Suu Kyi, who was already 78 years old at the time, this was tantamount to a life sentence. On the day Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested, large-scale street protests broke out across Myanmar. In the end, large-scale clashes broke out between demonstrators and military police. Many Western countries condemned the Myanmar military government and announced the restoration of comprehensive sanctions on Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), was also banned by the military government. This series of actions basically announced the complete break between the Myanmar military government and the National League for Democracy. This caused the core political elites of the NLD and their supporters to completely cut off the possibility of parliamentary politics. The military government&#39;s violent suppression of demonstrations also caused Aung San Suu Kyi&#39;s supporters believed that the only way to fight against the military government was through force, so they announced the establishment of the National Unity Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Burmese abbreviation NUG). Its political proposition is to overthrow the military government through force and regain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NUG can be regarded as the NLD&#39;s government-in-exile, which announced the establishment of a military organization in 2021: the People&#39;s Defense Forces (PDF in Burmese). On September 7, 2021, NUG announced the launch of a &quot;people&#39;s defense war&quot; against the military government and called on citizens across Myanmar to resist the military government. For the Myanmar military government, this is undoubtedly a greater threat than the local ethnic armed forces in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since independence after World War II, Myanmar’s civil war has never stopped, but the armed forces of NUG PDF are different from the enemies faced by the previous Myanmar government forces. In past civil wars, the main enemies the Myanmar Army faced were ethnic minority armed forces in border areas, such as northern Myanmar and the Golden Triangle. Such armed forces may be powerful, such as the United Wa State Army, which has heavy equipment including anti-aircraft missiles and armed helicopters, or the Kachin Independence Army, which has sophisticated tactics and well-trained training. However, the characteristic of this type of army is that it is concentrated in areas where its ethnic groups are concentrated, and their political demands are only to maintain the independence and territory of their own ethnic groups. Therefore, the fighting between the Myanmar government army and these local ethnic armed forces is mainly concentrated in the northern region of Myanmar, which is the so-called Upper Myanmar. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Myanmar, also known as Lower Myanmar, is mainly dominated by the Bamar people. The Bamar people account for up to 68% of the population of Myanmar and are the absolute majority of the population. It is difficult for local armed forces of ethnic groups in northern Myanmar to penetrate Entered Burma to fight. Politically, ethnic local armed forces have no such demands. The core members of the NUG are themselves Bamar political elites, and their main area of ​​activity happens to be in Lower Myanmar. Especially after the NUG established the armed forces PDF, the core members were sent to the Kachin and other ethnic local armed regimes to learn how to fight, and at the same time, they used Its underground network in lower Burmese society continues to carry out propaganda and mobilization. A large number of soldiers and officers with combat experience were absorbed into PDF. In recent years, the Myanmar government military academies have not only had difficulty recruiting students, but there have even been incidents of graduates taking their equipment and defecting to PDF. So far, at least 16,000 Myanmar military and police personnel have defected and joined PDF. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to poaching and gathering intelligence, PDF began to engage in guerrilla warfare with the Burmese army in lower Myanmar, and its organized combat units even appeared near Myanmar&#39;s capital, Naypyitaw, and the largest city, Yangon. In May 2023, the NUG announced the establishment of about 300 battalions and columns, banned the government agencies of the military junta in 250 towns and villages in Lower Myanmar, and established its own regime. In June 2023, NUG announced the formation of the 5101st Battalion, which was actually established in the Yangon area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the PDF has not had any decent results since its establishment, and has not successfully annihilated any Burmese army troops, its direct threat to the political and economic center of Burma in Lower Burma has forced the Burmese government forces to allocate Spend a lot of resources to defend against PDF sneak attacks. The NUG&#39;s intelligence and mobilization capabilities have also greatly weakened the Myanmar military government&#39;s ability to control Lower Myanmar. The reason why the PDF is considered more deadly than any ethnic local armed forces is because their military goal is not to occupy territory or support themselves with troops, but to completely destroy the Myanmar military government and regain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we look back at the Kokang conflict in 2015, we will find that the Myanmar government army could easily mobilize several brigades from Lower Myanmar to assist Kokang, while the air force could take off directly from surrounding airports to concentrate its forces. Attack the Kokang Allied Forces&#39; positions. However, after the conflict broke out this time, the intensity and equipment level of government forces in mobilizing reinforcements were far lower than last time, and even air support was quite limited. The fundamental reason is that the mobile forces at the hands of the Myanmar military government are already stretched thin. If a large number of troops are deployed to support Kokang, the PDFs around Yangon and Naypyitaw will definitely take advantage of the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4lWn6pGSgtdzDnCKmw06nWYn9rgCT1PcPrrxBIvb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4lWn6pGSgtdzDnCKmw06nWYn9rgCT1PcPrrxBIvb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 8, 2023, in Shan State, Myanmar, the Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army conducted military training&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why is courage so important? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For the Kokang Allied Forces, Kokang is of course crucial, because that is the only goal of this army at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the four major families of Kokang, Kokang is their political capital and a treasure trove of wealth. Losing Kokang means losing everything that two generations have worked hard for for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the military government, Kokang is also crucial. The reason why the leader of the military government, General Min Aung Hlaing, stands out among many generals is because he successfully occupied Kokang and expelled Peng Jiasheng’s troops in 2009, making him He gained unprecedented prestige in the military and became the number one figure among the new generation of generals. Although Kokang is only the first special zone in Shan State with a permanent population of 140,000 and an area of ​​only 2,000 square kilometers, if it fails, the chain effect will be fatal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, from a political point of view, the Myanmar government forces will not give up Kokang easily, and will naturally try their best to support the local armed forces in Kokang to prevent the Kokang Allied Forces from succeeding in their counterattack. Therefore, although the Kokang Allied Forces made good progress in the early stage, it was still difficult to launch an actual offensive to retake Lao Cai. The price they are willing to pay to aid Kokang is the key to whether the Myanmar military government and the four major families can hold on to Kokang. If the level of military investment in the last Kokang conflict can be maintained, it may still be difficult for the Kokang Allied Forces to retake Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“花西子事件”后，再谈美妆国货的初心与始终丨日化行业科创力榜单解读]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259879]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 12:45:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Huaxizi’s “79 Yuan Eyebrow Pen” has caused heated discussions, and domestic beauty products have become the focus.

Excluding 1 ST company, the total R&amp;D investment of 14 listed companies reached 1.154 billion yuan, with an average R&amp;D investment of 82 million yuan, of which 5 companies invested more than 100 million yuan in R&amp;D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bettany &lt;span>; (300957.SZ) &lt;/span>; ranked first with a score of 77.13.

The score of each indicator item is based on the ratio of the company indicator value to the highest indicator value of the industry indicator item. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;R&amp;D investment, including R&amp;D investment amount, personnel and intensity, is the most critical indicator on the list and is also the competitive advantage of Bethany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;In 2022, Bethany’s R&amp;D investment reached 278 million yuan, accounting for nearly 1/4 of the entire industry, ranking among the top ten Among them, except for Shanghai Jahwa, the R&amp;D investment amount of the other eight companies is less than half of that of Beitani. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;In addition, its R&amp;D investment intensity exceeds 5%, and the sales revenue achieved by applying core technologies accounts for more than 95% of the company&#39;s main business revenue. Volume research and development, had to accept it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4730fa2d8c9ef11b8664ea5dc8b5edc1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; width: 100%; height: auto !important;&quot; width=&quot;645&quot; height=&quot;1070&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03 /4730fa2d8c9ef11b8664ea5dc8b5edc1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256888&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;645&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;1070&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beitaini was established in 2010, and its main brand Wei Nona was born in Dianhong Pharmaceutical &lt;span>; (now acquired by Germany&#39;s Bayer Group)&lt;/span>;. The background of a pharmaceutical company and the &quot;sensitive skin&quot; track it chose determined the path of research and development of Winona Roll, and also set the tone for Bettany&#39;s high-level research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, China&#39;s sensitive skin market segment has been dominated by big European and American brands. Winona&#39;s ability to take a share of the big European and American brands is inseparable from its insistence on independent research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Bethany Research Institute is the main platform for Bethany’s R&amp;D innovation. In 2022, Bethany Research Institute established an innovative raw material R&amp;D center based on the original functional cosmetics R&amp;D center, established a systematic Yunnan characteristic plant active substance screening and evaluation system, and carried out a large number of functional research based on Yunnan characteristic plants. Independent research and development. As of the end of 2022, the company has successfully independently developed 40 functional cosmetic plant raw materials, exported 40 technical standards, and industrialized 11 Yunnan specialty plant actives including purslane and green thorn fruit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Independent research and development has created the product strength of its core brand Winona, and also laid the foundation for telling its brand story and creating a brand image suitable for sensitive skin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Proya, ranked second, has been a &quot;constant winner&quot; in the domestic product list in recent years, but it missed the championship in the science and technology innovation industry list, mainly due to insufficient investment in research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Proya&#39;s revenue reached 6.385 billion yuan, ranking third in the industry after Shanghai Jahwa and Blue Moon Group. Its R&amp;D investment amounted to 128 million yuan, also ranking third. , but its R&amp;D investment intensity is only 2%, ranking fourth from the bottom. Even Yixian e-commerce, which is often criticized for &quot;emphasis on marketing but not on R&amp;D,&quot; has an R&amp;D investment intensity of 3.51%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Old domestic products, struggling to transform&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Jahwa, ranked third, is the first to develop in China The beauty and personal care group includes old brands founded in the 20th century such as Herborist and Maxam, as well as a new brand Yuze that focuses on sensitive skin. With a relatively complete product matrix, Shanghai Jahwa ranks first in the industry with revenue of 7.1 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the oldest domestic products, Shanghai Jahwa’s online channel layout and innovative marketing methods are not as good as those of new brands. In 2022, its online channels will account for less than 40% of total revenue, while cosmetics companies such as Bettany, Proya and Shuiyang Shares will account for more than 80% during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emphasis on offline channels may be closely related to the high market share of Shanghai Jahwa’s personal care and home cleaning brand. Compared with marketing, the old brand seems to be more willing to invest in product research and development than most new brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Jahwa’s R&amp;D investment in 2022 will be approximately 180 million yuan, ranking second in the industry after Beitani. Its research and development directions cover a wide range of areas, including medical research co-creation, traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine, cell biology, safety and efficacy assessment equipment, packaging design, AI customization and beauty instrument platforms. In the annual reports of other companies, the content of AI is usually related to sales channels, but in Shanghai Jahwa, AI is truly related to products and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Shanghai Jahwa’s transformation and upgrading is the blessing of digital intelligence and biotechnology to its main business; the fourth-ranked old domestic product Mingchen Health is launching a dual business model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fiscal year 2022, Mingchen Health invested 110 million yuan in research and development, and also invested in daily chemical products and game business. Of the 23 R&amp;D investment projects disclosed during the same period, nearly half were game R&amp;D; R&amp;D personnel increased by nearly 80% year-on-year to 520, mainly due to new additions to the game business segment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mingchen Health developed the game business through acquisitions in 2020. In 2021, the revenue of the game business and the daily chemical business will account for 37%. In 2022, the ratio of the two will be very close, and the game business will account for 30%. 47%. The 2023 semi-annual report shows that the game business revenue accounts for more than 70%. Next year it will most likely be classified into the software and information services industry. However, this is also a transformation of traditional daily chemical companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 16 daily chemical companies, only 5 including Betteni, Proya, Mingchen Health, Pepperl+Jie, and Blue Moon Group achieved year-on-year revenue growth in fiscal 2022. In fact, the revenue of Mingchen Health&#39;s daily chemical products also declined year-on-year, but thanks to the doubling of game business revenue, the overall revenue increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gross profit margin of Mingchen’s health game business will reach 73.55% in 2022, while the gross profit margin of the daily chemical business will be only 33.75%. In a period of industry involution, decisively exploring new businesses is a new path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingdao Golden King, the largest source of revenue in 2022 will no longer be cosmetics, but new material candles, aromatherapy and handicrafts. Diversified development is another option. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Is high R&amp;D investment worth it? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>; Putting aside these transformations and career changes, focusing on the daily chemical industry itself, is high R&amp;D investment a necessary choice? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business operations, R&amp;D investment is a cost account of the enterprise. Compared with industries with strong technological attributes such as software services and consumer electronics, the benefits that R&amp;D can bring to daily chemical companies are not immediate. At the same time, R&amp;D investment is not high, and there are many brands that have achieved substantial revenue through marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the annual reports of listed daily chemical companies, all of them have sales expenses higher than R&amp;D expenses. For example, Proya’s sales expenses are as high as 2.7 billion yuan, which is 21 times its R&amp;D investment. &lt;span>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;We cannot deny the importance of brand marketing for daily chemical products, but additional high R&amp;D investment has become an industry consensus in recent years. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;16 daily chemical companies also gave their answers using numbers. In fiscal year 2022, a total of 11 companies experienced a year-on-year decline in operating income, accounting for nearly 70%. However, among the 15 companies that disclosed R&amp;D investment, only 6 reduced R&amp;D investment, accounting for 40%. how so? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, R&amp;D is the basis for brand premium. In the &quot;79-yuan Huaxizi eyebrow pencil&quot; incident, someone calculated that its price per gram was even higher than gold. Of course, Huaxizi is not the only one with high prices. Many domestic products have quietly raised their prices in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although compared with big European and American brands, the prices of domestic cosmetics still have room to rise, but behind this incident is the fact that the &quot;hard work&quot; of domestic brand marketing cannot support their price increases. The reason why consumers don’t buy the “79 yuan eyebrow pencil” is ultimately because they question the value of the product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The value of consumer goods usually includes brand value and functional value. The formation of brand value requires the accumulation of time, but functional value can be obtained by latecomers through research and development. For domestic brands whose brand value has not yet been formed, strengthening research and development is not only to create the functional value of the product, but also is conducive to the formation of its brand image. Winona is an example of &quot;focusing on research and development&quot; as the direction of brand development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Secondly, R&amp;D is the only way to create new growth points. &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;This is especially true in the cosmetics industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, channels have always been king in China’s beauty and skin care industry. The focus of competition for market share ranges from offline stores to traditional e-commerce to social e-commerce. Thanks to the development of social media, the degree of information asymmetry between consumers and businesses has been greatly reduced. Consumers have begun to pay more attention to the efficacy of products. It has become a trend to buy skin care products based on their ingredients. The beauty and skin care industry has entered a stage driven by product efficacy. new era. Launching functional skin care products and creating a matrix of functional products have become a new battlefield for cosmetics companies to compete for market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The efficacy of beauty products, especially skin care products, is closely related to product raw materials and formulas, and the discovery and invention of raw materials and formulas are undoubtedly inseparable from R&amp;D investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, as functional skin care has become a new selling point, coupled with the popularity of medical beauty, biopharmaceutical companies with inherent advantages in formula research and development and targeted &quot;medicine&quot; have also begun to join the &quot;involution&quot; of the beauty industry . &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Biotechnology, cross-border competition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some people may have noticed that holding Mibel, Huaxi Biotech &lt;span>; (688363.SH)&lt;/span>;, which owns cosmetics brands such as Quadi and Runbaiyan, did not appear on the list. Bloomage Biotechnology is classified into the biotechnology industry under the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. It does not participate in the daily chemical industry rankings, but it is an important competitor of companies in the daily chemical industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bloomage Biotech, founded in 2000, has entered the skin care industry since 2016 and has ranked first in the hyaluronic acid business in the industry. In 2022, its functional skin care products achieved revenue of 4.607 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 38.80%, accounting for 72.45% of the company&#39;s main business revenue. This revenue is even higher than the total revenue of Shuiyang Co., Ltd., the parent company of Yunifang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/a20f11734e761e45cf14adcd5b0c615d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 559px; height: auto !important;&quot; width=&quot;559&quot; height=&quot;781&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/a20f11734e761e45cf14adcd5b0c615d.jpeg&quot; data- key=&quot;256889&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;559&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;781&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to this, there are giant creatures &lt;span>; (02367.HK)&lt;/p>; span>;, one of its main businesses is functional skin care products. Its brands include Kefumei, Kelijin, etc. Its revenue in fiscal year 2022 reached 2.364 billion yuan, of which functional skin care products accounted for more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the daily chemical industry is also actively moving closer to biotechnology. Marubi Co., Ltd. proposed a research and development plan based on recombinant collagen in the next ten years in 2022. It plans to successively launch recombinant collagen products with Class II medical device certification, recombinant collagen water-light injection products with Class III medical device certification, and Class III medical devices. Certified collagen-filling products and artificial corneas based on recombinant collagen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;In fact, the biotechnology and daily chemical industries are going in both directions. The intersection of medicine and beauty is getting closer and closer, and beauty and skin care products are moving closer to biotechnology from formulas and ingredients to technology to packaging. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Technologies such as fermentation engineering and molecular biology enable the extraction and development of new active ingredients; technologies such as nanotechnology and micro-emulsification technology are used to overcome the problem of difficulty in skin absorption; degradable packaging materials play an important role in environmental protection policies promoted to the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Integrate product research and development with biotechnology in an all-round way, integrating industry, academia and research. In the fields of precision skin care, functional skin care and other fields, beauty and skin care brands have cultivated their own competitiveness by deeply cultivating biotechnology, and new brands are also seizing the opportunity. Technological changes are coming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the development history of international beauty giants such as L&#39;Oreal, Estee Lauder, and Shiseido, their origins and the establishment of moats are all closely related to chemistry and biomedicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when consumption is downgrading and national trends are prevalent, domestic beauty and cosmetics companies that have always focused on &quot;high quality and low price&quot; are facing important competition points to narrow the gap with big European and American brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To seize this &quot;overwhelming wealth&quot;, domestic beauty products must examine and learn from the original research and development intentions of European and American brands, and must not use high marketing as a basis to increase prices at will. After all, the company is not in a In the advertising industry, what makes consumers perceive value is not the gorgeous packaging and advertising endorsements, but the genuine effects that the products bring to consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[她研究在美中国本科留学生，发现高远志向下的挣扎和迷茫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259847]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[剁碎新鲜白菜凑厨余垃圾，涉事企业：正在整改]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259867]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
