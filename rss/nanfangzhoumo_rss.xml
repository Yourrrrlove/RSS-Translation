The late well-known archaeologist Su Bingqi, who proposed the &quot;starry sky&quot; theory about the origin of Chinese civilization, once said that what we want to build is a modernization with Chinese characteristics commensurate with the ancient country of five thousand years of civilization. This naturally puts forward the idea of ​​five thousand years of civilization. What is the essence, what is the national soul, and what is the spiritual pillar? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of &quot;Chinese nation&quot; was proposed by Liang Qichao a hundred years ago, but even starting from the Liangzhu Culture characterized by jade culture, the civilization creation of our ancestors on the land of China has exceeded 5000 years. The Liangzhu ancestors’ divine and animal facial patterns, head-up and head-down dragons, and tomb forms with obvious ritual connotations, all clearly show that they are an important source of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese civilization naturally has more than one origin. In addition to the Liangzhu Culture in the Taihu Lake area, there are also the Hongshan Culture in western Liaoning, the Yangshao Culture in the Central Plains, the Pengtoushan-Chengbeixi Culture in the Yangtze River Basin, the Longshan Culture that is a fusion of various cultures in China, and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The basic spirit of Chinese civilization has gradually formed in the historical development, including the invention of square characters, the &quot;work&quot; of the &quot;system&quot; of the previous kings in the actual social development form, and the &quot;narration&quot; of the previous teachers, as well as The &quot;interpretation&quot; of scholars and intellectuals of all dynasties. Whether it is the &quot;new underground materials&quot; that are advancing rapidly in the modern era or the rich ancient documents dating back to Oracle Bone Inscriptions and Bronze Inscriptions, they can all help us today understand more deeply what the &quot;Chinese national spirit&quot; is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this understanding cannot only be directed towards the past. Although Zhou is an old state, its destiny is renewed. It is facing the future and participating in the present. Here, I try to summarize what I understand about Chinese civilization from five aspects: society, politics, faith, economy, and culture and education. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Society: Family Orientation and Individuality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From a social perspective, we attach great importance to the value of a small community such as &quot;family&quot;, which leads to the spirit of benevolence and individual personality. growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benevolent people are the most important to people who are close to each other. To be close means to be filial to one&#39;s parents, to be kind to one&#39;s children, and to be friendly to one&#39;s brothers and sisters based on human blood and nature. And &quot;Old people are like the old people, young people are like the young people&quot;, and this kind of love is extended to everyone. Different from Mohism’s proposition of universal love, as the mainstream of Han culture, Confucianism admits that “there are differences in love”, but it still has a feeling of universal love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern people tend to value individualism first. Does this kind of &quot;familism&quot; conflict with respect for individual personality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a motivational point of view, parents raising their children comes from their own nature and is the best natural mechanism to help individuals grow. Family love provides relatively pure love and good emotions between parents and children. In terms of children&#39;s growth, the family structure can provide more support. From the perspective of ethnic continuity, this culture is obviously beneficial to increasing fertility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dear love does not advocate unconditional submission. If parents are at fault, the &quot;Book of Filial Piety&quot; advocates that &quot;there are faults in the family&quot;, but it only advises parents to pay attention to their attitude and methods. Mencius encouraged everyone to &quot;nurture my awe-inspiring spirit&quot; and &quot;even if there are thousands of people, I will go there&quot;. It is a kind of personalism with abundant independent consciousness and free spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although in reality there are overbearing and irresponsible parents and rebellious children, this is precisely because they have betrayed the love of their relatives and cannot be blamed on this kind of balancing of family structure and individual personality. The social structure and value form of development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family, a small community, constitutes a social unit, and the independent individuals with community and public care bred in it have become the foundation of the country. The laws promulgated by the governor should encourage this kind of love, but not destroy it. If conditions are created to make it easier for parents to raise their children and for children to get closer to their parents, it is care that nourishes this spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political ideal: The world is for the common good&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the mainstream of our culture, individuals not only live within the family structure, but also naturally extend to the country and the world. To cultivate oneself, manage one&#39;s family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world, in &quot;The Great Learning&quot;, individuals need to constantly study things to gain knowledge, be sincere and righteous, and expand their areas of concern and efforts to the vast areas of the country and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When someone asked Confucius why he did not engage in politics, Confucius quoted &quot;Shangshu&quot; and replied: &quot;Filial piety is only filial piety, and friendship is with brothers.&quot; Politics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a social structure and cultural spirit, &quot;keeping the family together&quot; is already a part of public affairs. Expanding this spirit to a wider social space is also &quot;for government&quot; rather than for government. You must &quot;serve as an official in the government&quot; to enter politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern families are families of three or four, but in Chinese history, unless official laws deliberately required &quot;family separation&quot; to weaken the organizational strength of small communities, our culture often praised &quot;multi-generational families&quot;. &quot;Together under the same roof&quot; encourages large families to live together and help each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of large family living together combines the principles of &quot;kinship&quot;, &quot;respect for respect&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot; to form the social autonomy of a small community. From this, the tradition of gentry autonomy was derived. This made it possible to create a &quot;small government, big society&quot; where the imperial power did not extend to the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhou system of feudalism and founding of the country directly used family as a link to establish the basic political order of the entire Chinese world: on the one hand, the eldest son inheritance system was implemented to ensure the institutionalization and stability of the inheritance of power; On the one hand, talented people are selected to govern. Of course, the Zhou system still embodies moral governance in the family and the world, and the degree of openness of power is still limited. In the political field, the value that best embodies the spirit of the Chinese nation is the spirit of &quot;the world is for the common good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original text of &quot;Book of Rites&quot; is: In the journey of the great road, the world is for the common good, selecting talents and talents, adhering to trust and cultivating harmony, old friends do not only kiss their relatives, do not only give birth to their children, so that the old will die well. The strong have their uses, the young have their talents, and those who are modest, widowed, lonely, and lonely are all supported... Another example is &quot;The king and his ministers are united by righteousness.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not all about the same surname&quot;... These political thoughts, which exude eternal brilliance, have broken through the &quot;kinship&quot; principle of the family and become a concrete manifestation of the commonwealth of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since selfish desires are difficult to eliminate, it is extremely difficult to achieve the goal of serving the world for the common good. Needless to say, the Qin system, from the Han and Tang dynasties to the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, the separation of imperial power and prime ministerial power, the system of admonishing officials and historians, the feudal system throughout the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties, the education of princes, and the system of co-governance of scholar-bureaucrats, etc., are only partial and It plays a certain role in the short term. Royal power is never truly under the law. The Chinese nation’s political spirit of “the world is for the common good” is so premature and yet so immature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the famous &quot;Debate between Righteousness, Benefit and Overlord&quot; with Chen Liang, Zhu Xi lamented decisively: For fifteen hundred years, he was just sitting on this, so it was just a matter of time to make up for it. Although there may have been some moderate prosperity during this period, the Tao taught by the three kings Yao and Shun, Zhou Gong and Confucius, has not yet been practiced in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the political standard of the world for the common good continues to exist. Whether to put the interests and happiness of the people first in governance, and whether to keep the economic, social and spiritual life vigorous and prosperous? These political requirements for governors are also an important dimension of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Economy: People have permanent property&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the economy, how does &quot;the world is for the common good&quot; be reflected? For the government, it is &quot;the king, why should he call it profit&quot;. From the emperor, princes to officials, managers at all levels should not compete with the people for profit; for the common people, it is &quot;those who have permanent property have perseverance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to do this specifically? What the government wants to do is to &quot;benefit the people according to their interests&quot; and naturally carry out production, trade and consumption activities based on the needs of the people in the world. Therefore, in the choice between cannon and butter, butter obviously takes precedence. This only requires the establishment of a service-oriented government that provides &quot;benefits at no cost&quot; and cannot compete with the people for profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Benevolent government must start from the borders.” The basis for the interests of the people is to ensure that citizens have their own three-acre land, and they can use their own land according to their personal and family interests. Judgment, to produce and trade. Although Mencius&#39;s proposition mainly focused on delimiting the boundaries of mine fields, its essence pointed to the determination of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Mencius also advocated encouraging commerce and protecting travelers by providing warehouses for merchants and requisitioning them in accordance with the law to avoid stagnant goods, only registering and inspecting but not collecting taxes, only doing labor service but not collecting land rent, etc. Let it be beneficial to farmers, so that all merchants in the world will be happy and willing to hide in their markets, all travelers in the world will be happy and willing to go out on their own roads, and all farmers in the world will be happy and willing to plow their fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the current economic reform is concerned, the confirmation and long-term stability of agricultural land rights, as well as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises, protecting the investment and property rights of the private economy in various fields, tax laws, etc., all fall into this category. economic issues. This also determines whether entrepreneurs have long-term confidence in the Chinese economy and whether they dare to make large investments. In short, the essence of the economic spirit of an ideal Chinese community is to achieve economic prosperity, prosperity and prosperity for the people, and ensure the material life of the people through the property rights, production and trade system of &quot;big public ownership and private ownership&quot; and the fiscal and taxation system that is light on corvee and light on taxes. of plenty. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Belief: The unity of nature and man&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For families, why should fathers be kind and sons should be filial? For rulers, why should the world be for the common good? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do ordinary people have perseverance only if they have perseverance? For a person like Yan Hui, why can he achieve &quot;a basket of food and a ladle of drink, and he cannot bear the worries, but his joy will not change even after he returns&quot;? How can he have perseverance without permanent income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This involves the fourth dimension of Chinese civilization, faith. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businessmen believed in the personified &quot;Emperor&quot; and were biased toward the dominating heaven; Zhou people believed in &quot;the destiny of heaven is constant, only virtue is the supplementary one&quot;, and in the dominating heaven there was a profound meaning of the heaven of righteousness; although Confucius &quot;revered &quot;Keep the ghosts and gods at a distance&quot;, but still &quot;offer sacrifices to the gods as if they were present&quot;, reminding the disciples to realize the sincere spirit of life from the great popularity of &quot;Heaven can say nothing&quot;, and firmly believe that they carry &quot;Heaven will not lose the grace&quot;, which deepened the Zhou people&#39;s The concept of destiny; in the Han Dynasty, Dong Zhongshu believed that humans are copies of heaven, that heaven and humans can sense each other, and can warn the king of his misconduct and mismanagement with &quot;disasters&quot;; by the Song and Ming dynasties, heaven mainly became the heaven of justice, tending to one an inner transcendence and infinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For heaven, most of the most outstanding kings and sages of the Chinese nation had a strong and heartfelt awe, and regarded the unity of heaven and man as their ultimate pursuit, thus giving integrity to daily life and political life. sense of meaning, certainty and direction. Mencius has a very vivid description of this realm of belief that is both ordinary and holy: what is desirable is called good, what is called self-belief is called faith, what is full is called beauty, what is full and glorious is called great, what is great is called transformation. Holy, what is holy but unknowable is called God. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Father&#39;s kindness and son&#39;s filial piety originate from the &quot;nature of destiny&quot; and from &quot;the child is free from the arms of his parents for three years&quot;. If this kind of human nature is brought into full play like Shun in &quot;Yao Canon&quot;, we can A saint who acquires a set of abilities including avoiding disasters, harmonizing the family, and governing the country is a saint who unites nature and man;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Emperor&quot; regards himself as the eldest son of Heaven to gain legitimacy and even sanctity, and must serve Heaven To carry on, we must nourish all people, and the world is for the common good;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinary people don’t understand this enough, and they don’t have the time to cultivate themselves. They need a constant income to have perseverance. This is normal, but it has a family “kissing” mechanism. With nourishment, there is still benevolence and righteousness in the heart. As long as you don&#39;t cut it off, you can also see the virtuous and considerate people; The obsession with external objects returns to the state of life where meaning flows. March is not contrary to benevolence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is extremely difficult to truly practice faith. For ordinary people, if they have permanent property and perseverance, maintain a comfortable life and common sense rooted in the meaning of family, they can become qualified members of the Chinese community; for people in high positions, if they cannot &quot;devour their heart and soul to understand heaven, &quot;If you cultivate your mind and cultivate your nature to serve Heaven&quot;, you will begin to pollute a large area from the source of law, politics, culture and education, and spread evil to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While Mencius affirmed that all people have the four ideals, he also clearly realized that &quot;human beings are somewhat different from beasts.&quot; He quoted from &quot;Shang Shu·Tai Oath&quot; that &quot;Heaven sees me and the people see me, and God listens to me and the people listen&quot;, and gave a principled explanation of the relationship between heaven and the people. God’s will is unpredictable and manifests itself through public opinion. A holy king who unites nature and man is rare to find in five hundred or even a thousand years, but secular kings who are holy because of their kings are everywhere. The reverence for heaven and the people is not empty talk, so it is necessary to establish a technical system to restrict the royal power, so that public opinion can be fully reflected, and governance can fully reflect public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public opinion may be divided and antagonistic, what should we do? Will it bring about the disadvantages of &quot;welfarism&quot;? Will the &quot;public opinion&quot; of this generation harm the &quot;public opinion&quot; of future generations? These challenges have entered the field of building a modern republic and legal system. In addition to drawing on the more mature modern governance system, we also need to give full play to the spirit of &quot;Spring of the First Year, King Zhengyue&quot; in &quot;Spring and Autumn&quot;. In the era of great changes, we should constantly return to the origin of politics and beliefs, consider profits and losses, and &quot;make&quot; new systems. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Literature and education: Respecting teachers, respecting morality, and vigorous spirit&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Liangzhu, Hongshan, Yangshao to Longshan, from Xia, Shang and Zhou to Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing, the Chinese community gradually formed and split frequently And it can be continuously unified, and the culture whose roots were formed over five thousand years will never be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a unified square character that has basically not changed since ancient times. Even though &quot;the winds are different in hundreds of miles, and the customs are different in thousands of miles&quot;, a county may have several dialects, but we can still recognize and identify with each other. There is also the ideological system from Zhou Confucius, Mencius, Xun, Lao and Zhuang. They have governed themselves and made history, and they have also learned from history and classics, providing rich resources for spiritual inspiration and institutional reconstruction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no insurmountable rivers or mountains in the land of China. Whether it is divided into feudal states or prefectures and counties, the gradually formed Zhou Wen and Han systems, Tang style and Song style are diverse but capable of unification, and have strong agglomeration effect. For thousands of years, no matter what force entered China, it would be transformed by Chinese culture to a large extent. They inherited Chinese culture and therefore gained basic recognition from the scholars in this tradition. This is the attraction and centripetal force of the Chinese national spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this cultural spirit faces not only the debate between China and the West, but also the changes in ancient and modern times. How to inherit and update our cultural spirit has been a major issue that several generations of intellectuals in modern times have struggled with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the Han Dynasty to the Tang and Song Dynasties, we spent thousands of years absorbing Buddhist culture, which not only gave birth to Chinese Zen Buddhism, but also gave birth to Taoism in the Song and Ming Dynasties. Since the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, in the face of the strong Western learning and Western politics, scholars from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and three places have translated a large number of translations, digested them quickly, practiced them politically, and compared and absorbed them academically, which has initially opened up a new situation for Chinese culture. The process is far from over. To return to the roots and create new things requires a free and powerful cultural and educational system that represents the fifth dimension of the Chinese national spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher is someone who teaches, teaches and resolves doubts. China has a tradition of scholarship. The Jixia Academy, which flourished 2,400 years ago, was once an international academic center in China, even though it was officially run by the Qi State. Scholars from Taoism, Confucianism, Legalism, Ming Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Agriculture, Yin and Yang, Mencius, Xunzi, Shen Buhai, Lu Zhonglian, Shen Dao and other scholars whose names were important for a time and even influenced thousands of years are here to &quot;discuss without ruling&quot;, &quot; &quot;Discussing state affairs without holding office&quot;, the ideological power derived from this has surged forward with the source of living water, and its influence continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Confucius broke away from &quot;learning in the government&quot; and gave private lectures, to the &quot;Jingshe&quot; in the Han Dynasty, from the &quot;academy&quot; where individuals studied and lectured in the Tang Dynasty, to the Yuelu Academy in the Southern Song Dynasty, where Zhang Shi lectured , the Bailudong Academy restored by Zhu Xi... The folk academy system is well-established, with independent subject-based teaching systems, autonomous methods for students to participate in management, and relatively independent funding sources, finally forming a mature private school system. By the Ming Dynasty, academies such as Longgang, Guiyang, and Kuaiji, which were founded or presided over by Wang Yangming and promoted the purpose of Xinxue, changed to Donglin Academy, which criticized the shortcomings of Xinxue and advocated practical learning. This has never ceased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These academies have the character of pursuing the Tao rather than seeking official positions, the style of study of free debate, the aura of making friends to help others, and the worldly sentiments of &quot;the sound of wind and rain, the sound of reading, family affairs, state affairs, and world affairs.&quot; In &quot;Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot;, Huang Zongxi even put forward the view that &quot;what the emperor is right may not necessarily be right, and what the emperor is wrong may not be wrong, so the emperor will not dare to be wrong for himself and publicize his right and wrong to the school.&quot; Right and wrong and truth were elevated to a higher status than the emperor, restoring the traditional essence of discussing politics based on Tao, and inspiring people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern intellectuals need to inherit the spirit of scholars, not only to interpret and continue the great ancient Chinese civilization, but also to &quot;work&quot; according to the times and explore new philosophical, institutional and scientific principles. In short, the foundation of this cultural and educational system is the guarantee of the institutionalization and legalization of &quot;teachers&quot; and &quot;scholars&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conclusion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The final conclusion: This article believes that heaven (the belief system in which heaven and man are unified), earth (the economic system in which people have permanent property), and the country (the political system in which the world is for the common good) System), relatives (kinship is the most important, a personality development system nurtured in the family structure), and teachers (a cultural and educational system full of dynamic research, preaching and civilized dialogue), the above five constitute the main content of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国跳水队包揽亚运会跳水项目首个比赛日的两枚金牌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258022]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 19:38:40&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 30, 2023, Chinese group Quan Hongchan (right)/Chen Yu Xi in the competition.

The imaginary group of people gradually disappeared on the other side of the misty water, but the imaginary wine and food still exuded steam, as if chasing the sound of construction and singing that had just disappeared... More than two thousand years passed by in a blink of an eye, and this road from North China The rivers flowing across the plains brought me closer to those people and things that were far away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The river is named Yishui, and it is famous in history because of that famous farewell. ——That year, they sang softly by the river:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wind rustles and the water becomes cold,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strong man will never return once he is gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/qHq4WGuD8LlEMzMFhaZ0nMRZjeTLpZxv9oW0uzru.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/qHq4WGuD8LlEMzMFhaZ0nMRZjeTLpZxv9oW0uzru.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yishuihan, Yixian County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Yandu&lt;/span>; h4>; &lt;p>;The North China Great Plain extends to Yixian County, Hebei Province, and has reached its western edge. In the county town, looking to the west from a high altitude, a line of dark mountains stretches across the end of the plain, which is the Taihang Mountains that separate the North China Plain and the Shanxi Plateau. The Yishui that gives Yixian County its name originates from the eastern foothills of Taihang Mountain. In fact, the Yishui is not one river, but divided into three: North Yishui, Zhongyishui and Nanyishui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various signs that that famous farewell should be on the shore of Zhongyi River. The man named Jing Ke, when he finished singing generously amidst the sound of Gao Jianli&#39;s construction, and everyone&#39;s eyes were splitting with anger, he had already jumped on the carriage and headed to Xianyang, the capital of Qin, two thousand miles away. In order to repay Prince Dan for his kindness, he is going to perform an almost impossible task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the traffic conditions at that time, there were two roads for him to choose. One was to go south, along the Great Plains to today&#39;s Kaifeng, Henan, and then turn west; the other was to follow the Yishui River, Passing through Puyinxing and Feihuxing among the eight hidden tunnels in the Taihang Mountains, they entered today&#39;s Shanxi, then traveled southwest, crossed the Yellow River from Pujin, and entered Guanzhong. For no reason, I think Jing Ke would probably choose the latter. Although the latter journey is more difficult, the mileage is shorter. What is particularly important is that perhaps, only when he slowly climbed from the flat plain to the majestic mountain - at that time, the wind was also blowing, blowing Jing Ke&#39;s white robe - he stood at the mountain pass, and then turned back to take one last look at the sad scene under the sunset. The windy home is more in line with Jing Ke’s character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Jing Ke appeared on the scene, the life of Yan State had entered a countdown. And Jing Ke, a native of Wei, is undoubtedly a colorful part of the historical drama of Yan. The 800-year history of the Yan Kingdom came to a desolate and tragic end with Jing Ke&#39;s stubbornness and despair in attacking Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The history of Yan State must start from three hundred miles north of Yishui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is also a river, a river that is shallower and thinner than Yi Shui: Liuli River. The Liuli River is an insignificant tributary of the Haihe River Basin. When it flows into Fangshan District, Beijing, a small town surrounded by the Liuli River is named after the Liuli River. To the east of the town, a number of Shang and Zhou cultural relics and sites have been excavated since the 1940s. Now, relying on the ruins, the Western Zhou Yandu Ruins Museum has been built. There are eight big characters on one wall of the museum: Ding Tian Ge Di, appointed to the Northern Territory. These eight characters illustrate that the purpose of establishing the Yan State was to ensure the security of the northern frontier of the Zhou Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/WyrxAP660ttx9yxBFzMnYaAIAjLh6TYFswiKhog4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1449&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/WyrxAP660ttx9yxBFzMnYaAIAjLh6TYFswiKhog4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216773&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Territory tiles with Taotie patterns from the Yan State, collected by the Yandu Museum of the Western Zhou Dynasty. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Shang Dynasty in the Zhou Dynasty, the princes were granted great titles. The first person to be ennobled in the Yan Kingdom was the eldest concubine of King Wen of Zhou, who was also the half-brother of King Wu of Zhou, Ji Shi. Since Ji Shi wanted to stay in the royal city to assist the emperor, he did not go to the fief to govern, but sent his son Ji Ke there. He himself was called Zhao Gong because of his fiefdom, so he was called Zhao Gong in history. This means that the nominal first monarch of the Yan Kingdom was Zhao Gong, but the actual first monarch was Zhao Gong&#39;s son Ji Ke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The territory of Yan State is roughly equivalent to today&#39;s northern part of Hebei plus Beijing. Among all the princes, Yan State is located in the north, and bordering it is the ethnic tribe called Rong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first capital of the Yan Kingdom - for the sake of narrative convenience, let&#39;s call it the first capital of Yan - is near the museum. Of course, the capital city of a feudal state more than two thousand years ago was just a larger market town. When the Yan Kingdom was first established, it was adjacent to another smaller country: Ji. Soon, Yan State annexed Ji State and moved its capital to Ji. The location of thistle is located in the Guang&#39;anmen area of ​​today&#39;s Beijing city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/U9CatV5KXO1N1LSRngz9uAyuINPajP8hVdy0UiOT.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/U9CatV5KXO1N1LSRngz9uAyuINPajP8hVdy0UiOT.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216774&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Outside Guang&#39;an Gate in Beijing, there is a Liao Dynasty Buddhist temple - Tianning Temple. The Tianning Temple Tower is the oldest above-ground building in Beijing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yan Kingdom lasted for more than 800 years, and it can be said that it had little sense of existence for the first 700 years. In other words, the only time it had a sense of existence was when this small country in the north encountered big trouble - Shanrong invaded and almost destroyed the country. Fortunately, the Central Plains region was in the era of Duke Huan of Qi, the leader of the Five Hegemons in the Spring and Autumn Period. Under the banner of Zun Wang and Expelling the Barbarians, Duke Huan of Qi contacted the princes to form a coalition. He personally led his troops deep into the hinterland of the Shanrong and fought several battles with the Shanrong until the Shanrong came far away. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, the Yan Kingdom was just like ordinary passers-by A and B, living and multiplying in the northern country in obscurity. By the time the princes turned their attention to it again, it was already three hundred years later. At this time, a major event occurred in the Yan Kingdom that shocked the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the important difference between the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period is that although the Spring and Autumn Period also had frequent wars, they generally only beat their opponents until they surrendered and admitted their mistakes, while the Warring States Period focused on occupying the opponent&#39;s territory or even annexing the opponent. Purpose. During the bloody Warring States Period, with wars and wars raging, ancient countries perished one after another, and the remote Yan State also felt great pressure to survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 321 BC, the first king of the Yan Kingdom, King Yan Yi, died. His son Ji Kuai ascended the throne and was known as King Kuai of Yan in history. Faced with the great powers surrounding the country and the weak state of Yan, King Kuai of Yan was worried. He wanted to work hard to make the backward Yan state invincible. He sincerely believes that as long as it can make the Yan country strong, he will not hesitate even if he and his family are not in power. Various signs show that King Yan is a simple and open-minded person. Only in this way can his dream be used with ulterior motives. The traitor took advantage of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treacherous minister was his son, who was the Prime Minister of Yan State at that time and was highly regarded by King Kuai of Yan State. Zi Zhi was indeed quite talented, so much so that King Kuai of Yan mistakenly believed that Yan must rely on him in order to revitalize the country. Zizhi fully grasped the eagerness of King Kuai of Yan to seek governance. His two confidants Su Dai and Lu Maoshou often gave advice to King Kuai of Yan, praising Zizhi&#39;s ability to govern the country, and urging King Kuai of Yan to follow the example of Yao and Shun and cede the world to the throne. Son of. In this way, Zi Zhi can not only govern the Yan Kingdom well and realize the rise of the Yan Kingdom, but at the same time, King Kuai of Yan will also become a saint like Yao and Shun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Kuai of Yan deeply believed in these deceptions, &quot;because the whole country belongs to the son, and the son is of great importance&quot; - King Kuai of Yan handed over all the important affairs of the country to the son, so the power of the son was extremely popular. ——Of course, I also want to sit on the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after, under the continued instigation of Zi Zhi and his associates, King Kuai of Yan &quot;received the seals from his son who was an official of three hundred stone&quot;, that is, he took all the seals of middle and high-level officials with more than three hundred stone in the country. Leave it to Zi, and let Zi control it. So, &quot;the son went to the south to do the king&#39;s business.&quot; The throne of the King of Yan passed from King Kuai to his son, who became the King of Yan. King Kuai instead became a minister. He no longer interfered with political affairs on the grounds of old age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucianism has always beautified the three generations and believed that the abdication of Yao, Shun and Yu was a symbol of the great unity of the world. Later, there were many abdication events, including Emperor Xian of the Han Dynasty, whose throne was Cao Pi, Emperor Gong of the Jin Dynasty, Liu Yu, Emperor Gong of the Sui Dynasty, Li Yuan, Emperor Ai of the Tang Dynasty, Zhu Wen, and Emperor Gong of the Zhou Dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin. However, the concessions between these foreign surnames were backed by force by the recipients, and the monarch had no choice but to give in. In contrast, King Kuai of Yan&#39;s true and heartfelt surrender was unprecedented, if not unprecedented, in thousands of years of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the sage-like abdication of King Yan brought a catastrophe to the Yan country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;子之在位三年，燕国没有像燕王哙希望的那样振兴，反而更糟，“燕国大乱，百姓恫怨”。燕王哙的儿子太子平，原本应该他继承王位，但父亲的禅让，却让他成了臣子，他当然想夺回本属于他的王位。于是，在将军市被支持下，太子平及其拥护者密谋推翻子之。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与燕国毗邻的齐国看到了染指燕国的绝佳时机。齐宣王派使者与太子平联络，表示愿意帮助太子平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有了齐国承诺，太子平自感大事将成，遂与市被攻打王宫。但是，齐国并没有按承诺及时出兵。太子平及市被战败身死，燕国一片混乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;趁此良机，齐宣王发兵攻燕。燕军人心涣散，纷纷逃跑，燕王哙和子之均被齐军杀死。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐军侵燕，燕国损失惨重，大量重器被运走，宗庙被焚毁，死于非命的燕人达数万之多。齐军对燕人屠杀的直接证据，事发两千多年后重见天日：1966年，在河北易县燕下都发现了战国人头骨丛葬墓十四座，考古工作者对其中的5号墓作了抢救发掘。黄土下，大量白花花的人头骨被随意掩埋在一起，没有任何陪葬品。发掘报告说，“这批人骨几乎全是男性成丁个体”；“头骨中最多的属于18—35岁的青壮年，约占观察数的80%”；并且，考古工作者还发现，其中一些头骨要么被砍去一部分，要么还残留着箭头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵国与燕国毗邻，在赵武灵王帮助下，燕王哙的另一个儿子公子职被护送回国继承王位，这就是燕昭王。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕昭王接手的是一个烂摊子，蓟被齐军洗劫破坏，无法再做都城。于是，他在更南方的易水河畔兴建了一座新城，这就是燕下都；相应的，蓟就是燕上都。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕初都遗址地处北京郊区，一条铁路紧贴着遗址，偶有火车驶过，发出惊天动地的声响，稍远处，是人烟稠密的琉璃河镇。至于燕上都遗址，则处于车水马龙的繁华大都市，车来车往，昼夜喧嚣。与燕初都和燕上都形成鲜明对比的是燕下都——在已经发掘的春秋战国诸侯都城里，燕下都是占地面积最大的一座，极盛时，估计约有三十万人口——而整个燕国的人口，大概率不超过三百万。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;玉米地尽头，黑杨挺拔，掩映着一条小河，小河流向易水。那一年，白衣飘飘，衣冠似雪，太子丹和一群燕人簇拥着荆轲，坐上马车，缓缓驶出燕下都，来到了城外不远的易水河畔。那里，有一座亭子；亭里，酒菜已经摆好。他们，即将最后一次共同举杯……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/vj9FASfXSnIgbCDNOWacLiNo7rW2ju9r8w2zdQ2l.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;燕昭王意识到了人才的重要性，只有吸纳最优秀的人才为燕国服务，燕国才可能在短时间内富国强兵。燕昭王求贤若渴的消息迅速传遍天下，不少身怀利器的士人纷纷前往燕国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;寻访燕下都遗址前，我先去了河南洛阳。洛阳郊外公路一侧的田野里，有一座气度不凡的坟墓。墓侧，是河南省重点文物保护碑：苏秦墓。墓首广场上，立着几块高大的石碑，其中一块碑文为《战国合纵家苏秦墓碑记》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投奔燕国的士人中，最知名、影响也最大的就是周天子直属的洛邑人苏秦。苏秦的事迹，主要记载于《史记》和《战国策》，但两书自相矛盾的地方非常多。这是因为，无论司马迁还是刘向，都苦于缺少真实可靠的一手材料。直到1973年底，长沙马王堆三号汉墓出土了一批帛书，苏秦的真实面目才渐渐清晰。这批帛书被专家整理为《战国纵横家书》。二十七章中，有十六章是司马迁和刘向未曾见过的久已失传的佚书。佚书的内容，正好与苏秦有关——于是，两千多年后，通过这些文字，我们终于得以还原一个以生命作代价的潜伏者：间谍苏秦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投奔燕昭王前，苏秦周游列国，寻找机会，但他磨破嘴皮，花光盘缠，却没有任何一个君主重视他。他回到家里，家人也对他爱理不理。因此，当燕昭王尊重他、礼遇他，把他视作国士时，苏秦决意士为知己者死。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏秦认为，七国中，燕最弱。秦、齐是强国，赵是次强国。燕国无法与它们任何一国抗衡。要想打败齐国复仇，必须削弱齐国，而削弱齐国的最好途径，就是怂勇、支持齐国去吞并宋国，这样齐国势必成为众矢之的。为了让齐国执行错误路线并达到削弱它的目的，苏秦愿意前往齐国作内应。他与燕昭王约定：“内寇不与，外敌不可距。王自治其外，臣自报其内，此乃亡之之势也。”——内乱不生，外边不能轻易行动。大王在外策划对付齐国，我打入齐国制造混乱。这样，灭亡齐国的形势就造成了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏秦以燕国使者的身份来到齐国，及后，他以卓越的才华和口才，赢得了齐湣王的信任，被任命为相国——其地位，甚至超过了在燕国。随着苏秦受到齐湣王重用，燕昭王的身边人开始怀疑，苏秦或许不会信守曾经的承诺，燕昭王一度也动摇了。为此，苏秦写信告诉燕昭王，发誓他将“信如尾生、廉如伯夷、孝如曾参”——这些当时属于绝密的通信，正是通过汉初帛书的传抄，在两千多年后重见天日。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在齐国十余年间，尽管国际局势不断变化，苏秦始终如一地执行他与燕昭王的约定，即在为齐国制定对外政策时，总是想方设法削弱齐国。其间，他既曾劝阻了秦王约齐王共同称帝，还成功地离间了秦、齐关系，组成五国联军伐秦，并使赵、楚等国均与齐国关系紧张。尤其重要的是，他促使齐王三次入侵并最后吞并了宋国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了麻痹齐国君臣，对齐国恨之入骨的燕昭王唯齐王马首是瞻。齐国伐宋时，燕国派兵相助。甚至，齐湣王因小事处死了燕军将领，燕昭王虽悲愤下泪，却又派使者向齐湣王承认错误……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前286年，齐灭宋。位于中原膏腴之地的宋国，系周初分封殷商遗民而建，级别很高：公爵。这个高贵而富庶的国家被齐国吞并，引发了其他诸侯强烈不满。此时，燕国在燕昭王呕心沥血治理下，已然兵强马壮。此消彼长，齐国早已外强中干。于是，一年多后，燕昭王倾全国之兵，由大将乐毅率领，潮水般地越过齐燕边境，杀入齐国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当燕军进攻齐国，苏秦名为齐国相国，实为燕国间谍的身份暴露了，他被狂怒的齐湣王处以车裂的酷刑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐王的狂怒却无法抵挡志在复仇的燕军，燕军攻破齐都临淄，齐湣王逃跑，后来被楚军将领淖齿所杀——他的死非常悲惨：“射王股，擢王筋，悬之于庙梁，宿昔而死。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕军连下齐国七十余城，仅余下即墨和莒还在困兽犹斗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，即墨之围期间，燕昭王去世了。时局，也一下子发生了峰回路转的巨变：即位的燕惠王做太子时就与乐毅有隙，在齐国挑拨下，他将乐毅撤职，乐毅只好投奔赵国——春秋战国时代，这种用脚投票的行为屡见不鲜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原本处于绝对弱势的齐国，在名将田单的运筹帷幄下咸鱼翻生——燕军被赶出国境，齐国失去的城池一一收复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;燕国昙花一现的强盛也就到此为止，它像一颗划过天空的流星，当人们还在仰望它并惊讶于它的灿烂时，它已熄灭并坠落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;后来&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;有意思的是，享国八百余年的燕国，它最精彩的两大历史事件，即苏秦间齐和荆轲刺秦，其主角都是外国人；而不论是作为间谍还是作为刺客，以这种非同寻常的手段试图打败一个国家或是拯救一个国家，都充满了天马行空的想象力和步步惊心的传奇色彩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从辈分上说，太子丹是燕昭王六世孙，两人之间相距五十多年。从燕昭王去世到太子丹的父亲燕王喜在位的半个世纪里，燕国国运每况愈下，四代燕王昏招叠出，九次对外战争，仅小胜一次。其中，燕王喜在位时，赵国在长平之战中惨败，作为赵国邻居，燕国不仅没有唇亡齿寒，反而趁火打劫，却被惨败之余的赵国暴击，以致燕都被困，不得不纳重金求和。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鹬蚌相争，渔翁得利。奋六世之余烈而进行统一战争的秦国乃是诸侯火拼的最终受益者。秦灭韩后，再灭赵，秦国势力进抵南易水。此前，燕国已沿着南易水修筑了长城。然而，太子丹知道，简陋的长城，根本无法抵挡秦国的虎狼之师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他希望有一个办法，能够快速且一劳永逸地解除秦国威胁，拯救风雨飘摇的燕国。于是，便有了众所周知的荆轲刺秦；便有了两千多年前，易水河边那场风萧萧兮的饯别宴……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/J2zZt3V7ZcZwjVHayueRKgRLKKn6oXdk4WNJIC8L.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;从远处看，荆轲塔的形状像一柄短剑，直刺蓝得空洞的苍穹。它让我想起了荆轲藏在地图中的匕首。图穷匕现，如果那把淬过剧毒的匕首刺死了嬴政；又或者，燕昭王的寿命再延续十年；历史，一定不是我们后来看到的那样。只是，世界上有苹果有芒果有开心果，却没有如果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/OeWlz0cgwTsfzJQ2BWrovDOIpEAWW1gcEapnM3C4.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;目前，男子100米的亚洲纪录是中国选手苏炳添在2021年东京奥运会上创造的9.83秒；亚运会纪录同样属于苏炳添，他在2018年雅加达亚运会中跑出了9.92秒。决赛时，他现身直播间进行解说，表示他们这批老运动员已经完成任务，接下来就要看年轻运动员了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/01/M0tl7nFcaGJ8O3SwQZtNyW14KQCmuGmUMoemIxRs.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;陈冠锋便是苏炳添看好的年轻运动员之一，他曾多次在公开场合称赞陈冠锋为国内00后选手中的佼佼者。在一次采访中，他提到：“按照我当年的进度来算的话，三年时间他应该能接上班。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月2日晚，陈冠锋站在成都世界大学生夏季运动会男子100米决赛第二道上，他俯下身，等待发令枪响。 12年前，同样是23岁的苏炳添也站在深圳大运会男子100米决赛第二条跑道上，那次，他获得了铜牌，媒体称他是“中国短跑的希望”。后来，苏炳添在百米赛道上一路扬名，将众多纪录收归名下，在世界田坛闯出一席之地，成为无可争议的中国短跑领军人物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;23岁的陈冠锋几乎复刻了苏炳添的夺牌之路，这是他职业生涯第一次出现在真正意义上的世界大赛中，也是第一次踏上世界级比赛男子百米决赛的跑道。他在半决赛跑出10秒16的个人赛季最好成绩，两小时后的决赛中，他以10秒17的成绩第三个冲过终点线。比赛结束后，陈冠锋身披国旗，绕着田径场跑了一圈向观众表示感谢。 4天后，他与队友获得4×100米接力金牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/01/yH5ivwbDM5RXIIwH8iggUHNRB2xjkgApagUuq9Gf.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;陈冠锋说：“我会尽我最大的可能，向奥运会的领奖台发起冲击。虽然不知道自己能不能成功，但我也会像苏炳添大哥一样，帮助后面的年轻人，给他们做好榜样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管在全国田径赛场上，陈冠锋还是一张新鲜的面孔，但在广州他早就有了“西关飞人”的称号。在17岁之前，陈冠锋一直是一名校园选手，没有进入体校接受系统的专业训练。他曾多次代表广州第一中学参加校际比赛，跑步速度远远强于一般同学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我就是从小比较好动，喜欢跑跑跳跳，好像小学时体育成绩就一直比较好，体育老师们就推荐我在学校田径队练习。也没有牺牲很多学习时间去练田径，跟其他同学一样，也是要写功课参加考试的。”陈冠锋说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他多次在荔湾区的比赛中名列前茅，被西村青少年业余体校原教练顾燕强发现。 2015年，顾燕强履新广州体育职业技术学院，他跟陈冠锋父母及其本人做了长期思想工作，将中考后的陈冠锋招入学校。 “父母对我很支持，一直和我说的是做你喜欢做的事，自己开心最重要。”陈冠锋回忆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顾燕强评价他：“接受专业训练的时间有点晚，但他练短跑有天赋，身材不错，弹跳力好，是不可多得的人才。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/01/yJAMO94NiPbDa8jm3UteqAMOOKu73TlP0Hi54Vhd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年8月2日，在成都第31届世界大学生夏季运动会田径项目男子100米决赛中，中国选手陈冠锋以10秒17的成绩获得季军&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;初入体校时，陈冠锋基础比较薄弱，百米成绩最高11秒03。随着年龄增长和教练慢慢引导，陈冠锋的训练逐步走上正轨。在顾燕强的计划中，他要花两年时间打基础，训练爆发力、协调性、平衡力、灵敏度，循序渐进提升力量和频率。 2017年末，陈冠锋加入了广东省省队。 2018年，他从省队转正并入选中国国家田径队，成为男子4×100米接力项目的主力队员，开始向更大型的比赛发起冲击。他不断刷新自己原有的速度，在田径赛场上崭露头角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年12月，陈冠锋加入苏炳添的团队接受训练。苏炳添在东京奥运会创造9秒83的“神话”后，由暨南大学、广东省体育局、中国田径协会三方共建的苏炳添速度研究与训练中心成立，以探索田径训练的前沿技术、学科建设和科技创新，支撑田径后备人才的培养和选拔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术团队对陈冠锋的日常训练进行拍摄，针对他的技术动作进行分析。他因此改进了起跑和途中跑。 “我在起跑上的优势还算行，但途中跑非常糟糕。经常前面六七十米是领先的，但是最后二三十米被反超了。”陈冠锋分析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾在杭州亚运会百米跑道上的表现，陈冠锋表示自己的前半程发挥正常，但调整技术后，后半程严重掉速的老问题依然存在。他坦承决赛跑到后半程时腿部略有不适，所以选择了相对保守的完赛策略，毕竟后面还有接力任务。 “目前还处于新技术的适应和磨合中，但已完成挺进决赛的目标，以我目前的硬实力，在亚洲并不算特别突出，所以决赛就是学习、享受的过程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看着前辈谢震业在杭州打破10秒大关，陈冠锋兴奋地表示这是属于中国短跑的历史性时刻。对于是否有机会成为第四个打破百米10秒大关的中国选手的提问，陈冠锋表示会全力以赴，时刻做好接棒的准备。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得有天赋的人太多了，你必须通过刻苦训练，每天保持最佳状态，才能在竞技场上不落下风。”陈键锋说，“这是我第一次参加亚运会，以目前亚洲各国的短跑水平，我不能说肯定能拿名次，但给自己设定的目标是挺进决赛。”就这次亚运会表现来看，他实现了自己的目标，我们有理由相信这位00后运动员会带给我们更多的惊喜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中小学流行“萝卜刀”惹争议：让孩子没有害人之心，比严防死守害人之物重要得多丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近日，一款儿童玩具引发舆论热议。据媒体报道，小学生几乎人手一把“萝卜刀”，这是一款彩色塑料仿刀玩具，借助自身重力实现刀体滑动。 “萝卜刀”可选不同颜色尺寸，价格从5元到25元不等，还有“印花闪光萝卜刀”“夜光重力萝卜刀”等不同款式，网上已经“热销40万”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;媒体报道说，有家长向重庆网络问政平台反映，中小学生把“萝卜刀”带进学校聚在一起玩有安全隐患。还有家长担忧，孩子们模仿刺、捅等动作，会不会对其心理造成负面影响。有专家学者受访时表示“萝卜刀”存在安全隐患，以及“潜意识里激发孩子暴力倾向，拿着真刀做出同样举动”的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乍一看来，似乎萝卜刀是一种名如其物的“刀具”，存在割伤划伤捅伤儿童的危险。如果萝卜刀真的是一种刀刃锋利、容易伤人的道具的话，别说未成年人不应持有，在成人世界里也应该列为管制刀具。但从这款玩具的实际情况看，恐怕其危险性并没有报道中家长与专家渲染得那么严重，“危险”“警惕”“提醒”等字眼，也未免存在夸大其词的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，从萝卜刀的外观与材质看，其“刀口”是个钝角，本身也是塑料制品，其对人类能有多大的伤害能力，仅凭几张捅破白纸与苹果的照片是不具备说服力的，拿铅笔、圆珠笔同样可以捅破，是不是也以危险而一禁了之？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;把玩手里的物体，这是人类与生俱来的天性。哪怕是尺子、圆珠笔这些常见文具，孩子都发展出了转笔、摆尺的娱乐用途。硬要说危险程度，30度的三角板、薄薄的钢尺、尖锐的圆珠笔尖，这几样常用文具中的任何一种拿出来恐怕都比萝卜刀厉害许多。甚至于，长长的手指甲都能划破皮肤。一纸书页也可以划破手指。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，如果仅仅是为了防止这种“塑料钝刀”的可能伤害，就要祭出“家长监护下玩耍”“不让孩子将其带到学校”的举措，这显然是夸大了一个塑料钝刀玩具的威力，并向其投入了不成比例的注意力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，专家学者受访时“激发孩子暴力倾向”的说辞，也值得辨析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在萝卜刀出现之前的漫长岁月里，世世代代的未成年人同样会模拟“刺、捅、戳等动作”，因为这是写在人类基因里的东西。人类祖先是从狩猎活动中一跃成为万物灵长进而统治地球的，模仿与使用武器是每一个小孩的天性。简陋的木剑木刀，或者精致的玩具刀剑，几乎是所有人的童年记忆。谁小时候不曾幻想过自己是超级英雄，或者多少是个将军侠客？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玩乐本来就是孩子认知世界的一种方式，角色扮演与模仿武打动作更是他们不可压抑的天性，“亮出我的萝卜刀，一击制敌”这样的广告语其实也没有什么大问题。如果将孩子模仿使用武器的行为一律贬低为“暴力倾向”，这肯定是不符合形式逻辑也有违常情常理的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小小的塑料玩具与真正锐利的管制刀具之间的差别，模拟游戏与持刀伤人的不同，乃至合法暴力与非法暴力之间的分野，稍有辨识能力的孩子在接受教育之后都可以轻易分得清清楚楚。 “激发暴力倾向”的说法未免有些跨越度过大，也是在否认孩子的认知与辨别能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后从未成年人健康成长的角度而言，对他们进行过度保护其实并不现实。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未成年人的成长历程里总会遇到种种风险，这既是人生的必经之路，也是躲不开的代价。交通规则尚且无法消除所有交通事故，体育竞赛也做不到消灭一切伤病，即便成人社会也无法消除所有风险。校园之内，文具、树枝、桌椅、板凳都可伤人，是否应将校园像监狱一样杜绝尖锐物品与坚硬墙壁，管得水泄不通？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，“不要小看孩子”早就是教育学的共识。家长与学校都不应过度保护未成年人，或是完全否定他们自我管理的能力。未成年人总有一天会长大，不可能一直将他们严防死守在无菌环境里，为每一丝可能的安全风险担惊受怕。正确的做法应是引导他们正确地评估风险，教会他们独立对抗风险的能力。否则，中文世界里就不会有“文明其精神，野蛮其体魄”这样的名言。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，面对“萝卜刀”玩具的爆火，成年人正确的做法是进行合理的导引，传授给孩子正确的价值观。让孩子没有害人之心，比严防死守害人之物要重要得多。毕竟不正之心一起，徒手亦可害人害己；心怀正见正知，利器恰可自卫护人。一个小小的塑料钝刀不但没有多少安全风险，反而可以成为孩子正确看待暴力、学习面对风险的“经验包”。 &lt;/p>;

. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier that day, the &quot;Kyiv Independent&quot; quoted a spokesperson of the Security Service of Ukraine &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(SBU)&lt;/span>; Andrei Yusov said that Kadyrov was &quot;seriously ill&quot; and &quot;his illness has worsened, leading to such a serious condition.&quot; According to the report, the source pointed out that Kadyrov had &quot;fallen into a coma&quot; and &quot;is recovering. Waiting to be transferred from Chechnya to &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(possibly the United Arab Emirates)&lt;/span>; for treatment.&quot; Yusof also told the media, &quot;He &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Kadyrov)&lt;/span>; has been ill for a long time and has systemic health problems. His condition has been very poor in recent days. Serious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Kadyrov is smiling broadly in the video, it can be clearly seen that his facial contour and figure have changed significantly, and he seems to be far fatter than before. Some outsiders have speculated This is the swelling caused by his long-term kidney disease. In short, despite his own personal experience, there is still a lot of speculation and controversy about his health issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kadyrov&#39;s health condition aroused doubts from the outside world in early 2023 - Kadyrov, who claims to be infinitely loyal to Putin and will hardly miss any major events of the Moscow authorities, suddenly disappeared without any notice. Putin was absent from Putin&#39;s annual State of the Union address. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Father&#39;s legacy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ramzan Kadyrov, the current president of the Chechen Republic, likes to call himself &quot;Putin&#39;s little soldier&quot; and is Putin&#39;s most loyal ally. People call him Putin&#39;s fighting dog. In addition to the administrative regions, the Russian Federation also has 24 autonomous republics &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (including the internationally unrecognized territory of Ukraine)&lt;/span>;, Kaiti It is the most special one among the 24 heads of autonomous republics at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes him special is not just his relationship with President Putin, but also that he is a social media influencer. Kadyrov said that while he admired Putin, he also tried to create the same tough guy image as Putin. Therefore, he posted videos and photos of himself firing machine guns and taming tigers on social media, as well as his high-end and luxurious daily life. Kadyrov is not only eye-catching, he is also a person who cannot be criticized casually in the Russian Federation - the leaders of the other 23 autonomous republics obviously do not have this treatment. Any Russian media or individual criticizes him in public, even if he is not there In Chechnya, people will also be asked to be cautious in their words and deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unique status comes from his father Akhmad Kadyrov &lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed Kadyrov, the former President of the Republic of Chechnya, his presidential term ended in seven months - he was killed by a bomb in an assassination attempt in May 2004 at the age of 52 years old. Ahmed was the central figure in the Kadyrov family&#39;s rise to become the rulers of the Chechen Republic, and his life was full of ups and downs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed was born into a poor family in Karaganda, Kazakhstan in 1951. At that time, all the Chechens were transferred from Chechnya to Central Asia by the Soviet government to break up their resistance. They are the descendants of this group of immigrants. Later, with the change of the Soviet policy towards Chechnya, the Chechens were able to return to their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ahmed worked in agriculture and construction during the Soviet era. In the 1980s, he entered the Islamic University of Uzbekistan to study religious studies, and then established the first modern Islamic religious schools in Chechnya, and later more He went to Oman and Jordan for further studies and became a famous religious scholar in Chechnya. In 1993, Dudayev, the leader of the Chechen separatists, declared the independence of Chechnya. Ahmed was a religious leader whom Dudayev relied heavily on. At that time, he also issued a famous declaration of jihad against Russia:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are 1 million Chechens and 150 million Russians. If each Chechen kills 150 Russians, we will win.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the Chechen war broke out, and Ahmed not only called for war against Russia He launched a jihad and personally led a guerrilla force during the war. His youngest son, the current Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, also joined the guerrillas. He later claimed that he had successfully killed someone at the age of 19. One Russian soldier died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian army in the First Chechen War ended in failure and suffered heavy casualties, and was forced to make a humiliating retreat. After the war, Ahmed Kadyrov, who had become the chief mufti of Chechnya One of the main representatives of the negotiations with Russia, his guerrillas were also known as the Kadyrov faction due to their outstanding military exploits during the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is strange, however, is that Ahmed broke with the Chechen independence faction in 1999. In the same year, Putin became the president of Russia, and the second Chechen War broke out. Ahmed this time withdrew his last declaration of jihad and led his troops in an alliance with the Russian government to fight the Chechen separatists he had fought alongside. With his help, the Russian army won the second Chechen War, which became Putin&#39;s first military victory after coming to power. This success avenged its shame, and the popularity of the Putin government was unprecedentedly high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Ahmed defected to help Russia in the second Chechen War, the outside world generally believes that in addition to personal ambitions and desires, he also had to do with the rise of Wahhabi fundamentalists in Chechnya. Worry. As the supreme religious leader of Chechnya, he is quite resistant to the international jihad claimed by the Wahhabis. From an ideological perspective, he is still a Chechen nationalist. After experiencing the first Chechen war, Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was not only reduced to ruins, but also suffered a large number of casualties among the local population, causing serious social problems and economic crisis. At this time, the fundamentalists among the Chechen independence faction chose to ally with bin Laden and his like during the rise of global terrorism in an attempt to expand their territory in Russia. This is obviously not something that the Chechen nation with a population of 1.5 million can accomplish. matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on national sentiments and personal safety considerations, Ahmed publicly accused extremists of using Chechnya as a base for terrorist attacks in early 1999, which was dangerous and full of conspiracies. This led him and previous The relationship between comrades quickly deteriorated to the point of tension. At this time, the Russian government extended an olive branch to him, and forming an alliance became a matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reciprocating the favor, after the second Chechen War, Putin gave Ahmed the throne of Chechen president until his death in an assassination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to determine whether it was Ahmed&#39;s defection to Moscow that prompted Putin to make up his mind to launch a second Chechen war, or whether Putin wanted to establish his prestige through a war after coming to power, or whether the two complemented each other. result. But looking at Ahmed&#39;s choice now, whether it is based on his personal interests or the interests of the Chechen nation, it is not a mistake. Even if he did not defect and the second Chechen War did not break out at the end of 1999, after the &quot;9·11&quot; incident in 2001, it would be difficult for Chechnya to survive independently under the banner of joint anti-terrorism between the United States and Russia. It may even cause a more serious humanitarian disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Prince&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As Putin’s biggest contributor in the Second Chechen War, Ahmed Kadyrov’s political legacy was successfully passed on to his younger son Ramzan Kadyrov. Derov succeeded, and the latter soon became the real &quot;king&quot; of Chechnya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a process for getting to the top. In November 2005, a year and a half after Ahmed was assassinated, the then Prime Minister of Chechnya Sergey Abramov was seriously injured in a car accident and resigned due to health reasons. The cause of his car accident has not yet been determined, and the possibility of assassination cannot be completely ruled out, because at that time, assassinations of Chechen military and political leaders were common, and Sergei was assassinated in 2004, so the truth may never be confirmed. In any case, the biggest beneficiary of this car accident was the then First Deputy Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov. He became acting Prime Minister of Chechnya on November 18, 2005. A year later, he was officially promoted from &quot;Prince&quot; as &quot;King&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ZvIZ8puCKbgy4aB6jOT5UdVh8YhdujEScHCwozQc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;746&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ZvIZ8puCKbgy4aB6jOT5UdVh8YhdujEScHCwozQc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 30, 2004, President of the Chechen Republic Akhmed Kadyrov (right) and his son Ramzan Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan Kadyrov’s first task after taking power was to rebuild Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. He built the Akhmed Kadyrov Mosque in the center of Chechnya in the name of his father, also known as the Heart of Chechnya. It is the largest mosque in Russia and one of the largest in Europe; it has the most It can accommodate 10,000 people, has a magnificent dome, a towering minaret and hand-painted by Turkish craftsmen. These are the standards for large mosques built during the heyday of the Ottoman Empire. On October 16, 2008, the mosque was officially opened. Ramzan Kadyrov and Putin both attended the opening ceremony and appeared side by side in the news. In addition to the magnificent mosque, the palace-like presidential palace, highways, five-star hotels and casinos have risen from the ground. Now Grozny has become a modern city with many high-rise buildings. Its core business district is even compared with Moscow and St. Petersburg. No less impressive. Funding for these large-scale infrastructure projects comes from the support of the Russian Federation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to reward the loyalty of the Kadyrov family, under the personal care of President Putin, the Russian Federation invested US$18 billion in the Chechen Republic in 2010 alone, with an average per capita income of more than US$1,300. In contrast, the autonomous republic of Dagestan next door to Chechnya spent less than $1.6 billion in federal investment in 2010, but the country has a population of 2.2 million. Relying on financial support from Moscow, Ramzan was able to complete the reconstruction of Grozny as one of the core achievements of his internal rule. However, the heavy economic dependence on Russia has also led to a rather deformed economic structure in Chechnya. The local area lacks core industrial chains and the unemployment rate remains high. In 2010, it even reached an astonishing over 60%. It is obviously impossible to solve the problem by relying entirely on federal funds and large-scale construction projects. The core local issue is the economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/alxQC5TrmUCcwFQIdOagoa4PBKvPULr8v5AI7jxx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/alxQC5TrmUCcwFQIdOagoa4PBKvPULr8v5AI7jxx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252397&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 25, 2022, the Chechen armed forces held a swearing-in meeting to prepare for their mission in Ukraine. Chechen leader Kadyrov (middle) takes a group photo with soldiers &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we must note is that La Mzan&#39;s greatest economic achievement in Chechnya is not that he built Grozny into another St. Petersburg through extensive construction, but that he successfully obtained economic autonomy from Moscow. In 2018, Ramzan Kadyrov announced that his government would take over 100% of the shares of Chechen State Petroleum Technology Company, allowing Chechens to develop, extract and sell crude oil on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, 1,100 oil wells and 2,000 land parcels owned by the Chechen State Petroleum Technology Company with a total area of ​​7,740 hectares were all controlled by the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Ramzan has been fighting for control of oil assets in Chechnya since at least 2015, the year he first proposed to Putin that the Chechen Oil Company be handed over to Chechnya. On the surface, Putin agreed to transfer the equity, but in fact he has been putting it on hold. The reason why Moscow adopts the procrastination strategy is not entirely due to economic considerations, but one of the main means of control over Chechnya for a long time is economic control. During the Soviet era, Moscow firmly controlled the extraction, transportation and sales of local oil. Local people could only engage in agriculture and handicrafts, and were almost unable to enter the oil industry. The result of this was that the local area had to rely on financial subsidies from the Soviet Union&#39;s central government, otherwise infrastructure and public spending would be almost impossible to carry out. During the first Chechen war, Chechen guerrillas obtained military expenses by stealing crude oil from Russian oil pipelines passing through Chechnya. The elites in Moscow certainly know the importance of controlling the oil industry in controlling Chechnya. Therefore, they are not only unwilling to hand over control, but also deliberately do not expand local oil production capacity. However, Ramzan successfully overcame the calculations of the oil oligarchs and economic elites by relying on his personal relationship with Putin. With Putin&#39;s personal intervention, Ramzan got what he wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As seen in the fight for control of oil, Ramzan Kadyrov clearly knows what he needs and how to get it from Moscow. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kadyrov&#39;s Chechnya&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chechen high school students are now required to read Akhmed Kadyrov&#39;s biography &quot;The Road Bathed in Light&quot;, according to Chechen state television &quot;, as &quot;supplementary material for the study of Russian history&quot;, the book introduces &quot;the political and spiritual legacy of Akhmad Kadyrov&quot;. Schools are required to organize regular essay and poster competitions featuring Kadyrov and his family. Teachers and school administrators are required to comment on social media posts by Kadyrov and his inner circle as part of their job evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the magnificent Kadyrov Mosque, there are more than 300 streets in the Chechen Republic named after Akhmed Kadyrov. In 2020, Ramzan Kadyrov ordered that images of American comic book superheroes be removed from Chechen children&#39;s centers and playgrounds and replaced with likenesses of his father and other &quot;real heroes&quot; in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan hopes that his father will become the only superhero in Chechnya, and he will become the first Internet celebrity in Chechnya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kadyrov family on the Internet shines brightly, and at the same time they are down-to-earth and full of true nature. Instagram has been Ramzan’s favorite platform for years, where he actively shares his outfits and lifestyle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan also opened a Telegram channel to share his carefully recorded videos and his views on the current situation. He even gained millions of followers by feuding with Elon Musk on Twitter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Run by his PR team, his father, Ahmed Kadyrov, became a loving father and hero who saved Chechnya and became a great martyr, revolutionary and Martyr saint. Ramzan himself is a kind-hearted Chechen brother. Not only does he have an enviable luxurious and cool life, he is also a fan of President Putin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with Vesti-24 TV station in 2018, Ramzan Kadyrov stated that he was rebuilding Putin&#39;s Caucasus native cavalry division, or &quot;Barbarian Division&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very famous allusion to Tsarist Russia. The Caucasus Cavalry Division was affiliated to the Russian Imperial Army. It was established on August 23, 1914. It participated in World War I and was led by Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexander. Rovich conducts. The division earned the nickname &quot;The Barbarians&quot; for its lax discipline, but the unit was a fighting force, distinguished itself during World War I and was loyal to the Tsar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ramzan&#39;s concept of &quot;barbarian divisions&quot; actually has a deeper meaning. Since Putin intends to incorporate Tsarist Russia into the orthodox national historical narrative, Ramzan&#39;s repeated mention of &quot;barbarian divisions&quot; is precisely to borrow from ancient times. Yu Jin showed his loyalty to Putin. In fact, Ramzan has been working hard to maintain an image of himself and the Chechen nation as brave and loyal. The security forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs controlled by Ramzan not only collaborated with the Russian army in South Ossetia&#39;s war against Georgia in 2008, but also actively participated in the Syrian war. Chechen special forces have frequently participated in various international special forces competitions, and have won the Jordan King&#39;s Cup special competitions many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lzvpOxPRgyNW9F2JGK2lIcNC5q2C7Zx2VReO5K60.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lzvpOxPRgyNW9F2JGK2lIcNC5q2C7Zx2VReO5K60.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252395&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 13, 2023, in Moscow, Russian President Putin (left) met with Chechen leader Kadyrov&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to participating in Russia-related military operations, the international community also accused Ramzan of participating in the assassination or intimidation of Russian anti-government figures, but there is not enough evidence to prove this. Prove this. Since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Chechnya has sent tens of thousands of troops to directly participate. Although there is no evidence to prove that they played a key role in the war, and they are not even as good as the Wagner mercenary group that successfully captured a city, their posture is undoubtedly very important. in place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What further illustrates Ramzan’s attitude is that when Prigozhin led Wagner to march into Moscow in June 2023, local troops along the way were unable to intercept him. Only Ramzan Kadyrov’s men were the last to stop him. The elite &quot;Akhmat&quot; special forces positioned themselves on a bridge near the town of Kolomna, about 110 kilometers from Moscow, preparing to intercept the Wagner rebels, saying they were ready to fight to defend Vladimir Putin. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Loyal enough, and Ramzan clearly does not look like a threat to Putin&#39;s regime. Not only because of the small number of ethnic Chechens, but more importantly, within Moscow’s power circle, Kadyrov’s only political backer is Putin. If Putin loses his support, there is no guarantee that the next Chechen president’s surname will still be Kadyrov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it seems that the probability that the future leader of Chechnya will be named Kadyrov is still very high, not to mention that members of the Kadyrov family almost control all important positions in the Chechen government. Like his son Akhmat Kadyrov who is less than 18 years old &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Akhmat Kadyrov)&lt;/span>; was also attacked in March 2023 received an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant reports, this was an informal meeting.

Putin congratulated Akhmat on his upcoming marriage and shared with Akhmat his memories of his relationship with his grandfather, Akhmat Kadyrov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one knows what they said, but they may have talked about Putin meeting a weeping Ramzan in the Kremlin after Ahmed was assassinated in 2004. News reports at the time said it was also an informal meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外星人遗体被发现？全世界有几百万人每天都寻找外星人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258006]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;audio id=&quot;contents-audio-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021854137506&quot; data-media=&quot; audio&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Podcast · Some Culture Alien remains have been found?

However, netizens in Shandong have posted When the tall man next to him came out, Heilongjiang netizens were not idle either. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that in the national height competition between boys and girls, the height of boys in Heilongjiang ranks first, while the height of girls ranks first in Shandong Province. With the development of economy and life As the level increases, the average heights of men and women are 174 cm and 161.4 cm respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Height has always been a topic of public concern. What kind of height is best in the eyes of the opposite sex? According to Polish scientist Pokryka, the standard for a perfect woman is an average height of 1.74 meters, and the standard for a perfect man is an average height of no less than 1.82 meters, with leg length equal to the length of the upper body, and a ratio of 1:1 that makes a man Looks stronger. However, the so-called perfect body standard cannot be generalized. In the era of aesthetic diversity, health has a standard definition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what factors determine height? First of all, 70% of a person&#39;s final height depends on genetic factors, but in addition to genes, nutrition, exercise, environment, living habits, etc. all have a great impact on height. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is only an ideal standard. In reality, there are still relatively few situations that can achieve this state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current aesthetic trend of society pursuing height, many people will have height anxiety and try unconventional remedies to increase their height through injections, medicines, and surgeries.

According to reports, the theory of &quot;Zero Limit Cleansing Method&quot; comes from &quot;At Zero&quot; written by American Xiu Lan in 2007. It is translated as &quot;Zero Limit: Hawaiian Therapy for Creating Health, Calm and Wealth&quot;, and the mantra is &quot;Sorry, Please forgive me, thank you, I love you.” Doesn’t it sound very positive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, a group of young people who were inexperienced in the world joined Xueba Mao&#39;s &quot;body, mind and soul community&quot;. &quot;There are thousands of people, and more than 70% of them are women.&quot; Ordinary spiritual practices often teach people to control or let go of desires. Xuebamao does the opposite, allowing students or believers to buy without asking the price or looking at the labels. Debt does not matter. Xuebamao believes that in order to “clear away the fear of money, one must choose a method of flowing large amounts of money to open up one’s own energy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe in it and use their savings to buy or borrow money to buy what they like, and buy various courses and consultations from Xuebamao. &quot;With the expansion of the community one after another, there has been a trend of debt consumption among students. Living in a large flat, driving a luxury car, going to Xinrongji for afternoon tea, and constantly opening credit cards...Xueba Mao Dai With one bracelet, everyone will go to the same store to buy the bracelet. Not only that, everyone&#39;s speaking style is becoming more and more similar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is Xueba Mao? In 2015, Mao Mao, a top student who graduated from the sociology department of a certain university, tried to start a business; around 2017, she found &quot;body, mind and soul practice&quot;. In 2021, the price of courses began to increase, and Xuebamao changed its original simple style, and the community was renamed &quot;Xuebamao·Hogwarts Lady Branch&quot;. A student discovered that her course had experienced several rounds of price increases, from 199 yuan to 999 yuan in the first quarter, and the price increased to 9999 yuan in the third and fourth quarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This true story makes people feel a lot of emotions when reading it: First, the students believe in Xueba Mao’s spiritual practice theory and spend their own money to buy and buy in order to gain spiritual freedom. Xueba Mao Whose money does it cost me to buy flowers? In this real-person game, who is the real financial freedom and spiritual freedom? Secondly, spiritual cultivation is really a good business. As long as the seller makes people believe in his theory and himself, he can make the buyer &quot;use his body and his arms, and his arms and his fingers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, there is supply only when there is demand. The various spiritual schools on the market actually reflect the spiritual crisis, spiritual crisis and value crisis faced by some people in the modern social environment. To put it simply, it is because it is too short to enter modern society, and many people have suffered from many mental discomforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not to say that traditional societies do not have such crises, but that comparatively speaking, such crises are much less common in traditional societies. This is because traditional societies are basically in a state of scarcity, and people are busy working all day long to provide &quot;three meals a day&quot; for the whole family. In fact, &quot;three meals a day&quot; is just rhetoric here. Only in an era of abundant food can everyone live a healthy life. &quot;Three meals a day&quot; day. In this case, most people are mainly concerned about survival and have no leisure to pay attention to the so-called spiritual life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, everyone leaves the countryside where they are familiar and in their comfort zone and enters the city full of strangers. On the one hand, the income is much higher than that of their ancestors, and it is not a problem to have enough or even good food. Son, in addition to higher income, there is also more leisure. In fact, people cannot really let themselves be leisurely, so they will inevitably have spiritual thinking and pursuit. But on the other hand, natural blood communities such as families tend to disintegrate. Everyone in the city is atomized and scattered. We come into contact with many people every day at work, but how many people can we have close relationships with? Humans are social animals, which brings a lot of loneliness and insecurity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to get rid of it, some people will look for like-minded people online and offline. People with similar knowledge background or values ​​will come together, as well as common interests and hobbies such as fishing or playing games together. In short, we must &quot;talk with the same voice&quot; &quot;Response, seek each other with the same spirit&quot; to settle their own souls; some people throw themselves into the embrace of spiritual practice and the like. There are all kinds of methods, all of which are used by people to relieve or solve their spiritual atomism, loneliness and insecurity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Chaoyang District Rinpoche to &quot;Master Wang Lin&quot; to various &quot;body, mind and spiritual teachers&quot;, the routines and profit models of these people are similar: I know that you are facing a spiritual crisis, a spiritual crisis and a crisis of values. , come on, lost lambs, children of lost souls, come to my arms and hand over your body and mind to me. I have the final and definite answer here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the so-called &quot;body-body-spiritual guru&quot; also went through a process of spiritual struggle and internal consumption to enlightenment. &quot;Human, too human&quot;. His personal experience increases the credibility of the narrative and the &quot;truth&quot; he preaches. Credibility.在某个阶段，会皆大欢喜，学员得到了虚幻的心灵自由，导师则得到了真实的财务自由。但最终，你可能无法生活在自欺与谎言中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们每一个人都得明白：只能在做有意义的工作中、过有意义的生活中，发现意义本身，建立自己强大的价值观内核，质朴刚健，有勇气去开拓、去面对、去战斗，为自己、为家人。这一切都得靠自己与真心爱自己的家人，买不来，买来的必是赝品与麻醉品。须知，精神上的软弱是最大的软弱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
