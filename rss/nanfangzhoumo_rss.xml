Corruption issues in key positions and key areas.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, many former officials of the State Tobacco Administration have been dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Zehua, former member of the Party Leadership Group and deputy director, was investigated in July, and Zhang Hong, former director of the Department of Science and Technology, was investigated in July. Ling Chengxing is the highest-ranking official dismissed from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration since its establishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Zhao Hongshun, a former party member and deputy director, was investigated in February 2019, and Pan Jiahua, a former party member and leader of the disciplinary inspection team, was investigated in January 2022. Zhao Hongshun was sentenced to life imprisonment in June 2020, and Pan Jiahua was sentenced to 11 years in prison in April 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The starting point of official career&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before Ling Chengxing was investigated, the tobacco system had been continuously shaken, and many department and bureau-level cadres were dismissed intensively across Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places, among which Jiangxi, the starting point of Ling Chengxing&#39;s official career, was the hardest hit area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 1, 2023, Li Benjian, a former division-level cadre of the Jiangxi Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (Company), underwent disciplinary review and supervisory investigation. According to Caixin reports, this person once served as Ling Chengxing’s driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 6, Zheng Wei, Party Secretary, Director and General Manager of the Guangdong Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (Company), was dismissed. He was previously the General Manager of China Tobacco Jiangxi. On the same day, Fu Wujun, the first-level business manager of the Human Resources Department of China Tobacco Jiangxi, was subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanggao County in Jiangxi Province was the starting point of Ling Chengxing’s career. He started working in 1980 and was promoted to the Standing Committee and Deputy County Magistrate of Shanggao County at the age of 27. Thereafter, he served as director of the Jiangxi Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, and eventually became a member of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and executive deputy governor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Ling Chengxing was elected as a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress in Jiangxi. A media person who interviewed Ling Chengxing at the Two Sessions told Southern Weekend reporters that during the discussion, everyone still called Ling Chengxing &quot; Governor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retiring in 2018, Ling Chengxing was still very concerned about his hometown Shanggao. His only public appearance after retirement was to visit the water supply company in his hometown accompanied by the local county party secretary, county People’s Congress director and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Area hardest hit by corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 2013 to 2018, Ling Chengxing served as a member of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group, and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, China&#39;s cigarette sales fell by 2.4% in 2015, the first decline since 1995, equivalent to smokers reducing their consumption of 60 billion cigarettes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that the tobacco tax will be raised by 6 percentage points starting from May 10, 2015. The price and tax rate of the cigarette wholesale link will be increased from 5% to 11%, and the price will be increased by 0.005 yuan/cigarette. A specific tax is levied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the trend of declining sales, Ling Chengxing, who has always been low-key, took the initiative to accept an interview with the &quot;Study Times&quot; sponsored by the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposing to &quot;prevent (tobacco control) from becoming expanded, one-sided, and absolute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the National Two Sessions in 2015, this also became the focus of reporters’ questions. What is the expansion of tobacco control? Ling Chengxing replied: &quot;Let me give you an example. Some people say that bone hyperplasia is caused by smoking. I think this has no scientific basis. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, China&#39;s cigarette sales stopped falling and rebounded. rose, with 47.378 million boxes sold throughout the year, an increase of 0.8% compared with 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the discussion of tobacco control, the tobacco industry’s government-enterprise integration system has always been the focus of discussion. In the eyes of the tobacco control party, the government-enterprise integration system has become the biggest obstacle to tobacco control in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ling Chengxing’s predecessor, former Party Secretary and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, Jiang Chengkang, made the biggest institutional reform of China’s tobacco industry by promoting the “separation of industry and commerce” at the provincial level, but the reform failed to continue. further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Ling Chengxing took office, he followed the previous ideas and rapidly expanded the scale of the company through mergers and alliances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first stop for his research after taking office was in Yunnan. After the merger of Hongyun Group and Honghe Group, the newly established &quot;Hongyun Honghe Group&quot; became the largest group after Altria Group, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco. , the world&#39;s fifth largest tobacco group after Imperial Tobacco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 30, 2013, a symposium on cultivating major brands of Yunzhen cigarettes was held in Mile County, Honghe Prefecture. Ling Chengxing, who had just taken over as the director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, issued the tobacco &quot;Policy Agenda&quot; for the first time: Adhere to &quot; &quot;Three Stabilities&quot; (the guiding ideology determined at the beginning of the year remains unchanged, the goals and tasks remain unchanged, and the work measures remain unchanged); maintain the &quot;Three Stabilities&quot; (stabilize the leadership team, stabilize the cadre team, and stabilize the morale of the employees); think, plan, and practice &quot;Three major issues&quot; (where are the dividends of tobacco industry reform, where is the potential for development, and where is the goal of catching up). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ling Chengxing also implemented a number of reforms during his tenure. Starting in 2014, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration issued the &quot;Key Points of the Market-oriented Reform of Cigarette Marketing&quot; for four consecutive years, but it was limited to the marketing level, focusing on &quot; How can commercial enterprises truly reflect market demand, how can industrial enterprises meet demand in a timely manner, and how can industrial and commercial enterprises respond to market demand in a timely manner?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the previous &quot;foreign troubles&quot; in which China Tobacco faced direct competition with foreign brands, Ling Chengxing faced more internal management pressure. During his tenure, many major cases occurred in the tobacco system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, a scandal broke out in the Henan Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, and many people including the former director were arrested. There is also the case of Yang Weizu, chairman of Yunnan Ruisheng Group, who is associated with the Yunnan Tobacco Science Research Institute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, at least a dozen central officials in the tobacco system have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ping, Party Secretary and General Manager of Hunan China Tobacco Industry Co., Ltd., was investigated in October 2020 and was suspected of accepting bribes of 413 million yuan and misappropriating public funds of 135 million yuan. This case is known as the most serious job-related crime in the tobacco system since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A disciplinary inspection cadre analyzed the causes of corruption in the tobacco system to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The tobacco system is different from other vertically managed departments. It is a system that integrates government and enterprises, and the path to realize power is very difficult. Short, all links are accompanied by indicators, which results in power being permanently concentrated in the hands of a few people and the lack of effective supervision, making it more difficult to fight corruption in the tobacco system.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tobacco Bureau even controls the money bags of local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An interesting detail is that during the National People’s Congress in 2015, a mayor publicly appealed to Ling Chengxing that he wanted to improve the quality of cigarette production. “It used to be that Septwolves were basically OEM, and the taxes and profits of Septwolves were relatively low. It would be great if the next step is to produce Chinese cigarettes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was refuted by Ling Chengxing on the spot, &quot;That&#39;s impossible. China Tobacco is a banner of the tobacco industry.&quot; The mayor said with a smile that “it may not all be the pen of the (old) governor” and suggested that better equipment could be invested in production. Ling Chengxing still insisted, &quot;When you come to engage in Zhonghua Cigarettes, you will immediately destroy the Zhonghua Cigarettes (brand).&quot; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the mayor continued, &quot;While the (old) provincial governor is in the position of the General Administration, a certain city&#39;s tobacco industry chain tax revenue can reach 10 billion yuan.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that this media record at the time was preserved under Ling Chengxing&#39;s instruction. According to an insider, &quot;He may have just wanted to show that he rejected the other party.&quot; The mayor who made this request was dismissed soon after because of his involvement in the Su Rong case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“啥都不用干”是最大的福气吗？ ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259230]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Many people have said &quot;I don&#39;t want to work&quot; when they are sleepy or frustrated, but these words are probably inappropriate. Really, if we don’t have any mines or pie from the sky, what else can we do if we don’t move bricks honestly? But there are indeed some people who regard &quot;no work and someone to support you&quot; as the highest ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger said that since childhood, her aunt has indoctrinated a bunch of little girls, including her, with the idea that girls are &quot;blessed&quot; and can enjoy a good life without doing anything. . Not only do you not have to do anything, but you marry a good family and you don&#39;t even need to take care of the children yourself. That is what you are blessed to do. This concept is close to &quot;labor equals shame&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all have inertia and a desire for comfort. In our subconscious, we may have had the image of just lying down and enjoying ourselves. When I was a kid, I experienced the intense itching pain all over my body after harvesting and threshing rice and wheat by hand. I also had &quot;plans&quot; to stop working. But honestly, just think about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extravagant and luxurious life in books and movies is described in the wonderful lyrics of &quot;Huang Liang Meng&quot; by the Pingdiao Luozi Theater Company in Handan City, Hebei Province: &quot;Endless generosity, endless power; Endless delicacies to eat, endless money to spend; endless carols to listen to, endless gifts to receive; endless wealth to enjoy, endless New Years to live.&quot; Ordinary people can just think about it, and really educate themselves like this Children, that&#39;s really gone astray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For ordinary people, when they are minors, they are supported by their parents, and when they become adults, they have to support themselves and their families on their own. If you want to live a good life, you can only accumulate it step by step. This is the first meaning of work for most people: to support their families. In order to achieve this goal, many people work very hard and may not be in a career they like, but they persist because this job can bring acceptable returns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is very painful to do a job that you don&#39;t like for a long time. A friend told me that the joyless days at work day after day were really a torture. But even so, we can&#39;t &quot;just leave&quot;, we can only wait for the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My friend’s words moved me deeply. The reason why people should work hard is because work should have a second meaning: combining it with one&#39;s own talents and interests, making the work itself a source of fulfillment and happiness. Many writers have been doing writing work for a lifetime based on their talent and interest. I have also been a media commentator for many years based on my talent and interest. This is a blessing. There is also a kind of work that may seem heavy and tiring, but it may be something that workers like to do. For example, blacksmithing is not acceptable to most people, but in reality there are people who work very hard at it. I also heard a car mechanic say that although it may be tiring and dirty all day long, it is a job that interests him and cannot let him go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the values ​​that ordinary people should uphold, try to do meaningful work and live a meaningful life. In other words, a livelihood should be one that can not only meet the purpose of earning money to support the family, but also satisfy interests and hobbies. Accordingly, we not only get practical benefits, such as income and evaluation, but also spiritual satisfaction. This sense of gain is the spiritual source that enriches us in this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people envy the financial freedom of wealthy families, but they only know one aspect but not the other. Even among the envied few &quot;giant pandas&quot; in society, most of them do not relax their requirements for their children. Instead, they pay more attention to providing high-quality education and scientific employment guidance to their children, and to promote their children to pursue a decent and respectable career. jobs and better realize the value of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, these families need their children to inherit the family business. In order not to be left behind for this goal, they are motivated to help their children avoid becoming &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;dandy children&quot; who only consume high amounts of money and live in vain. Look at the young people who have inherited the family business of wealthy parents today. Which one has not experienced the nourishment of a good education and the tempering of basic work. Many people have the ability to protect their children from dust, but they still let them start from the &quot;workshop&quot; and perceive the meaning of life. This is true wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the many second-generation rich people do not sit around doing nothing all day long, eating, drinking, and waiting to die as some people imagine. In other words, people who are more &quot;qualified&quot; than ordinary people to do nothing work harder than you. What other reason do you have for fantasizing about “doing nothing”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don’t forget, if you really have nothing to do, you will definitely fall into emptiness. If a person does not &quot;fill&quot; his life with meaningful things, he will easily fall into emptiness and become as light as a feather. In this case, even if you get a fortune one day, you will not be able to control such wealth. In Yu Hua&#39;s novel &quot;To Live&quot;, he explained the story of a swinger brother who lost his family fortune by gambling. How many such folk narratives are there? After the demolition in my hometown many years ago, the &quot;second generation&quot; became rich instantly. However, it is not uncommon for them to lose their property overnight due to gambling, dissoluteness, and being cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am obviously middle class or even poor, but I still always want to live a &quot;fairy life&quot; like a powerful or wealthy family, just enjoying myself and not working. To put it mildly, this is unrealistic, but to put it seriously, it is unrealistic. This is a lack of self-awareness. This idea is difficult to realize. In short, humans are animals of meaning, and meaning is the food of the spiritual world. On the basis of establishing a good life, people should do meaningful work or career to nourish our spirit. Under the sun and on the earth, we should still let ourselves &quot;sink&quot;, settle down, and become human plants that are truly not afraid of wind and rain. This principle applies to both the second generation of rich people and the children of ordinary people. Meaningful work or a meaningful career is the &quot;key&quot; that helps a person lead to a happy and transparent state. Only when you find a sense of presence and cultivate your character in your work or career, can you follow the trend. For, gradually improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[取消个人医保账户？国家医保局辟谣]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259436]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 15:04:11&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, an article titled &quot;Employees Attention! &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;From 2024, employee medical insurance premiums will be completely changed&quot; article and related screenshots were circulated online in some WeChat groups, WeChat Moments and other places.

After the reform, the employee medical insurance personal account system will still be retained, with three &quot;unchanged&quot; features. First, the ownership of personal account balances remains unchanged. The historical balances before the reform and the newly transferred balances after the reform are still owned by the individuals and can be used for medical expenses and other expenses for individuals and their families, and can be carried forward and inherited. Second, the proportion and flow of personal contributions of active employees remain unchanged, and the full amount is still transferred to their personal accounts. Third, the policy of retirees not paying contributions remains unchanged, and personal account funds are still transferred from the overall fund. At present, the reform has achieved positive results, and the level of outpatient benefits of employee medical insurance has been steadily improved. In the first half of 2023, general outpatient services will benefit 1.124 billion people insured by employee medical insurance.

This is one of the tasks of my country&#39;s second comprehensive scientific investigation and research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores are like natural archives, recording natural changes and human activities. However, climate change caused by human activities is also erasing the memory in the glaciers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why ice core? Why study glaciers? Who is studying Mount Everest? With various questions, we followed the Everest scientific expedition team in 2023, traced the history of the Everest scientific expedition for more than 60 years since China&#39;s first comprehensive expedition centered on Mount Everest in 1959, and recorded the progress of the glacier scientific expedition. The goals and actions can gradually describe the outline of those engaged in glacier research: most of them come from rural areas, are brave, can endure hardship, love nature, and love field work. They find peace and joy in nature, they are not stingy with time, they are aware of and concerned about the pulse of the earth, and they believe that the world is a community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Shi Yafeng, the father of Chinese glaciers, said, glacier research is a career for brave people and a heroic career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mount Everest is the main peak of the Himalayas, the tallest and youngest mountain range in the world. The Everest region mainly includes the &quot;Everest Nature Reserve&quot; in China on the north slope and the &quot;Sagarmatha National Park&quot; in Nepal on the south slope. With widespread glaciers, it is an important treasure house of freshwater resources on the earth and is also a source of climate and environmental change. Sensitive areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UWRilmxdoeZ2bErRTuZhdK8y4UyVlv1RajRdhTFV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UWRilmxdoeZ2bErRTuZhdK8y4UyVlv1RajRdhTFV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255409&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 23, 2023, members of the scientific expedition team took snow and ice samples at the top of Mount Everest&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ice cores, nuclear explosion tests and pesticides&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;All four drill motors were broken. If it breaks down, just go down the mountain, Chen Pengfei thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of May 20, 2023, at a pass at an altitude of 6,500 meters on Mount Everest, in a military green tent that was blown by the wind, Chen Pengfei and his colleagues shot two Ice core and a shallow ice core. Shallow ice core is an overloaded task: we have worked hard to get there, and we have to drill more until the drill breaks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores are cylindrical ice and snow samples that are continuously taken out from the glacier section by section using a drill from top to bottom. A bottom-through ice core means that the ice core is drilled into the rock layer and reaches the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Snowfall falls on glaciers and ice sheets. Year after year, it is deposited into ice, and the information of nature is sealed in it. The scientific expedition team members always want to obtain longer ice cores, hoping that the ice cores will contain more physical and chemical parameters. Relying on these parameters, scientists were able to reconstruct the history of changes over millennia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Antarctica, the North Pole and the Tibetan Plateau are collectively known as the &quot;three poles&quot; of the earth. Human activities in these three poles are weak and are used as the basis for environmental research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We need to know what the earth was originally like.” Chen Pengfei’s colleague Guo Junming said. They are all associate researchers at Northwest China Institute of Technology, which belongs to the State Key Laboratory of Cryosphere Science. This laboratory originated from the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciation and Permafrost, Chinese Academy of Sciences (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;established in 1965&lt;/span>;) and was founded by the &quot;Father of Chinese Glaciers&quot; It was established under the leadership of Shi Yafeng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores know the original appearance of the earth. For example, the ratio of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen reflects the fluctuations in climate, and high values ​​of sulfate ions represent volcanic eruptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice cores also retain evidence of violent human activities, such as nuclear explosion tests and nuclear leaks one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Everest ice core drilled in 2005 was measured to have two beta activation peaks, corresponding to the global thermonuclear test in 1963 and the Chernobyl nuclear leak in 1986. In other words, the memory of the Cold War is sealed in the glacier. In 2017, ice cores drilled in the Aru glacier area at an altitude of 6,150 meters on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were measured with five beta activation peaks of varying levels, which not only correspond to 1963, but also correspond to the 2004 Mihama Nuclear Power Plant in Japan.

The peak lead content in the Greenland ice core drilled in 1994 corresponds to the peak period of the Roman Empire; the black carbon concentration in the East Rongbuk ice core on Mount Everest reflects the continued impact of pollutants emitted by human activities since the Industrial Revolution on the atmospheric environment; more The concentration of DDT in the Everest ice core corresponds to the malaria outbreak in India. DDT is a highly effective but environmentally damaging pesticide that is difficult to decompose. It has been banned by many countries since the late 1990s, but is still used in India. Therefore, the content of DDT in the forest soil of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is currently the highest in the world, higher than Nordic Forest 10 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice core research is difficult to do because the sample size is very small and the appropriate detection indicators are limited. Even if there are good ideas, ice core research is extremely time-consuming and laborious. But ice core research is exactly the direction of Chen Pengfei’s transformation. “At this stage, I need the quality of papers more than the quantity,” he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To ensure that the ice core does not melt, ice core drilling always starts at seven or eight o&#39;clock in the evening and ends before the sun rises. Engineers use exhalation to judge when to start work: if you can exhale &quot;white air&quot;, the temperature is low enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before finishing work at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, Chen Pengfei always walks out of the tent to watch the sunshine on Jinshan Mountain. The golden light falls from the sky and shines on the snow-capped mountain top. He had seen this scene more than 30 times at the pass, and he was delighted and moved every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How to describe it, starting from the top of the mountain, the golden color slowly falls, and then the entire Mount Everest is golden. It is very spectacular and I like it very much.&quot; Chen Pengfei said. His WeChat avatar is Rizhao Jinshan, a photo he took when he first came to Mount Everest in 2013. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/nHTIwV6CtvarPGACGZCX91n3jXsBx6ldim9Lmia8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/nHTIwV6CtvarPGACGZCX91n3jXsBx6ldim9Lmia8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255407&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 23, 2023, the scientific expedition team members maintained and upgraded the automatic weather station at an altitude of about 8,830 meters on Mount Everest&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The glacier snow surface is printed with a complete human shape”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Those who engage in scientific research are always the poorest, and many scientific research team members They all say this with some embarrassment or a joke. There are too many places to spend money, and the equipment and consumables in the laboratory are the real gold-swallowing beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the specially designed drilling rig, the ice cores are surrounded by ordinary objects: ice cores in ordinary plastic bags, marked with black markers; the insulated box is the most common one, dark blue in appearance, one meter in diameter. It is half a meter long and wide, with soft pads inside to protect the ice core from impact; the soft pads are basically cut military green quilts, with red or black mottled cotton batting exposed here and there; as for the freezer, it is a common cold drink cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, it seems that the difficulties Chen Pengfei encounters can be attributed to saving money. On the second day of work, the generator failed to start. It was a non-Yamaha generator. The next day I pulled up the Yamaha generator and worked all night. Closed on the third day, Yamaha was damaged by a rare strong wind. On the fourth day, I borrowed a generator from Everest Base Camp to work, and asked my colleagues to quickly transport another generator. On the fifth day, the tent was completely blown to pieces and the business was closed again. Although the strong wind made people unable to stand steadily, the working tent was just a slightly thicker outdoor tent that had been blown by the wind on the Qilian Bayi Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/sEz01Dwdsa2zl4XMJ4peip4mBeM6yO7jy5wzn99V.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/sEz01Dwdsa2zl4XMJ4peip4mBeM6yO7jy5wzn99V.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255404&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Pengfei&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(our reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t shave, Stop shaving.&quot; Chen Pengfei recited silently every night. It wasn&#39;t until the seventh day when new tents and new generators were used that the team members began to work continuously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As everyone in the cryosphere knows, ice coring is hard work. Chen Pengfei’s teacher, Vice President and Researcher of Northwest Institute Kang Shichang wrote in his Antarctic scientific expedition diary: “Compared with the glacier scientific expedition on the Tibetan Plateau, the conditions for the Antarctic ice sheet expedition are much better... The glacier expedition on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, There are only tents, especially in high-altitude areas. They usually use stones to build a stove, use a box to support a chopping board, and cook and cook in a corner of the tent. Sometimes chefs and scientific expedition team members can only sleep in the kitchen tent. Large We don’t have beds for part of the time, so we lie on the ground.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For Everest expeditions, we usually camp on moraine ridges surrounded by rocks. We try to find a few slightly flat stones and lay them with moisture-proof mats. Leather mattress. Every night we are constantly moving and changing sleeping positions, trying to avoid the direct &#39;collision&#39; of sharp rocks and looking for a relatively flat and comfortable position. Sometimes, we also need to camp on the glacier. Once on Mt. During the inspection, I lived for a month on the 6,300-meter-high Rongbuk Glacier in the Far East. When I left, there was a complete human shape printed on the snow surface of the glacier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Shichang participated in the China-U.S. Joint Pearl River Delta Initiative in 1997 The scientific expedition team on Mount Everest drilled the first ice core on Mount Everest; in 2005, he served as the captain of China’s fourth comprehensive scientific expedition team on Mount Everest; in 2013, he led the team to drill 3 ice cores on the East Rongbuk Glacier, including 142 The meter-long one is the longest Everest ice core drilled in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The suffering on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau cannot be compared to the Antarctic.&quot; He said. Almost all work in Antarctica is mechanized, but on the glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau, all work relies on human power, such as shouting slogans to drag dozens of kilograms of ice cores across the ice ridge. Not only must we overcome altitude sickness, we must also do heavy physical work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Creating ice is also a laborious activity. Therefore, in addition to scientists, there are more workers in the team. Most of them have cooperated with Northwest Institute for many years, going to the plateau to climb snow-capped mountains, and walking far away carrying a 100-pound generator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/j9gcOLRvL7U9oBvhhtHO2xip2WHxU3DuARq9qLuk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/j9gcOLRvL7U9oBvhhtHO2xip2WHxU3DuARq9qLuk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255410&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Zhaofu (left)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(our reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 6500 After working continuously for more than ten days at Mi Chu, everyone felt weak. The strong wind not only damaged the tents and generators, but also made the team members unable to walk every night. &quot;It was obvious that the team members were a little out of control, their tone was a little tough, and they were a little broken.&quot; Chen Pengfei said. Sometimes everyone would sing in the tent, singing loudly without knowing the words or music, which was more like a way to vent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I couldn’t eat or sleep well, and there was strong wind and heavy rain. Everyone has had the experience of getting lost, either using Mani Stones to identify the direction, or relying on teammates&#39; calls to find someone. Everyone has worked on the plateau until they were exhausted. Kang Shichang once chased a frightened yak carrying samples at an altitude of 5,000 meters for samples, until both the yak and he were unable to move due to lack of oxygen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In your subject, will there be more children from rural areas?” We asked Kang Shichang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s absolutely true.&quot; Kang Shichang replied loudly, &quot;Almost all are rural children, and rural children can endure hardship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youngest member of Kang Shichang&#39;s team is Hu Zhaofu, 2023 He left his postdoctoral position in 2011 and joined Northwest Institute. He is from Suzhou, Anhui and grew up in a village next to the Lianhuo Expressway. Before going to middle school in the county town, he not only often climbed mountains, but also caught scorpions: he would lift up rocks, and when he found a scorpion, he would hold its tail and blow on it, and then skewer it with chopsticks. Small scorpions are sold for 1 or 2 cents, and larger ones are sold for 40 or 50 cents. Hu Zhaofu, a primary school student, can get more than one yuan of pocket money every time he catches a scorpion. I was stung four or five times, but I didn&#39;t deal with it, saying that the pain would be gone in a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Hu Zhaofu participated in the scientific expedition to the Geladandong Snow Mountain. He worked for 20 days at an altitude of about 5,800 meters, and was able to eat, sleep, and be physically strong. That time he was particularly happy and a little proud. &quot;I see that other people are a little high-reflex, so I feel that my body is capable of doing this job, and God is giving me food.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/25/8WI03FcUtgWZ3wQwrIKW9NwgjxT1P60rH0SGtYmo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/8WI03FcUtgWZ3wQwrIKW9NwgjxT1P60rH0SGtYmo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255406&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guo Junming&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Reporter Dashi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The ice tower forest is gradually melting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The ice tower forest is getting less and less.” Hu Zhaofu said. The first time he climbed Mount Everest was in 2019. In the past four years, the shrinkage of the seracs was visible to the naked eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 5800 and 6300 meters on Mount Everest, the seracs gradually shrink to become sparse and low, making them hard to find at a glance. You have to walk to the mountain col to see them. The seracs look like the teeth of a giant shark and are a form of ice unique to high-altitude areas. Seracs that appear in groups are called seracs. Unlike most seracs that are not as tall as a person, the Everest seracs are scattered in heights, with the tallest ones exceeding 30 meters. Because the seracs on Mount Everest are so tall and resemble a Gothic spire church, Western explorers call them the &quot;Penitentes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seracs are remnants of the melting glaciers. Due to the different movement speeds and ice densities of various parts of the glacier, some cracks and gaps will appear on the surface of the glacier. Mount Everest is located at 27°59&#39; north latitude, which is a low latitude and uneven sunlight exposure. When glaciers melt, the ice in the cracks melts faster, and seracs gradually form. As the temperature rises, the seracs gradually melt and may accumulate into glacial lakes or merge into rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Permafrost areas are most sensitive to climate change. The Tibetan Plateau is warming at a rate more than twice the global average, and scientists warn that by 2100, the Tibetan Plateau will lose two-thirds of its glaciers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where is the boundary between man and nature changing each other? Every time he goes out to work in the field, some broad, abstract, and unanswered thoughts will envelope Guo Junming and last until he goes down the mountain. &quot;Human beings are part of the earth. When people adapt to the earth, they will inevitably change the earth. What degree of change is appropriate? The future temperature control value we call is actually the boundary where humans feel comfortable. What about the earth itself? The earth has never experienced such violent activities. Where is the boundary of the earth?&quot; He asked a series of questions and finally concluded, &quot;I sometimes wonder if the earth can be in any state without humans?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no answers to these questions, but these questions give meaning to Guo Junming’s research. His recent research focus is on the mercury cycle in the cryosphere of the Tibetan Plateau. Human activities cause large amounts of mercury to enter water bodies, atmosphere and soil, and then enter the ecological cycle. Mercury can be detected at all three of Earth&#39;s remote poles. In the 1950s, mercury-containing wastewater was discharged from Minamata Bay in Japan. Fish and shrimp were contaminated, and then entered the bodies of birds, cats, and humans through the food chain. The victims ranged from slurred speech and staggering, to neurological disorders and death. This is the &quot;Minamata Disease Incident in Japan&quot; that shocked the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2017, the Minamata Convention on Mercury came into effect, and so far 128 countries have signed it. In Guo Junming&#39;s view, it was batch after batch of scientific researchers who used research results to clarify the environmental behavior and hazards of mercury, which promoted the birth and signing of the Minamata Convention. He hopes that his research can help all parties understand mercury more fully, and then promote the implementation of the contract by signatory countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Currently, mercury emissions in many countries in Europe and the United States have dropped, but emissions in South Asia are still very large. What I want to study is what impact and how mercury emissions in South Asia have on our Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.&quot; He explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/WU7AmICxijsST7iuLs8uDqokazvx1aj00Q5JnVBx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/WU7AmICxijsST7iuLs8uDqokazvx1aj00Q5JnVBx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255405&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gao Tanguang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(our reporter’s food/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enjoyed this Such freedom, no longer wanting to do regular work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The ice cores that were dug were buried in the snow. After the ice core penetrated to the bottom, the team members walked back from the pass to the camp at 6,350 meters, packed the boxes until late at night, and waited for the yaks to carry the insulated boxes down the mountain the next day. They then stored them in the base camp freezer and transported them back to Lanzhou by truck. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not two days after returning to Lanzhou from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Guo Junming returned to the office to be busy. He is 36 years old, in his prime academic years, and the breadwinner of his family. Every day he receives a steady stream of phone calls, routine work one after another, and noises he wants to avoid again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice coring is different. There is no signal at 6,300 meters, and Guo Junming’s mobile phone hardly turns on. &quot;It&#39;s so cool not to have a mobile phone, hahaha,&quot; Guo Junming laughed, &quot;I said it a bit harsh, and that&#39;s true. As soon as I got back to the city, I kept calling, emailing, WeChat and all kinds of things. Even if I couldn&#39;t receive them on Mount Everest, I would reply. No, I didn’t do it on purpose, I just couldn’t help it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He called his home satellite phone every two or three days. In addition, Guo Junming only has three things to do on Mount Everest: eat, sleep and make ice cores. &quot;Creating ice cores with peace of mind.&quot; Guo Junming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having been to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau many times, Guo Junming is now quite proficient in climbing Mount Everest. He knows how far it is to walk from an altitude of 5,300 meters to 6,300 meters. He can always reach it by walking slowly at his own pace and taking his time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tjNJmoO8ystPHYNqgPbyjL9xgC3zDj1wrykNdOPl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tjNJmoO8ystPHYNqgPbyjL9xgC3zDj1wrykNdOPl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255399&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; =&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zou Qiao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going out into the wild is work, and it is also an adjustment to one&#39;s life. &quot;It&#39;s really depressing to stay in the office for a long time. Go out and see the mountains, lakes, and climb mountains. There will be a few days where you can experience another kind of life, and your mental state will be better after you come back.&quot; Guo Junming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although going out into the field is no longer a necessary condition for geological research, and samples taken by colleagues or partners can also be used for research, in our interviews, everyone participating in the 2023 Mount Everest scientific expedition Scientific researchers all love nature and love going out into the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Tanguang, associate professor at the School of Resources and Environment of Lanzhou University, offered to take us mountain climbing during the interview. &quot;Let&#39;s change places. It&#39;s a bit silly to sit here (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;café&lt;/span>;),&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who would have thought that the interview would be in Wuquan Mountain, the northern foot of Gaolan Mountain, a natural barrier in Lanzhou city. Not only does Gao Tanguang take his children to climb Wuquan Mountain every Saturday, he even holds group meetings for students by climbing the mountain first and then talking about academics after climbing to the top. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is the senior brother of Chen Pengfei and Guo Junming. He also graduated from the Tibet Institute and studied for a doctorate in Beijing for five years. As a native of Shandong, he worked as a teacher at a key high school in Beijing after graduation and also worked in his hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/GKxiX67cZQvbT3hDKbojRgth2FIx0tQ9ss06yVG7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/GKxiX67cZQvbT3hDKbojRgth2FIx0tQ9ss06yVG7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, near the Mount Everest Mountaineering Base Camp, scientific expedition team members from the School of Ecology and Environment of Tibet University collected aquatic life samples&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both of these work experiences were very short because they were boring. &quot;When you have experienced the scenery of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for several consecutive years, when field work accounts for a large part of your life, when you have enjoyed the atmosphere of the research group chatting and laughing in the wild, and enjoyed the abundant time to search for something for several days in a row, I have been running around in the mountains, not caring about anything, completely isolated from the outside world. I have enjoyed this kind of freedom, but once I enter a regular job, it is really unbearable.&quot; Gao Tanguang said, &quot;I have always felt that cities are just reinforced concrete. It&#39;s hard to never get out of the forest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to live freely and live freely. It is difficult to tell whether this is his nature or whether it was shaped by his five years of studying at the Institute of Tibetan Studies. In the past five years, he not only went out in the wild, but also loved to ride mountain bikes in Beijing. He rode from his dormitory to Yanqing, a round trip of more than 100 kilometers. He spent a year as a visiting scholar at the University of Jena, Germany, and traveled through Northern Europe (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;focused on playing in the Arctic Circle&lt;/span>;). He spread out a blanket at the train station and slept, not afraid or alone. &quot;I was in a small town in Norway. I was going to sleep at the train station at night. A group of German college students came in and sat together and took turns reading to everyone. My German is not good, so I couldn&#39;t understand anything I read, but it was so interesting. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tJ3R0BpP98C1XsEeQVFiJopSqi3mArE4kkE7kZYH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960 &quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tJ3R0BpP98C1XsEeQVFiJopSqi3mArE4kkE7kZYH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255401&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 22, 2023, near the Mount Everest climbing base camp, scientific expedition members collected soil samples&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Danger&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Pengfei refuses to miss every sunshine on the Golden Summit, Guo Junming finds peace in making ice cores, and Gao Tanguang is free due to field scientific research. But the romance and charm of glacier scientific research often belong to the lucky and brave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, the name Lin Shubiao was mentioned. In 2011, 29-year-old Lin Shubiao, a doctor from the Institute of Tibetan Studies, disappeared while inspecting the Muztag Glacier in Xinjiang. After completing the installation of the automatic weather station on the Muztag Glacier in Xinjiang, he lost contact while descending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most speculations are that he fell into a deep and winding ice crevice and could not be found by search and rescue. He is a native of Tangkou Natural Village, Zhendong Village, Jiushi City, Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province. He won the &quot;township top scorer&quot; in the high school entrance examination. He walked out of the mountains in the college entrance examination and was called &quot;the pride of the mountain people&quot; by the villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ice crevasses are the biggest danger in glacier scientific research. Most of the time, the crevasses are covered in snow and difficult to see. Kang Shichang once fell into a half-meter-wide ice crevasse. He held his feet on both sides of the crevice, and his body was suspended in the air, waiting for rescue. &quot;I wasn&#39;t afraid at all at that time. The other team members would definitely look for me when they saw that I was missing!&quot; Today, 22 years later, when he talked about this past incident, he suddenly slapped his thigh and said, &quot;Hey! I&#39;m really scared when I think about it now, but I didn’t panic at all at that time! I was so courageous at that time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if they have never fallen into an ice crevasse, everyone can tell a story about a serious case of high fever that they witnessed with their own eyes. Urgent transports down the mountain often encounter dangerous moments: they may get lost halfway and fail to arrive late at night; or they may have become incontinent, and the consequences would be unpredictable if they were slower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, modern glacier scientific research was born along with mountaineering expeditions that represented human courage. Early scientific expeditions to Mount Everest were always closely tied to Everest expeditions. They also began with human curiosity and desire for unknown territories. Mountaineers not only want to climb Mount Everest, but also get back precious basic information, such as images or samples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The first expedition made very valuable geological surveys, and both expeditions also observed and collected many geological and botanical specimens. The geologists wanted a stone from the summit of Mount Everest , so that you can determine whether the peak is at the top or bottom of the fold.&quot; In 1922, Mallory, the British explorer who first attempted to climb Mount Everest, introduced the scientific gains of climbing Mount Everest twice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time China organized scientific researchers to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the 7,000 square kilometers centered on Mount Everest was in 1959, in order to cooperate with the national mountaineering team in preparing for the first climb of Mount Everest. The first modern glacier scientific expedition in China was just two years ago, in 1957. At that time, regarding the activities organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to climb Mount Gongga, He Long, then director of the National Sports Commission, instructed: Mountain climbing should serve scientific research and expand social effects. Three scientific workers were selected to climb Mount Gongga: Cui Zhijiu, Ma Wenfu and Ding Xingyou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;That&#39;s a hero! Our hero in the glacier world!&quot; In a chat, someone mentioned Cui Zhijiu. Kang Shichang gave a thumbs up and said in a loud voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Zhijiu’s glacier career began in 1957 when he climbed Mount Gongga. The following year, he published &quot;Preliminary Observation of Modern Glaciers in the Gongga Mountains&quot;, filling the gap in the study of modern glaciers in China. The subtitle of this paper is: &quot;In memory of the comrades who died heroically in the conquest of Gongga Mountain.&quot; In Gongga Mountain, four team members encountered mountain disasters, including scientific worker Ding Xingyou, who was an assistant professor in the Meteorology Department of Beijing Agricultural University at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next 10 years, Cui Zhijiu visited the Everest region twice and climbed Nyenchen Tanglha, Muztagh and Shishapangma. He lost five fingers from the cold, suffered from severe snow blindness, and experienced the sacrifices of 12 teammates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that such tragic stories have rarely been seen in glacier scientific expeditions in the past 30 years, but what the older generation of scientists experienced and persevered still has lasting power for those who come after them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Tan Guangzheng, who was born in the 1980s, read &quot;Qinghai Tibet: 50 Years of Scientific Investigation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Published by Sanlian Bookstore in 1999), I have been fascinated by the Qinghai-Tibet scientific research since college.

He returned home with a full load. As soon as he got off the train, he was dragged into a fight and locked up in a cowshed that night. He was criticized for three years, but he quietly compiled the investigation data in the bullpen and completed a thesis on the ice-forming effect of infiltration on Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 1972, the Qinghai-Tibet Scientific Expedition Team was established. Many experts who had lost their jobs and had been working in the &quot;May 7th Cadre School&quot; all year round told each other that they called it a &quot;safe haven&quot;. Through this scientific expedition team, our country began to establish an understanding of the Tibetan Plateau from different subject dimensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from the 1950s, the main achievements of the 30-year first phase of modern glaciology in China were the completion of regional and national filling of snow, ice, and frozen soil. This basic work means long and arduous field expeditions and a lifelong dedication of a group in particularly harsh conditions: the starting point of the work of glaciologists is where the snow line lies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the snowy swamp area, the car was stuck and dug repeatedly, and on the extremely cold night when the wind and snow overturned the tent, you would feel the burden on the lungs and heart every step you took, and for those with severe mountain sickness, emergency rescue, the joy of surviving a desperate situation, the fragility and magnificence of life that can be experienced in the snowy mountains and ice fields, as well as the relief and countless emotions at the end of each expedition... After every danger is saved, they will always I was overjoyed: &#39;It was so dangerous!&#39; After every field trip, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh with regret. But when I went out to the field again the next year, I was brave enough to move forward courageously. Choosing this career also meant accepting it. Everything related to it.&quot; There is such a passage in &quot;Qinghai-Tibet Vast&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;The Vast Tibet&quot;, in 1980, when the International Scientific Symposium on the Tibetan Plateau was held, Deng Xiaoping smiled loudly and replied in Sichuan dialect: &quot;We in China have With so many mountains, it doesn’t matter if you take away a few stones. They can take them if they want.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, international exchanges and cooperation in Tibetan Plateau research have become routine work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My mentor is very far-sighted.” Kang Shichang talked about academician Qin Dahe, the first Chinese to cross the Antarctic continent on foot and the author of the assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When my supervisor trains students, he must first be international. When I was studying for a Ph.D., he asked me to study abroad several times, and my postdoctoral work was also done in the United States.&quot; Kang Shichang was a little emotional, &quot;When I was in After traveling around the world, I realized that there are differences in culture and good and bad politicians, but people are very amiable. Many times, group interests and political interests lead to many conflicts on our planet. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because the subject research he is engaged in is always related to the changes of the entire earth. In Kang Shichang’s eyes, the earth is the dust of the universe, and human beings are the dust of the earth. Disputes and conflicts are inevitable in the face of the vast universe. Lost meaning. &quot;Global warming is not caused by any country, but by all mankind. Human beings on the earth must be peaceful and united without too many conflicts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/eqTDESi1mURABf2rWjkoots7uARONNc9rvAa7QGe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/25/eqTDESi1mURABf2rWjkoots7uARONNc9rvAa7QGe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255411&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xi Zhenhua at Everest Base Camp &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Reporter Dashi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Don’t waste time at the Mount Everest Station&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past 10 years , every scientific researcher who goes on the scientific expedition to Mount Everest has to deal with Xi Zhenhua. He is the observation supervisor of the Mount Everest Atmosphere and Environment Comprehensive Observation and Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Everest Station&quot;&lt;/span>;), and is also The person in charge of various specific affairs at the Everest Station in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Zhenhua has been at the foot of Mount Everest for 10 years, and this time is constantly lengthening. He is an indispensable part of various scientific expeditions on Mount Everest. The Everest Station, 30 kilometers away from the base camp, is the last preparation area before the Everest scientific expedition. Here, the scientific expedition team members can use the power supply from the national grid, sleep in bed with air conditioning, and use the toilet normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its completion in 2005, in the past 18 years, the Everest Station has evolved from a tent to a prefabricated house to a building, and its observation and monitoring instruments have gradually been completed. After Xi Zhenhua came to the Mount Everest Station, he added several people as helpers to perform data collection on different scientific research tasks, such as regularly monitoring the hydrology of the Rongbuk River, observing the growth of alpine shrubs, and guarding against local plum blossoms being eaten by plateau sheep, instrument The battery was stolen. During the peak season of the scientific expedition, he helped the scientific expedition team communicate with the locals, arrange food and accommodation, and deal with various practical problems, such as driving injured workers to the hospital in Shigatse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, in order to prove that he could stay at the Mount Everest station, Xi Zhenhua stayed on the mountain for more than half a year for the first time. He had diarrhea as soon as he drank water and lost more than 20 pounds. It was not until he spent the New Year at the village cadre&#39;s house that he learned that boiling water in a pressure cooker could cure his acclimatization. &quot;Now it doesn&#39;t matter whether I use a pressure cooker or not. I just get used to it as I drink,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Zhenhua is already half a local. On the way up the mountain with him, he chatted enthusiastically with his &quot;three brothers and three sisters-in-law&quot; and regretted that he missed the horse racing festival. There are two boys from the nearby Basong Village who often come to play basketball in front of the Everest Station. Xi Zhenhua watches with gusto. He went to a Tibetan home to celebrate the Tibetan New Year, where he ate steamed vegetables, drank wine, sang, danced and played dice. After the round, he came back to eat, drink and sing. He also collects donations of clothes from his circle of friends and distributes them to villagers with financial difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is not good at sociability, but he has become familiar with the locals because of his time. &quot;Over the past few years, they have become familiar with this place. Maybe they think that I am very honest and I will not treat them badly, so they are very willing to help me with many things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This place was only opened in 2016 When the power was turned on, the violent storm cracked the window glass. Peppers, potatoes, leeks and rapeseed are grown in the vegetable greenhouse. During the meal, eight people share a plate of scrambled eggs with leeks. The weather is getting colder, and I shiver with cold every time I go down the river to measure data; when going up or down the mountain in the middle of the night, there are frequent rockfalls, and swarms of moths and lime hit the windshield. Every time I go forward, it is like breaking through the fog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once upon a time, Xi Zhenhua’s closest friend was a native dog named Dahuang, who had been there since he entered the station. Every time he returned to the station in the middle of the night, Dahuang would lie at the door waiting for him, and would rush at anyone he saw. Wags the tail forward. &quot;Last year, before I got on the plane, I found out that Dahuang was dead. I couldn&#39;t stop crying all the way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a secular sense, Xi Zhenhua has many disappointments. But after seeing mountains and rocks for months and years, he forgot about that. &quot;Sometimes you can live very easily if you don&#39;t think about the messy things. Day by day passes like this, very fast.&quot; Xi Zhenhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is not stingy with time, has few desires, and is somewhat insensitive. Staying at the Mount Everest station for 10 years is not painful for Xi Zhenhua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He loves to pick up stones and relies on his imagination to select stones: like a lady dancing, like a white tiger lying prone, like a Tibetan antelope leaping. When I was most lonely, stones were piled up on the wall behind the Everest station. He doesn&#39;t smoke and doesn&#39;t drink much, so he passes the time by recreating stone textures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Zhenhua’s real pain is his relationship with his daughter. He spends little time with his family and knows that his children have a weak relationship with him. Sometimes the video only hangs up after saying two or three sentences. &quot;We will face this kind of problem in the wild for a long time. It is always a problem and there is nothing we can do about it,&quot; he sighed. Every time he thought about this, he felt a little regretful about coming to the Everest Station. &quot;I want to stay with my wife at home.&quot; Children.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After coming down from the mountain in 2023, Xi Zhenhua went to his daughter&#39;s school to participate in the &quot;Parents in the Classroom&quot; activity. He told the primary school students about the origin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, his work on the station and interesting stories. The daughter was very happy that day and thought her father had done a good job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At least I can gain some status in the children&#39;s hearts.&quot; Xi Zhenhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking from the open space in front of the Everest Station, if the sky is clear, you can see a small section of the Golden Summit at sunset. Sometimes there are colorful auspicious clouds, so colorful that they have the gentle power to soothe people&#39;s hearts. In the middle of the night, I looked up and saw the starry sky, with the Milky Way brushing across the night like a brush. Many steep unknown mountains have names in Xi Zhenhua&#39;s mouth: This one has a lion&#39;s face, that one has a horse&#39;s body. His favorite saying is: Compared with Mount Everest, these are nothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/ZQxbMx6X9tJPsw9g9DNDvqUFfmpHNtIZ1Mqdr3fi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/ZQxbMx6X9tJPsw9g9DNDvqUFfmpHNtIZ1Mqdr3fi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;British explorer Mallory&#39;s photo spot&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zou Qiao/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cross Two photos from the year 102&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before reaching 6,500 meters in 2023, the scientific expedition team will stay at the base camp for many days to complete glacier end sampling, glacier lake measurement, and an idea of ​​​​slanting out: find Here’s another photo of the location of the Rongbuk Glacier in Mallory’s 1921 photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest existing image of the Everest glacier was taken by British explorer Mallory. Mallory once said a famous sentence in the history of mountaineering - when someone asked him why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, he replied succinctly:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because the mountain is there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The dream of climbing Mount Everest has attracted the British elite for many years. Veteran and mountaineer Mallory was selected by the British Mountaineering Club to become the hope of seizing the afterglow of the once &quot;empire on which the sun never sets&quot; after entering the 20th century. Since the second half of the 19th century, British exploration has ceased to lead. They repeatedly failed in the race to open the Northwest Passage and reach the North and South Poles of the Earth. After the end of World War I, Mount Everest, known as the &quot;Third Pole&quot;, became Britain&#39;s last hope to prove itself. Many newspapers in the UK published a speech by Younghusband, chairman of the Royal Geographical Society - better known as a colonist who led troops to invade Tibet in 1903-1904 and killed many people - saying that he was the first to stand on Everest. Those at the top will inspire countless comers and cheer up the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mallory climbed Mount Everest with the team in 1921 and 1922. The first time he reached an altitude of 7,000 meters, he photographed the Zhongrongbuk Glacier; the second time he reached an altitude of 8,320 meters, with 7 people on the way. Sherpa killed by avalanche. His teammates found a trail leading up through the East Rongbuk Glacier: a rise of dirt and rock right in the middle of the glacier that made it possible to hike directly across the glacier. Since then, climbers and scientific expedition team members of all generations have walked through this road to reach the 6,500-meter mark of Mount Everest. Western explorers call it the &quot;Miracle Highway&quot;, and Chen Pengfei said they call it the &quot;Yak Trail&quot;: this is the last section of Mount Everest that yaks can pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1924, Mallory climbed Mount Everest for the third time. This time he had a young partner, Andrew Owen, a student from Oxford University. On the morning of June 8, the two set off from 8,300 meters with new oxygen equipment, and then disappeared on Mount Everest. It was not until 1999 that an American mountaineering team sponsored by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) discovered Mallory&#39;s body at about 8,170 meters on the north slope of Mount Everest, but there is still no trace of Owen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the two men had ever reached the summit during their lifetimes has become one of the most famous mysteries in the history of modern mountaineering. The climbing team did not find a photo of Mallory&#39;s wife in Mallory&#39;s well-preserved belongings. He once promised that if he reached the summit, he would leave a photo of his wife on Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Rongbuk Glacier photographed by Mallory is a photo familiar to permafrost researchers. Kang Shichang even used this photo as the cover of a course teaching the changes in Mount Everest glaciers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding Mallory’s shooting spot was Gao Danguang’s task, and he was quite excited about it. Mallory was his favorite explorer: full of grit, heroic tragedy, and unsolved mysteries. He initially did not know that the 1921 photo of Zhongrongbu Glacier was taken by Mallory and that it had appeared in his study materials. When he learned that the photographer was Mallory, a sense of intimacy came over him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many years ago you read bits and pieces about someone, and then suddenly discovered that you had already met him in your work, and it was like the intimacy of meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign country. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glaciers are changing all the time: accumulation and melting constitute the material balance of ice and snow. Climate change can tip this balance off at any time, causing glaciers to advance or retreat. Therefore, scientists always want to obtain as much data as possible on changes in glaciers over time to study the changing processes of glaciers and climate. Although glacier monitoring in the Himalayas has made rapid progress in the past 20 years with the help of satellite remote sensing technology, long-term continuous observations are still lacking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we can take another picture of the Zhongrongbuk Glacier at the Mallory shooting point, it will move the time scale of observing glacier changes forward by 102 years. This is the scientific significance of finding Mallory&#39;s shooting spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gaotanguang failed three times, for different reasons: unable to cross the moraine on the west side of the Rongbuk Glacier; there was a problem with the instrument; the shooting point was found but was blocked by clouds and fog. Finally, his junior brother Wang Shaoyong and an accompanying reporter took a picture of the Zhongrongbu Glacier in 2023 at the Mallory shooting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the first glacier distribution map of the Mount Everest region drawn by the British mountaineering team in 1921, Gao Tanguang compared the two photos spanning 102 years and was surprised to find that the distribution of the Rongbuk Glacier in mid-1921 The seracs are about 4 kilometers below the current terminal seracs, and the huge glacial lake at the end of the glacier today did not exist back then. This means that as the global climate continues to warm, the end of the Zhongrongbuk Glacier is retreating by an average of 40 meters per year, and the retreat rate is increasing year by year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, the end of the Halong Glacier in the Animaqing Mountains in the Yellow River source area has retreated by 450 meters in the 11 years from 2006 to 2017, while the Gangjiaquba located in the east of Geladandang, the source of the Yangtze River The glacier has retreated more than 4 kilometers since 1969. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SGCzy0HK8bSTD86oxanq9IR03P3EWHWGGyFL5Yvq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SGCzy0HK8bSTD86oxanq9IR03P3EWHWGGyFL5Yvq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255408&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At about 12:30 on May 23, 2023, the 13 summit members of the 2023 Everest Scientific Expedition successfully climbed to the top of Mount Everest, the top of the earth.

On the way to the foot of the mountain, the falling snow enveloped the surroundings in a white mist. The spray-like snow blown off from the snow-capped mountains looks like endless white scarves against the blue sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 40 centimeters of snow in Gradandong delayed Chen Pengfei’s work progress: every step seemed to be opening a path. “I thought it would take two days to move everything, but now it looks like it will take five or six days.” When he thought he would lose the signal, he shared a photo of a snowy field with us. It was a vast expanse. “Under the snow were stones and straw bags. , It’s easy to sprain your feet and you have to return to the tent before dark. If you are too tired from walking, the team members will collapse easily.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Kang Shichang’s team took ice cores from Gradandong was in 2005. Chen Pengfei This time we walked higher than 18 years ago: the higher the altitude, the less likely it is for the glacier to melt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2005 Gradandong ice core was cut into more than 3,000 small pieces. Zhang Qianggong, a researcher at the Tibet Institute, tried to date it by testing indicators related to nuclear explosions - this is the most mature method for dating ice cores. one. But it took him two years to locate the peak of tritium activity in the 1960s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We expected that the peak should appear at about 20 meters, but in fact it appeared at 5 meters. In another ice core from Nyenchen Tanglha Mountain, we did not find a corresponding nuclear explosion Value, this has caused us a lot of trouble, what is the problem?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Zhang Qianggong brought the ice core to the Paul Hill Institute in Switzerland. &quot;This is the world&#39;s largest nuclear energy and chemical laboratory. The research finally determined that the top of the Gladandong ice core corresponds to 1982, but this ice core was drilled in 2005, and the top should correspond to 2005. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In other words, the records of the Gradandong ice core from 1982 to 2005 are missing. The information loss of the Nyenchen Tanglha ice core is even greater. The records only stop at 1950. Ten years of memories have disappeared.&quot; Zhang Qianggong shared this research experience in a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Global warming is melting the ice. Research by two generations of scientists has confirmed that human activities are causing rising temperatures. Based on the six climate change policies issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as IPCC&lt;/span>;) from 1990 to 2003) Take the first assessment report as an example. The 1990 report stated that “there is very little observational evidence to detect the impact of human activities on climate.” By 2007, the report stated that “global warming since the mid-20th century is likely to be caused by human activities.” By 2023, the IPCC is very convinced that &quot;there is no doubt that human activities have caused warming of the atmosphere, oceans and land.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glaciers remember human activities, but human activities are also erasing glaciers memory. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fairness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As temperatures rise and glaciers melt, the consequences are of course not only the disappearance of serac forests, but more importantly, the occurrence of avalanches, floods, and the reduction of fresh water resources. There are an increasing number of large glacial lakes in the Himalayas that could burst their banks at any time and destroy high mountain communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Global warming is not only about the environment, but also about fairness. The most vulnerable people and ecosystems are disproportionately affected by loss and damage and are suffering a disproportionate share of the adverse impacts of climate change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2006, the village of Harji in western Nepal has been hit by glacial lake floods every summer. Floods and reverse currents flew down from the glacial lake on Namunani Peak at 5,300 meters in the western Himalayas, sweeping away houses, horses and crops; in 2012, an avalanche in the Himalayas caused river flooding and killed more than 70 Nepalis; In 2016, the Nepalese military spent several months dredging Lake Imza, the glacial lake on Mount Everest. In 2018, scientists warned that climate warming will cause the glaciers in the Himalayas to melt at an alarming rate, and Lake Imza may continue to expand. Eventually it collapses, possibly causing horrific floods in Nepal. Rishi Ram Sharma, director of the Nepal Hydrological Meteorological Service, said: &quot;As a small country, it is difficult for us to prevent what happens to the glacier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the IPCC&#39;s Sixth Assessment &quot;Synthesis Report&quot; stated , almost half of the world’s population lives in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Over the past decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable areas than in low vulnerability areas. “Taking the right actions now will bring about fundamental changes that are crucial to building a sustainable and equitable world.” IPCC emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 1961 to 2016, the Tibetan Plateau lost more than 43 billion tons of ice, but this is less than one percent of the global ice retreat. The global ice volume has lost more than 9 trillion tons in 55 years. In the 1990s, about 0.8 trillion tons of ice melted every year. From 2000 to 2017, the annual ice melt volume was about 1.3 trillion tons. In simple calculation, 1 trillion tons of ice is a large ice block with a length, width and height of 10 kilometers, which is higher than Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now is the warmest time in the past two thousand years. Recovery is a very slow process. I can&#39;t imagine how to cool the earth and restore the seracs. You won&#39;t be able to see this by the end of this century. &quot;Arrived.&quot; Kang Shichang said, &quot;The amount of water released by the glacier ice sheet causes the sea level to rise by 3 millimeters per year. If the global sea level rises by 15 meters, it is equivalent to the demise of the Greenland ice sheet. Then the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, The Pearl River Delta will be in catastrophe.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have made many early warnings, but the power of change often does not belong to them. IPCC Chairman Li Huisheng told government representatives around the world during discussions at the 2023 conference: “Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce loss and damage to nature and people, but also bring wider benefits. If we take action now, we can still provide a livable and sustainable future for everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time we take ice cores, the team always asks some Tibetans to help, 24-year-old Dundang Also among them. He is from Quzong Village, one of the villages closest to Everest Base Camp. Everest tourism, Everest scientific expeditions and commercial mountaineering have brought new livelihoods to the people of Quzong Village. Dundang said, &quot;Here, Everest is our greatest resource.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What do you think of Mount Everest?&quot; Has the peak changed?&quot; a reporter asked him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mount Everest has not changed, it is still the majestic Mount Everest.&quot;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&quot;How do you think about killing a person in a place with complete surveillance?&quot; Intermittent voices came from the phone. . 2023年的初秋，上海街头的一家咖啡馆里，科幻作家糖匪在电话采访中说起新小说集《后来的人类》的最初想法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年4月，在因新冠疫情波动而难以自由出行的日子里，糖匪开始重新打量自己居住的房子。彼时她住在北京闹市区的一座老房子里，房子面积不大，书房被书填满。糖匪偏爱这种都市生活里的闹中取静。尽管不少朋友已经在家里配备了齐全的声控智能电器，但是她家中的智能电器并不多。糖匪独居，家里唯一安装的摄像头是为了照顾相伴18年的狗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;重新打量自己的住所，多少会产生一种异质感：一间房子，就像组成城市的一块积木，人居住其中，用手机牵引着屋里一连串的智能电器——它们是科技时代的电子生物，聆听主人的召唤。当智能电器被驯化得足够智慧的时候，它们是否会像宠物一样去维护主人和家庭呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科幻写作是糖匪观察世界的棱镜。雨果奖、星云奖得主，美国华裔科幻作家刘宇昆翻译了糖匪的第一篇科幻小说《黄色故事》，当他见到糖匪的时候，觉得她就像她笔下的故事，不被习俗束缚，不为销量写快餐甜品文学。在科幻小说集《奥德赛博》《看见鲸鱼座的人》中，糖匪执迷于穿梭都市、幻境和宇宙。 “不管是外星人还是时间旅行，不管是都市恐怖还是虛拟现实技术，糖匪的小说擅长用这些科幻小说常见的比喻来表达以及质疑我们作为人的洞察。”在刘宇昆看来，这正是科幻世界的特质，“现实比小说更科幻，而科幻思维反而变成了说实话的方法。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“未来已经到来，只是尚未流行。”尽管凯文·凯利早已在《必然》中提醒人们面对技术的态度，但当AlphaGo、ChatGPT引发社会关注时，人们仍很难将人工智能视为当下的现实，而是或澎湃畅想科技开启的广阔未来，或对此继续保持警惕。糖匪是热衷于研究新技术的科技爱好者，但她在自己的科幻小说集《后来的人类》中，却将视线投向了被技术时代抛下的“后人类”，她在小说里写那些不知不觉中从社会消失的普通人，用科幻重新描摹那些被时代抛弃之人的生活，揭示了科技对人们的生活方式和人际交往模式的深层次改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在糖匪的小说中，未来已经到来，人类进入全面的人工智能时代，但人们依然怀有对过去生活的记忆，一半自我踏入了云端的洁净未来，另一半自我陷在地面的肉身记忆。在人与机器耦合的赛博世界里，人们有上传到云端的虚拟分身、有增强大脑能力的脑机组装手术，公寓里有掌控一切的人工智能“家庭主脑”、满足家庭成员性欲的机器“欢喜”，人们还可以在球形振子场出租自己的身体……糖匪用细腻的笔触描摹着后来的人类：和记忆一起消失无形的鹤来、被“家庭主脑”监视的家庭主妇欣敏、“心态稳定”如塑料人的美妆博主陈可青……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这些故事讲的是最普通的人类日常事情，却写出了技术时代张爱玲般的感觉，触及了人类最柔软和最坚硬的部分，从来没有见到科幻把它们表现得如此细致入微、缠绵悠长而令人心痛。”科幻作家韩松说，他觉得这样的科幻小说是属于未来的真正的文学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《快活天》中，糖匪想象了一种未来的新型公寓。在未来，人们不再为房贷和房租苦恼，曾经让整个社会紧绷的住房问题早已消散无影，居住权是人们与生俱来的权利，“年轻一代已经忘记那个住房紧张的时代。由于气候条件缩短大量建筑的耐久年限，生活资源高度集中，住房供应一度非常紧张。即便最后一代婴儿潮过去，城市人口锐减，可居住土地面积仍然无法满足现有人口。新型公寓的出现结束了那段混乱拥挤的日子。”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《快活天》&lt;/span>;）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在未来，集约化智能型的智能公寓被技术赋予了温度，又把温度传递给那些选择它的未来人。在新型公寓中，人工智能“家庭主脑”控制着公寓的一切，从各种家具和电器的使用，到遍布家中的听筒、空气成分分析仪、红外摄像针头的数据收集，甚至能细化到对家中各平面的压力、热度及微辐射的数据分析。技术为居住于此的人提供了幸福、高效、便捷的生活，也控制和监视着这些家庭的一切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只是在这些家庭里，有资格控制机器的是谁呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WtMDY37206Cqnz5LHmqwUUSwMS9JIHXl40wpwm6V.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WtMDY37206Cqnz5LHmqwUUSwMS9JIHXl40wpwm6V.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;读到糖匪的《快活天》时，小说家辽京感到有些恐怖，她给糖匪发微信说想起了《1984》。小说里公寓的“家庭主脑”无所不知，“它是以服务者的身份出现，无所不知，以无所不用其极的细微方式去照顾这一对夫妻，但实际上它是一个监视者，甚至成为了一个统治者。”辽京说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“其实在过去的几年里，大家经常会有这样的感受。好像我花钱买了部手机，下了一些软件之后，我给我自己戴上一个锁链。”辽京在糖匪的新书沙龙上分享着自己的感受，“我们觉得自己是手机的主人，觉得手机是以我为主，但如果我出门忘带手机，可能我哪里都去不了。当你觉得技术对你是一种无所不至的关怀和照顾的时候，实际上你是陷入了某种枷锁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在数字时代的技术渗透中，人们的被监视感似乎无处不在。写《快活天》时，糖匪好奇的是，如果人在每天居住的公寓失去了主动性，那这个把人照顾得无微不至的公寓，是否更像法国哲学家米歇尔·福柯提出的“全景监狱”，技术真的能为弱势赋权吗，还是会加强剥削、加速分化呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小说中，哪怕到了人可以把一切记忆和思维方式上传到云端的科技未来，住在未来公寓的家庭还是“男主外，女主内”的家庭模式，这来自糖匪的特意设置。妻子在家做家务，妻子通过调配“家庭主脑”，掌控着家中大小事务，看起来是家中的主人。然而“家庭主脑”的控制权限在丈夫手中，哪怕只是调节家中的电器参数，都需要等丈夫下班回家后，获得他的允许才能实现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“虽然是发生在未来的故事，但实际上的阅读感受非常当代。它作为我们经常会谈论的家庭主妇的处境，在很多电影、电视剧也出现过。她在她的家庭生活里的地位甚至低于公寓的&#39;大脑&#39;，她一直处在被控制、被监视的环境里，虽然她好像是主人，不断有需求，但实际上她连修改参数的权限都没有，她不会得到这个权限。”辽京说，“她在想，那我要AI干什么？为了让我能够更主动、更好地完成家务。这个问题的提出实际上涉及一个核心问题，就是到底是谁在利用谁，是谁在奴役谁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一次次的科技飞跃中，被看见的是科技进步，不被看见的是被掩藏的劳动。小说里，糖匪特意描画了这位女性和家庭AI的关系：在家中，最了解她、给她最多陪伴时间的，是她亲手驯养出来的“家庭主脑”AI。而她的工作也是用人类的经验和情感去“喂养”AI，打成文字输入到AI后台，让AI可以更好地为人类服务。面对智能公寓里无处不在的家庭主脑、面对对自己视而不见的出轨丈夫、面对好友的猝然离世，小说主人公欣敏陷入了一种失去主体性的恐惧之中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在糖匪看来，最残忍的惩戒是“人的消失”。 “把一个人关在狭小空间，当她不存在。你在这个社会看似自由，但是你被透明化，没有人在乎你是怎么想的，没有人在乎你喜欢什么，偶尔跟你的对话也都是围绕着他的需求。你的劳作是微小的，因为被技术覆盖了，个人价值无法通过智力劳动实现。家庭劳动不算劳动，你的情感劳动也被剥削了，在这种情况下这个女主角就是&#39;被消失&#39;的、不存在的人。”糖匪说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“科幻是一种思想方法，它通过极端情境，还有异世界的构建等等这种陌生化的创作手段，把我们从日常的这种刻板印象、固有思维中解救出来。从而改变我们看问题的尺度和角度，重新审视我们现在的生活。”在第七届中欧国际文学节的大师课上，糖匪受邀分享她对科幻小说的认识和理解时，曾指出科幻的意义并不只是停留在制造与现实不同的奇观，关键在于跳脱平时的视角和思维，这股想象力扎根在厚重的现实，又从未来获得向上生长的力量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小说中对机器的设定和以前的小说不太一样。 “家庭主脑”面对这对貌合神离的夫妇时，唯一需求是维护家庭稳定，它悄无声息地帮助这对夫妇掩盖彼此的出轨痕迹，守护住现有的家庭运转轨道，像家长一样想让这个家良好地运行下去。小说中女性的愿望也是恢复秩序，但是不满足于机器恢复的美好秩序，而是希望获得自身的主体性。在小说的极端设置中，她通过智能公寓，杀死了丈夫，处理了犯罪工具，而最后“家庭主脑”也帮忙掩盖了这个犯罪事实。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“与其说是复仇，不如说是她在自己被抹除人的价值之后，寻找作为活人存在的方法。这不是一个男人和女人之间的对立，而是社会结构的问题。”糖匪说，小说把人对世界的无奈和愤慨转移到了个人的困境中，挣脱它、突破它，实际上是个人对抗整个世界的困境的问题。在机器的帮助下，这位女性获得了自由和真正的身份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人和机器的关系未来会有什么样的变化？在糖匪看来，现在的人们对待科技不再像21世纪初的对抗或者盲目崇拜，而在未来，人们可能会同机器站在一起，共同对抗那些所谓的“非人性”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NQwtjJ1QnbZJt7xvxWizVueWRn7FuM6aITaSoEru.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/NQwtjJ1QnbZJt7xvxWizVueWRn7FuM6aITaSoEru.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254473&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“后来的人”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;糖匪身体不好，2022年做了一场大手术，“我今年的状况比去年更糟糕，长期处于每天睡眠只有两到三小时的状况。而且在北京的时候，也没有办法出门。整个人处于摇摇欲坠的状态。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;疾病到来之前，糖匪觉得自己终于进入了一个绝佳的写作状态。几个中篇小说已经写好，与以往的小说集不同，她在新小说集里展开了一个非常完整、系统的世界，她觉得找到了很明确的写作方向，也对科幻有了非常清晰的概念，迫不及待要进入新的创作阶段，“当时完完全全就是你给我一个苹果，我都能写科幻小说。那个状态就是特别稳，又特别野，就觉得自己无所不能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“结果一下子，去医院检查，一下子发现……然后就开始长达两年被死亡摩擦。”糖匪在闹哄哄的咖啡馆里回忆当时的就医情景，关于她在疫情中去医院做手术的艰难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术始终是不断进步的，人们往往也是随着时间始终往前走、善于遗忘的。新小说集《后来的人类》的英文标题有两种翻译，第一种是“后人类”，这是科幻小说里非常重要的概念。第二种是用上海话讲，“后来的人”就是落后的人。 “先到者会成为更成功的、更有资源的人。后来的人显然会更被动，也会慢慢不知不觉滑入到一个边缘的位置。小说里是很悲观的未来。”糖匪说，“小说就是作者最好的镜子，对这个世界的理解是以非常诚实和无法伪装的方式呈现在文本上。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在糖匪看来，科幻并非只是承载科学技术狂想的文学类型，她热爱科幻是因为它如此活泼，充满可能性。在中国古代，小说是从神话传说到志怪小说一路发展来的，作者们用一种天真热烈的信念将这些虚构之物呈现在读者面前。尽管科技早已驱散人类前现代文明的黑暗，现实和幻想却以另一种形式再度混淆，尤其是新冠疫情那几年，震惊成了常态。许多匪夷所思的事情发生，人们用科幻来形容现实，无论是高度发达的科技给予的梦幻生活，还是梦魇般的现实。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当人们已经生活在科幻中时，科幻文学该如何表现以及回应现实？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《后来的人类》的写作中，糖匪觉得这个过程就是一场“贴地飞行”，几篇小说是沿着现实生活对未来城市展开想象，“这样的科幻给人巨大的惊异感，会让男性有一种血脉偾张的感觉吗？未必，但是我想有一点挑衅和刺痛，让人明白即便科技如此发达，家庭劳作仍然要付出巨大的劳动、耐心和时间。不仅是家庭劳动，在现代生活里由于科技的出现，许多劳动都因为科技的飞升被掩盖了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“人们常常说AI要替代人类了，但是当AI替代人类的时候，人类干什么呢？人类去服务和训练AI。”糖匪说，“科技是绿色的”是一个巨大的幻觉。无论是ChatGPT还是许多为人所熟知的人工智能软件，都需要大量人力去训练它，而这些简单重复枯燥的工作往往对应着世界欠发达地区的人们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小说中，她写到很多被技术时代甩下的人们的未来，只是这些科幻小说几乎快变成了现实。两年前写的《半篇半调》中，居住在海岛的居民受海洋微塑料影响，渐渐变成了塑料人，而近期新闻中关于微塑料损害人体健康的报道不断出现。 《跑球》中的出租身体有上层阶级对下层阶级的剥削，当生产力发达到一定程度，人们被剥削的不是劳动力、智力，而是一种主体性、做人的乐趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“为什么要唤起对这些人的关怀？因为这些人的今天可能就是我们的明天，现在每个人好像衣食无忧、安居乐业，很可能明天就因为什么事情，人生的轨道不断下滑到同样的位置。如果对边缘的人给以关照，为他们发声，也是为我们的明天做出一点事情。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[珍∙古道尔：与黑猩猩共度的传奇一生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/wPjs2fqHqWCrluRezzRKVpWPhAYCdCV7seBpgTu2.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;珍·古道尔的研究发现打破了长久以来“只有人类才会制造工具”的观点，为人类学和动物行为学的研究引入了全新的资料。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;已经下午五点，珍∙古道尔却连一只黑猩猩也没遇见。趁还有一丝光亮，她准备去自己选中的观察点，期待在那能看到黑猩猩搭巢。忽然，她听到黑猩猩的叫唤声，四只黑猩猩出现在望远镜中，正在吃着一种类似李子的黄果子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她决定离它们近一些。当她小心地走近那棵大树时，却发现树枝上空荡荡——黑猩猩们又一次溜走了。半年多来，这种情况已上演过无数次，她有一种近乎麻木的绝望。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，当视线下移，她发现，就在离她不到二十米的地面上，坐着两只成年黑猩猩，正在注视着她。过了几秒，它们开始旁若无人地捋对方身上的毛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这确是我一生中有幸经历过的最令人激动的时刻之一。”珍∙古道尔在《黑猩猩在召唤》一书中如此写道，她终于得以近距离观察黑猩猩了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月17日，以89岁的英国生物学家珍∙古道尔为主角的纪录片《珍∙古道尔的传奇一生》在国内上映，该片曾获得第71届英国电影学院奖最佳纪录片提名，豆瓣评分高达9.2。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从童年时期起，珍∙古道尔便对动物抱有强烈的兴趣。周岁时，家人给她买了一个玩具黑猩猩，成了她最可爱的朋友；4岁，她在鸡窝里一待五个钟头，就为了观察母鸡如何下蛋；刚满8岁，她就打定主意，长大后要去非洲，与野生动物为伍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成年后，当朋友邀请她去肯尼亚的农场做客时，她毫不犹豫地辞去自己的工作，回老家当了一段时间的服务员，积攒费用前往非洲。“我从来没期待过要结婚、组建家庭，那不在我的考虑范围内。去非洲和动物生活在一起，是我唯一想做的。”珍∙古道尔说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/HpRcTJ1jNuZIbTwW9gO4uEWrTfojng2am9fYIoA6.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;珍与野生动物摄影师雨果相恋成婚，后来，二人为了各自的事业选择了分开。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“与世隔绝的奇异感觉”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;最初到达非洲之际，有人告诉珍∙古道尔，如果她喜欢动物，就一定要去拜访时任肯尼亚国家博物馆馆长路易斯∙利基。珍∙古道尔听从了建议，并在之后成为路易斯∙利基的秘书助理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1957年，路易斯∙利基申请了一笔为期六个月的野生黑猩猩研究经费。在他看来，对类人猿行为的研究，有助于了解人类远古祖先的行为特征。他想找一个可以进行田野调查，未受科学理论影响、不抱偏见的研究者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秘书珍∙古道尔正符合这样的要求。在1960年前往贡贝研究黑猩猩之前，她从未接受过学术训练，也没有科学学位，甚至，她对野生黑猩猩一无所知。但是，她热爱动物、有耐心，对知识怀有极大的热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《黑猩猩在召唤》一书中，珍∙古道尔回忆，第一眼看到贡贝那片一望无际的森林时，陪同她前往的母亲心生畏惧，而她自己所想的只是“与世隔绝的奇异感觉”。然而，对一位年轻女性来说，接近黑猩猩并试图被这个群体接纳，实在是难以想象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她只能期待黑猩猩能习惯她，进而忽视她的存在。她在贡贝的生活节奏很固定。不论天气如何，她总会一大早就到山里观察黑猩猩——穿过层层树丛，蹚过溪流，攀爬上陡峭的小坡，抵达一个合适的观察点，举起手中的望远镜。有时她能看到一群黑猩猩在无花果树上荡来荡去，有时则完全看不到。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而每次当她试着靠近一点点，黑猩猩总会跑走。“那应该是我最沮丧的时候。”珍∙古道尔说。更令人恐惧的是，有时候，面对陌生人，黑猩猩会变得有攻击性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接受《纽约时报》采访时，珍∙古道尔回忆，黑猩猩们有时会尖叫着爬到树上，头发竖起，使劲摇着树枝，并用枝桠打她的头。每当这个时候，她只能假装镇定，不看它们，在地上挖些小洞、吃些树叶。而等黑猩猩离开后，她的腿才开始后知后觉地发抖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好在经过几个月的观察，黑猩猩逐渐习惯了她的存在，接纳了她。而越靠近黑猩猩，珍∙古道尔越发现，它们和人类如此相似，它们也有恐惧、嫉妒等情绪，甚至，它们还会制造工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天早晨，珍∙古道尔跑遍了三座谷地，却连黑猩猩的影子都没见到。正当她艰难地穿过陡坡登上峰顶时，六十米开外的草丛传来动静，珍∙古道尔举起手中的望远镜，看到一只黑猩猩正蹲在红黏土的白蚁巢旁，将一根细长的草棍伸进白蚁洞中，再提起来舔食。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几天之后，她又观察到一群黑猩猩去往一座白蚁穴，在一旁捡起带树叶的树枝，而后拔光上面的叶子，将它修整为自己趁手的工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长久以来，人们一直认为，只有人类才会制造工具。珍∙古道尔的这一发现，几乎是颠覆性的存在。当她发电报告诉路易斯∙利基时，他激动不已，回应说：人类必须重新被定义，或是承认黑猩猩也是人类。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/ccl0MFXqinTiK7UTwh1Uvrs9nSjYGFtwQNQCyMRy.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;近年来，珍·古道尔仍致力于动物和环境保护，在世界各地进行巡回演讲，呼吁人们意识到黑猩猩濒危的生存状况，保护猿类栖息地。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“我不能离开，这是我的生命”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;珍∙古道尔小时候曾希望成为男人，“或许是因为那时我想做的事，男人可以做，但女人不行”。在那个年代，即便她取得了对黑猩猩的重大发现，但随着赞誉而来的还有质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有人觉得她是未受过训练的年轻女性，所以她的研究结果不值一提。有人认为她出名是由于外表——身材修长、有着一头漂亮的金发。当年的许多报纸在刊载时都会强调她的女性身份，有些还会以美貌作为噱头，比如某家报纸的标题为《美女和她的野兽们》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“人们认为我出名是因为我的腿，这太蠢了，我没放在心上，不过名气很有用，因为这时我得自己募款。”珍∙古道尔说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她或许可以尽力忽略外界对她的性别和外表的议论，但对她来说，更难的是取得家庭和事业的平衡。在珍∙古道尔有了对黑猩猩的重大发现后，路易斯∙利基又获得了美国国家地理学会的一笔补助，让她得以继续研究黑猩猩。同时，美国国家地理学会还派来了一位摄影师雨果∙范∙拉维克，记录黑猩猩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;故事的走向不难猜想，珍∙古道尔和摄影师雨果相爱、结婚，一起在贡贝研究黑猩猩。然而后来，美国国家地理学会停止了对雨果的资助，他身为摄影师的任务结束了。对他们来说，这是一段艰难的抉择时期，珍∙古道尔想在贡贝继续研究黑猩猩，而雨果不能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最初是珍∙古道尔做出了牺牲。她大半时间都陪雨果留在非洲的塞伦盖蒂，雨果拍摄野生动物，她则写书并照顾儿子葛拉。在那时，她更多担任了雨果的助手、葛拉的母亲。对于在贡贝的工作，她不再追踪黑猩猩，主要负责管理研究站。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而变故再次来临，贡贝的黑猩猩突然爆发了脊髓灰质炎传染病。珍∙古道尔再次回到贡贝，她决定花更多的时间跟贡贝的黑猩猩待在一起。那时候儿子也跟在她身边，早上她会分析资料和管理行政，花一两个小时在黑猩猩营地观察它们，下午则陪着儿子葛拉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但人终究是群体动物，珍∙古道尔明白社会性的重要性。到了葛拉上学的年纪，珍∙古道尔不得不送他回英国读书。和葛拉分开时，她很难过，有种背叛他的感觉。而跟丈夫雨果，由于长期分隔两地，关系似乎也走向了尽头。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雨果对珍∙古道尔说，他们必须决定未来怎么过，他需要有人陪他留在塞伦盖蒂的大草原，问她是否愿意为他离开贡贝。珍∙古道尔写信向自己的母亲求助。“没有不能失去的人……对男人来说没有心碎这种事，他们的工作永远是第一，还有他们的梦想，女人只是用来衬托的。”母亲的回信这样写道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;珍∙古道尔做出了选择，“我不能离开，这是我的生命，而他也有他的理想。”他们最终离婚了。&lt;/p>;

Looking more closely, there are many characters with different shapes, and there are twists and turns behind each person. A long story; magnify it 10 times and it will give you a different scenery. It is rumored that there are unknown secrets hidden in the pictures, and there are lice crawling in the Chinese clothes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This coincides with &quot;Under the City&quot;.

The seemingly irrelevant case of the Xianbi Monkey Monster has brought back an old case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The length of each episode is different.

Put an ear leisurely in the middle. The past and present, old events and new cases are flexibly connected together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern suspense dramas often follow a socialist approach, while ancient suspense dramas represented by this drama are rooted in sophisticated and solid classicism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Under the City&quot; emphasizes the supremacy of logic, with puzzle solving and trickery as its core: the horrific serial murders are the appetizer, and the highlight is the case within the case, the mystery within the mystery, and the love within the love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years ago, undercurrents surged in the Lu Mansion, which was whitewashing peace.

What we are looking forward to is how the detective puts the pieces together into a picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The fate of characters and the social ecological chain&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first thing I felt when watching &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; was: prosperity and crowds. But if you zoom in and study half of the scroll, you will see the shadow of the prosperous age hidden in the details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first watched &quot;Under the Busty City&quot;, I felt that the market was prosperous and full of people. Officials, squires, traffickers and pawns, women with fireworks, all appeared on stage like a revolving lantern, roughly sketching out the portraits of the people in Jingxian County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when you zoom in under the microscope, you will find that everyone from state and county officials to ordinary people are included in a tightly interlocked social and ecological chain, and there are clever and hidden games everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dian Shi Song Chen, Leng Captou and others have specific powers, but in the final analysis they are still low-level officials trapped in an increasingly rigid system and acting according to a set of hidden rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dian Shi was a miscellaneous official of the county magistrate. He had no specific rank but was ordered by the emperor to sign and approve. He was in charge of arrests, prisons and other matters, so Song Chen had a certain deterrent effect on arrests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fast class led by the catcher is responsible for arresting murders and investigating cases, and the soap class is responsible for the promotion of the court. There are many people like Gao Shicong in the play who spend money to work as temporary workers. So once something happens, Gao Shicong and others will be the first to be dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5434e1d86ea7305ac52af7967a2ad966.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;1428&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5434e1d86ea7305ac52af7967a2ad966.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255233&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Airborne Xia The head catcher is the type of person that the yamen is most afraid of because it is difficult to find out his background in a short period of time. Therefore, the petty official who usually showed off his power had to be beaten, and he had to bear the pain to watch him establish his power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/1eafb08470d481b123abd98e742c34fc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;775&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/1eafb08470d481b123abd98e742c34fc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255235&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The imperial power does not decline The proverb &quot;county&quot; accurately describes the power vacuum zone below the county level in the feudal era. The lower-level officials have the power of flexible autonomy. Therefore, grassroots governance also relies on the black and white management system. It treats the common people one way, but treats the gangsters and bullies in another way. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leng Captou controlled the lifeblood of Fangxing during his lifetime and reached a solid cooperative relationship with him. As long as it did not involve the abduction and trafficking of women and children, he would turn a blind eye. The bank &quot;pays&quot; him a fixed amount of money every month, and also does some dirty work when needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The salaries of officials in the Ming Dynasty were very low, and quick-thinking people found solutions elsewhere. Part of the kickbacks taken by Leng Captou will be subsidized to the subordinates on the fast shift. But there are also honest officials like Song Chen, whose monthly salary is only enough to meet his sweetheart once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/231e1c0322880ddcc2b8e159ef935769.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;565&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/231e1c0322880ddcc2b8e159ef935769.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255238&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cold catcher After his death, it was replaced by Zaoban Yi to arrest the head and do business with the bank.

In the beginning, he was a straightforward and cheerful person. He didn&#39;t have to understand the survival rules of the lower-level officials. He was protected by the cold catcher who was like his master and his father. After his master died, he was forced to grow up and started to do things that he didn&#39;t want to do before, such as Use mediation among the three religions and nine streams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, he is the same type of person as Song Chen. It is inevitable to wear black gloves after staying in the mud for a long time, but there is a fire of justice in his heart that illuminates the way forward. It is not difficult to speculate that Song Chen will be his new guide and will perform the duties of his master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fbe94e7cb0ef6cfa0d2ece822efa9598.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;497&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/fbe94e7cb0ef6cfa0d2ece822efa9598.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255240&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s it.

He beat the passers-by and pretended to be evil, and the fake scholar they found pretended to be innocent. They were trying to annex the game within a game. The old man’s property.

In addition, subordinate officials such as Qu Sangen had no right to take scientific examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f705ffc52289396448673bf882f0bb19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;883&quot; height= &quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f705ffc52289396448673bf882f0bb19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why Mr. Lu Can you get your household registration done with just a little money?

Insurance, he believes: &quot;In addition to the normal natural decrease, an important reason is that residents actively surrender their insurance. This is mainly because premiums continue to rise. From 2003 to 2023, individual premiums increased 37 times in 20 years. The second The reason is that many uninsured residents are in good health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This explanation is wrong. The National Medical Insurance Administration&#39;s &quot;2022 Medical Security Development Statistical Report&quot; makes it very clear: as of the end of 2022, the number of people insured by basic medical insurance was 1,345.7 million. With the launch of the national unified medical insurance information platform, all provinces have stepped up data management and comparison. The number of insured people has decreased by 17.27 million year-on-year, mainly due to the elimination of duplicate insurance... Among them, the number of people participating in employee basic medical insurance is 362.42 million, a year-on-year increase of 8.11 million. people; the number of people participating in the basic medical insurance for urban and rural residents was 983.28 million, a year-on-year decrease of 25.38 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Urban and Rural Residents Basic Medical Insurance (referred to as &quot;Resident Medical Insurance&quot;) is the merger of the former Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance and the New Rural Cooperative Medical System to provide integrated and equal medical protection for urban and rural residents. Its operation model is significantly different from that of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (referred to as &quot;Employee Medical Insurance&quot;). The biggest difference is that the former is voluntary insurance, while the latter is compulsory insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, because the resident medical insurance is voluntary, you can of course voluntarily withdraw from the insurance or not participate in the insurance, but it is unwise to do so. Because individuals pay a few hundred yuan per year in premiums for residential medical insurance, which is a small part, and government subsidies are the big part. Regardless of men, women, old or young, the advantageous strategy for individuals is to buy it every year and continue to insure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Shanghai as an example. The individual payment standards for Shanghai residents’ medical insurance are higher than those in other provinces. In 2022, the individual payment for children&#39;s students is 220 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 1,660 yuan, the latter is 7.5 times the former; the individual payment for 15-59 year olds is 860 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 2,750 yuan, the latter is 3.2 times the former; individuals aged 60-69 years old The payment is 690 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 5,940 yuan, the latter is 8.6 times the former; individuals over 70 years old pay 520 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 6,110 yuan, the latter is 11.8 times the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an individual, if it is not mandatory to participate in employee medical insurance, would you voluntarily participate in resident medical insurance? Will you choose to cancel the policy after joining? The answer is self-evident. In the final analysis, resident medical insurance is a fundraising model in which individuals contribute a small amount and government financial subsidies contribute a large amount. Of course, going one step further, government revenue or taxes come from taxes paid by workers and businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparatively speaking, employee medical insurance is compulsory. It is based on an individual&#39;s pre-tax salary. The rate is generally 2% for individuals and 8% for enterprises. In some cities with heavy pension burdens, the enterprise rate is It will be higher. Of course, whether contributions are made in the name of an individual or a company, they are essentially part of the individual’s total salary or the company’s total labor costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The minimum and maximum individual payment bases for employee medical insurance are 60% and 300% of the average salary in the local society. That is to say, for two people, one pays the highest premium and the other pays the lowest premium. The payment of the former It is 5 times that of the latter. However, except for the different personal account balances, the reimbursement ratio for outpatient and hospitalization is the same between the two people, which has nothing to do with the amount of personal payment. This reflects the intra-generational transfer payment attribute of employee medical insurance: a transfer payment from high-income earners to low-income earners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has led to some effects: For some cost-sensitive &quot;marginal enterprises&quot; in free competition industries, the strategy for employees to participate in employee medical insurance is to only allow &quot;regular employees&quot; to participate, or to reduce employee pre-tax coverage. Salary, because in the eyes of enterprises, the mandatory payment of employee medical insurance has obvious tax implications, so it is natural to avoid it if possible; some people are flexibly employed or freelance, and their wise approach is not to participate in employee medical insurance because &quot;it is too expensive&quot; &quot;, and choose to participate in residents&#39; medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Let’s compare the medical benefits enjoyed by residents’ medical insurance and employees’ medical insurance. Due to the length of the article, we will skip outpatient treatment here and only compare hospitalization reimbursement ratios. It is not difficult to find that, given the huge difference in personal payment costs between the two, the hospitalization reimbursement ratio for residents’ medical insurance participants is not much lower than that of employee medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also take Shanghai as an example. The current reimbursement ratio for hospitalization or emergency observation rooms under residents&#39; medical insurance is 80% (level 1)-70% (level 2)-60% (level 3) for infants and students above the self-pay range of 50-300 yuan, 19 Those who are 59 years old are 80% (first level)-75% (second level)-60% (third level), and those who are 60 to 69 years old are 90% (first level)-80% (second level)-70% (third level) , 70% (level one)-60% (level two)-50% (level three) for those over 70 years old, and the hospital level is in brackets. The lower the hospital level, the higher the reimbursement ratio. This encourages insured persons to go to primary hospitals as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, the current employee medical insurance reimbursement ratio for hospitalization or emergency observation rooms is 85% for active employees above the minimum payment standard and below the maximum payment limit, and 80% for above the maximum limit; the reimbursement ratio for retired employees is, Above the minimum payment standard and below the maximum payment limit is 92%, and above the maximum payment limit is 80%. The reimbursement ratio is higher than that of residents’ medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see the intergenerational transfer payment attribute of employee medical insurance: the transfer payment between workers, young people and the next generation to retirees, the elderly and the previous generation, or it can be intuitively understood as &quot;all Children support all parents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, whether it is resident medical insurance or employee medical insurance, although it is called insurance, its operating logic is different from that of general commercial insurance. Commercial insurance will actuarially determine and collect premiums based on the age and health of the insured. People with certain diseases will be denied coverage. Individuals cannot conceal certain diseases before enrolling in insurance, otherwise they may be denied compensation. If you charge a fixed premium every year, it actually means you will charge more when you are young, because the probability of getting sick is low when you are young. The premium collected minus the consumption of the year is the so-called &quot;cash value&quot;. The government medical insurance will not deny coverage because the insured is too old or in poor health, nor will the premium be calculated based on the individual&#39;s age and health status. So, this is a kind of security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, if your parents are unemployed in the city or live in the countryside, it is a wise choice to urge or buy resident medical insurance for them. On this basis, it is also a good choice to purchase critical illness medical mutual aid supplementary insurance for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[莫砺锋：“花瓣飘落的方向，是风决定的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259413]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral Profile&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mo Lizhen, the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in April 1949 in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1963-1966, attended high school in Suzhou Senior High School, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 1968 to 1977, he worked in farming in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province and Si County, Anhui Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978-1979, undergraduate student majoring in English in the Department of Foreign Languages, Anhui University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1979-1981, Master&#39;s degree student in ancient Chinese literature in the Department of Chinese, Nanjing University, studying under Cheng Qianfan Mr., received a Master of Arts degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1982, he became a doctoral candidate in ancient literature in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In October 1984, graduated from Nanjing University majoring in ancient Chinese literature.

In 1966, when he graduated from high school, he applied for the engineering major at Tsinghua University. In July of that year, the college entrance examination enrollment was suspended, and the dream of becoming an engineer was shattered in an instant. For the next ten years, he went to the countryside to join the army and spent his bitter youth in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, his life turned around - he entered the English major of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, with the launch of reform and opening up and the resumption of postgraduate education, Mo Lizhen seized the opportunity again.

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;初衷很简单，每个月的助学金能从18元涨到35元。我在安大每月能领到18元助学金，手头十分拮据。我从安大宿舍出发到省教育厅去查阅各著名大学的招生目录的那个早晨，都还没有想过要报考中文系。我本想考南大的外文系，但外文系要考第二外语——法语、德语或西班牙语。而我没学过，只能临时改成中文系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你报考研究生时才大二，这在当时应该不常见？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;大二考研究生本是不被允许的，但当时比较特殊。我们77级本科生普遍的情况是学生年龄偏大，我班最大的与最小的相差13岁。那时安大外语系的英语专业分7个班，我在7班。 6班是快班，很多同学来自北京、上海，英语基础不错，他们认为自身已具备本科毕业的水平。于是，他们向学校提出提前考研的要求，学校一开始不同意，但他们不停地去磨，最终校方松口说，考虑到你们年纪比较大，再读四年本科，毕业时已三十好几，才决定开这个口子。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们班同学撺掇我跟着6班的同学一起去考研。结果我碰巧考上，于是到南大来读中国古代文学。最有意思的是，我报考时，对南大的古代文学学科一无所知，看到招生简章上的导师是程千帆先生，我压根不知道他是谁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从理工科到英语，再到古代文学，在做这些重要选择时，是否有些一以贯之的原则或者理念，你如何看待其中的偶然性和必然性？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这些都不是我决定的，而是命运决定的，我是顺遂命运者。我最近几年常说，我们就像树上的花瓣，被风一吹就飘下来，事先根本不知道飘到哪里，飘的方向不是花瓣决定的，而是风决定的。我就这样飘到南大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;偶然性中肯定包含着必然性，但从大环境来说还是偶然性。 1966年如果不爆发“文革”，我要么考不上清华，要考上的话就会去学工科。我当时最大的理想是当工程师，我父亲对我的期望也是如此。可惜在他去世多年以后，我才进入大学。父亲没有看到我成为大学生、研究生以及大学教授，是我一生中最大的遗憾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老三届那一代人的命运差不多都是这样，很多事没有办法选择。当年有的同学侥幸被招工，但到城里后进哪个工厂，做什么工种，都只能听从安排。能招上工已经很幸运，我们都羡慕的不得了，毕竟能拿工资，而农民只能挣工分，一天工分的价值只有两三毛钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，这其中也有主观能动性。我一直没放弃读书，很多同学都放弃了。我在苏州中学有一些同班同学成绩很好，但恢复高考后他们早已结婚成家，有两三个娃，也就不想考了，他们后来很快就下岗，一辈子和大学无缘。这样的人很多，碰到那场“狂风”，一下被吹到泥淖里，再也没有翻身的机会。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1979年你入学时学位条例还没有正式颁布，直到1981年国务院批准《学位条例暂行实施办法》，学位制度才正式建立。那时读博算不算冒险？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;在1979年9月的开学典礼上，匡亚明校长说学位条例正在制定。他是国务院学位委员会的委员，参与这项工作。我们入学时不分硕士、博士，统称研究生。匡亚明校长说，你们以后会是第一批硕士和博士。两年后我们毕业，学位条例颁布了，我拿到硕士学位，后来又跟着程先生继续读博。我觉得读博是件好事，也完全没有“冒险”的感觉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在真正开始读博前，你对于博士生活的预期是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;也没有具体的预期，谁知道博士生涯是怎样的。我只是觉得读硕都那么辛苦、紧张，读博肯定只会更加紧张，所以心里做好了坐几年冷板凳的准备。反正我年轻时吃过不少苦，“曾经沧海难为水”，读博肯定不会比种地更辛苦。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那时我们还没有自主培养的博士，作为第一批文学博士的你们是怎么读博的，如何上课和撰写博士论文？据说你刚开始读博时，程先生也不知道博士论文要写到什么程度。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;确是如此，因为博士在中国属于新生事物。当时没有完整的课程体系，培养模式也是暗中摸索的。程先生也不知道博士论文要写到什么程度，他从学校图书馆里借来一堆国外已出版的博士论文，还有不少港台高校的博士论文，读了好几本，才心中有数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;程先生的培养方式来自哪里，是如何形成的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得是他自己揣摩的，当然也可能是从国外或港台的博士论文的学术水准上推导出来的。由于当时全系只有我一个博士生，所以程先生没有为我在课堂开课，除了外语，我的课程学习完全采取专书阅读的方式，也就是自己读书，遇到难点去先生家请教。程先生规定我攻读8部典籍：《诗经》《楚辞》《论语、孟子》《老子、庄子》《左传》《史记》《文选》《文心雕龙》。每部书都要交读书报告，其中有4篇报告后来作为学术论文公开发表。那种培养模式有点像旧时的手艺人带学徒，师傅手把手地教，学徒边干活边学习。对于中国古代文学这样的学科，那种方式是相当有效的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978年恢复研究生教育时，当年录取了1万人。如今，在读博士约为56万人。许多博士生不免担忧就业前景，对未来迷茫，文科博士更甚。你博士毕业时也会迷茫吗，以及如何看待他们当下的担忧和迷茫？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我1984年博士毕业时，分配工作，可以挑很多单位，最后我选择留在南大。那时国家培养的硕博人数少，客观上没有就业压力，这点跟现在很多文科博士的处境不一样。我很理解现在的同学们，现在博士生人数多，而岗位少。经过多年大规模研究生扩招，大部分单位都不缺人，所以就业越来越难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is entirely a problem of the times, not a personal problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的学生找工作也难。 If I can&#39;t find a job, the pressure will extend to me. Of course, the three doctoral students who graduated this year have all found jobs, going to Sichuan University, South Central University for Nationalities and Zhejiang Normal University respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255703&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2008年，莫砺锋在北京签售百家讲坛图书。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;致力于研究“大家”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你曾提及古代文学研究主要是做翻案工作，因为所有的观点都被人说过了，新观点就是做翻案文章。 Most of your research subjects are masters such as Du Fu, Su Dongpo, and Huang Tingjian. What is your original intention in choosing to study these &quot;masters&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, all academic research is about reversing the case, and the same is true for science and engineering. When I was studying for a PhD at NTU, the school recruited 10 doctoral students in the first batch, each from a different department.我们宿舍住3个人，一个化学系，一个计算机系，我跟他们交流，发现他们做研究，找题目写论文，跟我们一模一样，都是在前人成果的夹缝里面求生活，在很细小的方向上追求一些创新，补充或推翻前人的研究结果。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the subject of ancient literature, what can truly represent the academic achievements of an era should be &quot;everyone&#39;s&quot; research. Whether there is an overall breakthrough in the research of an era depends on how well &quot;everyone&quot; studies. &quot;Xiaojia&quot; research only fills the gap and cannot become a symbol of the academic level of an era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你最喜欢的两位诗人是杜甫和苏轼，甚至曾说愿意穿越到宋朝去黄州帮苏轼种地，你认为在研究杜甫和苏轼的过程中，他们带给你最大的体悟是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may be related to Mr. Cheng’s proposition that “literary research should focus on feelings and words”. I started reading Du Fu and Su Shi before I entered college. The only motivation at that time was that I liked them. I felt warm and comforted when I read them.我多次说过，当我在那座被狂风刮破屋顶的茅屋里过夜，眼看着满天繁星而冻得瑟瑟发抖的时候，杜甫的《茅屋为秋风所破歌》给我带来心灵的震撼。我种过十年地，我觉得自己当个农民并不算屈才。但我真心不愿意让苏东坡也在黄州开荒种地，他那样德才兼备的杰出人物有更重要的事情要做！ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜、苏二人给我带来的最大体悟就是“安得广厦千万间”的人间情怀，和“一蓑烟雨任平生”的人生态度，我愿意尽我可能来宣扬他们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在“大家”研究中是如何做到创新的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;真正的创新很难，我哪能做到。因为创新要求你比别人看得更深或更远，我没有那么高的水平。此外创新也需要偶然的机会，正好出现很好的新题目，或者很珍贵的新材料，这都是可遇不可求的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我只能尽量不人云亦云，不炒冷饭。我现在普及工作做得较多，讲一些常识性的内容，但如何将常识性内容讲得准确，要求也很高，这和学术的严谨性应该是统一的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;注意到从走进《百家讲坛》之后，你就一直致力于古典诗词的普及工作，开始做普及工作有什么契机？你曾说最大的心愿是做在唐诗宋词“仙山秘境”入口处的导游，这个愿望现在实现了吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我上《百家讲坛》也是偶然。南大百年校庆时，邀请央视的编导来录节目，录完后在《百家讲坛》播出，效果还不错，后来他们就来找我讲唐诗。节目播出后，很多观众来信，反响热烈，我感觉普及工作蛮有意义。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我现在最想达到的目的，是让普通读者和我一样喜欢唐诗宋词，喜欢杜甫和苏东坡。所谓普及，就是走出学校的小教室，走向社会的大教堂。让我欣慰的是，我开讲座时的听众里各个年龄层次各种身份的人都有，我真的走到社会大众中间，也算实现了自己的愿望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那你认为古代文学的学术研究和普及工作在当下是否面临一些困境？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;现在的研究有概念化、碎片化的趋势，普及工作则有庸俗化的趋势。前者比如一定要强行发掘某些古典诗词中的现代性，实际上可能没有。如果生搬硬套一些新名词来贴标签，结论就不符合历史真相。还有一些学者选题过于细碎，意义不大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;普及工作则有庸俗化的趋势。为了吸引观众，切合年轻人的口味，有不少戏说、曲解，而且把古人完整的意境弄得碎片化，缺乏整体感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有什么解决方法吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这个问题难以避免，走向大众，必然会带来不同的口味和要求。我只能要求自己尽量做好。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对当下的年轻人，特别是大学生和研究生群体有什么人生建议吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;莫砺锋：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我今年6月应邀到安徽大学参加毕业典礼并致辞。我40年前离开安大时没有获得毕业证书，如今以“杰出校友”的身份参加典礼，心中感慨万分。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在典礼上引用东坡的《定风波》来勉励学弟学妹们学习东坡的人生精神，来迎接自己的风雨人生。因为我们普通人的人生必然是充满风雨的，我们不能幻想走上一帆风顺的人生道路，所以一定要做好充分的思想准备。请让我引用在安大的致辞中的几句话来送给其他高校的大学生和研究生群体：“我衷心祝愿同学们像东坡那样始终以&#39;自强不息&#39;的积极态度来对待人生，有所作为。我也衷心希望同学们遇到人生坎坷时以&#39;一蓑烟雨任平生&#39;的格言自我勉励，从容应对！”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在如今鱼龙混杂的演艺圈，的确鲜有人像李健这样讨喜的歌手。我们很少听到乐评人对他的批评之声，也没见微博的各类营销号抖他的什么黑料，他就是红了，红得那么理所当然，红得那么众望所归。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;出世：&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;知识分子的气质&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;李健具有这样的底气。清华大学电子工程专业毕业，与许多歌手“寒碜”的学历或文化素养相比，李健是一览众山小，“清华高材生”本就是一个令人羡慕之极的身份，又不同于我们对理工男邋遢、不修边幅、长相平凡的印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更关键的是，李健身上那种知识分子的气质。李健的家中整整齐齐堆满了唱片和书，他听的唱片是Leonard Cohen、The Beatles、Freshly ground、Michael Buble、Fabio Zanon，看的书是博尔赫斯、茨威格、劳伦斯·布洛克、乔治·奥威尔，最后他拿出来的是Leonard Cohen的传记《我是你的男人》。他有着知识分子的那种清醒、自持，他与物欲横流的世界自觉保持着一定的距离，并在精神世界上追求精进。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而从他的选歌，也可以看出他的这种独立气质，有人说他是“音乐诗人”，其实他凸显更多的是“音乐傲骨”。比如线上演唱会，10首私藏翻唱，14首原创作品，诠释他心中对于海和诗的感悟。李健总是在浅吟低唱，他不秀技巧，不飙高音，旋律轻柔绮丽，唱腔空灵婉转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是李健出世的一面——他并不孜孜追求外在的功名和财富，有的是作为一个独立个体的追求、傲气和坚持。纸醉金迷的娱乐圈，他没有迷失自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255636&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;入世：希望刚毕业的&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一帆风顺&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;如果这是李健的全部模样，或许他也很难这么讨喜。毕竟音乐圈里高冷的创作歌手不少——比如梁博，一首《灵魂歌手》惊为天人，他的人气和受众基础却远不如李健，其他小众歌手更不必提了。李健的独特之处在于，他又有着入世的一面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健尽管不耽于物质，他却能够把自己的生活过得很好。他健身，旅行，懂咖啡，家里有专门的茶室，收集唱片……每一次出现在镜头前，他的穿着打扮总是给人熨帖舒适之感。李健的生活，有着一种高冷的格调，他不是满大街随处可见的大众品牌，他是Fendi、LV和Hermes。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些访谈中你可以看出，李健对社会发展中出现的一些问题有所关切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如因“希望大家少经受挫折磨难”的话题登上了微博热搜，他不久前在音乐会上对年轻人说：“我希望所有的人能够生活得简单轻松，不需要付出很大的努力就可以过上很好的生活，尤其是那些刚刚毕业的朋友，少经受挫折和磨难，不经受挫折和磨难更好，希望你们一帆风顺。”对于困境，他不愤世嫉俗，不声嘶力竭，而是祝福与前行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就如同他的选歌，他始终在吟唱着爱情、故乡、童年、月光、星辰、年华等美好的事物，他不直接批判庸俗，但他吟咏美好的事物曲折地达到这个目的。你也许会说李健很“保守”，但他却非常安全。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何况，李健还是一个接地气的“耿直boy+高萌的段子手+可爱的吃货”，轻描淡写就能够把许多严肃的、刻板的话语方式消解掉，让人会心一笑，并察觉到他的可爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，在李健身上，出世和入世是如此完美地组合在一起。很多人只能做到一点，或者连一点都做不好，或者在二者之间撕扯纠缠，李健完美地拥有了二者，他是很多人的人格理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无怪乎不少评论说，李健是中产的灵魂抚慰者。李健的歌迷虽然囊括了各个群体，但诚如媒体人朱伟所说，喜欢李健的人主要是“文青”“小资”“受过良好教育且感情细腻的群体”。这些人都是属于中产阶层或者预备中产阶层。如果说中国中产阶层有什么显著的特点，在出世入世之间“撕扯”便是其一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中产们既有入世的一面，他们追求物质，追求格调，安分守己，保守中庸，渴望岁月静好、现世安稳的生活；可遗憾的是，为了这岁月静好，他们又得奔走在大都市的钢筋水泥森林，疲于应付职场中的快节奏与复杂人际，承受巨大的生活压力与精神压力，稳定安逸的生活似乎触不可及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是他们又有出世的一面，他们很想逃离这一切，不去理会什么房子、车子、孩子、职场，想辟出一块属于自己的精神家园，屏蔽外界的一切纷纷扰扰；但真的要放下这一切，他们又会有所眷恋，有所不甘。中产的撕扯是因为他们无论是出世或入世，均不可得。于是他们时常在二者之间彷徨犹豫，左手是马云，右手是星云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健完美出世又完美入世，他活成了许多中产想活成的模样，他就这样成了中产的抚慰者。这样说绝不是贬低李健，李健无意于扮演这样的角色，他只是刚好踩到了时代的节点上——这个时代的中产阶层真是太累了。 &lt;/p>;
