Warren Buffett has lost his best friend forever, and the world has lost another humorous and unruly wise man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger, 99, is a partner of Warren Buffett. He has served as Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway since 1978. Over the past 40 to 50 years, the two have worked together to build Berkshire from a shaky textile manufacturing company into one of the most successful multinational conglomerates in history. The group&#39;s subsidiaries have covered many fields such as insurance, rail transportation, energy, manufacturing, retail and services, and hold shares worth more than US$318 billion, about half of which are Apple shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two weeks ago, Munger was interviewed by CNBC reporter Becky Quick. Compared with the shareholders&#39; meeting half a year ago, his thinking is still sharp and he likes to use long sentences when stating his views, but his voice has become increasingly hoarse and difficult to understand. The limitations of the body cannot be overcome by the intellect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quick asked him what he wanted to do in particular, and got a negative answer. His hands can no longer feel the tension of the fishing line when different fish bite the hook like they did when he was young. He no longer insists on crossing &quot;catching a 200-pound tuna&quot; off his bucket list. &quot;It requires too much physical strength. Even if I have the chance now, I won&#39;t go there, I won&#39;t even chase them. Time will always make you give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with when he was 96 years old, he We are increasingly aware of aging and weakness in our bodies. When asked about it by Quick, he said he no longer had a plan. He &quot;happily accepts&quot; all kinds of changes. During the interview, he was sitting in a sunny courtyard, with a row of anthuriums, also known as flower candles, placed on the lawn beside him. This kind of flower has bright color and long-lasting flowering period. From blooming to withering, it will show beige, milky white, green and yellow, each with its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260223&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From &quot;The Way of Munger&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by CITIC Publishing Group)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Buffett often jokes that in front of Munger, he is still a young man. Just a week before Munger&#39;s death, 93-year-old Buffett had just announced a donation of approximately $866 million worth of Berkshire stock to four family charities. This is the latest step in his commitment to donate more than 99% of his net wealth to charity. Since 2006, every year on the eve of Thanksgiving, the &quot;Stock God&quot; has donated to the above four family charities. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said that he is 93 years old and feels very good about himself, but he is also fully aware that he has entered &quot;overtime.&quot; A week later, in the &quot;overtime&quot; game, his most tacit teammate bid farewell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has always believed that the important reason why he and Buffett have had outstanding careers is to stay on the scene long enough, but the prerequisite for the magic of &quot;compound interest&quot; to be cast is still &quot;more than most&quot; People are less crazy and stupid”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger was born on January 1, 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska. He has loved reading since he was a child, is especially fascinated by biographies, and has a strong logical thinking ability. After graduating from Harvard Law School as a magna cum laude graduate, Munger followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father and started his career as a lawyer in Los Angeles. Subsequently, in order to earn more income than a senior lawyer, Munger began to rely on existing client resources to carry out investments outside of his legal business and created his own investment partnership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;959&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260228&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 9, 1988, Munger was in California, USA&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1959, Munger&#39;s father passed away. When he returned to his hometown to take care of his funeral, he met 29-year-old Warren Buffett at a dinner arranged by a friend. The two, who were 6 years apart, hit it off immediately. At Buffett&#39;s suggestion, Munger began to focus on business in 1965. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two were each other&#39;s confidants and contributed to an important turning point in each other&#39;s lives. Buffett once said that it was Munger&#39;s ideological power that expanded his horizons and allowed him to &quot;evolve from apes to humans at an extraordinary speed.&quot; Otherwise, he would be much poorer than he is now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of his career, Buffett was a loyal follower of Benjamin Graham, known as the &quot;Father of Value Investing.&quot; Graham advocated finding company stocks that were selling for less than working capital, buying them cheap, and then selling them when the stock price rose, leaving a sufficient margin of safety. These &quot;cheap and unloved stocks&quot; he compared to &quot;cigarette butts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1592&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260227&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Munger&#39;s Way&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key force driving the evolution of Buffett&#39;s investment philosophy is Munger. Munger believes that Graham&#39;s investment strategy is based on the assumption that the future will be &quot;more dangerous than full of opportunities.&quot; But in fact, investing in great companies with fair stock prices is far better than investing in ordinary companies with ultra-low stock prices. Influenced by Munger&#39;s ideas, Buffett gradually moved away from the limitations of Graham&#39;s theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They found that some stocks are still very cheap even though the price is two or three times their book value, because the company may be on a growth path, have very good managers, or The whole management system is excellent and so on. Through detailed analysis of balance sheets, social and economic trends, etc., Buffett and Munger detected high-quality stocks from the vast stock market that they regarded as &quot;compound interest machines.&quot; Holding these stocks over the long term will result in excess profit returns, and these funds will be reinvested. Buffett compared this process to &quot;snowballing&quot;. &quot;You can only roll a snowball if you find the right snow.&quot; &quot;Choose a snowy place while moving forward to let the snowball get bigger and bigger.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since From 1965 to the end of 2022, Berkshire&#39;s annual compound return was 19.8%, and its total return in 57 years reached nearly 37,900 times, far outperforming the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Without Charlie Munger’s inspiration, wisdom and involvement, Berkshire Hathaway would not be able to develop to its current position.” After Munger’s death, Buffett wrote in a statement road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260226&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 6, 2023, Nebraska, USA, shareholders listened to Munger (right) and Buffett via video at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Deliver a speech &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acquiring wisdom is a moral responsibility&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;According to Forbes, as of November 28, 2023, Munger&#39;s net worth was approximately US$2.6 billion. However, compared to his difficult-to-replicate wealth and life, what benefits ordinary people more is Munger&#39;s thinking mode. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett calls Munger &quot;the best fast thinker in the world.&quot; As a stock picker, Buffett would test his ideas through Munger&#39;s questioning. &quot;He can think from A to Z in one go, and he can see the essence of everything even before you finish speaking.&quot; Behind this insight is Munger&#39;s long-trained thinking method, which he calls &quot;multiple Thinking Model”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has spoken many times in public about the value and importance of using &quot;multiple thinking models&quot; in the business world and real life. For example, before making an investment decision, he will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the internal operating conditions of the intended company and the larger overall &quot;ecosystem&quot; in which it operates, so he can always &quot;find convincing weaknesses within 60 seconds.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Munger&#39;s estimate, he has as many as a hundred multiple thinking models stored in his mind. These models will help him collect and process information and provide decision-making guidance on this basis. These models need to borrow and combine analytical tools, methods and formulas from various traditional disciplines, including the redundant backup system model of engineering, the compound interest model of mathematics, the breakpoint of engineering, the overturning moment of physics and chemistry, and the autocatalytic model. Modern Darwinian integrated models in biology, and cognitive misjudgment models in psychology, to name a few. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1525&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Poor Charlie&#39;s Almanac&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the so-called &quot;intuition&quot; is actually the end point of a long thinking journey, which is Munger&#39;s understanding of human behavior and business systems. and other products of long-term interdisciplinary research. He advocated &quot;quick annihilation of what shouldn&#39;t be done, followed by a skilled, interdisciplinary attack on what should be done, and then, when the right opportunity comes - and only when the right opportunity comes - decisive action.&quot; He likes to regard his life as an educational experiment. &quot;A person who has mastered his major well will test the feasibility and effectiveness of this basic academic spirit and method in a very broad academic field.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Munger&#39;s view, gaining wisdom is not just to make an individual&#39;s life better, but also a moral responsibility. He made this point in his 2007 commencement address at the USC Gould School of Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his speech, he also reminded the young graduates to &quot;avoid extremely strong ideologies&quot;, &quot;especially those expressed in a very violent way&quot; because &quot;it only &quot;Instilling some concepts in people instead of convincing people to accept some truths&quot;, &quot;This is tantamount to locking the brain in a very unfortunate mode&quot;, &quot;In this way, your mind will be broken, and sometimes it will be bad.&quot; It breaks at an alarming rate.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to help himself stay clear when he is inclined to support a strong ideology, Munger set an &quot;iron rule&quot; - &quot;Only if you can be better than your opponent I am qualified to have an opinion only when it refutes my own position.&quot; Of course, this &quot;iron rule&quot; is not limited to avoiding the whirlpool of strong ideologies. Munger believes that this way of thinking deserves continuous training. Only by constantly falsifying and questioning yourself can you reduce your ignorance. In his opinion, perhaps more suitable as an ideology is the spirit of &quot;accuracy, diligence and objectivity&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, catastrophic thought states include &quot;jealousy, resentment, hatred, and self-pity.&quot; Munger has experienced the greatest pain in the world. In 1953, shortly after divorcing his wife, his eldest son Teddy suffered from fatal leukemia. Bone marrow transplant surgery had not yet been available at that time, and Teddy soon died of the terminal illness. In the memories of friends, after visiting his son in the hospital at that time, the 29-year-old Munger would often walk on the street crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, Munger warned young people, &quot;Excessive self-pity can make people almost paranoid. Paranoia is one of the hardest things to reverse. Whenever you find yourself feeling self-pity, whether it is No matter what the reason, even if your child is about to die from cancer, you have to think that self-pity will not help.&quot; However, different life stages will always encounter very difficult problems. His advice is: Don’t have high expectations; have a sense of humor; surround yourself with the love of friends and family. &quot;The most important thing is to adapt to changes in life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a wealthy and long-lived wise man, Munger is most often asked &quot;How to become happy and wealthy?&quot; In his opinion Come on, there&#39;s more to life than just being smart about accumulating wealth. Most success in life and business comes from things that should be avoided, like premature death and bad marriages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260225&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2010, Munger (left), Buffett (middle) and Bill Gates attended an event in Beijing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has another answer - &quot;When you get up every day, strive to become a little smarter than you were before. Complete your tasks seriously and well. Slowly, you will make progress, but not necessarily quickly. But it will lay the foundation for rapid progress...slowly moving forward a little bit every day. In the end - if you live long enough - you will get better. Most people will get what they deserve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 82, Munger&#39;s friends gave him a copy of &quot;Cicero on the Good Life&quot; published by Benjamin Franklin, which included a A translation of Cicero&#39;s &quot;On Old Age&quot;. Inspired by this article, Munger wrote the article &quot;In Praise of the Elders: Munger on His Old Age.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article, Munger excerpted a summary of this wise man who was born in 106 BC: &quot;The best protective armor in old age is a life that has been carefully spent before it, and a life that has been used for... A life of useful knowledge, honorable deeds, and noble conduct; the man who leads it devotes himself from youth to his own improvement, and will reap in old age the happiest fruits that they produce; and not only because Beneficial knowledge, glorious achievements and noble deeds will accompany him throughout his life, even to the last moment of his life, and will bring supreme blessings to the soul because of the conscience that has witnessed an upright life and the memory of the good achievements in the past. Comfort.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger&#39;s life is one of the best illustrations of this. Like Benjamin Franklin, whom he loved to emulate, he always had a strong thirst for knowledge and a wide range of interests. He was always creating, giving, and then being remembered. He has spent a full 99 years carefully, just as his mantra at Berkshire&#39;s annual meeting: &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;( Reference materials: &quot;Poor Charlie&#39;s Almanac&quot; and &quot;Munger&#39;s Way&quot;.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[糖分摄入过多有危害，上海试水含糖饮料健康提示]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261576]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“3元羽绒服”上热搜：不是买不起还是感冒药更有性价比]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261501]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, discussions about down jackets have become heated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When will down jackets sell for five figures?&quot; &quot;Domestic down jackets sell for 7,000 yuan&quot;... Thousands of thousands of down jackets are frequently on the hot search list, slowly becoming a &quot;luxury product&quot; in winter &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the &quot;3 yuan down jacket&quot; attracted the attention and discussion of netizens, showing that low-priced down jackets costing 3 yuan but actually selling for only 35 yuan were given to ordinary people in the cold winter. The warmest gift, for them, is more than enough for them compared to big-name luxury goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the light snow season has arrived and major cities have entered winter, many people have dug out the down jacket that has been at the bottom of their boxes for a year. Statistics show that more than half of netizens buy down jackets when needed. , during Double 11, down jackets became a hot-selling product on major e-commerce platforms. Many domestic down jackets were on Tmall’s best-selling list and received a lot of praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the rise of domestic down jackets is inseparable from the improvement of the comprehensive production strength of the manufacturers behind them, and the Yangtze River Delta is the main force in down production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong, the number of down-related companies exceeds 10,000, and many domestic down jacket brands are gradually starting to transform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the wide variety of down jacket brands and types, many netizens said that they are in urgent need of a scientific selection guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it depends on the filling of the down jacket: goose down is more expensive than duck down due to factors such as large and full velvet, good fluffiness, strong warmth retention, and long use time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is the down that really plays a role in keeping warm, and the down content more intuitively reflects the quality of the down jacket. It is worth noting that thicker and warmer is not the case. The higher the fill power of a down jacket, the more air it insulates and the better its thermal insulation effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the data point of view, there are still a small number of netizens who choose thousand-yuan down jackets, and most netizens pursue cost-effectiveness. As a saying often seen on the Internet: It’s not that down jackets are unaffordable, but that cold medicine is more cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What price range of down jacket would you choose? Today, &quot;Know&quot; will show you how to choose a cost-effective down jacket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/586c1b2150.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/586c1b2150.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259897&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/135e6eaeff.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/135e6eaeff.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259898&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/tytIIT1Ze3ZYW31QaU8DrhSJeQ8Tm4SvtKxe7GWc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/tytIIT1Ze3ZYW31QaU8DrhSJeQ8Tm4SvtKxe7GWc.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260222&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/a2e0996720.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/28/a2e0996720.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259899&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/28/f6fba97f3a.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/28/f6fba97f3a.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259900&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/28/9a1cf85f82.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/9a1cf85f82.

But in more than ten years of study experience, he found that his ideal is still to &quot;engage in academics and do research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from the Journalism Department of Fudan University in 1968, the child soldiers were assigned to participate in labor training in Horqin, Inner Mongolia. In 1970, the &quot;Jintie News&quot; accidentally discovered their writing skills to become a journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tide of the times is carrying budding journalism students drifting in unknown directions. In 1977, news came that the country had resumed the college entrance examination. The child soldiers who were far away from the border regained their fighting spirit to study, and the following year they were admitted to the postgraduate degree in the Chinese Department of Peking University. This year, a full ten years have passed since the child soldier graduated from college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His mentor during his master&#39;s and doctoral studies was journalism educator Gan Xifen. Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Tong Bing devoted himself to the research of Marxist journalism concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Opening up a new research direction requires a lot of basic reading support. Within one year, Tong Bing read through more than 4,000 papers with the word &quot;horse&quot; in them, and also read through all 50 volumes of the complete works of Marx and Engels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The complete works of Marx and Engels were published in batches. After the first 39 volumes were read, the last 11 volumes were not published until 1985.&quot; Tong Bing said that at that time, the most complete new books could only be seen at the former Central Compilation and Translation Bureau. The child soldier who was still a &quot;poor student&quot; often brought two steamed buns and a cup of boiling water to read in the Translation and Compilation Bureau, sitting there all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating with his doctorate in 1988, Tong Bing stayed at Renmin University of China to take up a teaching position. In more than 40 years of research and teaching career, he has published more than 700 academic papers, published and edited more than 50 books, textbooks, dictionaries, etc., and successively published the &quot;History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot; and &quot;The History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot;. Academic monographs such as &quot;Classic Course of Marxist Journalism&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Theoretical Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Journalism Theory&quot;, &quot;Comparative Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Subject and Mouthpiece - An Examination of the Trajectory of News Communication in the Republic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This is how I have been through these years. It can be said that there is no time to breathe and no chance to sleep peacefully. I am constantly breaking through new tasks. Although it was tiring at the time, looking back now, I think it was worth it,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the first PhD in journalism independently trained in China, Tong Bing has experienced the process of postgraduate journalism education from scratch, and witnessed the development of Renmin University of China, The development of journalism at Fudan University, one of the two famous universities in the north and the other in the south. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do knowledge simply and plainly, but don&#39;t do simple learning&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t dare to waste a day in life&quot; are the creeds he mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Already octogenarian, Tong Bing is currently a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University, still standing on the three-foot podium teaching journalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Truth&quot; is a key word for Tong Bing&#39;s academic studies. He once used the four &quot;truths&quot; of &quot;true learning, true understanding, true belief, and true application&quot; The words summarized his lifelong academic insights. His pursuit of truth in learning also allowed him to repeatedly speak out about the shortcomings of the journalism community and the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Journalism research has entered a new era. He directly stated the shortcomings of the development of the discipline, &quot;Among various disciplines, the discipline construction of journalism has developed slowly.&quot; In his It seems that in order to solve the development problems of journalism, &quot;it is necessary to calmly spread out the problems and conduct in-depth analysis. This may be good.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;My ideal is not here.

Student cadres who want to test liberal arts are generally choosing the Department of Political and International Political Department, and the Department of News. At that time, the best university in my country was the people&#39;s university in the north, and the south was Fudan University. My parents did not want me to leave Shanghai, so I passed Fudan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern weekend &lt;/strong>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/ SPAN>; After graduating from undergraduate to graduate students, can I talk about this experience for a full ten years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; When I graduated from undergraduate, it was the later period of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. At first, it was a road maintenance and repair railway. At that time, our country&#39;s large railway bureaus had corporate newspapers, and the Jinzhou Railway had a corporate newspaper called the &quot;Jintie News&quot;. After more than half a year, they knew me and transferred me to the newspaper to be editors and reporters. The newspaper often runs correspondent classes. Because I am studying news, I often go to lectures and have more relationships with everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; I stayed there for a while, and my country resumed the college entrance examination again. At first I didn&#39;t want to let me go, because I have graduated from undergraduate. However, later, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau heard that Renmin University and Fudan University recruited master&#39;s degree (in the past without graduate students) and agreed to try to take the test. I was admitted as soon as I took the test. It was the first master&#39;s degree in our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; What impact? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; The changes in my personal destiny and reform and opening up are closely linked. Sometimes I often talk about it at the meeting or in class, and thank you Deng Xiaoping. If the college entrance examination is not restored and the college enrollment is not restored, then I may still be a reporter at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in my life. I can do a good job to give me a deputy chief editor or editor -in -chief. However, my ideals are not in this place. I still want to do academics and theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; How to guide you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; Mr. Gan Xi also recruited graduate students for the first time, and the requirements for me are strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; had previously made a pilot, but it could not be performed after a while, so there was no master&#39;s degree in journalism before 1978. The desires of these old gentlemen in their lives are to advance news research, and those who do related work earlier are the People&#39;s Congress and Fudan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Gan Ximan emphasized two points when he guided me. The first point is to read the original work. He believes that graduate students in journalism must learn more classic works; second, there must be practice. These two points have always been insisted during the period of studying at the National People&#39;s Congress, and I still persist well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>; How do you insist on these two points required? What are the specific practices? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; I took a class during the day, and read a book at about 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. At the time, we could not make newspapers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Back from the classroom and library at 9 pm, and the newspaper of the day in the dormitory, including the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; and &quot;China Youth Daily&quot;. 5 nights for a week, each person was responsible for one week, and several people took turns. Students responsible for the evaluation must make a record, write a report in a week, and this report is sent to the newspaper. The newspaper also attaches great importance to our opinions, and we will reply to us every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; arrangement is very helpful for us to learn. Three years of master&#39;s degree, this method has almost been adhered to for 3 years. We have a lot of connections with the news unit and the relationship is more closely. I did this until I graduated to stay at school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Keep new lessons, recruit new students &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt; /strong>; &lt;/span>; &lt;strong>; 1 &lt;/strong>; In 983, the Degree Committee of the State Council agreed to set up a doctorate in journalism.

Why do you continue to study for a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; , I have the opportunity to listen to many other majors in Renmin University. For example, I have heard history, scientific socialism, and international politics. When I went to the class, no teacher refused. They saw that I was not young and so easy to learn. I generally agreed to enter their classroom, and I often asked in the classroom. In this regard, they did Ready: When I take a break after class, I will ask questions, and other teachers or classmates will stop (ask questions first). In my studies, it can be said that many related majors of Renmin University have a lot of help to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, my mentor also has some other teachers in the Department of Journalism and hopes that I can pick a head to help the school establish a doctorate in journalism. Later, the State Education Commission agreed that there was a doctorate degree in journalism. At that time, China began to have (journalism) doctoral points. Two schools were criticized, one was the Department of Journalism of Fudan University, and the other was the Department of Journalism of Renmin University of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; Taught by the National People&#39;s Congress, and returned to the undergraduate alma mater Fudan University in 2001. How did you think about it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; After finishing a master&#39;s degree at Renmin University, staying in the school is to consider the needs of school work. At that time, our journalism was particularly needed for talents. Young people wanted to devote themselves to them and go to society. But the instructor told me something, which made me very moved. The Cultural Revolution was delayed for ten years, and they wanted to recover our major as soon as possible, so I hope I can stay at the school with peace of mind. Only by staying in this major and taking the teacher as a teacher can this major continue to have new talents and new development. I soon accepted the arrangements in the school, worked hard, and did a lot of pioneering work for decades. Now it is worth thinking about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; To teach from the People&#39;s Congress to Fudan, it is also a adjustment arrangement of the school. At that time, Fudan particularly needed people. Compared with the National People&#39;s Congress, Fudan&#39;s development is more international. Many outstanding students go abroad after graduation. Teachers are getting older and their bodies are not as good as year. Our teachers and students know very well. This situation is also in the eyes, anxious, so the school proposes this expectation, hoping that we can come back to provoke the burden. I came back without saying a word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At the beginning, it was very stressful and the burden was heavy. The journalism has been delayed by the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; for many years, urgently needed to develop, and shows the desire for talents everywhere. Therefore, whether it was to stay at the National People&#39;s Congress or later was summoned by Fudan, I just taught at ease, and kept on new lessons and recruited new students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This is how these years have come here. It can be said that when there is no gas, there is no chance to sleep with peace of mind. Although it was tired at the time, these difficulties were overcome by us soon, and work continued to improve. Looking back now, I still feel worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &quot;To understand your mission&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt; /strong>; &lt;/span>; In your opinion, what are the current steering of the current research of the journalism and academia, and what are the lack of aspects? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; The difference between the theoretical views is inevitable, natural existence, and natural and reasonable. (The development of journalism research) I think it will eventually depend on the progress of journalism. You insist that your point of view is right. As a result, the newspaper is done, and the radio and television is done. This shows that the theory guides practice. Conversely, you are theoretically talked about in theory, but no one reads your newspapers and no one listens to your broadcast, indicating that your theory has no power. Isn&#39;t this a problem? Those who are ashamed of our theory are in this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, the atmosphere of self-appreciation of the academic community is still very heavy, which should not be. In this regard, the academic community should review and analyze the reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; Journalism has always faced &quot;News What do you think of this statement? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; &quot;Unclear theory&quot; has long affected the development of journalism for a long time, mainly in several cases. The journalism starts late, and there are not many independent knowledge and works. The aspects of the deep impact on China are still practical. It is practical to run newspapers, do radio, and television stations. Not big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; These knowledge all affects the status and image of journalism in various majors in liberal arts. With these doctors, Chinese journalism research gradually entered the right track and began to be a bit decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; How do you understand the journalist’s Mission? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; The most simple and simplest requirement of the journalist is to report real things to the people Real news, this is the most important. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-alft;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;/span>; The university freshman of the journalism science Just entering the school gate, can you give college students some suggestions for life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>; This is a very open proposition. Waves, one wave follows the waves, a tide one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As a teacher, we hope that new students can inherit the good traditions in the school, and then develop and grow, making the university get better, and the college students themselves themselves themselves themselves themselves Being able to improve continuously, only in this way can our country get better and better, our career will become more and more brilliant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So after college students enter college, the first thing is to understand their mission. Everyone should have their own arrangements and prospects. This is not just hanging on the mouth, but it must actually do so. We also came from undergraduate to a master&#39;s degree and doctoral degree. New students must have a sense of mission. I think this is the most important thing about the future, looking forward to, and arrangement. Time has passed fast. Don&#39;t look at the four years of undergraduate, half of the blink of an eye passed, but the task is actually not over. In the future, we need to continue to work hard, fight for, and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; University students should not be afraid of tiredness. Only by continuously developing their prospects can individuals have new goals, new directions, continuous progress, can they be There are more knowledge one day than you learn, overcome your shortcomings, and show new expectations. This is my college student, whether it is an undergraduate or a master&#39;s degree or a doctoral degree, a common expectation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“机场判官”再曝住宿骗局：虚假定位误导消费者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261538]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 09:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;IMG Alt = &quot;July 5, 2020, Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport.

In the video released on November 20, in order to avoid leakage, Liu Yan deliberately took the high -speed rail from Beijing to Xi&#39;an, and then took a car to Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport to &quot;patrol&quot;, confirming the positioning of the homestays around the airport on the OTA platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In this video, Liu Yan searched on a platform to search the nearest hotel at the nearest hotel.

The interviewees confessed &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the video released by Liu Yan, many netizens provided a screenshot of the different reviews of the above false positioning hotels: &quot;Did not pay attention to the above writing. The straight -line distance is too strong. The hotel is actually more than 8 kilometers away from the airport. It is actually the room near the airport. Comments mentioned problems such as remote and room -like pictures, but such homestays still ranks among the platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Liu Yan discovered the false positioning of the above homestays, which are set at the online car parking lot, T3 terminal, and T2 terminal of Xi&#39;an Airport.

On another OTA platform, a shop labeled &quot;less than 100 meters away from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport, about 1 minute&quot; on the 20th, and has been revised on the 22nd to &quot;4.5 kilometers away from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport, about 9 minutes.&quot; When a reporter from the Southern Weekend asked why he saw a distance of only one minute walking before, the store did not respond positively, but emphasized that &quot;it is impossible to be so cheap in the airport outside the airport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On November 22, the reporters from the Southern Weekend contacted the four OTA platforms of Ctrip, Tongcheng, Flying Pig, and Meituan, and did not receive a reply. According to the analysis of the OTA platform industry who do not want to be named, the platform needs to verify its address before the hotel is launched. After the launch, it is also necessary to do daily verification and inspection. License or lease contracts, such as the address on the contract as the online address, is difficult to distinguish the platform. At the same time, each online travel hotel platform also has some agency housing, and some houses are closed on one platform, and the vest on other platforms. &quot;If the platform is not effective, it is difficult to investigate and deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City told the Southern Weekend reporter that the local market supervision department has interviewed the three OTA platforms in the past two days and ordered them to strengthen the homestays around the airport.

Zhang Ning and the hotel&#39;s front desk theory, why the hotel location and photos are different from the platform. The other party said, &quot;That&#39;s an old shop, it has been closed&quot;, and does not provide specific addresses, letting her take a taxi. At that time, it was late at night. Zhang Ning could only live after weighing again and again, and asked the pick -up personnel to return her back to the airport the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I originally wanted to give a bad review, but because he had my personal information and dare not give it.&quot; Zhang Ning said that she was worried about being retaliated and did not want to give herself.

The opening exhibition was the exhibition of the &quot;freak Ivy&quot; Xu Wei himself, followed by Chen Laolian. By 2023, It is a special performance by Ren Bonian, and each performance is worth a special trip. The 13-meter &quot;Flowers of the Four Seasons&quot; came from Ren Bonian&#39;s exhibition.

It is said that Ren Bonian was able to draw lifelike figures very early. It is said that one time someone came to see his father, but his father was not there. When he came back and heard about it, he asked Ren Bonian who the visitor was. Bonian was only ten years old at the time and could not answer the guest&#39;s name, so he had to take a piece of paper and draw the person&#39;s name.

The Zhong Kui he painted is especially chic, with a high attitude and a swaggering look. The knights, often in these works with new and surprising shapes, you can get a glimpse of the painter&#39;s true temperament and sense of humor. The same goes for his paintings of flowers and birds. The fat bird with its big white eyes comes from Bada Shanren, but the extraordinary rise of Bada turned into joy in Ren Bonian&#39;s place. The chicks that have just emerged from their eggshells under the crape myrtle flowers are fluffy and childish. His gait and expression are like those of a gangster, he is still young and arrogant, which makes people smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Egpnr7tr8haTxsmnwxwnPmwCUl88sESebNpNhPcg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;461&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Egpnr7tr8haTxsmnwxwnPmwCUl88sESebNpNhPcg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259264&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aunt Gongsun is considered the best master of sword dancing in the prosperous Tang Dynasty&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most interesting one is &quot;A Picture of Aunt Gongsun Dancing with Swords&quot;. It is said that Aunt Gongsun was the number one dancer in the prosperous age of Kaiyuan, and was promoted to be the best dancer in the prosperous Tang Dynasty for her sword dancing. Zhang Xu, the grass sage, understood the essence of cursive script from her sword skills, and Wu Daozi, the painting sage, also learned about Gongsun Auntie’s dance by watching her dance. Use the sword to learn how to use the pen. What the actual situation is cannot be determined now, but look at Ren Bonian&#39;s painting of sword dancing. Gongsun danced the two white blades as if they were practiced softly. The artist did not hesitate to draw hundreds of circles to record the imaginary and the real. All the traces of the sword flying across the air, the leaves on the big tree branches behind Aunt Gongsun trembled, as if they felt the sword energy, but Aunt Gongsun herself remained unmoved, her expression was quite calm, she was the one who stood firm among the thousands of changes. The core of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Beihong once said: Ren Bonian is &quot;the first Chinese painter after Qiu Shizhou (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qiu Ying&lt;/span>;) &quot;I don&#39;t care whether this statement is fair or not, but at least it reflects Xu Beihong&#39;s preference for Ren Bonian. This preference may be related to Ren Bonian&#39;s position. He lives in Shanghai all year round and makes a living selling paintings. Therefore, his paintings combine literati paintings and fireworks. Indeed, we can see many traces of connecting the past and the future, connecting China and the world. It is a rich and flexible tradition of calligraphy and painting, which is at the confluence and turning point of the tide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都新力量]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261516]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;The power of a city to move forward largely comes from the new strength of the new youth.

Image source: Pinduoduo Weibo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 28, 2023, Beijing time, Pinduoduo’s intraday trading repeatedly hit new highs, rising by more than 18%. Within fifteen minutes, the market value increased by $100 million. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the opening to the closing, Pinduoduo’s total market value soared from US$156.4 billion to US$184.7 billion, a surge of nearly 30 billion. As of the close, Pinduoduo was only tens of billions away from Alibaba, which has a market capitalization of US$195.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If compared according to the price limit rules of China&#39;s A-share market, Pinduoduo is only one &quot;price limit&quot; away from Alibaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s rapid rise has triggered heated discussions among investors. Some people lamented that the throne of e-commerce is about to change hands and that &quot;an era of great things is coming&quot;, while others joked that &quot;the higher the stock price rises, the poorer everyone becomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fierce reaction of the capital market stems from Pinduoduo’s outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 28, Pinduoduo (PDD.Nasdaq) released its financial report for the third quarter of 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;financial report&quot;), with revenue of 68.84 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 94%, not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP), net profit attributable to Pinduoduo’s ordinary shareholders was 17.027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can clearly feel the continued recovery of the economy, as well as the potential and resilience of the consumer market. At the same time, we also see from user behavior that consumption upgrades are both about quality and price. The optimization of price-performance ratio is consumers&#39; ultimate pursuit of good products at good prices.&quot; said Chen Lei, Chairman and Co-CEO of Pinduoduo Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Pinduoduo’s past financial reports, it achieved (Non-GAAP) quarterly profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 89%. Since then, although revenue has doubled on average every quarter, it was not until the second quarter of 2021 that Pinduoduo achieved double growth in revenue and net profit in a single quarter for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, Pinduoduo has drawn a significant upward curve of revenue growth and net profit doubling for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Buy a lot of groceries, a hidden revenue tool&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei attributed the revenue growth to the improvement of the consumer environment and the implementation of the company&#39;s &quot;high-quality development&quot; strategy. Judging from the financial report, Pinduoduo’s 94% revenue growth was due to the double increase in revenue from its two main businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online marketing services and other services increased by 39% year-on-year, and transaction service revenue increased by as much as 315% year-on-year. The two account for about half of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What supports the growth of transaction service revenue is generally an increase in the number of active merchants on the platform and an increase in the average transaction service revenue of each active merchant (i.e. commission). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from a Pinduoduo merchant that the transaction commission is charged based on the sales price of the completed order, and the commission will not be refunded if the consumer returns the product. Pinduoduo did not release GMV (gross merchandise transaction) data in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Lichong, President of Huisheng International Capital, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that transaction service fees actually include the income of Duoduo Maicai. This quarter’s unexpected growth is due to the rapid expansion of Duoduo Maicai. Huang Lichong once served as executive director and managing director of the investment banking department of China International Finance Securities (Hong Kong). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduomaicai was launched in August 2020. Since then, Pinduoduo’s transaction service fee income has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei commented at the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call that Duoduo’s grocery shopping business is “a platform that consumers use very frequently.” Entering the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s number of active buyers surpassed Alibaba for the first time, reaching 788 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, Duoduomaicai has gone through many rounds of fierce battles between platforms and has survived the dark moment of community group buying. According to reports from many media including Qilu Evening News, nine provinces have been shut down in order to target the prosperity of the sinking market. Jingxi Pinpin is only left in Langfang, Hebei and Beijing. Other community group buying has also been shut down one after another. Currently, Pinduoduo and Meituan Each controls half of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the US asset management company HAYDEN CAPITAL estimated that by 2025, Duoduo Maicai will contribute at least about 14 billion yuan in EBIT to Pinduoduo, which may start in 2023 Achieve overall profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial performance meeting, Chen Lei introduced that Pinduoduo started out in agricultural products and retained a number of users through agricultural products services. However, the current online rate of this category is low, and there is huge potential in the future. potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Duoduo’s grocery shopping, the market generally speculates that Duoduo’s cross-border services may create a new revenue growth curve for Pinduoduo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, Pinduoduo launched the cross-border e-commerce project Temu, which Chen Lei regarded as his &quot;third venture.&quot; At that time, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance, Liu Jun, said that cross-border business was in its early stages and would have little impact on financial reports. Temu’s revenue data was not announced in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduo’s cross-border project is led by Gu Pingping, the former head of Duoduo’s grocery shopping, and inherits Pinduoduo’s domestic supply, talent, and marketing advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial report meeting, Liu Jun said, &quot;Pinduoduo&#39;s global business is still in a very early stage, and the team is still increasing its understanding of consumer needs in different markets around the world.&quot; Currently, Temu has launched a In 2016, it has expanded to 40 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Getting out of the quagmire of losses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 28, in contrast to the upward trend in Pinduoduo’s stock price, the stock price of Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) dropped all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumption downgrading is an increasingly clear trend. Consumers are moving from platforms with high unit prices to low-price platforms. Low price is still the key for Pinduoduo to occupy the sinking market in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at Pinduoduo’s growth history, the “10 billion subsidy” strategy has not only opened up the market for it, but is also the main reason for dragging down its financial performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo has faced significant losses since its listing. From 2018 to the first quarter of 2020, losses continued to expand. In June 2019, after the &quot;Ten Billion Subsidy&quot; was launched, it achieved GMV growth and increased user activity. The price was that its sales and marketing expenses exceeded profits, which was equivalent to all the revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the second quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s losses have narrowed. Ma Jing, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance at the time, said at the earnings conference call, “Profitability will not be considered this year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the third quarter of 2020 that Pinduoduo achieved profitability for the first time, which was also when CEO Chen Lei took office. The first report card after. This year, Pinduoduo launched Duoduo’s grocery shopping business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo really &quot;taken off&quot; in the second quarter of 2021, with both revenue and profit increasing, and getting out of the mire of losses. Since then, it has almost maintained a double-digit profit growth. In particular, three quarters in 2022 will achieve multiple growth, with profits in the second quarter nearly tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jing responded at the second quarter 2021 conference call that revenue growth stems from the increase in the number of users and the increase in user psychological share, and the second quarter is the off-season for marketing, so marketing expenditures are small and there are seasonal factors. Special reasons for sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pinduoduo executives also made no secret of the fact that the increase in profits comes from cost reduction and efficiency increase during the 2021 financial results conference call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Lichong said that over the years, Pinduoduo has optimized its operating costs, reduced some unnecessary expenses, increased profit margins by increasing product prices and reducing after-sales service costs, while investing in technology, logistics, agriculture and other fields. , improve its own competitiveness and business efficiency. These strategies have effectively helped it get out of losses and achieve profits beyond expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s executive director and co-CEO Zhao Jiazhen revealed in a recent earnings conference call that during the just past “Double Eleven” promotion, the number of users of Pinduoduo’s “10 billion subsidy” has exceeded 620 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the financial report was released, employees on Alibaba’s intranet discussed Pinduoduo’s performance in the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba partner Jack Ma rarely replied, &quot;All great companies are born in winter. The era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is both an opportunity and a challenge for everyone. I would like to congratulate Pinduoduo for the past few years. Decision-making, execution and efforts. No one is better, but those who can reform for the sake of tomorrow and the organization that are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戏骨云集的《风声》姐妹篇，砸了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new theatrical film &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is the latest version of &quot;The Wind&quot; &quot;Sister volume of &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also an original work by Mai Jia + director Gao Qunshu, with a spy war theme + a bone drama, but the reputation is far different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1511&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259921&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Today, 14 years after its release, &quot;The Wind&quot; is still the leading Chinese-language spy suspense film. 600,000 people gave it a high score of 8.4 on Douban, which is better than 95% of dramas and 98% of thrillers.

However, using dubbing to promote narrative in film and television works is undoubtedly a very weak choice. On the contrary, it proves that the film is unable to tell stories with pictures and characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259926&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although there are many characters appearing in the first half, they still have distinct personalities. But the characters who appear in the second half, such as the members of the military command team stationed in Nanjing, Lin Yingying&#39;s relatives, etc., these supporting roles are too homogeneous. In fact, there is no need to type subtitles for every person who appears, nor do you need to give everyone equal time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such a passing character and hasty explanation of the ending give the second half a sense of deja vu, as if you have finished the plot and left work early, and the narrative is cohesive&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; span>;Compared with the first half, it can be regarded as loose prose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a common saying to describe the impression of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot;, it is that &quot;it is full of energy, then fades, and three times it is exhausted.&quot; The more you watch, the more discouraged you are, until it collapses thousands of miles. The film wants to portray the change of mentality of the triple agent. It stands to reason that the character will be highlighted and sublimated at the end, but this mechanism obviously fails in this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/88632c0053d9c80d3cbd10e11477fa59.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259931&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Wind&quot;, which has a lot to do with the tendency of film and television adaptation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The original work of &quot;The Sound of the Wind&quot; is divided into Dongfeng, West Wind and Jingfeng. From the perspectives of different narrators, it restores the ghost-catching past events in Qiuzhuang with different versions that are difficult to distinguish between true and false. If it were shot strictly according to the logic of the original work, it would be a polished remake of &quot;Rashomon.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But the director accurately picked out the main line of the story, filled it with flesh and blood, and drastically deleted unnecessary plots. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film version of &quot;The Wind&quot; is a bit like a colorful stage play, and it does use the three principles of drama&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (observe time , location and actions are consistent)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;——The isolated Qiuzhuang is an excellent stage for the story to be staged. The protagonists with different thoughts seek faith and survival. Time and space are further compressed to highlight the characters and stories as much as possible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/9b97d4839579d0da47de7da325e491c2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;760&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/9b97d4839579d0da47de7da325e491c2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259930 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The original work of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is divided into upper and lower volumes. The positive side is about Jin Shenshui, and the negative side is about Lin Yingying. Together they are the complete context of the history of the two fighting side by side. This novel focuses on the growth of the characters and has a large span, which makes the adaptation quite difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The problem with the film version is precisely that it&lt;/span>; wants to completely present the whole character, but ends up copying the gourd and being constrained by the original work. Based on the size of the original work, it would be a good choice to make a 40-episode TV series. The 120 minutes of the film version is really difficult to carry such complex characters and emotions. It is better to only retain the first half of the film and delve deeper into the characters to make them fuller and richer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ff2a834d717cfb87e4f5e915174ce941.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ff2a834d717cfb87e4f5e915174ce941.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259929&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even without &quot;The Wind&quot;, &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; would not be considered a success&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. Because it was difficult to choose side branches from the main plot, the movie was turned into a double-speed explanation video of the TV series, which was really a mistake. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Director Gao Qunshu also has &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and &quot;Gunshots from the Secret Service&quot; on his waiting list. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; I don’t know when they will be released. Once again, we can see a spy thriller on the big screen comparable to &quot;The Wind&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
