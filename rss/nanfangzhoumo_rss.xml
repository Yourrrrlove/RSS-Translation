In the video, a cornfield is crowded with people. The road next to it is filled with tricycles of all sizes, and some cars drive directly into the field. The voice of an eyewitness in the video said that the cornfield totaled 2,000 acres, and hundreds of acres had been robbed. The police could not stop it because there were too many villagers. The video also shows police arriving at the scene. At the end of the video, the local township government staff said that the township chief had arrived to maintain order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The local township government and the Dancheng County Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau later denied that looting had occurred, saying that the farmers only went to the harvested plots to &quot;pick up&quot; the missed corn. According to the situation statement issued by the Dancheng County Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, there are not as many corn fields as 2,000 acres, only 400 acres. After the company that contracted the land to grow corn contacted the township government, the township government &quot;immediately arranged for village cadres and police station police to go to the scene to maintain order, persuade the people to leave in an orderly manner, and the machine collection work was carried out normally.&quot; In the afternoon of that day, the company&#39;s 400 acres of corn had been harvested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it looting or picking up? Judging from the video, most people are indeed picking corn in the harvested fields. However, according to eyewitnesses, these people did follow the harvester to pick it up at first, but then many people gathered around and the harvester could not move, and many people started to grab it. To take a step back, even if the land has been harvested by machines, can we pick it up immediately? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural areas, leakage does exist. This is a good thing and prevents food waste. However, it can only be picked up after the owner harvests it. Nowadays, most people use harvesters to harvest crops, often missing a lot. Under normal circumstances, the owner will manually pick up the leaks again after the machine has finished harvesting. Only the rest can be picked up by others. If you follow the harvester directly to harvest, you will either pick it up or rob it. Judging from the action of the contracting company calling the police, it is obvious that they do not want to see these farmers &quot;picking&quot; corn after the harvester, not to mention that there may be people who run into the confiscated fields to &quot;pick&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the rural population decreases, governments at all levels encourage social capital to transfer land in rural areas for investment and entrepreneurship. However, cases of agricultural entrepreneurs being robbed are seen on the Internet from time to time: college students who return to their hometowns to start a business are robbed by villagers, watermelons are stolen from greenhouses contracted by outsiders, pumpkins are stolen, and peaches and apples are stolen... In short, no matter what Whatever entrepreneurs sow and raise, it can be stolen. Many entrepreneurs are forced to erect barbed wire fences, install video surveillance, and keep a few dogs to look after them. Not only is the cost high, but the results are not good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the robbery incident, the local government will use various excuses to excuse the farmers. Some, like in Dancheng, Henan, said that farmers did not steal, but &quot;picked up&quot; and picked up the leaks after the owner had finished harvesting; some said they were deceived by rumors that the owner did not want them anymore and could pick them up at will. ; Some even directly favored the thief. There was once a melon farmer who got into a fight with a melon thief, causing the melon thief to fall to the ground and suffer a slight injury. When the police arrived at the scene, they asked the melon farmer to pay the thief 300 yuan, which aroused great public attention. They just asked the thief to return the money and settled the matter. In the end, the theft was not recognized and the melon thief was not punished in any way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pick one or two watermelons, a few pumpkins, and dozens of corns. It doesn’t look like much, and it doesn’t seem like there’s much to “make a fuss about.” But once there are more people, the number of people who are picked off and taken away is not a small number. If the behavior of one or two people &quot;picking&quot; and &quot;picking&quot; crops is not strictly stopped and punished, there will be groups of people coming to &quot;pick&quot; and &quot;pick&quot;, causing huge losses to investors. The repeated occurrence of such incidents will seriously undermine the confidence and enthusiasm of agricultural investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of rural laborers has decreased, and land has been transferred to foreign investors for a fee to operate on a large scale and collect rent. Some people can also work on farms and receive wages. This is a win-win situation. However, if investors’ interests are not adequately protected, they may not come back. Without outside investors and no people in the village, the land would be abandoned and the farmers would have no income. Where to start talking about rural development? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To solve this problem, we must take a clear-cut stand to protect the interests of agricultural investors and crack down on theft and robbery. We can no longer be confused and &quot;lawless&quot;. Perhaps it is difficult to control all the robbers immediately due to the large number of people at the scene, but it is entirely possible to leave video evidence and ask them to return the stolen property afterwards and punish them in accordance with the law. In fact, as long as a severe penalty and a few people are punished, it is enough to deter those who are lucky enough to teach these locals a lesson and not dare to steal again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄罗斯总统普京抵达北京]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258724]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 09:36:42&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the morning of October 17, Russian President Putin arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport by plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;President Putin will attend the third &quot;Belt and Road&quot; International Cooperation Summit Forum and participate in related activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 09:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[通报落马官员，频现新表述]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258722]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/16/4qime8N3feVFJIWeLrzvDR8wlYUfoKhlVJdoAYEm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/4qime8N3feVFJIWeLrzvDR8wlYUfoKhlVJdoAYEm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254222&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The revised &quot;Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China&quot; will &quot;organize gangs within the party&quot; &quot;Gang&quot; is listed as one of the disciplinary violations. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 25, 2023, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission reported that the former Shaanxi Provincial Fruit Industry Center Party Secretary Chu Jinfeng was &quot;double fired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The formation of huge debts has led to hidden government debt credit risks.” In addition to common violations of disciplines and laws, the notice specifically mentioned this point. According to public information, the same statement was not found in the reports of the dismissed officials by the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions at all levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, in recent years, new formulations have frequently appeared in the draft notices issued by the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions at all levels reporting the dismissal of officials. These new expressions mainly describe the new phenomena and characteristics of fallen officials&#39; violations of discipline and law, or reveal the true political attitudes of fallen officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that some new wordings, such as &quot;creating gangs within the party&quot;, &quot;arguing against the central government&#39;s policies&quot; and &quot;being a two-faced person&quot; have been revised twice in 2015 and 2018. It was written into the &quot;Regulations on Disciplinary Punishments of the Communist Party of China&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Peng Xinlin, a professor at Beijing Normal University Law School, “The new expression is a theoretical refinement and generalization that can better grasp the new stage characteristics of the current anti-corruption work. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Increased “new formulations”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chu Jinfeng was born in March 1966. His official career started in the Weinan Municipal Finance Bureau, where he worked for 15 years. From December 2002, Chu Jinfeng served as the deputy mayor of Hancheng City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Weinan City). In Hancheng, he served successively as deputy mayor of Hancheng City, deputy secretary-general of the municipal government, director of the National Development and Reform Commission, mayor (deputy department level), and secretary of the municipal party committee, until he was transferred to the party secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Fruit Industry Center in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The specific behavior of &quot;forming huge debts and triggering government implicit debt credit risks&quot; is that during his tenure as mayor and municipal party committee secretary of Hancheng City, Chu Jinfeng led the decision-making and implementation of a number of projects without project approval procedures. , failure to apply for construction permits, lack of land procedures and other irregularities. Data released by the Hancheng City Finance Bureau show that in 2022, the Hancheng City government debt balance will be approximately 4.432 billion yuan. In the same year, Hancheng’s fiscal revenue was only 3.361 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to causing hidden debt risks, there are also notifications that list fallen officials as disciplinary and illegal behaviors that lead to a sharp increase in local government debt risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission on July 27, 2023, Jiao Xiaoping, the former deputy commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, was &quot;double fired&quot;. The report stated that it &quot;exacerbated the government&#39;s hidden debt risks and created financial problems.&quot; Security risks&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 2023, the 2022 anti-corruption warning record &quot;Loyalty and Betrayal&quot; produced by the Hunan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision introduced the disciplinary and illegal behavior of Cao Jiongfang, the former secretary of the Xiangtan Municipal Party Committee. In May 2016, after Cao Jiongfang took office as Secretary of the Xiangtan Municipal Party Committee, he carried out large-scale demolition and construction in the city regardless of financial resources and reality. He blindly proposed to turn every urban road into a landscape road, a high-quality road, and a model road. A total of 345 paving projects were completed. The total investment is 61.7 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;According to the observation of Zhuang Deshui, deputy director of the Integrity Construction Research Center of Peking University, after 2015, disciplinary inspection and supervision agencies at all levels gradually increased the number of &quot;new references&quot; in the notifications of fallen officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An obvious node may be June 2015. The Fuzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Lin Lunjian, chairman of the Lianjiang County CPPCC, Chen Baifan, leader of the discipline inspection team of the Fuzhou Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, and Lin Zhong, deputy mayor of Changle City, committed &quot;serious violations of socialist ethics&quot;. According to the Beijing News, the issue involved by these three officials was an inappropriate relationship with a woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, disciplinary inspection and supervision systems at all levels have frequently used new expressions in draft notifications. Southern Weekend reporters combed through and found that these new expressions mainly describe new phenomena and new characteristics of fallen officials&#39; violations of discipline and law, or reveal the true political attitudes of fallen officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhuang Deshui’s observation, the original website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of Supervision was launched in September 2013 (renamed the “Website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission” in March 2018). As the website construction gradually matured, the investigation of fallen officials Public notifications were normalized, and new wording and expressions appeared in draft notifications around 2015. In addition, after the launch of the pilot reform of the national supervisory system in November 2016, the content of notifications against fallen officials has become more abundant, which is one of the reasons why new wording appears frequently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhuang Deshui explained that before the reform of the supervisory system, the Discipline Inspection Commission’s reports usually focused on the disciplinary violations of dismissed officials, and the illegal and criminal issues were basically not mentioned. The illegal and criminal issues were generally reported by the court after being transferred to the judicial organs. . After the reform of the supervision system, the proportion of illegal and criminal issues in the notification has increased significantly, and it will contain some rare statements that have not appeared before. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New expressions and new questions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“There are two meanings behind the new expressions.” Zhuang Deshui’s analysis, the first is to analyze a certain issue at the factual level Underline officials&#39; disciplinary violations, illegal crimes, and summarize the characteristics of their disciplinary violations and the Party discipline and national laws they violated; secondly, the new expression actually reflects the newly exposed problems in the anti-corruption work, or the next stage of the disciplinary inspection and supervision system The issues that need to be investigated and dealt with are a benchmark for anti-corruption work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2021, Xiao Yi, the former vice chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference, was double fired. The notice stated that he &quot;abused his power to introduce and support companies to engage in virtual currency &#39;mining&#39; activities that are not in compliance with the requirements of national industrial policies.&quot; , this is the first time that virtual currency “mining” behavior has appeared in a report from the disciplinary inspection system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2022, Zhou Jiangyong, former member of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and former Secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, was double fired. The notice mentioned that he &quot;colluded with capital and supported the ineffective expansion of capital.&quot; &quot;China News Weekly&quot; reported that this expression was used for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2022, Zhang Jinghua, the former deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, was &quot;double opened&quot;. The report mentioned that he &quot;committed falsification of economic data in order to seek personal advancement.&quot; This statement was not included in the report of the disciplinary inspection system. precedent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2022, in a press release from Chen Jiadong, former director of the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress of Xiamen City, Fujian Province, it was stated that Chen Jiadong used public power to serve interest groups, resist organizational censorship, and engage in superstitious activities. Shangguan News reported that &quot;using public power to serve interest groups&quot; appeared for the first time in the notice of the fallen official. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Ji Guogang, a former member of the Party Leadership Group and Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, was “double fired” and reported that he had “wantonly abused central and local special funds.” &quot;Liberation Daily&quot; reported that this wording appeared for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhuang Deshui noticed that after the emergence of these new formulations, some of them have been absorbed into party documents and listed as work goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The communique of the Second Plenary Session of the 20th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection held in January 2023 clearly stated that &quot;resolutely investigate and deal with corruption where political issues and economic issues are intertwined, and resolutely prevent leading cadres from becoming the targets of interest groups and powerful groups.&quot; Spokespersons and agents, resolutely prevent political and business collusion, capital penetration into the political field, etc. from damaging the political ecology and economic development environment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Institutional Norms&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;And Summary Compared with the new wording on the illegal behavior of fallen officials, the new expressions revealing the political attitudes of fallen officials have also attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Zhao Shaolin, former member of the Standing Committee and Secretary-General of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, had been &quot;double fired&quot;. The draft of more than 300 words rarely used eight new expressions, including &quot;creating gangs within the party&quot;, &quot;engaging in wanton exchanges and transfers of interests&quot;, &quot;coining and corrupting leading cadres&quot;, &quot;openly disseminating and comprehensively strictly governing the party&quot; Remarks that contradict the requirements” etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2015, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Zhou Benshun, the former secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, seriously violated political disciplines and rules and &quot;made remarks that went against the spirit of the central government on major issues.&quot; This new statement was also Caused widespread concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 1, 2016, the revised &quot;Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China&quot; listed &quot;creating gangs within the party&quot; as one of the disciplinary violations, and &quot;unreasonable discussion of the central government&#39;s policies, undermining the &quot;Party centralization and unity&quot; is included in the category of violation of political discipline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2016, Zheng Xuebi, the former secretary of the Chengde Municipal Party Committee in Hebei Province, was &quot;double fired&quot; and the notice pointed out that he &quot;refuses to implement the party and the country&#39;s principles and policies.&quot; Jiemian News reported that this wording appeared for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2017, the Anhui Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection reported serious disciplinary violations by Yang Jingnong, the former Secretary-General of the Anhui Provincial Government, saying that he &quot;has no ideals and beliefs, is not loyal and honest to the party, and has long been a &#39;two-faced man&#39;&quot; &#39;&quot;. The term &quot;two-faced man&quot; has no precedent before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Effective from October 1, 2018, the newly revised &quot;Regulations on Disciplinary Punishments of the Communist Party of China&quot; came into effect, with 11 new articles, including &quot;engaging in hilltop doctrine and refusing to implement the major policies set by the Party Central Committee&quot; , implement the disciplinary provisions for discounting or making changes in the decisions and plans of the Party Central Committee, as well as creating and spreading political rumors and other behaviors that endanger the unity and unity of the Party&quot; and &quot;engaging in double-dealing, being a two-faced person and other behaviors that are disloyal and dishonest to the Party.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The improvement of intra-party regulations is an important part of the construction of the anti-corruption system. Peng Xinlin believes that &quot;the revision of the Party Disciplinary Punishment Regulations is to timely upgrade some new phenomena that actually appear in anti-corruption work, or some good experiences and practices into institutional norms.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一帧新发现之大千先生自画像稿]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258694]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/16/EFEkjWo3Eja9vKdOM4zpri5jSaSTfgJaHBoy9XUI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;832&quot; height=&quot;1095&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/EFEkjWo3Eja9vKdOM4zpri5jSaSTfgJaHBoy9XUI. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254144&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Self-portrait of Mr. Daqian. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Daqian likes to make self-portraits. Taking into account only those that can be seen in public and private collections today, from the first painting he made at the age of 28 to the end of his life, there were more than a hundred self-portraits handed down to the world, and the number of those that have been lost is still unknown. In the history of world painting, even if this is not the &quot;best&quot;, it is certainly one of the &quot;best&quot;. If we look back at the history of Chinese painting, it will definitely be the best in ancient and modern times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The newly discovered self-portrait manuscript of Mr. Daqian was originally collected by Zhang Shizheng&#39;s &quot;Qinglian Bookstore&quot;. Master Zheng was born in Chaoyang, Guangdong. His father was an antique dealer in Hong Kong. He was very familiar with Mr. Daqian. In 1956, he ordered his son to become a disciple of Dafeng Hall. Later, he went to Brazil to live in Bade Garden. He was one of the four disciples of Bade Garden and was appointed by Mr. Daqian. The teacher named him Qian, with the courtesy name Shi Zheng. His teacher, Zheng Nai, was a young man who was cautious and spoke softly. In addition to studying painting, he also took care of the books, paper, ink, and stationery in the Bade Garden Studio. There is an unwritten rule in Bade Garden: any drawings, sketches, lesson plans, fragments of poems, or even banquet menus written by the teacher during daily painting and chatting, even if they are just pieces of paper, can be shared by all the students in turn. , Mr. Daqian is also happy to see this. If there are any scraps of old paper in the studio that are worthy of study, you can ask the teacher to keep them for yourself. Master Zheng was responsible for managing the studio and was close to the water, so he earned a lot of money. Later, he fell in love with another Bade Garden student, Wang Dandan. Three years later, in 1969, they both said goodbye to Bade Garden and returned to New York and got married. Six years later, he died of a brain tumor, and this frame has been preserved by Wang Dandan to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/MFBSGanK6l6rAI2YeklAjQ67AwM0OYJhsyLyKvb2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;790&quot; height= &quot;807&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/MFBSGanK6l6rAI2YeklAjQ67AwM0OYJhsyLyKvb2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254143&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhang Shizheng and Wang Dandan are in Bade Garden. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-portrait on paper, 45 cm high and 35 cm wide, without inscription, with Dandan inscription On it:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Da Qianfuzi&#39;s self-portrait drawing with silk thread. I don’t know the name of the thin paper, which is glossy and translucent and extremely cheap. It is commonly used by teachers and students of Da Feng Hall for shadow tracing. The teacher Zheng Bingxing respected calligraphy paper and was amazed by his master&#39;s unique skills in gossamer tracing. He found this painting among the discarded papers in the Bade Garden Studio. I re-examined the old box under the lamp because I recognized it. Dingyou is at the end of the year, every day. It was cold and rainy, and it didn&#39;t stop for two days. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three seals are &quot;Qinglian Bookstore&quot;, &quot;Dandan&quot; and &quot;Wang Xi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gossamer drawing is one of the so-called line drawings in &quot;Hua Shi Zhi Meng&quot; written by Ming Zou Dezhong, &quot;18 ancient and modern drawing techniques&quot;. Its meaning is as the name suggests. &quot;Haixian Painting Manual&quot; notes: &quot;Use a very sharp pen, like the pattern of Cao&#39;s clothes.&quot; (Editor&#39;s note: Cao Zhongda in the Northern Qi Dynasty and Daozi in the Tang and Wu Dynasties were both good at painting Buddha statues. Cao&#39;s brushwork is thick and overlapping, and the clothes are tight and narrow; Wu&#39;s brushwork is round Turning, the clothes and belts are fluttering, so later generations call it &quot;Wu belts are in the wind, Cao&#39;s clothes are flowing out of the water.&quot;) Mr. Daqian&#39;s lines in this frame are as thin as a gossamer, fluent, elegant and graceful, without any obstructions; not only does the beard and eyebrows grow, The line drawing also expresses the solid texture of the skin of the cheeks, nose, lips, and ears, and the shape is mastered. It cannot be achieved without a clear mind and a perfect hand. It can be said to be superb and jaw-dropping. Thinking of this, Sun Jiaqin, one of the four disciples of Bade Garden, was trying to identify the authenticity of Master Yiwujie&#39;s paintings. He opened the scroll and looked at it briefly, and said: &quot;There is absolutely no doubt! Others don&#39;t have this writing power, and they can&#39;t come up with this kind of charm.&quot; .&quot; Wang Dandan looked at this frame for the author, looked at it for a long time, and sighed: &quot;I will never be able to draw like the teacher in my life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several lines of short titles in the upper left corner of the self-portrait manuscript: &quot;Ape The baby is named Black, and he is cute and funny. During the day, he likes to climb outside the window of the big studio to paint. The teacher also loves him like a favorite. If he is sick, he will ask the local pediatrician to treat him, and he can be cured, which is also a miracle. Dandansaki remembers it again. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Daqian often tells people that this life is the reincarnation of a black ape. On the eve of his mother Zeng&#39;s delivery, she dreamed of an elderly man with a white beard holding a black ape on a gong and giving it to him, and told him to take good care of it. He also said: &quot;The black ape is afraid of meat and fish, and is afraid of being restrained.&quot; The gentleman said to himself: &quot;Dream Just listen to what the omen says. The strange thing is that after weaning, I really can&#39;t eat even a little bit of meat and fish, and I have been vegetarian since I was a child. It&#39;s not that my family doesn&#39;t let me eat meat, but it&#39;s that whenever I touch meat, I will turn my stomach and vomit. What&#39;s even weirder is When I was a child, I burst into tears when I saw the moon and kept crying for a long time. This happened repeatedly, and my family was surprised and believed in the theory that dreams portend black apes.&quot; His revered master Zeng Nongbeard had already felt that this disciple was very smart and enlightened. A person with abnormal spiritual power was born with dark skin and thick hair. Hearing this, he became more convinced and gave him the name &quot;Yuan&quot;. Since then, he has lived in various places, and Mr. Daqian has always followed him. He often used apes in his paintings, and he could be called a master of ape paintings during the reign of Emperor Yi and Yuan Ji of the Song Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;black baby&quot; was raised by Mr. Daqian in the Bade Garden in Brazil. The Taipei National Palace Museum also has a portrait of Mr. Daqian and Hei Baobao. It is one of the pages of the album. It has a similar composition but different pen and ink. The writing is simple and has a cursive style. The title is: &quot;My Little Monkey and I&quot; , is so cute, or is it actually transformed from this frame? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/8q9PJYQRAnYS52AzWalYSQJl3Dtf471ojIqs9B5y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; height= &quot;797&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/8q9PJYQRAnYS52AzWalYSQJl3Dtf471ojIqs9B5y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254142&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhang Daqian&#39;s &quot;My Little Monkey and I&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dandan told the author: &quot;Baby Hei will wait on the corridor in the morning and accompany the teacher hand in hand. Take a walk. The big wire mesh cage where it is kept is facing the big window of the studio downstairs in Bade Garden. It hangs and plays in it, looking at the teacher through the window. We play with it and feed it bananas, and it will come to get it and peel it by itself. He also likes to use his two paws to gently push your hair away, as if he is looking for something, and will hit you when he is unhappy.&quot; When Mr. Daqian travels, he often writes letters to the students in the garden. and. For example, the letter to Wang Dandan in 1967 ended with the question: &quot;Are cats, dogs, and black apes good?&quot; It made people smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/ZH1hpjAYsfpPby6s2izZtB9CqUHHW3wHM6xXjTUw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height= &quot;395&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/ZH1hpjAYsfpPby6s2izZtB9CqUHHW3wHM6xXjTUw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254141&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Daqian is in the Bade Garden studio, and Baby Hei is outside the window. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 1969, Mr. Daqian went to San Francisco for surgery due to worsening of his eye disease. He was depressed for a time. On January 15th, he wrote to &quot;Dandan&#39;s Nephew&quot; saying: &quot;I have become very exhausted after falling ill, and I really want to give up all my hobbies. Nephew and Brother Luo, Mr. Huang, Uncle Shen, and Brother Zhang will quickly send Hei Baobao, Xida immediately cooperated to send it to the zoo, and then gave the flower to the dog lovers. The fool will bite, and if there is anyone who can train him, he will give it away. The little flower was fed by the ugly girl, so love is not a problem. . Please discuss the matter with us as soon as possible, so that your love will not bear to part with you when we see you again. Best advice, best advice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some reason, Mr. Daqian&#39;s instructions were not implemented. In late April of the same year, when Wang Dandan and Zhang Shizheng said goodbye to Mr. Daqian and Bade Garden and returned to New York, Hei Baobao and others were still in the garden. At this time, it was only a few months since Mr. Daqian decided to give up Bade Garden and move to California in the United States because the Brazilian government was about to take back the land to build a reservoir. On the day when teachers and students reunited in Mr. Daqian&#39;s new residence &quot;Huan Pi Temple&quot; in the small coastal town of Carmel, California, there was no trace of pets around the teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paper used in this frame is also worthy of research. As Wang Dandan said in the inscription, the paper is thin and translucent, with an oil-like waxy shine on the front and a silk color. The author has seen that there are several handwritten manuscripts of Daqian poems and early Dunhuang mural paintings in the old collection of Master Zhang Zheng Qinglian&#39;s bookstore, and they also use the same kind of paper. This paper is translucent and does not smear when receiving ink, so it is most suitable for line drawing or rubbing. Chang Shuhong&#39;s daughter Chang Shana lived with her father in Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes for many years. She heard her father talk about Mr. Daqian&#39;s method of rubbing murals, and she wrote a review of the Dunhuang rubbings left by Mr. Daqian. His &quot;Readme&quot; says: &quot;When Zhang Daqian copied the murals at Thousand Buddha Cave, he used thumbtacks to press the copy paper onto the murals. The resulting manuscript was very accurate, but the thumbtacks would inevitably make small holes in the wall. holes, destroying murals.&quot; Although the words were accusatory, they pointed out that the paper Mr. Daqian used for rubbings was &quot;copy paper.&quot; The National Palace Museum in Taipei has a painting of &quot;The Portrait of Samantabhadra of the Western Xia Dynasty at the Dharma Assembly in Cave 4 of the Yulin Grottoes in Anxi, Dunhuang, copied by Zhang Daqian, Sun Jiaqin, Zhang Shizheng during the Republic of China.&quot; There is an inscription written by Daqian himself, and it also mentions the paper used to copy the Dunhuang murals: &quot; In the second cave of Yulin Grottoes in Anxi (author&#39;s note: it was mistakenly thought to be the fourth cave), the Xixia people painted Manjushri and Samantabhadra going to the Dharma Assembly in one pavilion. The brushstrokes were all painted by Long Mian, and the background was also composed of Ma Xia, which is what the murals depict. Not yet. I was anxious to return, so I couldn&#39;t write it down, but I used oil sketches to draw the draft. The next year after I was surrendered, I revisited my old capital and found the second version of Chu Chu in the Song Dynasty. The length and width were about the same, so I used paper... ...&quot; I know that Mr. Daqian said that the paper used for his couch manuscript is called oil pigment, and the copy paper mentioned by Chang Shana should be the same thing, which is the paper used for this frame of Mr. Daqian&#39;s self-portrait. At that time, the origin of this paper was either domestic or imported, and it was yet to be learned by those who knew it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the author&#39;s personal opinion, it seems that this paper should still be named &quot;Oil Su&quot;. Firstly, it comes from the mouth of the person involved, Mr. Daqian, so I believe it must be well-founded; secondly, it sounds better than &quot; &quot;Copy paper&quot; is more Chinese and more elegant. Mr. Daqian used a wide variety of drawing papers throughout his life, including expensive ones such as ancient paper from the Song Dynasty and the following dynasties, and cheap ones such as Sichuan bamboo paper and Guizhou leather paper, as well as pineapple paper, Goryeo paper, Japanese Torizo ​​paper, Jinqian paper and even Taiwanese pineapple Xuan and other exotic products, as well as homemade Dafengtang rib paper and Maya Jingshe couplet paper. And this &quot;oil element&quot; should naturally be included in the list of &quot;Daqian Paper&quot;, and it cannot be judged by the secular world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additional note: Regarding what Mr. Daqian calls &quot;oil-based&quot; paper, there is a sentence in the above article: &quot;Those who have yet to learn can be taught.&quot; Unexpectedly, I immediately received relevant clues from my friends. &quot;The Life of Qi Baishi&quot; written by Zhang Cixi, a member of the Baishi sect, said: Bai Shiweng&#39;s family was poor in his early years and could not afford to buy books to learn painting, so he borrowed a copy of &quot;The Biography of Mustard Seed Garden Painting&quot; from a customer&#39;s home, &quot;In the wages earned, even some With some money, I bought some oil paper, paints, brushes and other things that must be used. Oil paper is thin bamboo paper soaked in tung oil. It is very thin, transparent and does not bleed ink. After work at night, I went home and gathered some pine oil. Under the firewood lamp, I sketched one picture after another. It took half a year to complete the sketch of &quot;The Biography of Mustard Seed Garden Paintings&quot;, except for the incomplete one.&quot; Yang Danxia&#39;s &quot;Identification of Authenticity of Chinese Paintings and Calligraphy&quot; says : &quot;Mi Fu&#39;s &quot;Daolin Tie&quot; is in its early style. There are also copies made by the Qing Dynasty, using oil paper. This kind of paper is dark beige, and the surface of the paper is oily. When copying, it will not appear on the original. The ink penetrates into the original calligraphy. Jiang Heng, a calligrapher during the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty, was good at imitating the ancients. His grandson Jiang He once said in the inscription after a work that his grandfather copied Li Dongyang&#39;s calligraphy on oil paper. There are also records about Zha Shibiao&#39;s forgery in the Qing Dynasty rulers, saying that the Zha Tuo people bought this kind of oil paper, and then copied ancient works and sold them without letting anyone publicize it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, Mr. Daqian called this kind of rubbing paper &quot;oil-based paper&quot;, which is indeed not random, because the original name of the paper is oil-based paper; Chang Shana called it &quot;copy paper&quot;, which comes from the English transliteration of oil-based paper. The function of paper is the same as that of &quot;copy paper&quot; in the West, so it is confused and misnamed without careful study. Oil paper is a traditional paper product in China. It is made of bamboo paper dipped in tung oil. It has been used since the early Qing Dynasty at the latest. As for Yang&#39;s book, it is said to be &quot;deep beige&quot;, but the oil paper used by the author&#39;s eyes is like a silkworm cocoon and has a slightly light yellow color. This is probably because what Yang saw is ancient calligraphy and painting, and the color has become darker over time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 08:25:26 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[努力模仿上层生活：中产窘迫之源]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258646]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;There are often many &quot;middle-class Versailles&quot; on Chinese social media, for example, for houses, cars, houses in school districts and vacations cost anxiety. In fact, this is a common problem among the middle class in various countries. Let’s analyze the lifestyle and spiritual feelings of the middle class in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Europe and the United States, the middle-class life seems to be very good. They can vacation overseas, live in a house with a garden, and build a swimming pool. In the United States, companies purchase commercial insurance for their employees. Even if there are elderly people or children at home, the burden is not large. Life in the American middle class seems easy and comfortable. However, this may not be the case. On Buzzfeed, an American news aggregation website, an American netizen summarized &quot;what is the middle class&quot;, defining it as a life experience unique to the middle class that neither the rich nor the poor understand. The experience was not that great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen summed it up like this: The middle class in the United States can take a vacation, but they need to be careful with their budgets, while the rich do not need to be careful with their budgets, and the poor do not take vacations; the middle class can buy a house, but they are struggling with what kind of house to buy and the loan, while the rich In many houses, poor people don&#39;t think about this at all; the middle class has double garages, but one of them is full of messy things and can only park one car, while the rich have large garages and storage rooms, and the poor have fewer cars and less stuff. ; The middle class has a lawn, but they need to mow it themselves, while the rich hire a gardener, and the poor have no lawn; the middle class goes to Costco to kill time and buy a large cart, but the rich are not interested in shopping at this level, and the poor cannot afford to go; Children have to bear heavy college loans, and the children of the rich have their parents to pay, and the poor can apply for various subsidies; middle-class families have various facilities, but they have to buy a complete set of tools to repair them themselves, because labor costs are very high in the United States, and the rich It doesn&#39;t hurt to hire someone to fix it, but the poor can&#39;t afford so much equipment...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, this netizen said three words: enough is enough. In fact, to a certain extent, the embarrassment of the American middle class is inevitable. Since we are middle class, we must be caught in the middle, neither above nor below. Compared with the lower class, it is more than enough. The middle class has got rid of material poverty and lives a relatively prosperous life. However, compared with the upper class, their abilities are limited, their desires are hard to satisfy, and they cannot take it easy like the truly wealthy class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of the times has deepened this feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the information technology revolution, although all classes of society lived on the same land, they were isolated from each other to some extent. Although the lower and middle classes also know about the life of the upper class, they only have a superficial understanding of it. The means of communication are only hearing and writing. Therefore, there is such a ridiculous cross-class imagination that &quot;the poles used by emperors and empresses to carry water are all made of gold.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the advent of movies and television, the lower class’s understanding of the life of the upper class has deepened. In the era of social media, this barrier has been completely broken by smartphones, Douyin, TikTok, and Twitter. Videos, live broadcasts, and real interactions all make cross-class showing off direct and intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People’s desire to consume is often influenced by the scenes they see on social media, movies, and friends circles. Those who exert influence are of course high-income people, and the goods they consume are regarded as symbols of &quot;accessible happiness.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This influence is dragging the middle class with their desire for a higher level of consumption. The middle class strives to imitate the lifestyle of the upper class, from clothing and diet to hobbies. The middle class can grit their teeth and save money to achieve expensive purchases such as pianos, horse riding, mountain climbing, and studying abroad. At the same time, this has also become a source of pain for the middle class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is that the middle class feels more tax pain. The famous politician Benjamin Franklin once said a famous saying: &quot;In this world, the only things that cannot be escaped are death and taxes.&quot; For the poor, although they also have to pay taxes, such as consumption tax when shopping, but The welfare received by the poor is greater, and the net welfare received by the poor is greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the rich, it is first of all more difficult for the state to collect taxes from them. There are many ways for rich people to avoid taxes, such as donating to charitable funds they set up and putting consumption into company costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, U.S. President George H.W. Bush signed a new law: levying taxes on high-end cars over $30,000, yachts over $100,000, valuable furs over $100,000, and private jets over $250,000. 10% &quot;luxury tax&quot;. The purpose of the luxury tax is to allow the rich to pay 10% more when buying a yacht, and the increased fiscal revenue can be used to help the poor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although the wealthy can afford the 10% tax, their purchases are very flexible: they can buy yachts abroad and then bring them back to the United States as second-hand yachts. Moreover, they can no longer buy yachts, but take vacations, buy luxury watches and diamonds. But the yacht industry is not that flexible. It is impossible to switch to other products in the short term, and it is impossible for workers in the yacht industry to change jobs in the short term. As a result, taxes from the wealthy were not collected, but the U.S. yacht industry was severely damaged, causing industrial workers to lose their jobs. In 1993, President George H.W. Bush repealed the luxury tax on yachts, private jets and furs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, most of the middle class are engaged in mental work or manual work with basic skills, and mainly rely on wages and salaries to make a living. This makes their taxes easy to collect and easy to check. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, although the rich are richer and the absolute amount of tax burden borne by a single individual is higher, the number of rich people is very small. Therefore, for the country, the middle class is the largest tax base. A country&#39;s expenditures are all borne by the middle class, and the benefits the middle class receive are far less than the taxes they pay. More taxes are paid to support the poor and the state&#39;s expenses, which means that the consumption of the middle class is less than their own labor income. This also forms part of the source of pain for the middle class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The drag on consumption and the pain and burden of taxes will all lead to one result, which is the embarrassment of the middle class, thereby suppressing the fertility rate of the middle class. Of course, overall, the middle class invests more in education than the bottom class, and the quality of their offspring is also higher. From this perspective, making the life of the middle class easier is also a blessing for the country’s future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外国游客飞无人机撞坏安阳文峰塔？当地称确有碰撞正了解详情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258682]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens claimed that “several Korean men were operating drones to photograph Wenfeng Temple in Tianning Temple, Anyang, Henan Wenfeng Tower was destroyed by a drone when the tower was being destroyed.&quot; On October 16, Anyang Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau responded to Nandu reporters saying that a drone did indeed collide with Wenfeng Tower, and the specific situation is still being understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/0e27823c9e8a08f33ef86bc33f78928f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1234&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/0e27823c9e8a08f33ef86bc33f78928f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254147&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Netizen posts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 15, some netizens posted, “Several Korean men operated drones to photograph the Wenfeng Pagoda of Tianning Temple in Anyang, Henan.

He is 53 years old and has been in prison for nearly thirty years. In the past ten years, lawyers have repeatedly applied for him to have his sentence commuted or even released from prison, but each time he was rejected. From November 4, 1995 to the present, many extreme things have passed away, and the title of &quot;the most dangerous person&quot; in Israel still belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amir fired three shots with a semi-automatic pistol, staining Prime Minister Rabin&#39;s blood red that day. At that time, Rabin attended a rally in Tel Aviv&#39;s Kings Square. After speaking, he was about to get into his car when he was shot twice and his bodyguard was also wounded. After Rabin&#39;s death, King&#39;s Square was renamed Isaac Rabin Square. Even now when I walk there, I still have a strange feeling: not because I am immersed in sadness, but because of the monument in the square commemorating Rabin. The sculpture looks so strange: it looks like a pyramid frame composed of three huge triangular wooden fences, with the tip pointed to the ground, and it is all rusty red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/jimLNhy65dBQ1iOPFmsQ6dymlgNkafRUoqioRDOS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/jimLNhy65dBQ1iOPFmsQ6dymlgNkafRUoqioRDOS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254180&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Orthodox Jewish ghettos are often messy and quiet, but this is where the hearts of the fanatical believers belong. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Ye Tui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously from 1993 to 1995, Amir completed his compulsory military service and was among the best in Israel. He studied law and computers at Bar-Ilan University. During this period, Israel, under the leadership of Prime Minister Rabin, negotiated peace with Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and signed the Oslo Accords. The conciliatory gesture angered the country&#39;s extreme right wing. Amir and his brother were both extreme right wingers and conspired to kill Rabin. In 1996, Amir was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the bodyguard who was injured outside was sentenced to six years. His brother Haggai was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the arrival of the new century, the left-wing parties led by Rabin and Shimon Peres gradually declined. The right-wing has long occupied the leadership position in Israeli politics, but Amir has never been released from prison. However, after 2003, a Russian-Jewish woman named Larisa Trumpovler kept visiting him in prison. The two got married in 2005, and two years later, they got the child of love through in vitro fertilization, named Yi Nong. Amir has never been released from prison, and their union and offspring were all carried out with approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, when Larissa first started dating Amir, a 77-year-old man named Herz Frank followed her with a camera. Frank is a Jewish citizen who immigrated to Israel from Latvia in 1993. When Larissa appeared, he seemed to realize that the thing he most wanted to do in life had appeared. He wanted to find out about Amir, the man everyone talked about. How did the perverted and terrifying prisoner come to associate with Larissa? What’s more, I want to know what motivation Larissa had to plunge into a hair-raising and absurd love, waiting for someone who would be impossible to return to freedom under normal circumstances. man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an absolutely public personal act, and he also obtained the permission of Larissa and other relevant personnel. Ten years later, Herz Frank died. His Russian friend Kravchenko obtained the video materials he shot and spent another two years making a documentary called &quot;Beyond Fear (&lt;span style=) &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or &quot;Beyond the Fear&quot;, Beyond the Fear&lt;/span>;)》. The film is dedicated to Herz Frank, and it mainly presents his shooting experience. He also appears in more places than Amir and Larissa, but the killer Amir’s sinister expression is impossible for viewers to miss. , which is also the &quot;selling point&quot; of the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of this content is information that can be searched and compiled, including the public opinion disputes that arose when the film was released. Amir is still in solitary confinement and is prohibited from using communication tools. His brother had some conciliatory words after his release from prison, but Larissa and the rest of Amir&#39;s family have always refused to apologize for his actions. They just hate Rabin and the &quot;Oslo System&quot;, but now that Amir has become a father, Larissa has pushed this love story as far as they can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/7C448riAw5rqKRk8qb6rrQXDepLwLDqaIOApjuEO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/7C448riAw5rqKRk8qb6rrQXDepLwLDqaIOApjuEO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254186&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Igor Amir&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rabin His death was a huge wound for Israel. He was deeply loved by the people of Israel. He was self-denial and devoted to public service throughout his life. After his death, he had only a meager birth. Israel has designated November 14th as the anniversary of Rabin’s assassination. Every year on this day, the Labor Party led by Rabin organizes an organization to commemorate him. The crowds at rallies always look back on the past and express their sorrow with silent solemnity. Every year passes. , the speeches of the labor leaders became increasingly concise, no longer talking about the original details in detail, saying only that &quot;we are proud to be members of Rabin&#39;s party&quot; and &quot;we will continue to fight to bring the country on the road to peaceful dialogue.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The left has been in a slump. Even if no one dares to take the initiative to release Amir, right-wing parties have always controlled the political situation and used their tough external voices to prevent people from having any illusions about peace again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more things, things that are more important than the ins and outs of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that anyone can say a few words about, are being ignored. It’s a feeling of exhaustion from thinking and feeling. Every Israeli citizen who looks healthy and sunny is fighting some shadows; every young parent will shrink his smile when thinking about his children having to serve in the compulsory military service in the future; every young and handsome man who looks like he blends in with the tourists The soldiers all have a lot to tell about being attacked, bombed, and killed in action. The relationship between security and danger is not just an opponent, but a neighbor. This seemed to be a foregone conclusion when the Israeli army retook Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank and Gaza through the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;. A poem by Yehuda Amichai best expresses this tension:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;In the old days On the roof of a house in the city&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The washed clothes are hung to dry in the afternoon sun:&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The white sheets of a woman who is my enemy,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Used by a man who is my enemy&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A towel wiping the sweat off his forehead.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who are &quot;enemies of me&quot; all lead normal lives. The peaceful forces have always emphasized this and have always wanted people to realize this, but the main militant faction has used the opposite narrative: Those who live a normal life are always hostile to me. In Israel, there is a stone erected on the roadside. The Hebrew words on it are about an explosion on a certain day of a certain year. You will know when you see several candle niches on a wall and long-withered garlands on the ground. A shocking and horrific incident occurred there. If there were toys, it would indicate that there were children among the dead. Not to mention that there are various memorial facilities related to the Nazi Holocaust of the last century. Some of them are just a photo wall or a name wall, which you will encounter if you are not paying attention. After various encounters, you will feel that such a small country accommodates too much sadness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Israelis will tell you that the worst enemies come from within ourselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/afLJyhAYjNC7hOz4xJjxGWeAIgiG06N4wISvluJe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/afLJyhAYjNC7hOz4xJjxGWeAIgiG06N4wISvluJe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254178&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This is a sculpture commemorating a group of Israeli soldiers who were killed in a suicide attack.

In Rabin Square, people can walk casually under the big triangle and pass through the shadows cast by the frames on the ground on a sunny day. Some children who are good at climbing on the fence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to see the meaning of this sculpture at a glance, and there is no unified explanation. Just as people&#39;s views, opinions, and attitudes towards Rabin&#39;s death are too diverse to form any natural consensus. Rabin is a good man, and in a 2006 national opinion poll in Israel, he was more revered than founding father David Ben-Gurion and topped the list of &quot;most beloved Israeli Jews.&quot; He was also an outstanding soldier. As Chief of Staff of the National Defense Forces, he played a major role in the victory of the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; in 1967. He was also an excellent diplomat. After the war, he proposed to the then Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to be the ambassador to the United States. Eshkol thought he had heard wrongly. The prime minister was famous for his humor and he was very fond of Latin America. Bing said: &quot;What? You say you want to stand in those long cocktail parties and sit in those annoying banquets? Are you willing to play those boring diplomatic games that diplomats have to play?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/Le2uKYuHBFYILdHnzB4LJIt3l47LY65pcSUupYrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot; 628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/Le2uKYuHBFYILdHnzB4LJIt3l47LY65pcSUupYrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254187&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rabbin in his youth&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Rabin wanted to What&#39;s more, the heightened hostility in the Arab world after the disastrous defeat of the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; will inevitably make Israel face a greater threat. The world was split in half during the Cold War. The Soviet Union stood behind the Arab countries. During the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;, Syria, Egypt and Jordan all relied on Soviet arms. So whose support should Israel seek? Of course it&#39;s the United States. Eshkol knew very well that Rabin, who never spoke any official language, became an ambassador for the benefit of the country. After Nixon won the election, Rabin often traveled with the newly appointed Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and became a celebrity in the White House. Not only that, as a core figure of the left-wing Labor Party, he also told his political opponent, the right-wing leader May Nachem Begin said how important diplomacy is to the country: When I do diplomatic work, I must use the adversarial relationship between the Democratic and Republican parties to promote Israel&#39;s interests, otherwise I might as well pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/UXp8jodD1S9kyotAeIxrHrNcnEY2xwon3rPshyRM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;528&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/UXp8jodD1S9kyotAeIxrHrNcnEY2xwon3rPshyRM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254183&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rabin and Clinton&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The close relationship between the United States and Israel It goes without saying how important connections are to Israel. However, after the 1986 Palestinian uprising known as the first &quot;Intifada&quot; in history, Rabin gradually realized that when the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; enabled the country to take over the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, it also took away these lands. The 1.7 million Palestinians brought in together. What to do with these people? What are their identities? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Rabin was the defense minister. He convened a group of left-wing writers and poets to learn about the situation of the Palestinians. Among these literati are Oz, AB Yehoshua, and David Grossman. They all believe that blindly ignoring the existence of Palestinians will make the country never have peace. Yehoshua often said with pride afterwards: No head of state would consult a writer on national policy. Rabin joked many times: Every Israeli is teaching me how to be prime minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/6qkFnYgSHnL33IplsswbR2zIJ9r6HOxvf74VIXTv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; height= &quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/6qkFnYgSHnL33IplsswbR2zIJ9r6HOxvf74VIXTv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254185&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Grossman, AB Yehoshua, and Amos Oz are the iron triangle of Israeli left-wing writers. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then to the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1994, Rabin firmly transformed from a war hero Transformed into a peacemaker. In August 1993, Rabin stood side by side with Arafat at the White House and delivered a famous speech entitled &quot;Enough Blood and Tears, Enough.&quot; After that, the management power of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was considered to be Officially handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Looking back at that time, people may think that &quot;land for peace&quot; was indeed the aspiration of the people in Israel at that time, but in fact, from the conclusion of the Oslo Accords to November 4, 1995, the Israelis were completely divided and targeted Protests and petitions against Rabin and the peace agreement continue one after another, month after month; even a bystander who knows nothing about Middle East affairs and only subconsciously agrees with &quot;peace&quot; will realize that this country Something serious has gone wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every anti-Rabin person regards himself as the master of the country, and what he says is usually intellectual. Those far-right Jews who have occupied a settlement in the desolate West Bank are only &quot;abominable&quot; and &quot;unreasonable&quot; in the eyes of rational people, but they are not &quot;ignorant&quot;. Everyone has knowledge and can defend their position eloquently. If a person holds a Bible in his hand and talks about the relationship between the Jewish nation and this land for three thousand years, you will definitely feel that he is very knowledgeable. On the other hand, another person, such as Shlomo Sander, the author of the &quot;Fictional Trilogy&quot; and a professor at Tel Aviv University, opened his mouth to refute the various narratives accumulated around the &quot;Holy Land&quot; and argue that &quot;Semiticism&quot; His origins and debunking the myths created by Zionism in the past hundred years, you will definitely be convinced by him, and perhaps deeply moved by his courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The atmosphere of debate can be seen everywhere and can be felt since childhood. Children who grow up here learn early on that politics is not a &quot;meat-eater&#39;s plan&quot; but an urgent matter, and any stone with something written on it is a reminder to people to think about something. A person&#39;s habit of having an opinion on everything stems not only from the spiritual tradition accumulated by ancient scriptures and scripture interpretations, but also due to the &quot;oppression&quot; of the public opinion atmosphere. A person must not only form and demonstrate his own position, but also try to refute it. Seemingly profound philosophical creeds such as &quot;the opposite is the movement of the Tao&quot; are often just common sense in practice here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, politics is not a mental exercise. It requires people to take a stand. As a result of the peace talks and agreements, the atmosphere of hostility suddenly escalated. The official order to withdraw from the occupied territories ignited the hatred of the Jewish settlers there towards the Palestinians, and also made them full of anger towards the Israeli soldiers who came to dismantle the settlements. The confrontation between Israeli military police and black-robed Jews produced many photos that can be recorded in the history of photojournalism. They not only showed the extreme anger of extreme fanatics, but also engraved the internal divisions of a country where everyone is patriotic. Martin Gilbert tells the story of the first extreme suicide attack after the Oslo Accords in &quot;History of Israel&quot;: On January 22, 1995, 20 Israeli soldiers were killed in a series of explosions near Netanya. Die, that&#39;s the work of jihadist groups - no party seems to be satisfied with &quot;peace,&quot; and dissatisfaction can easily escalate into violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/wdrHPnQ4Es3D5ekZcrkLTFrrTnWRCxIm3GY0O4fk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/wdrHPnQ4Es3D5ekZcrkLTFrrTnWRCxIm3GY0O4fk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254182&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Common expressions of Palestinian boys in the West Bank. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rabin used countless speeches to convince the people of the need for peace, but for the warring faction , the peace faction is always surrendering, ruining the future of the nation, and all the contributions Rabin has made to the country in the past can be wiped out. Does he understand this? Did he have a premonition that he was shot minutes after his last speech? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I feel more and more that Rabin’s death was a self-sacrifice: he had been willing to go among the people all his life, not guarding against the crowds surrounding him, and facing them with his shy and blushing face. Eyes of love or hatred. He probably understood that only his own blood could temporarily appease the excited emotions of all parties and interrupt the peace project he was trying to create, perhaps based on fantasy. He must use his own ending to serve as a warning to future generations: He would rather fight to the death with foreign enemies, and would rather spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build the most technologically advanced national defense system, than do so within the country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To be precise, it is to cultivate enemies within the Jewish people&lt;/span>;) and stimulate those who have different political views to take action with weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xERYwpe2Vyv2xIHNBNTzU1IARVmlxPt8S1bA31Xu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xERYwpe2Vyv2xIHNBNTzU1IARVmlxPt8S1bA31Xu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254181&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the Old City of Jerusalem, you can see many people who do not seem to belong to the &quot;Jewish state&quot; of Israel.

These past events seem to have been turned over, and salvaging them is also the work of some writers and researchers who believe in humanitarianism. In particular, the pain they caused at that time was not universal. For many French and Russians, Tragic things are far beyond one&#39;s perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in Israel, where the space is small, and in the ancient city where the enemy is drying laundry opposite one&#39;s home, nothing will really turn the page; events are always current events, not a repeat or replica of what happened back then. Prepared for it: prepared for calm to enter the bomb shelter, prepared for sadness at the news of the killings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shlomo Sander once told me that the direct impetus for him to write &quot;The Fictional Jewish Nation&quot; was his sympathy for the situation of Palestinian students who were struggling in this country. Lack of &quot;at home&quot;; Sander deeply understands their pain. In this book, he demonstrates that the Palestinians who were driven out at that time are the true descendants of the ancient Israelites in the &quot;biblical era&quot;. He also said that the apartment where his home is located was a Palestinian village before the establishment of the state of Israel and had its own Arabic name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course Sander will not take the lead in exiting his own house. He was just doing what a scholar should do. Although he has endured attacks, reviles and even life threats from his enemies on the right, Sander is not alone. In Israel, he and others of all stripes continued to think, write, and publish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Democracy is also the biggest concession that Israel has made for its &quot;occupied&quot; land. In other &quot;one land, two peoples&quot; cases, horrific ethnic cleansing has occurred, but not in Israel; despite Zygmunt Bauman&#39;s sneer that there can be no enlightenment as long as there is occupation, Israel has sent troops in the past When suppressing Palestinian unrest, tanks were never fired at surrounding crowds. Tragedies have occurred when countries such as Syria, Jordan, and Algeria suppressed rebellions. Making this kind of comparison now feels a bit &quot;excessive&quot;, but it is also different now than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/gsKDXkKztV2yZeInYf2wcWViMJqrQwJTyj2qg6BN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/gsKDXkKztV2yZeInYf2wcWViMJqrQwJTyj2qg6BN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254179&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Israeli mother and child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a &quot; The &quot;Impossible Triangle&quot; stands at the center of Israeli politics, with its three corners being land, security and democracy. Israel has wanted all three since 1967, but in fact it can only get two: if it wants land and democracy, it means sacrificing security; if it wants democracy and security, it must give up land; if it wants security and land, it Democracy must be abandoned, that is, the civil rights of non-Jewish people in the current population must be denied, and all voices of internal and external dissatisfaction must be silenced. This triangle can be used to explain the strange sculpture commemorating Prime Minister Rabin: Rabin decided to give up the land for the sake of security and democracy, and died here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let people freely &quot;pass&quot; the unstable inverted triangle and feel its meaning. This design also reflects the principle of democracy. When talking about Rabin with older Israelis, they will all say, &quot;He is a tragedy.&quot; But what kind of tragedy it is, and what is right and wrong, they won&#39;t say. It’s not that they dare not say it, but that they have long accepted all arguments about it. This is their way of understanding the tragedy and then moving on. Life is about &quot;passing&quot; every event and moment to form your own experience and your own thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/f9hLCsRfEcEHcR5MnF9SN7OzMZm8pEOG4l3ek3bW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/f9hLCsRfEcEHcR5MnF9SN7OzMZm8pEOG4l3ek3bW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254184&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Karavan&#39;s work &quot;The Road to Peace&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The sculptor Dani Karavan, who died two years ago, created many profound works in Israel’s deserts, cities and borders.

In 2016, at the screening of Qin Xiaoyue&#39;s first film &quot;The World and Me&quot;, Fang Junrui stayed until the end, blushing and stammering, telling Qin Xiaoyue that he wanted to restore cultural relics, but reality did not allow it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at this peer who was a bit socially anxious and stuttered, Qin Xiaoyue noticed that there was a strong dramatic tension in his expression. Fang Junrui said that doing cultural relic restoration work requires a certain financial foundation. He feels that his family&#39;s conditions are not enough to support him, but at the same time, he is also very proud that his family has a house next to Jing&#39;an Temple in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue and the photographer entered the family with cameras. It was a 30-square-meter husband&#39;s house, where Jun Rui, born in 1985, lived with his parents, who were over 70 years old. The largest room is the living room, which is also Fang Junrui&#39;s bedroom. It has a bed, a dining table, and a recliner for his father to watch TV. Fang Junrui kept buying books on art, religion, and literature, filling the gaps in the furniture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/nLfPZpNxPpSyvbnEnr1Z1qlv5M4Kk9o9uWXdqP95.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height= &quot;1346&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/nLfPZpNxPpSyvbnEnr1Z1qlv5M4Kk9o9uWXdqP95.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254135&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Differences in concepts and dependence in life are the daily life of Fang Junrui (middle) and his parents. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui was deeply influenced by his father who loved calligraphy and painting. When he was in college, he chose cultural relics. Professional restoration. After graduation, the father and son discovered that this was an industry that required high academic qualifications and strong financial support. In the two years after graduating in 2014, Fang Junrui not only failed to find a suitable job, but none of the other jobs he found lasted more than three months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Father continued to support Fang Junrui, helped him pay the high tuition fees, and signed up for a master class in cultural relic restoration. Fang Junrui took it intermittently and also repaired a bowl, but he never finished it. Constantly hitting the wall swallowed up Fang Junrui&#39;s hope. He fell into depression and melancholy, indulged in pure fantasy, and lived a life that was reversed day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui’s father did not live the life he wanted when he was young. He liked painting, but failed to make it a career; he wrote good poems and articles, but he was depressed for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue originally planned to film the mental journey of a boy who loves the restoration of cultural relics. But as soon as she stepped into their home, she felt that this expectation was completely disappointed. The camera was like a match, igniting the conflicts they had suppressed for many years. In the first few shoots, apart from quarrels, there was almost nothing captured. The direction of the film has completely changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a post-screening talk in Guangzhou on September 16, 2023, an audience member asked about the reason for the naming of &quot;The Nest&quot;. In his understanding, &quot;The Nest&quot; is closer to people&#39;s imagination of a beautiful family, but The film shows a trapped family, which reminded him of a &quot;cage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The nest is not only the feeling of a very warm family, but also the feeling of always living under the wings of the parents, and the expectation that he will always fantasize about when he can leave the nest.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue responded. , &quot;His spiritual world is also a nest. He used these books to build a nest for his spiritual world, which is in great contrast with the nest in the real world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xmmNdStZYSWXd9bozcBbEz9YRx1Qq9If6NXgrhGy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xmmNdStZYSWXd9bozcBbEz9YRx1Qq9If6NXgrhGy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254133&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Thirty Fang Junrui, who is many years old, lives with his parents, who are over 70 years old, in an old house of 30 square meters. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, has been investigating the intergenerational dynamics of Chinese society for more than ten years Regarding relationship issues, in her opinion, &quot;The Nest&quot; shows typical family intergenerational relationships during the transition period: &quot;Although parents are very unhappy, in fact, the children in this structure are also very unhappy. The reason why everyone resonates is Because the film reflects the current common dilemma of young people growing up, they all feel that they have a strong pursuit of self-realization but are powerless. From a sociological perspective, this phenomenon is a phenomenon unique to us when modernization and social development have reached a certain stage. The result of the intergenerational solidarity culture of familism and the culture of parent-child integration.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Triangle&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When photographing this family, Qin Xiao wanted to explore more and more, the people living under the same roof Although they clearly hurt and tortured each other, what allowed them to continue living together. In an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, she revealed her answer: &quot;Maybe they have very little and only have each other. If they throw away even this, they will have nothing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three of them rarely go out. When traveling, your social circle is also narrow. Except for the occasional visit by her mother to visit relatives, most of the time they spend all day in each other&#39;s home. Qin Xiaoyue described this family as a &quot;stable triangular structure&quot;, &quot;everyone is dependent and tortured.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The negative attitude common in East Asian families is passed down from generation to generation. Fang Junrui&#39;s grandfather was imprisoned for offending a prison guard when he was young, and his father looked down upon him very much. During the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, his father encountered the &quot;Going to the Countryside Movement&quot; and needed to go to the frontier. As soon as the mobilization people came, he ran away, forming a Fang Junrui also looked down on his father because of his evasive and fearful temperament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father often communicated with Fang Junrui in a suppressive way. When Fang Junrui complained that he could not find his ideal job, his father would say that he had suffered so many injustices and the conditions were so difficult, but he still came through and still insisted on painting. He accused his son of not working hard and only sleeping all day long. , don’t fight for it. Fang Junrui talked about his reading scope and said that sculpture is also one of the areas of interest. His father started by saying: &quot;Sculpture? Do you know sculpture? What do you know?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This made Fang Junrui in The already cramped home made him feel even more suffocated. He collapsed several times in front of the camera and even threatened to commit suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at the same time, the care in life is meticulous. Every month, Fang Junrui can get 3,000 yuan from his father. When he needs it, food and clean towels will always be handed to him. When the unpacked books are thrown on the ground, someone will help pick them up. Despite the suffering, Fang Junrui never chose to leave his parents and live alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After watching &quot;The Nest&quot;, someone shared his understanding with Qin Xiaoyue: The father has never had a sense of presence in society, so he has to make up for it in educating his son. He tried to set rules for the cat he adopted at home, but the cat was not tamed after being beaten, and continued to pace calmly around the dinner table. Fang Junrui is also &quot;immune&quot; to his father&#39;s advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the camera, the mother does not have as strong a desire to express herself as the father and son. Most of the time, she silently takes care of the housework. The adopted cats came and went, and while the mother fed them food, she lovingly called each one by the name she had given them. &quot;It seems that my mother has always been a person with infinite care, but she actually swallowed her grievances most of the time.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue remembered that later in the filming, perhaps because of the camera, Fang Junrui&#39;s mother confided all her grievances He came out and pointed at the camera, &quot;Let them judge.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui&#39;s mother angrily told her father and son that she wanted to leave them and travel by herself, but in the end she fell back on &quot;If you don&#39;t go, I won&#39;t go.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/oHoWXRS2kU0yhyYIHBRaK0XY0aGSqqpoY0EefXS1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height= &quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/oHoWXRS2kU0yhyYIHBRaK0XY0aGSqqpoY0EefXS1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254132&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Junrui’s mother. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, Fang Junrui’s mother revealed a past incident. Fang Junrui went to junior high school. I once asked to raise a puppy, but my father didn&#39;t agree. She believes that since this incident, her originally bright son &quot;has lost his mind and has become broken.&quot; The two of them, both in their 40s, had a son at an old age, and they doted on Fang Junrui, especially their father, who almost always responded to his requests since childhood. Qin Xiaoyue guessed that Fang Junrui was not satisfied in this matter, could not consider the problem from other people&#39;s point of view, could not accept his father&#39;s rejection, and his temper may have become paranoid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue has a younger brother who is more than ten years younger than her and is also loved by her parents. She sometimes uses this to warn her parents. &quot;But I think from the perspective of parents, sometimes there seems to be nothing they can do. They are just manipulated by their children. When you care too much about someone, it is difficult for you to control it, and your life will become more and more out of control. A point that cannot be resolved, and then they are together in pain.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The appearance of the camera allowed the family to burst out their long-pent-up emotions, and also exposed that the parents have completely different views on educating their sons. Attitude. The father also wanted to use the camera to help his son wake up and change, but the mother thought that it was useless to talk to him, and stimulating him in front of the camera would only make him more confused. At the end of the documentary, the mother said that selling the old house would be enough for her son to live on for a lifetime. The parents&#39; attitudes towards Fang Junrui were like two winds blowing in opposite directions, canceling each other out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Fang Junrui quit his security job, he went for air testing. The mother muttered to the father: &quot;Do you have to stand all the time for air testing? It will be very hard.&quot; The father said bluntly: &quot;You are so strange. At the same time, you are worried that he will not be able to endure hardship, and now you are afraid that he will endure hardship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;He is very adaptable in such an environment. He just does his own thing, and someone takes care of him every day. About whether he is awake, the meaning of life, and the motivation of life, such high-level talk falls back to everyone. The day&#39;s schedule still consists of eating wontons, cooking, and three meals a day.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering that Fang Junrui might get married in the future, the two elders bought an affordable house in Jiading, far away from the city center. Not long ago, they just moved Fang Junrui&#39;s books to their new house. Qin Xiaoyue hopes to take footage of Fang Junrui or his parents moving out of the old house in the future, which means that there is a high possibility of a breakthrough in the family&#39;s stable structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Two generations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Fang family’s ancestors had a prosperous past. During the Republic of China, Fang Junrui’s great-grandfathers moved to Shanghai, opened a rickshaw company, worked as compradors, and lived a prosperous life. A life that is the envy of others. When the Japanese invaded Shanghai, their family fled from Hongkou to the banks of the Suzhou River. They experienced ups and downs in the turbulent times, and by Fang Junrui&#39;s father&#39;s generation, they were completely in decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In stark contrast to the cramped and gray physical space, is the family’s spiritual world. His father loved painting and could write modern poetry, and his mother also read traditional vertical poetry. Fang Junrui was influenced by his ears and eyes, and inherited his interest in literature, history and art. When Fang Junrui took the college entrance examination, it was his father who first discovered &quot;cultural relic restoration&quot; while applying for the major. He spent his monthly salary and the money given by his father to buy books, and talked about Catholic culture and art with his fellow believers in a clear and logical manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Qin Xiaoyue&#39;s view, the fates of Fang Junrui and his father are &quot;very similar and parallel.&quot; Fang’s father liked painting since he was a child, but he did not have the opportunity to engage in related work. For twenty years, he worked as a waiter in public bathrooms. However, he never gave up this hobby. He would draw at home when he had time. When talents could flow, he switched jobs to work as an artist in a hospital. His main job was to publish blackboard newspapers. He waited until he was allocated a house at the age of 40 before he began to consider getting married and having children. He often says similar words: &quot;How many people can really live an ideal life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike his parents&#39; generation who could just take things as they come, Fang Junrui made no secret of the fact that he &quot;wasn&#39;t born with the right luck.&quot; With a sense of &quot;time&quot;, he found a place to blame for his rough life, imagining that if he had good material conditions, he could engage in restoration of cultural relics, get married and have children smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my father’s view, if there are no conditions or a house, how can we have friends or get married? Fang Junrui believes that having a house to live in and being able to get married are basic needs that everyone should realize. &quot;Can only rich people get married?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/4pw8RKm9m8gWpUK751TTxThDO734K3g89DSUOZRg.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/4pw8RKm9m8gWpUK751TTxThDO734K3g89DSUOZRg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254134&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Junrui (right) and his father (left) argue about personal experiences. Stills from the documentary &quot;The Nest&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Picture provided by the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong analyzed: &quot;My father and he have similar personal ideals, and they are very concerned about career, aesthetics, and There are similarities in the pursuit of art, but because they grew up in different stages of social development, they chose different paths in life. The father put survival first, but the son did not compromise on the path of self-realization and ideal pursuit. They are giants The conflict is the common characteristic of those disunited and disharmonious &#39;cheating&#39; families - the values ​​cannot match, and the instrumental support of the two generations becomes emotional binding and moral kidnapping.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The father and son suffered similar fates at the same age - due to various reasons, they were unable to live their ideal lives. But instead of cherishing each other, the two built high walls. Fang&#39;s father inspired Fang Junrui with his own life experience. The latter did not accept this trick at all and felt that it was nothing special. In the eyes of Fang&#39;s father, Fang Junrui is completely unable to take care of himself, and the restoration of cultural relics is just empty talk with high ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue pointed out that the turbulent times that Fang’s father experienced had destroyed his outlook on life, his feelings about life, and his entire inner order. This resulted in almost all of his cognitions and expressions being passive and conservative. Fang Junrui, like many of his contemporaries, &quot;has not experienced any great pain. He has witnessed the most rapid development stage of the motherland, and has been influenced by many foreign cultures. He has more opportunities and sees more possibilities.&quot; , not very good at setting limits for myself.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest difference between Fang Junrui and his parents is that the latter&#39;s living situation is that the whole family has no food if they don&#39;t work, while the former has enough food and clothing, and works more for self-realization. When Fang Junrui&#39;s ambitions could not be put into practice in society, he was neither willing nor able to immerse himself in survival and accept a mediocre and trivial life like his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quality of life of those born in the 1980s and 1990s is much higher than that of their parents’ generation. This is the core change in the growth environment of the two generations and the source of intergenerational conflict. Similar to Fang Junrui and his parents, the gap and cognitive differences between generations are common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Communication is very important. When communication is not in place, this situation may occur in their family. It feels like they say these words out of love, but these words cannot reach the other person&#39;s heart at all. The relationship is there.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue also suffered from the rejection of his parents. At that time, she returned from studying abroad, traveled around China by train, and started making documentaries. In the parents&#39; minds, after their daughter has tried what she wants to do, she should honestly find a class, preferably a TV station or a newspaper, where she will be stable and respectable. Unexpectedly, after Qin Xiaoyue worked on &quot;The Nest&quot; for five or six years, they couldn&#39;t figure out why their daughter &quot;jumped into a bigger pit again.&quot; During post-production, she had a conflict with her parents. Her mother said to her, &quot;If you continue like this, you will become Fang Junrui.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue looks back on this journey. He has earned every support from his family on his own. If there are achievements in this area, it will best dispel their worries. If there are no results yet, he must at least have enthusiasm and action to impress them. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film has been screened in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and other cities. In each scene, Qin Xiaoyue will receive direct resonance from the audience, such as thinking of the way his father speaks, and a friend&#39;s family is similar to it. etc. This is exactly what she hopes for - the audience can stop pointing fingers at the characters and use the film as a mirror to reflect their own problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A bowl&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui never repaired the bowl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the first filming, his father asked him to show the bowl to Qin Xiaoyue and the others, and encouraged him to repair the bowl. Maybe the master thought it was good and would be willing to accept him as a disciple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the second filming, my father &quot;exposed&quot; Fang Junrui in front of the camera - if he really liked the restoration of cultural relics, this bowl would have been repaired long ago. Qin Xiaoyue followed what he said and waited until he repaired the bowl before coming over to take pictures next time. Fang Junrui&#39;s eyes changed and he directly stated that it was impossible to make an inspirational film through him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/GY6u8OiCDlnQ6KS2IMfU1RXi2DpztTHqBwJYdyyX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height= &quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/GY6u8OiCDlnQ6KS2IMfU1RXi2DpztTHqBwJYdyyX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Junrui has not repaired the bowl for a long time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can’t Fang Junrui repair this small bowl? The audience gave a psychological understanding: for him, the bowl is a symbol of the ideal. If he does not practice, the ideal will always exist; if he practices it, he fails to repair it, or after finishing it, he still cannot find anything related to it. work, then his ideals will be shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The filming and production cycle of &quot;The Nest&quot; far exceeded Qin Xiaoyue&#39;s plan. She feels that this film is her bowl. &quot;You really want to do something, and you are very good at doing it, but you have never done it. At this time, you will feel that your life is out of control, and your life path is not what you imagined. It will produce a kind of self-doubt.&quot; In her opinion, the film was made by accident. If it had not been made, she would have been in a very helpless state. &quot;If I were absolutely sure about this, I would not do it. Hurry up. Changing careers may not be so painful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the film won the Best Documentary Award at the Frist Youth Film Festival, it received a lot of attention, including many workers in the field of cultural relic restoration. Qin Xiaoyue suggested that Fang Junrui take this opportunity Repair the bowl to prove his ability to those who care about him. Fang Junrui responded to her, so what if it was repaired, and he had no time at all now. &quot;Actually, work also has weekends. He was completely immersed in negative emotions and couldn&#39;t get out.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entry barrier for cultural relic restoration is high, and graduate school is usually required, with mentors leading the way. After watching the film, Fang Junrui’s college classmates told Qin Xiaoyue that no one among their classmates had entered the field of cultural relic restoration after graduation. Fang Junrui has tried many jobs, including real estate registration, technical worker, hospital security, etc., but it was always difficult to continue due to work ability, interpersonal relationships, personal wishes and other reasons. Struggling with income and housing issues, he couldn&#39;t find a partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong, who grew up in the late 1970s, observed that it is difficult for young people today to be &quot;down to earth&quot;. This change in mentality is closely related to the entire social information environment. “The network and information dissemination are too developed, giving people a strong sense of powerlessness. The people they refer to are always the best people, and they have no way to control the people around them. People and things, including those who are satisfied with themselves, live a very unhappy life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui wanted to live a better life, and imagined that such a life existed in the glorious years of his ancestors. But he couldn&#39;t see that the stagnant life in front of him would be loosened in the short term, and he lost his ability to move. Four or five years passed on the screen, and until the end of the film, almost nothing had been resolved. The bowl had not been repaired, a suitable job had not been found, family relations had not eased, and there had been no love or marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before meeting Fang Junrui, Qin Xiaoyue believed that everyone should live the life they want. He defied her expectations and never became a heroic figure. After struggling for a long time, Qin Xiaoyue accepted this sense of loss and accepted that anyone can be a mediocre person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think what his dad said is right. If you really love something, you will actually try more and won&#39;t give up so easily, but no one can To really empathize with him, for example, it would be unfair for him to say this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She turned to explore the reasons and tried to use documentaries to show part of the answers. The film has been cut one version after another, like answers that are hesitant to speak. The current version involves many issues such as family, destiny, and ideals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe no one can explain it clearly. (The reason) is comprehensive. He has certain personal reasons. For example, he is too fragile and gives up too easily. This has nothing to do with the environment in which he grew up. , family relationships, and social environment. For example, he did not encounter the kind of opportunities to support himself to try this aspect, and there was no well-connected and nurturing atmosphere.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue overturned his initial plan to shoot a Yu Yu The idea of ​​an ideal young man who is frustrated, &quot;These materials are enough to make a short film. But if I make such a film, it seems that I will ignore the more important influence on him in his life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
