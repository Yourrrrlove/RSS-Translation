The Hexi Corridor-Tianshan area is not only located in the north-south dividing zone on the extension line of the Great Wall, but also serves as the east-west passage from the Central Plains to the Western Regions. It is not only the isolation zone that separates the nomadic peoples of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Mongolian Plateau, but also the transition zone between the &quot;Hexi Granary&quot; farming area in Gansu and the nomadic areas in Qinghai. So it is not a line, but a &quot;crossroads&quot; where north-south and east-west cross each other. Historically, on a larger scale, the Central Plains empire and the nomadic peoples confronted, interacted, and constructed each other around elastic borders, forming a &quot;dual system of agriculture and animal husbandry.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2AxxXkUyWxYpZQLp6CWVYr3JONTnePlG8YtOgNSz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2AxxXkUyWxYpZQLp6CWVYr3JONTnePlG8YtOgNSz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;March 2022, Jiayuguan, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/0dFpcu08D0aNI47Ww7cMuGs7iQO0nsmsTgUiADYZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/0dFpcu08D0aNI47Ww7cMuGs7iQO0nsmsTgUiADYZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203980&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;October 2019, Gansu Gaotai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2aSsHvTcfiV1Bsh3qdVHWBZC7wXL5uXnt2OEHBpr.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/22/08/05/2aSsHvTcfiV1Bsh3qdVHWBZC7wXL5uXnt2OEHBpr.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203989&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;March 2020, Jinchang, Gansu&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;The Hexi Corridor I photographed has such a unique objective geographical location and its historical and geographical status is particularly important. area, so the Hexi under the lens is not only a realistic geography, but also a geography with historical participation and influence.

Stills from &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; (2023). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;You can have your own name&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Starting from early September 2023, two films known as meta-movies have appeared in theaters: Liu Jiayin&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot; and Wei Shujun&#39;s &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. Previous theaters in China include Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;One Second&quot;, Dapeng&#39;s &quot;Good Luck&quot;, Malaysia&#39;s Tan Cui Mei&#39;s &quot;Barbarian Invasion&quot;... Wei Shujun&#39;s next film &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is also said to be a meta film. The so-called meta-movies are generally considered to be &quot;movies about movies.&quot; Such films are often full of reflections on film creation and film operating mechanisms. They often have a theoretical flavor that explores film texts. Nowadays, they appear so densely in movie theaters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the age of film maturity. With unlimited communication, high-speed transmission, and rapid and easy access to visual means, the world has become a huge studio. In such an era, the distance between ordinary audiences and meta-movies has been greatly reduced. People are more familiar than ever with how movies work. Although these recently released films still lag behind other commercial films in terms of acceptance, their appearance in theaters can already be discussed as cultural phenomena. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; and &quot;Stories from Yong&#39;an Town&quot; are named meta-movies, they are actually not intentional by the creators. They just filmed their own life and work experiences. out. Since they are all filmmakers, they are all caught up in confusion about movies. When they express their confusion, the movie naturally becomes a meta-movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wonderful thing is that the moment when you express your confusion is also the moment when your confusion is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last film &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; directed by Liu Jiayin was completed in 2009, fourteen years ago. &quot;Cowhide 1&quot; was shortlisted for the Berlin International Film Festival and won an award, and &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; was shortlisted for the Cannes Directors&#39; Fortnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourteen years of &quot;creative blankness&quot; must mean huge pressure for a filmmaker. Moreover, she is teaching at a film school and is surrounded by actors who are engaged in film creation. I often ask her, when will your next film be released? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; expresses this pressure in an implicit way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very unique film. I remember that avant-garde experimental novels in the past sometimes did this - turning all the depression the author felt in life into the depression of the reader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director also knew that this was a risk, but everything was well thought out. The protagonist of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; - Wen Shan, played by Hu Ge, used to be a very unsuccessful screenwriter, and now writes memorial messages for people in a funeral home. He is very serious and responsible for his clients, and often gets into the emotional entanglement between the client and the deceased with a pedantic touch. Understanding the world and writing the right eulogy may be the goodness in his mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Lei plays Xiao Yin, a young man who lives in the same house as Wen Shan. The character is set up to be weird and ethereal. In the second half of the film, the audience suddenly realized that he was a semi-finished product, a movie character that Wen Shan, the screenwriter, had been trying to create for many years. When Wen Shan was hesitant or unsure about his creation, Xiao Yin&#39;s way of existence and sense of existence became vague and uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Yin also kept asking Wen Shan, you must face your situation sincerely! He is Wenshan&#39;s alter ego - which is logical. When Wenshan smokes, he also smokes, but he only has one set of clothes. He always wears the same jacket and hat, and he never grows a beard - this is because Wenshan did not really create him . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wen Shan, who had gone through countless mental struggles, finally confidently said to Xiao Yin one day, &quot;You can have your own name,&quot; I heard a low exclamation burst from the middle of the audience. This low exclamation occurred in the screening hall of Beijing Film Academy, which was the place where I watched this film for the second time. Most of the audience are film students and filmmakers who are engaged in creative work, so they can better understand this relationship. Of course, I believe that those who make a career out of writing will understand the subtleties and thrills involved, and at the same time recall all the hardships they endured while creating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That one movie moment almost brought me to tears. How much training does it take to create a fictional character? This not only requires the talent of the creator, but also other opportunities. A character&#39;s dystocia may come from the creator&#39;s deep mental quagmire for many years. He or she may have lost self-confidence and the courage to express. Sometimes it also comes from external pressure, the industry&#39;s unique norms and access systems, and evaluations. The chaos of the system makes creators lose confidence in creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Journey Worth It&quot; depicts and reflects on a very profound profile of the film creation process, revealing the subtleties of creation. Although the plot of Wen Shan writing a memorial speech takes the longest time to show in this film, what I think is the most touching is the deep affection between Wen Shan and his movie characters that contains fear. This film was able to win the Best Director and Best Actor at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. It seems that the inner world Liu Jiayin implanted in the film was still felt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Worthwhile Journey&quot; shows an area that is not easily perceived and expressed. One detail in the film impressed me deeply: when Wen Shan was working and typing in front of the computer, the inertia of the input method made some unpleasant names often pop up on the screen. These names were the names of characters he had failed to write successfully as a screenwriter. . Although they were not born, these names were often used by Wenshan, and finally the input method remembered them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;In Yongan Town, will nothing happen?&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reflection on the movie in &quot;Yongan Town Stories&quot; focuses more on the interpersonal level , is also more social. Although this film without the participation of top stars may not receive a high box office compared to &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, it does not prevent it from being an equally talented film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film is also autobiographical. The film was inspired by Wei Shujun&#39;s experience filming his second feature film in Hunan three years ago. It is very similar to the plot shown in &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; - in Hunan, the screenwriter and director had a conflict in the script concept. After running in, the final effect was not good, and later the two decided to overturn it and start over. This main plot was transplanted into &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, Wei Shujun&#39;s last film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; (2020) is also a meta film. Both films reflect on the filmmaking process, including the studio ecology, such as filmmakers’ arrogance, chaotic work order, inappropriate power relationships in creation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; discusses the correspondence between film narrative and the real world in more depth than &quot;Wild Horses Part Mane&quot;: How does the movie tell the story of Yong&#39;an Town? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three-part structure of the film, at the beginning of the first part, the documentary director behind the scenes is waiting for the crew at the door of the hotel. He wants to record everything that happens to the crew. The crew entered Yong&#39;an Town, and the director and screenwriter came together. After settling in, some people said that Yong&#39;an Town has a peaceful beauty. The screenwriter said, doesn’t this reflect people’s powerlessness? As it says in my script - nothing will happen in Yong&#39;an Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“Nothing will happen in Yongan Town” is a theme that the screenwriter constantly emphasizes in his scripts, which reflects his understanding and judgment of Yongan Town. However, the director did not agree with the screenwriter&#39;s judgment and asked the screenwriter to make modifications based on realistic logic and character logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major contradiction quickly emerged. The director and screenwriter are competing for the right to interpret Yong&#39;an Town, or the right to interpret reality. Wing On became a symbol of reality itself. The development and unfolding of this contradiction will eventually be realized in: &quot;In Yong&#39;an Town, will nothing happen?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first paragraph, a landlady who provides food for the crew appears. The proprietress is often accompanied by an old woman. The old woman sits in the shop like a sculpture. It seems to be in line with the screenwriter&#39;s imagination of Yong&#39;an Town: stationary, losing mobility, and nothing will happen to her. Once, the screenwriter met the boss’s wife and asked her to recite his wise words in dialect. When the boss’s wife said, “Nothing will happen in Yong’an Town,” the screenwriter laughed happily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the old woman who had been motionless suddenly moved her aging body out of her original position with the help of a chair with wheels. This scene happened quietly, but it seemed to prove that something &quot;happened&quot;. This scene delicately reflects the cultural hegemony and certain transgression of artists (such as screenwriters) over local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is the attitude of the movie? Will nothing happen in Yongan Town? The young proprietress is breastfeeding, and her husband works as an online ride-hailing driver, leaving her to take care of the child at night. During the day, she also helps her parents-in-law manage the restaurant, which is the family business she will inherit in the future. This woman was firmly imprisoned in this family structure, and it seemed that nothing would happen to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She was excited by the arrival of the crew, and she saw a new possibility - she made a prompt decision, weaned her child, and went to the street to get a manicure. This was her action. But the producer quickly brought in the female star Chen Chen to play the role that the boss lady longed for. Her movie dream was shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the boss lady&#39;s actions were unsuccessful, she cannot deny the power of action she once had. However, the unsuccessful ending is a serious blow to the actors. Such a small town story is indeed unable to inspire people&#39;s action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist of the second paragraph, the female star Chen Chen, actually walked out of Yongan Town. Chen Chen was warmly welcomed by her old classmates, but she did not enjoy the feeling of being respected. She was &quot;kidnapped&quot; to cut ribbons for others for free. The local officials were vulgar and had no respect for women. What made Chen Chen feel cordial was his old friend Chen Hong. Chen Hong&#39;s wife invited her to have dinner at home, but this meal put Chen Chen in an embarrassing situation. The other party actually wanted to use her as a back door to send their children to the crew to be actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Hong and his wife are played by Yang Jin and Wang Jiajia, who are also husband and wife in reality. Wang Jiajia portrays a middle-aged woman in a small town very vividly. She is vulgar and shrewd, and successfully ruins the relationship between her husband and his old lover. All the good feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen fled from this swamp-like family in a hurry. She said to her old classmate: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to become like this!&quot; Chen Hong said: &quot;You said you missed life here during the day! You are famous now Didn&#39;t you just leave because of money?&quot; Chen Chen said, &quot;The reason why I left was because I didn&#39;t want to live like your wife!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter believed that Chen Chen left Yong&#39;an Town just for money. Rather than a female awakening, Chen Hong&#39;s explanation for Chen Chen&#39;s behavior was actually the same as the screenwriter&#39;s. It can be seen that the screenwriter&#39;s understanding of life is not entirely based on subjective assumptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Chen Chen defended herself, saying that she left because of her awakening. These are two interpretations of Yongan Town. The voices of the two Yongan Town residents are the voices of Yongan Town itself, which means that Yongan Town itself is a chaotic and sticky place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the same external target, why do the two main creators have such different views? The third paragraph focuses on the two main creators who have been arguing and begins to analyze the source of their differences in concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenwriters like hand-rolled cigarettes, but directors don’t like hand-rolled cigarettes. They attack each other&#39;s music hobbies. The director likes RAP and pursues Spike Lee&#39;s style. The screenwriter thinks that those who like RAP are just pretending. They sing to show how awesome they are. He prefers rock and classical music. When the director played Chopin&#39;s music, the screenwriter said, &quot;As soon as this music played, I felt like I was in Yong&#39;an Town.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter wrote about a boy chasing a girl playing the violin and arriving at her building. But there was no action at the end. The director thought it was too literary, and the characters could not do without action. The screenwriter said that this story is his experience, and he once chased girls like this. &quot;The life I understand is that people don&#39;t take so many actions! They live by expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone has a strong ego and feels that the signal received by the antenna above their head Most accurate. This movie wrote a paper called &quot;On the Origin of Differences in Creative Concepts&quot; in a perceptual way, maybe more than one. The third paragraph actually gives part of the answer. The difference comes from experience and temperament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter rewrote the script based on the exchange between the two, but the director found that the script was riddled with holes and completely lost its filming value. They threw the script on the floor and lost their minds. At this moment when the conflict was heating up, the director did not seek to resolve the conflict head-on, but designed a moment of metaphysical transcendence. At this time, the WeChat ringtone rang, and everyone received the same news: Maradona was dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The music of &quot;Don&#39;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; enveloped everyone, including Chen Hong and his wife, and the hotel proprietress. Everyone transcended and sublimated at that moment, and the contradictions in the script were obviously transcended. Unsolved is better than solved. The main creators wanted to solve the problems of this film creation in a higher dimension. They decided to overthrow it and start over. The end of the film was the opening ceremony of the film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; and they started a new film. action. They channeled the conflict between director and screenwriter into their new film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;657&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252161&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; tells the story of a crew stationed in Yong&#39;an Town to shoot a movie. Stills from &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; (2021). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Does the movie faithfully represent reality? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wei Shujun’s ability to control narrative can not only bring the narrative in depth, but also quickly break away and transcend. This degree of control and narrative balance reflect a rare talent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; creates a textual maze. The film features four or five directors in roles, and three sections are titled after several Chinese arthouse films. Behind every director, there are their works and texts, and intertextual relationships can be formed between texts. This contains a certain amount of interest. Do you want to interpret it in depth? Of course you can, but the arrangement and combination of texts will create a kind of textual abyss. Perhaps a vague association will suffice here. The most important thing is the &quot;skill&quot; part of &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called era of film maturity means that film works have been textualized. The connotation of replacing &quot;work&quot; with &quot;text&quot; is a comprehensive reflection and questioning of traditional creative concepts. The work means the close correspondence between the author and the work, the work and reality, the author and reality, etc. That relationship is now being called into question. Does the movie faithfully represent reality? The producer constantly interferes and influences the creation. Is the director really the author of the film? Is the director staying true to reality? Or does he have the ability to accurately understand life? Film production has a strong impurity that can spiral out of control at any time. This can be seen as the inspiration of &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meta-movies are the textual movies mentioned above. This concept is actually not translated well enough, but let’s use it that way, and what I want to discuss here is a new large-scale trend in the field of Chinese film. How do we evaluate this trend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Shujun&#39;s last film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was also a meta film. I remember some commentators thought that the director was too narcissistic. They shouted to Wei Shujun - there is more to life than movies! I understand the commentator&#39;s attitude, but I think it pathologizes Wei Shujun&#39;s creative tendencies. I don&#39;t want to see it this way. As for &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot;, although it is a meta-movie that captures the director&#39;s own life, it also contains profound social analysis and social criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of film maturity does not only mean that people have watched enough films, are familiar with film history, film allusions, and understand the mystery of intertextuality; it also does not only refer to their life time and film in a broad sense. There are more overlaps and more daily communication through the form of movies in a broad sense... What’s more, we are already familiar with the cultural mechanisms of films, from studio production to ideological operating mechanisms; it means that at the moment, technology and media The &quot;wave of self-imaging&quot; brought to us by the development of the Internet has swept through each of our lives and reconstructed the organizational form and experience mode of our lives - think about the comeback of private images, think about Douyin and folk promotions The spontaneous performance of the actor...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of film maturity is also when all film forms seem to have been exhausted. People are rethinking the possibilities of film, including rethinking the development of new technologies, and rethinking film and reality. The relationship between... We are already in an era of intense film reflection and new film ontology, which constructs a new cultural spirit of our time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; and &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; have clues about the creator&#39;s original life that can be traced, but they also have the macro background of an era when movies are mature. Although these films are full of self-reference and discussion of the ontology of film, they are not outside of historical time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[做人生转折时刻的强者：不作无谓的精神消耗，而是活在意义之中]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;People have different attitudes and approaches when encountering major turning points. Most people panic and are in a dilemma. In contrast, the narrative of a Weibo blogger gives people a refreshing and enlightening feeling, which is quite enlightening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Weibo blogger recounted that her husband’s unemployment happened suddenly. In the morning, he was still complaining about too many people on the subway and was a few minutes late. Then he sent her a message saying: I was in a meeting and something was wrong. Condition. It turned out that after their project was launched, there were so many bad reviews that his boss was completely heartbroken. After a weekend of thinking, he decided to dissolve the company immediately. While there was still money in the company&#39;s books, more than 200 people in the company were given N+1 Everyone rushes towards their own future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course this is a responsible boss who treats his employees well enough, but for the workers, the bleak ending is already a fact. Her first reaction was that although the incident was sudden, unemployment was a foregone conclusion and she needed to plan for the next step immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their rent in Beijing just ends on September 30. She came to his company to confirm: disbandment is a foregone conclusion. After completing the formalities today, she won’t have to go to work tomorrow. She got N+1 beautifully. The two then spent 10 minutes analyzing the pros and cons, and decided to discuss it with the landlord, quit the rent on the 30th, and move back to Chengdu before the National Day. Next, he went to resign, and she contacted the landlord and the agent, explained the situation, and went through the check-in procedures for the two cats. She also immediately placed an order for the cartons, tape, plastic wrap and other things needed for the move and had them delivered in the same city. Then I announced to my close friends that I was leaving Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the standard performance of a time management master: when he left the company at 15:00, she had already made a list of what things at home needed to be unused and what things should be kept for return to Chengdu. . At 17:00, the agent came to take photos. She canceled her flight and hotel booking to Seoul for the weekend and rebooked her flight back to Chengdu. Around 19:00, she was already posting like crazy in the community’s idle group. At 20:00, she called two other more experienced good friends to help her husband revise his resume and teach him interview experience for the next job, because he had not moved around since graduation and had no experience in finding a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is my attitude towards life. Now that I have decided, there is no need to delay for one more second. Look forward, the sooner the better.&quot; Her emotion triggered the reaction of many netizens. Sadness and sympathy. In the face of such a thrilling fate, how could a person calmly make a handover with fate in just a few minutes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 years ago, I once &quot;drifted to the North&quot; for several months. In order to compete for a position in a magazine, for a whole month, I went from &quot;audition&quot; to &quot;audition&quot; among hundreds of people. Semi-finals&quot; and even the 4-person &quot;finals&quot;. When I finally lost my job opportunity with another &quot;unlucky guy&quot; because I didn&#39;t have a college degree, I was immersed in the emotions of shock, dissatisfaction, and unwillingness. It took a long time before I hesitated and went south in frustration. Compared with this &quot;time management master&quot;&#39;s never-procrastinating style, I am really ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are always disappointments in life, and unemployment is just one of them. When people reach middle age, some people get divorced, lose their spouses, lose their close friends, or encounter other unfortunate things. It’s not surprising to feel down and up and down at this point. So people often advise &quot;caged people&quot; to go out and relax. It has to be said that traveling far away does help to relieve the mood. However, regardless of whether you have the intention to go out, even if you go out, the troubles hanging in the air will continue to affect your mood. Didn’t you see that some of the wanderers became even more depressed after they came back? Therefore, this method of shelving conflicts and pain and adjusting time and space is not the best solution. The best solution is actually &quot;long-term pain is worse than short-term pain&quot;, do whatever you need to do, and never be sloppy or indecisive. The aforementioned blogger set an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively, because the blogger was mentally prepared and built up for her husband&#39;s unemployment, instead of being suddenly laid off, when the moment did come, the blow he suffered was naturally less severe. What&#39;s more, since the compensation can be described as generous, it has also greatly relieved the bitter taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this is not the key reason why he can maintain a calm and free style in times of turmoil. The key reason is to &quot;cut through the mess with a quick knife.&quot; Whether it is dealing with large or small matters and trivial matters, or making an immediate decision to move, it all reflects the philosophy of using speed to make things easier, and using pain to get rid of pain. Turning pages so quickly can minimize the impact of shock. Selling away most of the company-related artifacts is also to erase traces of the old job as soon as possible and reduce memory trauma. It is conceivable that at that time, their minds were occupied with other important things, so how could they squeeze in the pain? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be thought from this that modern people are greatly superior to the ancients in terms of material living conditions. But why does it seem that our stress is much greater than that of people in the past? Why do so many people seem to be depressed today? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, today we are indeed in a state of &quot;volume&quot; in many affairs, and pressure exists objectively, but have we ever thought about this problem: The ancients were often busy planning for rice every day, and rarely did they have to worry about it. I have free time to think about things, so much so that I have to &quot;steal&quot; even &quot;half a day&#39;s free time&quot;. Nowadays, people have more leisure in a materially rich environment. Once people are free, it is easy to get stuck in a corner and be unable to get out, amplifying the pressure. In fact, today, our situation is much better. For example, although the journey to school is extremely difficult, fortunately, examination or selection information is becoming more and more transparent, and at least there is certainty after studying hard, which is much better than in the past when imposters and secret operations were frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, leisure and non-idle are only relative, and how to deal with problems in specific circumstances also varies from person to person. However, no matter what era you are in, if you want to get out of trouble, people are given requirements and needs. The tactics adopted are actually the same, that is, the more extraordinary the period, the more meaningful things to do and the more meaningful issues to think about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you become stronger in this changing situation because of your timely stop loss and seeking changes, how heavy will the troubles of a person in a unit be? When a person can make himself bigger and stronger at the macro level of life - for example, becoming a person with a skill in his spare time and establishing extraordinary influence in a certain field - at this time, in a small space, because of interpersonal relationships and Can the waves caused by income disputes have a fatal impact on him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically speaking, in the context of life transitions, it means not to consume unnecessary energy, but to live in meaning. On the basis of acknowledging reality, turn around quickly and move from one state of affairs (stage) to the other as quickly as possible. Entering another state of affairs (stage), self-stimulating upward courage, it is too late and there is no time to feel sorry for yourself. This is the &quot;sharp weapon&quot; that the strong keep secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 20:25:21 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戴佩妮：写歌根本就是老天爷要我做的事情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/xDUbigKtQgtDIq3lncCbMYixioK3gMnfPWRa24AO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xDUbigKtQgtDIq3lncCbMYixioK3gMnfPWRa2 4AO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252435&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Penny Dai in &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the program team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene in 2000, a 22-year-old girl made her debut by releasing an album with original songs. In the mature record industry system What are the chances of finding a way out? Dai Penni told the audience through her actions that she might not be able to become an instant hit, but her talent will be recognized. The proof of this is the &quot;Nomination for the Best Newcomer Award at the 12th Golden Melody Awards.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the time since his debut was extended to 23 years, and the purely original album was released to his 13th, the singer entered another evaluation system, which consists of various criteria such as persistence, resilience, and having ideas. It seems that he can Separated from worldly judgments such as market and sales, the base is stacked with time and works. The &quot;status in the world&quot; shows the scarcity of music and the longevity of talent. Dai Penni is firmly on top, resting in a corner. She said: &quot;Writing songs is basically what God wants me to do.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She seems to have been accustomed to her situation: writing some songs that dig deeper into herself, and having a stable group of people who work with her The fans who grew up lived a contented life. As she said: &quot;I have always been a nobody, living a life where second place doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai&#39;s most popular clips on the Internet were presented by fans in an almost joking way. A few years ago, she sang her masterpiece &quot;How&quot; live, and handed the microphone to a fan. The other fan grabbed the picture, went out of tune, and burst out laughing in the middle of the song. She was stunned, took back the microphone, and finished singing this sad love song while holding her thighs. After singing, she was not annoyed and told the other party gently: &quot;Feixiang &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(fan&#39;s name)&lt;/span>;, keep up with the time.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;This less than two-minute clip was made into various videos and emoticons and went viral on various platforms. It was dubbed by some media as &quot;probably the most popular day since Dai Penny&#39;s debut.&quot; Until now, many people have seen Dai Penny staring at fans with complicated expressions, but they have not listened to the full song &quot;How&quot; she sang at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai’s life is littered with similar jokes of fate: she has written hundreds of songs, but still can’t read music. Her explanation for this was: &quot;This is a talent and a mission.&quot; She made up her mind to enter the music scene, and the first song she released was called &quot;Don&#39;t Want to&quot;. She was nominated for the Golden Melody Award for Best Female Singer many times, but she missed it every time and always regretted it. The album that finally won the award was called &quot;Purely Accident.&quot; She loves female singer Ani DiFranco. This pioneer in the original music industry has a unique personality and follows absolute DIY principles. He founded a record company to release his own solo album. Since his debut, he has been competing with the mainstream because of his clear views and controversy. While yearning for it, Dai Penni wrote about her endless self and subtle emotions in her songs, becoming part of the mainstream - being two extremes from being an idol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that is good about original singers is that the audience does not have to work hard to outline the singer&#39;s mood and story from the twists and turns of lyrics and music, especially for a creator like Dai Penni, who uses direct or indirect life experience as a Based on the original creation, the expression is strong and direct. &quot;My songs are my diaries,&quot; she said. With more than a dozen albums arranged by year, Dai Penni has been along the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at Dai Penny&#39;s music career, we can find that she is really full of energy. In addition to her dozen albums and hundreds of songs, she also has a large amount of unreleased inventory. In 2011, she gathered her friends to form the rock band Buddha Jump Over the Wall, serving as the lead singer. With her first album &quot;Buddha Jump&quot;, she was nominated for the Best Band Award at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards; her second album &quot;Show You&quot; won the 2015 Golden Melody Awards. Won the Best Arranger and Best Orchestra awards. She helped write lyrics and music for Peng Jiahui, Xu Guanghan, Pingguan, Jiang Meiqi, Liu Sihan and others. She won the Best Album Producer Award at the 25th Golden Melody Awards for the album &quot;Embrace You&quot; produced for Liu Sihan. In addition, she has also served as music video director and album photographer. Before her debut, she once wanted to become a professional dancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Tai was born into a scholarly family in Malaysia and started learning dance in the fourth grade of primary school. In high school, she participated in the first music competition in her life. She adapted a text written by a friend into a song and made it to the finals. The winner of that competition was later musician A Niu, and Leung Jingru won the Best Performance Award. Also participating were Zhang Zhicheng and Fang Jiongbin, who later became Dai Penny&#39;s few friends in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Dai Penni participated in the recording of Hunan Satellite TV&#39;s program &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;. In the previous four episodes, she invited her friend Zhang Zhicheng, who competed with her, and producer Yaya, who has been working with her for many years. She said that she doesn’t have many friends, but if anyone needs her, she will definitely stand up. “My loyalty can be exaggerated, and sometimes I forget that I am a girl.” In the program, they looked back on the past and pulled back the time to a long time ago. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the competition in high school, she caught the attention of musicians Chen Zihong and Huang Yi, signed up to &quot;Like Music&quot;, and released her first solo album &quot;Penny&quot; the following year. Until the release of her second album &quot;How&quot;, she had not decided whether to be a singer-songwriter or a professional dancer in the future. The song &quot;The Love You Want&quot; from the album was recommended by the company as the ending song for the TV series &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; and resounded throughout the streets as the TV series became popular. As she walked on the street, audience members came to say hello, &quot;For the first time, I felt like I was recognized by everyone because of my music.&quot; The energy of this song lasted for many years, and it is still one of her masterpieces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai’s music has rich genres and diverse emotions, which is one of her attractive features. She said: &quot;I&#39;m really vulnerable when I&#39;m vulnerable. I can be soft and strong. I don&#39;t hold back.

In fact, I was very afraid of singing the cover. But the atmosphere was very warm at the time, and Mr. Arai’s team was also very good. I was also invited to be a flying guest in the second season, but I missed it because I had Yang. This season is &quot;Friends&quot;, and the content has been changed to find your best friends, which attracts me even more. Through this program, I can let everyone know more about my friends who have been on the music road for more than 20 years and how they have helped and influenced me. I have very little exposure and rarely talk to people about these things. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not afraid of strangers and make friends easily. But until now, since my debut, I have very few real good friends as an artist. Most of them are the staff behind the scenes, the producers, costumers, etc. who shoot the MV. Stylist, makeup artist, music teacher, so I also want to use this show to make friends and learn about other musicians’ musical journeys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/BF0w2SdlxmEpTSofejPSmEzZ3N3prWLOD7UhKyo1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height= &quot;523&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/BF0w2SdlxmEpTSofejPSmEzZ3N3prWLOD7UhKyo1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252431&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Penny&#39;s first full creation in 2000&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly: &lt; /strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is it because we rarely become friends with artists because we have less opportunities to chat? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have some bad experiences. As long as I treat the other person as a friend, I will stand up for the other person when they need me. I will definitely show up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not very clingy with my friends. The friends we met in the early days were not like today. Now everyone makes friends through Moments, but the content shared in Moments may not necessarily be what he really wants to say. I don’t reject the idea of ​​a circle of friends. I used to have a circle of friends, but I rarely posted them. I was always looking at them. As I watched them, I began to speculate or worry about the other person (whether something was wrong). I felt that this was actually not very healthy. Gradually, I followed my previous approach and closed the circle of friends. If you have anything to say, we&#39;ll talk to you face to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am both passive and active, and I am very willing to take the initiative to help others, but if he doesn&#39;t mention it or doesn&#39;t let me know, I will feel that he doesn&#39;t need me at this moment, and I don&#39;t need to be too &quot;chicken bitch&quot; , I have to take care of others. The friends around me now will come to me if they really need some advice, but I don’t think I need to be so enthusiastic that I can take the initiative to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TxAvFrk8RV2VqY6CM4ElzKo5Q8OQKF0DqhIvX47D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;536&quot; height= &quot;746&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TxAvFrk8RV2VqY6CM4ElzKo5Q8OQKF0DqhIvX47D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252437&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Purely Accident&quot; 2013&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/ strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When will this mentality change be completed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2017, I wrote &quot;Passive Audience&quot;.

In the end, you will be distorted and you will feel like what are you doing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We won’t talk about the specific incident. Anyway, my trust and understanding of people and interpersonal communication collapsed in an instant. Many things and people would change, so I later opened up.

I rarely go out. Why aren’t my things being shared on social media? It’s because I feel bored. I’m not practicing or eating well at home. I won’t share who my friends are over the years. I am very protective of my circle of friends and my life, because for me, my life is my creation. Well... my songwriting is already a part of my life. From my debut until now, people have been guessing my appearance through my songs. This is natural. &quot;A person who doesn&#39;t often share too much about his life.&quot; In the circle I live in, it may be very contradictory for a person who wants to be exposed or publicized, but I just have this kind of rebellious personality. I don’t think this environment can only accept the existence of one type of artist or one type of business model. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ICY90xMKpkkZtKafCIbLZwq7whvIOCsxqivBS2IT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 540&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ICY90xMKpkkZtKafCIbLZwq7whvIOCsxqivBS2IT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252429&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Passive Audience&quot; 2022&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Characters Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you don’t want to expose your personal life, there are quite a few reality show parts in this show, and there are a lot of self-revealing parts. .

I will not take the initiative to tell everyone that I am in the show every day. Why, but when I meet fate and meet friends, I will talk freely. So this goes back to what I just said, I am not afraid of strangers or making friends, I am very willing to share. It’s just that I use music to share more than making friends to sit down and share with everyone. My life is my music, but I don’t want to just use social media to share my life. I hope I can find a more appropriate platform. I think this program is a very comfortable platform to talk about music. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have written all the most important things in the song, and I have already cut myself open enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the content written by some singer-songwriters may not necessarily be their own (experiences), but I choose to be a narrative singer-songwriter. I feel that I feel deeply and I only write when I have something to say. That&#39;s why I tell everyone that my songs are my diaries. I don’t like keeping diaries, but I love writing songs. Every song has people, things, things, and every song has secrets that you don’t know, yes, only I know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What does secret mean? For example, what&#39;s the secret in &quot;The Love You Want&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It refers to a lot of code words in words, which are things that only I understand. &quot;The Love You Want&quot; is relatively straightforward. The funniest thing about it is that the big boy in this song is actually me. It was a very young love affair, and I was too strictly controlled, so I wanted to be like a big boy and be free. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in fact its story is not what you think, it is the other way around, but no one knows it. As the person who sings it, everyone will definitely think that I have met a boy who wants to be free. No. But I don’t want to explain this thoroughly. It’s like some movies where you don’t know whether the ending is happy or bad. In fact, it’s an open ending, and many things just need to be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;How&quot; is obviously a touching love song, but it was changed into another style by a handsome fan friend of mine, and I didn&#39;t expect this change. I didn&#39;t know it at all. This change will occur. But I am loyal to the reason why I wrote this song in the first place. The changes in my life and things will not affect the picture in my mind when I sing this song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people are worried that I can no longer sing this song, no. When I sang this song, I knew what secrets I was hiding. I knew the time, place, and people. Of course, there would still be funny scenes when we talked about it, but it would not affect the reason why I wrote this song in the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you think you have improved in writing lyrics and music over the years? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it is the time that has given me different perspectives on things and different interpretations, and the words I use are different. So for me it’s not just aging, it’s maturing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t know how to use the word “nurture” before. Later, I heard a senior say that I think this word is very good, because different environments will cultivate different personalities. . Therefore, the word &quot;nurture&quot; has been used frequently in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was only after I finished the song &quot;Passive Audience&quot; that I learned to make peace with myself and often have meetings with myself. I was often in a state of binary opposition before. I would be worried about a lot of things at once, and I couldn&#39;t find the answers, so I started asking people for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote the song &quot;I Yearn&quot; in the album to remind myself. I have participated in so many programs in the past three years, and I am very afraid that I will go astray and forget my original intention. So I wrote this song to remember what I yearned for, &quot;The days I yearn for have sunrises, and the mess I yearn for is taken care of by you.&quot; By the second paragraph, I started writing and realized that my mentality had changed, so this song The song is to remind yourself not to get lost by filling in the gaps in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said you couldn’t make a decision before, so you started asking people everywhere, But your songs show that you seem to be a very courageous person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Things that are bold are very bold, and things that are not bold are not bold. I am very decisive now when it comes to big things. Now I use very unscientific methods to make decisions, such as throwing coins. My life is destined to be good, and the more I think about it, the less likely it will be. My whole life has been unintentional. I can only sum it up with this sentence. At the age of 45, from the beginning I didn’t want to be a singer-songwriter and just gave it a try, and now I have followed this path, and it feels like I was destined to do it. If the first album doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m going to go back to dancing or something, no, it&#39;s just going to be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can only admit that this is my mission. There are many people who can sing well, look good, and can create better than me, but not everyone can eat this. Have a meal. What makes me happiest is that my hobby is my job. I do things that interest me every day. At the same time, I can empower others through song, or give them a place to find release. This is the identity belt I have now. It gives me, supports me, and is the main reason why I still want to come out and sing and chat with everyone no matter how tired I am. Because this is basically what God wants me to do. If he didn&#39;t want me to do it, he would have asked me to go home and dance on the first album (after the album). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xkHR1nMNeASpTkionE5GrJKnAOtgxeTdAMM8TkMs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xkHR1nMNeASpTkionE5GrJKnAOtgxeTdAMM8TkMs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252433&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;, Dai Penni plays games with Yu Wenwen (left) and Meng Jia (right)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by the program team/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If this It is a kind of mission.

A country, just within these five hundred miles, has staged the ups and downs of its national destiny from rise to decline, from glory to annihilation. Sometimes, history can not only be examined with time, but also measured with space...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Congtai&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Climb high and have a bird&#39;s eye view, the lake lingers. In early autumn, the leaves of the wood are slightly yellow, and under the morning sun, their slender shadows wade across the lake and fall towards the square tower. The tower and the corridors at both ends are shaped like a giant bow. ——This reminds people of the several-meter-high statue in the square a few hundred meters away, also holding a bow. What&#39;s even more interesting is that when I walked into the blue-brick paved terrace, I saw that there was also a statue in the corner of the terrace, depicting the same person, also holding a bow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This man was once the master of this square tower, this city, and this vast land. He is the founder of the glorious history of Zhao State: King Zhao Wuling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/SUG0kgzgaydIkLLurgUzAZf3TVhKEoQy8BrWm0hb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1370&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/SUG0kgzgaydIkLLurgUzAZf3TVhKEoQy8BrWm0hb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;225541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The statue of King Zhao Wuling in Congtai Square, Handan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During my visit to the Zhao ruins, I was reminded several times of British scholar John Keegan&#39;s conclusion in &quot;History of War&quot;: Kings are created by great war horses. Although he is talking about the king of the West, King Zhao Wuling, the Eastern monarch, was also created by war horses. Of course, in addition to the war horse, there is another thing that must be added, and that is the bow in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three families were divided into Jin, and Zhao State had the largest territory and was also the most remote. Its main territory is in central and northern Shanxi, northern Henan, and southern Hebei. When talking with Fei Yi, King Wuling of Zhao said, &quot;Today, our country has the river and Boluo River in the east, which is shared with Qi and Zhongshan... From Changshan to Dai and Shangdang, there are the borders of Yan and Donghu in the east, and the borders of Donghu in the west. Bordering Loufan, Qin and Han.&quot; - A section of the ancient Zhangshui River in the eastern part of Zhao State bounded by the Yellow River and Boluoshui (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; in present-day Hebei Julu&lt;/span>;) serves as the border with Qi State and Zhongshan State; from Changshan to Daijun and Shangdang, it borders Yan State and Donghu State to the east, and Loufan, Qin State and South Korea to the west. From this point of view, Zhao was surrounded by the Qi, Zhongshan, Yan, Han, Qin and other princes, as well as the Donghu, Loufan and other tribes. If Daliang, the capital of Wei, is a city with four wars, then Zhao State is even more unfortunate. The entire country is a country with four wars - enemies are eyeing on all sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to achieve long-term peace and stability with strong enemies around. Especially under the law of the jungle where the strong bullies the weak and the masses bully the mob. King Wuling of Zhao sighed sadly all night long. He said, &quot;Today Zhongshan is in my heart. There are Yan in the north, Hu in the east, Linhu and Loufan in the west. If there are no strong soldiers on the border of Qin and Han, the country will be destroyed. What can I do?&quot; ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you are poor, you want to change. This is the driving force for the princes in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to compete for reform and self-improvement. King Zhao Wuling was no exception. So, there was Hufu riding and shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boundary between the monsoon area and the non-monsoon area is also the 400 mm equal precipitation line, which runs through the northern border of Zhao State. Zhao State is at the end of agricultural civilization and adjacent to nomadic civilization, especially Dai County of Zhao State. , and even closer to the nomads. The advantage of this proximity is that Zhao can obtain horses more easily than other princes. Before the industrial revolution, horses were mankind&#39;s most powerful and reliable source of power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The disadvantages are also obvious. Once the climate becomes dry and the pastures wither, it will be difficult for the nomads in non-monsoon areas to survive, and they will have no choice but to go south to plunder. At the beginning of the founding of Zhao State, it often faced intrusions from Donghu and other tribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reforms of King Wuling of Zhao surprised the people at the time - he ordered to learn from these barbarians who often invaded Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The speed and maneuverability of horses are not only incomparable to humans, but also to chariots. Moreover, in the era of King Zhao Wuling, the early aristocratic competitive chariot battles had evolved into a bloody and cruel life-and-death fight. The bulky chariots and the war ethics of not drumming and not rowing had long been unable to meet the needs of the times. Therefore, the heavy infantry represented by Wei Wuzu of Wei State came to prominence. However, the hoplites marched too slowly and had insufficient impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What King Wuling of Zhao thought was that if the soldiers were allowed to ride on flying horses like the Hu people, and shoot and charge on the horses, the mobility and flexibility of the army would be greatly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest problem is that the Chinese clothes are not suitable for riding horses. During the Warring States Period, the clothes of the various vassal states of the Huaxia tribe were generally the same. Today we generally refer to clothes as clothes. At that time, clothes meant upper garments and Shang meant lower garments. There are types of jackets, such as jacket, brown, coat, fur, robe and so on. Shang is a bottom garment, similar to a skirt, and is the same for both men and women. There is another type called Shenyi, which means the clothes and clothes are connected together, which is equivalent to the dress in later generations. ——As you can imagine, whether you are wearing a skirt and robe or a dress, it is really difficult to ride a horse, or even gallop on a horse, and perform various complex and difficult movements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how did the nomads do it? It turns out that their clothes are different from those of the Chinese people. The main features of the Hufu of the nomadic people are a short jacket with narrow sleeves and crotch trousers. The former is convenient for archery and the latter is convenient for horseback riding. In addition, the shoes of the Chinese people are made of cloth, while the shoes of the Hu people are made of leather. Leather boots are naturally more suitable for outdoor sports than cloth shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Wuling of Zhao disregarded many objections, including from his own uncle, and vigorously promoted Hufu riding and archery, he was like a magical magician who in the blink of an eye transformed the remote and weak Zhao country. Rising powerfully at a speed that dazzled the princes. The first real cavalry in Chinese history was born. The flying cavalry caused a dimension-reducing blow to the cumbersome chariots - from a historical perspective, King Zhao Wuling&#39;s Hufu cavalry not only marked China&#39;s transition from the era of chariot warfare to the era of cavalry warfare, but also meant that Hufu&#39;s It has become the common clothing of Chinese people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on the cavalry, Zhao conquered the three Hus. &quot;King Lin Hu offered his horse&quot; and &quot;Xiang Zhao Gu took control of Hu and sent his troops.&quot; Zhao State&#39;s control of Sanhu means that it can continuously obtain war horses, further increasing the strength of the cavalry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is particularly important is that after conquering Sanhu, Zhao State annexed Zhongshan, which lay across the middle of Zhao State and blocked Zhao State from the north to the south. In order to destroy Zhongshan, King Wuling of Zhao used troops several times. Zhongshan was weak and Zhao Guo was strong, so Zhongshan had to constantly cede territory and seek peace. After each time of ceding territory and seeking peace, Zhao became stronger and Zhongshan became weaker. Entrusting one&#39;s own safety to bribing the enemy would only make the enemy more greedy. A few years later, the Zhao army captured the capital of Zhongshan. The last king of Zhongshan was exiled and Zhongshan died. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With Zhongshan destroyed, Zhao State has solved its inner problems, and there are no more obstacles in the north and south territories. Moreover, although Zhongshan is weaker than the Seven Kingdoms, it is also a country of thousands of chariots, and Zhao&#39;s national power has greatly increased due to this. &quot;Warring States Policy&quot; said: &quot;Zhongshan is five hundred miles away, and Zhao is good at it alone. After his success and fame, he has become a vassal, and no one in the world can harm him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After rapid expansion, Zhao&#39;s territory reached its peak: &quot; It reaches Yan and Dai in the north, and Yunzhong and Jiuyuan in the west.&quot; Every inch of territory captured from the enemy echoed with the crisp sound of horse hooves and the long cry of powerful bows. With the cavalry pouring into the enemy formation like a tide as the background, Zhao State ushered in its unprecedented glorious years...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Handan in early autumn, the wind was a bit cold. In the afternoon, people came and went in Congtai Square, and the tall statue of King Zhao Wuling cast a heavy shadow. Congtai was completed more than two thousand years ago. The Congtai at that time was far larger and more spectacular than the Qing Dynasty building I see now. The main function of Congtai was for King Zhao Wuling to review troops and enjoy singing and dancing. In the pre-Qin Dynasty, when buildings were generally low, tall towers stood on the vast plains, which were symbols of the king&#39;s authority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With millions of people looking up to him, King Zhao Wuling ascended the Congtai step by step. This aloof king becomes even more mysterious and majestic because he is far away from all living beings. When the rapidly expanding territory and invincible cavalry made Zhao the only country among the princes that had the strength to compete with Qin, King Wuling of Zhao, who was looking forward to his glory, looked at the people in the audience who would give him orders at any time. And when the soldiers are stained with blood, their ambition to conquer the world seems to be surging like a spring tide...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 02/23/QEreryEQMOEb9mCKtYQkcNHIeg5xtuTanyqIesQd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1428&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/QEreryEQMOEb9mCKtYQkcNHIeg5xtuTanyqIesQd. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;225445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Handan Ancient Congtai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sand Dunes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 298 BC, in Xianyang, the capital of Qin, King Zhao of Qin, who had reigned for ten years, received an envoy from Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The envoy’s temperament and speech surprised King Qin Zhao. After the messenger said goodbye, the more he thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong: this was definitely not an ordinary messenger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Qin Zhao sent people to investigate and found out that the envoy had returned to Zhao. However, some of the envoy&#39;s entourage had not yet had time to leave. After questioning the entourage, their answers surprised King Zhao of Qin and his ministers: the envoy &quot;whose appearance was very majestic and unworthy of a human minister&quot; turned out to be the father-in-law of the State of Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called father-in-law is Zhao Yong, the former king of Zhao State - later given the posthumous title of Wu Ling and known as King Zhao Wuling in history. The year before, King Zhao Wuling passed the throne to his son Zhao He, calling himself the master father, equivalent to the supreme emperor in later generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did the father-in-law of Zhao go to Qin in disguise to see the King of Qin? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that before the annexation of Sanhu and the destruction of Zhongshan, between Zhao and Qin, only a small part of the southwest of Zhao State and the northeastern part of Qin State bordered. If the princes want to attack Qin, they must go west through Hangu Pass in the east of Qin. However, Hangu Pass is easy to defend and difficult to attack. The princes rushed thousands of miles, but they were unable to do anything to Qin who had one man to guard the pass and ten thousand men to open it. As Zhao State occupied Yunzhong and Jiuyuan, the situation quietly changed dramatically: Yunzhong and Jiuyuan were in the north of Qin State, which meant that Zhao army could move from north to south and from the north of Qin State to the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is what King Zhao Wuling envisioned.为了侦察秦国国情，他冒险扮作赵国使者前往秦国——两千年后，另一位远隔万里的帝王也像赵武灵王一样乔装打扮，深入到邻近各国考察，此人就是俄国的彼得大帝。彼得大帝为了使落后的俄国强大起来，曾化装成水手，造访西欧各国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前往秦国前，赵武灵王在宫中会见群臣，宣布把王位传给不到十岁的小儿子赵何，由肥义任相国，他自称主父。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王内禅给儿子，其目的是想摆脱国内具体政务，把全部精力投入到伐秦战争中。当然，他这样做还有另一番考虑：赵武灵王的长子赵章，此时已成人，按礼制，应该立赵章而不是赵何。但是，由于赵武灵王曾经十分宠爱赵何的生母吴娃，而吴娃刚去世不久，对吴娃的追怀与对小儿子的怜爱交织在这位多情的君王心中。于是，他决定立赵何为王。赵何年龄太小，他希望用禅让的方式让他尽快进入角色，趁自己还健在，教会他如何治理天下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，废长立幼却引发了可怕的后果，也使赵国的崛起如同昙花一现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵章被废后，赵武灵王封他为安阳君，但赵章对父亲的安排耿耿于怀。并且，朝臣也分为两派，一部分同情赵章，一部分支持赵何。关键时刻，赵武灵王又犯下大错：他看到成年的长子以臣子的身份跪在幼子脚下时，对长子的处境产生了怜悯之情，竟打算把赵国一分为二，让两个儿子各自称王。这一想法，遭到了肥义等人坚决反对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王的计划未及实施，双方的矛盾已经到了不可调和的地步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;悲剧，最终在一个叫沙丘的地方上演。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁在《史记》里三次写到沙丘。或者说，沙丘这个小地方，至少发生过三起重大历史事件：其一，商纣王建肉林酒池；其二，秦始皇最后一次出巡时病死；其三，赵武灵王父子相残。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广宗属河北邢台市下辖县，距邯郸市区约七十公里。广宗县城西北的大平台乡，公路附近，立着一对阙台，台后，树着两块碑，上面的字都是：沙丘平台遗址。碑后，栅栏封起一座土堆，那就是历代相传的沙丘宫遗址——从商朝直到秦朝，虽然天命流转，天子走马灯似地变幻，但这里一直建有行宫。如今，野岭荒郊，草长鸦飞，丝毫看不出宫殿的迹象。唯有一旁的小树林里，一群脏兮兮的山羊正埋头咬着铁丝一样的枯草，牧羊人坐在石头上，和山羊一样面无表情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵武灵王在两个儿子之间摇摆不定，对他和他的国家而言，都是一场空前的灾难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前295年，赵武灵王在沙丘宫举行朝会，赵章及其追随者发动兵变，肥义被害，赵何在将军高信保护下逃走，而早有准备的支持赵何的公子成——公子成系赵武灵王叔父，曾坚决反对胡服骑射——火速率军从邯郸赶来，包围了沙丘宫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵章眼见大势已去，便逃进宫中，希望得到父亲庇护。但是，公子成和李兑却将赵章杀死。此时，赵武灵王已失去了对政局的控制，公子成和李兑既不敢弑君，更不敢撤围。于是，便令宫内所有人员退出，独独不放赵武灵王出宫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缺吃少喝，赵武灵王只得生食幼雀，终至“三月余而饿死沙丘宫”。这位雄才大略的英主，竟以这种窝囊的方式在空荡荡的行宫里悲愤死去。随同他的肉身一起腐朽的，是赵国称雄天下的霸图和它恍如流星划过的辉煌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，经由赵武灵王变法打下的坚实基础，还将在相当长时间里继续支撑赵国。自齐、楚被打残后，赵国就是秦国以外实力最强的诸侯。因此，赵武灵王的子孙，还可以凭借他改革的余荫，继续与秦国周旋：咸阳宫里，蔺相如完璧归赵；渑池会上，蔺相如折冲樽俎；阏与城外，赵奢大破秦军——这一切，仰仗的都是赵武灵王胡服骑射以来积累的实力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只不过，这实力，随着后代子孙的不肖，随着国运的此消彼长，必将日益式微，直到丛台五百里外，一场大战爆发……&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;长平&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;去高平前，我看过一段视频：一道二十多米长、大半米高的断崖上，泥土之间，如同镶嵌着石头那样，镶嵌着密密麻麻的人骨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种令人惊悚的景象，对高平人来说，一点也不陌生。多年来，一场大雨或是一次基建，都可能惊现大量白花花的人骨。没有人知道他们是谁的儿子，谁的父亲，谁的丈夫。人们只知道，自古以来，作为兵家必争之地，高平的黄土下掩埋了难以计数的尸骨。其中，仅仅是秦赵之间的那场大决战，双方死亡人数就可能在六十万以上——如今，整个高平市的常住人口，也不过四十五万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高平，古称长平。战国时，属韩国。七国中，韩国最弱，又与秦国毗邻，被吊打的可悲命运几乎是注定的。高平所属的上党，即今山西长治一带，位于太行山西南，太岳山之东，王屋山之北，“其所最高，故曰上党也”。这里地势高耸，对周围有居高临下之势。穿越崇山峻岭的太行八陉，有四条在上党。通过它，东进华北平原，西入临汾盆地，南指洛阳，北望太原，自古就是兵家必争要地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前262年，秦军攻占野王（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;今河南沁阳&lt;/span>;），上党与韩国主体分割，成了一块孤零零的飞地。为此，韩国不得不答应把上党割让给秦国，以换取和平。然而，上党人民不愿被以残暴著称的虎狼之秦统治，上党郡守冯亭派使者到赵国，请求把上党所属十七座城池献给赵国，赵国派兵保卫上党。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从天而降的十七座城池，到底要不要接受，赵国君臣有过一番争论。最终，赵何之子赵孝成王赵丹实在拒绝不了如此大的诱惑，在平原君赵胜鼓动下，他接纳了上党，并派重兵布防。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;眼看上党已成囊中之物，没想到半路杀出个赵国，秦国自然不会善罢甘休。并且，秦相范雎认为，此前，秦国攻占了楚国大片土地，又曾兵逼大梁、新郑，打得魏、韩没有还手之力，却仍然没能称王天下，主要原因就是赵国未屈服。所以，必须占领上党，再攻打赵国首都邯郸以西地区，威胁赵国腹心地带，以逼赵国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是，中国历史上最著名的战役之一——长平之战爆发了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高平市区，丹河流过。溯丹河而上，在高平市以北，有一座名为长平的小村庄。长平村，即古长平城。丹河两岸，谷地平坦，更远处，东西山峰逶迤。就在这片谷地及附近，还有许多地名让人联想起那场惨烈的决定国运的大战：围城、箭头、白起台、骷髅山、廉颇屯、将军岭……在这样的地方寻幽访古，你能感觉到，历史并不只是书写在纸页上，还烙印在山川间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;秦、赵两国大军，各沿长平城左右五十里的山地构筑营垒。秦军由王龁率领，赵军由廉颇率领。廉颇认为，秦军士气旺，意在速战。赵军弱小，处于劣势，最好筑垒固守。从前260年七月起，双方在几次小型交锋后，廉颇便令赵军凭借有利地形固守不出。秦军求战不得，渐渐失去锐气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两军对峙长达两年有余，秦国开始实施反间计——反间计是秦国惯用伎俩，且每每收到奇效——秦国间谍潜入赵国，大肆散布流言，声称秦军真正害怕的是赵括，而非廉颇。赵孝成王本就对廉颇采取守势有所不满，怀疑他怯战，及至听到流言，信以为真——他如同秦人希望的那样，把身经百战的廉颇撤下来，换上了纸上谈兵的赵括。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得知赵国易将，秦昭王大喜，立即派有战神之称的白起秘密前往长平，取代王龁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;悲剧，已然不可阻挡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵括上任后，一改廉颇法度，由守势变攻势。白起佯败退走，却从背后偷袭赵军补给线，并将赵军截为互不相连的两部分——一部分是赵括亲率的主力，一部分是守卫营垒的留守。赵括返回营垒的归路被切断，陷入秦军包围圈，只好就地坚守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了吃掉赵军，秦昭王下令全国总动员——所有十五岁以上男丁，全部征集入伍。可以说，为了长平之战，秦国几乎倾整个国家的力量孤注一掷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵括被围，得不到补给，绝粮一个半月后，军中甚至发生了士兵自相残杀、以尸体为食的惨剧。赵括几次组织精锐突围，均被秦军击退。最后一次突围时，赵括亲自上阵，却被一阵乱箭射死。主帅阵亡，军中断粮已久，赵军兵无斗志，只得向秦军投降。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投降的赵军，人数多达四十万。白起认为，这些赵军将士，秦国既没法把他们改编为秦军，又不可能将他们释放。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;惨绝人寰的大屠杀就这样发生了。四十多万赵军将士，除二十多名年幼者被放还外，其余全部被杀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四十万这一数字实在过于庞大，以至后人怀疑《史记》是否有所夸大。然而，高平地区不断发现的累累白骨，却证明了大屠杀曾真实发生。只是，到底有多少人死于非命，则是一个永远的谜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长平之战纪念馆里，有一座用玻璃保护起来的尸骨坑。透过玻璃，层层叠叠的尸骨发出白生生的幽光。那天，纪念馆里除我之外再无他人，凝视着这些两千多年前非正常死亡者的遗骸，我仿佛听到了兵器击中肉体的闷响，以及此起彼伏的绝望的惨叫……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/02/23/EXiG7MlCUKRdWHYtFlxAnpwVCdVbfxsm64C088yE.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;令人意外的是，庙里还有一间小屋，门前挂着一块红底白字的牌：烧豆腐坊。烧豆腐是高平的一种特色美食，又名白起肉。 ——因痛恨白起坑杀数十万赵国将士，高平人发明了这种食物：把豆腐当肉，再用豆腐渣和蒜泥、生姜调成汁，当白起的脑浆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长平之战遗址纪念馆外，也有一尊塑像，塑的还是赵括。塑像下方，有八个字：空谈误国，实干兴邦。历史以哭喊、血泪和累累白骨在无声地警示后人。至于后人是否真的会记取教训，历史从来都无能为力。 &lt;/p>;

So this time I really hope to win the Asian Games gold medal, but I am also afraid that this gold medal will put too much pressure on myself, so I have been adjusting myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, more than a month ago, At the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, Wang Jianan jumped 8.05 meters in the first jump in the final, but he failed to exceed this score in five subsequent attempts. He failed to defend his title and unfortunately missed the podium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long jump tests explosive power, and the victory is decided in seconds. Behind it is the athletes’ years of training and hard work. Ups and downs are normal. What is difficult is to have the confidence to face success, and even more to have the courage to face failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/3UocneDe9x73yhQsmADXWFxF5t4RW68db8QMFUBG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;563&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/3UocneDe9x73yhQsmADXWFxF5t4RW68db8QMFUBG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 1, 2023, Chinese player Wang Jianan competed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Genius boy, a blockbuster&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Jianan is a typical &quot;genius boy&quot;. He was discovered to have talent in track and field sports when he was very young. He was born in Shenyang, Liaoning Province in August 1996. He participated in the Shenhe District Games in 2005. Although his performance in the 100-meter dash was average, he was spotted by Yang Keqiang, the coach of the Shenyang Sports School. Coach Yang saw Wang Jianan walking on the playground and found that although he was not very tall, he had long legs and a &quot;bumpy&quot; walk. &quot;He has the energy of an athlete, and I feel like he is a good prospect.&quot; At that time. Wang Jianan is still in primary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, he lived up to the expectations of his enlightenment coach. Yang Keqiang commented that he &quot;trains very hard, is very smart, and has strong comprehension ability. Many technical moves can be adjusted after a few times.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;At first, Wang Jianan was not a long jumper, but a decathlete, and his best event was the pole vault. At the age of 14, Wang Jianan entered the Xuzhou track and field team; at the age of 16, he was selected by the Jiangsu Provincial Sports Team to represent Jiangsu Province in the national indoor men&#39;s decathlon competition, scoring 7063 points. This is the second best result among world youth athletes in 2012: long jump 7.80 meters, 100 meters run 10 seconds 88, pole vault breakthrough 5 meters, high jump 1.94 meters - this was called a &quot;decathlon genius&quot; at the time &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jianan jumped 8 meters for the first time at the age of 16. He won the national long jump championship with a score of 8.04 meters. You know, this is a result that can only be achieved by a veteran who has been training for many years. Chinese men&#39;s long jump has been seeking breakthroughs since it broke the 8-meter mark in the early 1980s. However, most athletes have not made a splash on the international stage. Their best results were achieved in domestic or Asian competitions until Players such as Li Jinzhe began to appear on the international stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This also allowed Wang Jianan to focus on long jump in early 2013 and was selected for the national team. &quot;I switched to long jump because of my love for track and field. I am a decathlete athlete, and I still love all track and field events. I always have a kind of self-confidence: I feel that no matter what I practice, it will not be a problem. I am not an ordinary person. , I can do it.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a &quot;genius long jump boy&quot; Wang Jianan, his journey has indeed been relatively smooth. Some people call him &quot;lucky,&quot; and he doesn&#39;t shy away from it. He felt, &quot;From winning the bronze medal at home in 2015 to creating the best ranking in history at the 2016 Rio Olympics, strength is the foundation, but my luck is better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2013, in Pudong, India At the Asian Championships held there, in the absence of China&#39;s &quot;first brother&quot; Li Jinzhe in the long jump, 17-year-old Wang Jianan won the long jump championship with a time of 7.95 meters. He had never even participated in the World Youth Championships. Qualification for the World Championships in Moscow. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 24, 2014, Wang Jianan, who was under 18 years old, became a blockbuster in Eugene, USA. He won the men&#39;s long jump championship at the World Youth Athletics Championships with a time of 8.08 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2015 Beijing World Athletics Championships, at the Bird&#39;s Nest competition, three players of the Chinese men&#39;s long jump team, Li Jinzhe, Gao Xinglong, and Wang Jianan, appeared in the final at the same time. At that time, someone exclaimed, &quot;The best era for China&#39;s long jump It&#39;s already here.&quot; 19-year-old Wang Jianan won the long jump bronze medal, becoming the first Chinese and Asian athlete to reach the men&#39;s long jump podium at the World Championships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this also puts pressure on Wang Jianan. &quot;To be honest, after winning that medal, my confidence did not increase significantly, but it put more pressure on me. This medal is the only Asian medal in 32 years, and I won it, and It was a score of 8.18 meters, neither high nor low. Did I think this score was convincing at the time? This led to my results in 2016 being not particularly good throughout the whole year. I felt that I was suppressed by the bronze medal. .&quot; In an interview with CCTV, he admitted that he was carrying a burden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2018 National Track and Field Championships and Asian Games Trials, Wang Jianan jumped 8.47 meters, which not only tied the men&#39;s long jump national record held by Li Jinzhe, but was also Wang Jianan&#39;s personal best. In the men&#39;s long jump track and field finals of the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, Wang Jianan won the gold medal with an Asian Games record-breaking performance of 8.24 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/hlG2dACpPpI9xL1HZ1aEZYGboeSy1vRF9XUXdI3D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;739&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/hlG2dACpPpI9xL1HZ1aEZYGboeSy1vRF9XUXdI3D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252940&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 1, 2023, in the men&#39;s long jump final of the track and field event in Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese player Wang Jianan won the gold medal with a time of 8.22 meters&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hibernating after failure, reaching the top again&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Behind the smooth journey, there are injuries , there are also upcoming surprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2017 National Games, Wang Jianan underwent two knee surgeries on his left and right knees. When he learned that he had torn his meniscus, he even &quot;didn&#39;t want to practice anymore and wanted to retire.&quot; He took anti-inflammatory drugs for more than a month before he began to gradually improve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next major blow to his career was his failure to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. At that time, Wang Jianan had high hopes and was the only athlete in the jumping department of the national track and field team with a medal mission. Although he got a spot to go to the Tokyo Olympics, he did not perform well due to running-in problems with his coach and great pressure. He only jumped 7.81 meters and missed the finals. &quot;It was also a big blow to me. I feel that all the problems arise from my own problems.&quot; He took all the responsibility on himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This blow did not defeat him. He summed up his experience, regained his confidence and prepared to fight again. &quot;How much worse could it be?&quot; he recalled that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next step was his &quot;amazing jump&quot; at the World Championships in Eugene, which made more people remember this Chinese face. Before heading to the World Championships in Eugene, Wang Jianan shared a calendar on his mobile app on social media: &quot;It has been 3,078 days since I joined the national team, 2,058 days have passed since the 2016 Olympics long jump final, and my first meniscus surgery has passed. 1928 days, 1565 days have passed since the second meniscus surgery...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, Wang Jianan did not continue his past style. Until the last jump, his score of 8.03 meters was only ranked second. fifth place. On the big screen showing the results, the third place score was 8.15 meters. &quot;It&#39;s not very high. I think I should be able to sprint. Even if I jump with my head up, I can win a medal.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On July 17, 2022, after the last jump, he glided perfectly in the air and landed. He looked back at the sand pit and felt confident. When he saw the score of 8.36 meters displayed on the big screen in the arena, Wang Jianan squatted on the ground, covered his face and cried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/VBqSOdlm1LeWgX4cPeNrTmafyIaYCCjMlzec8A6L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/VBqSOdlm1LeWgX4cPeNrTmafyIaYCCjMlzec8A6L.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 16, 2022, Wang Jianan won China&#39;s first ever World Championships men&#39;s long jump gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, and became the first man in history to win a World Championships.

Consumers make complaints and reports. The announcement stated that once a complaint is determined to be malicious, the Municipal Supervision Bureau will not accept it. At the same time, if the complaint is used for extortion, threats and intimidation, the complaint will be transferred to the police to investigate the criminal responsibility of the malicious complaint reporter. Not surprisingly, this &quot;letter of caution&quot; caused great controversy. The bureau later deleted the document from its social media accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time such an announcement has appeared. In recent years, many places across the country have issued similar announcements. The municipal supervision department stated that its purpose is to &quot;create safe and comfortable consumption and a good business environment&quot; and &quot;equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and business entities.&quot; However, it is the legal duty of the municipal supervisory department to supervise illegal goods such as counterfeit and shoddy goods. If &quot;knowing about fakes and buying fakes&quot; is considered a malicious complaint and refused to be accepted, it is suspected of neglecting the performance of duties and administrative inaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Profit-making anti-counterfeiting&quot; is also commonly known as &quot;professional anti-counterfeiting&quot;. Its legal basis is mainly the relevant provisions of the Consumer Rights Protection Law, Food Safety Law, and Drug Administration Law. The Consumer Protection Law stipulates that if an operator commits fraud in providing goods or services, in addition to compensating the losses suffered by consumers, the amount of compensation should also be increased by three times the price of the goods or service fees. If the amount is less than 500 yuan, the compensation shall be 500 yuan, that is, &quot; If you give a false one, you will lose three.&quot; The Food Safety Law and the Drug Administration Law stipulate that if you produce food, counterfeit drugs, or inferior drugs that do not meet food safety standards, or you sell and use food that you know are not in compliance with food safety standards, or you know that they are counterfeit or inferior drugs, you are &quot;counterfeit.&quot; &quot;Ten for one&quot;, the minimum is 1,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on these legal provisions, a group of &quot;professional anti-counterfeiters&quot; were born. They look for substandard goods, food and medicines in the market, and after purchasing them, they complain or sue in order to obtain three or ten times the price. Additional compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cracking down on counterfeit and shoddy goods and maintaining food and drug safety are the legal responsibilities of market supervision departments. However, the market is very huge, and it is difficult to detect all illegal activities solely relying on the power of market supervision departments. The purpose of punitive damages stipulated in the law is not only to protect the interests of consumers, but more importantly, to make the criminals who make and sell counterfeit goods pay a greater price through punitive damages, so as to curb the behavior of counterfeiting and counterfeiting. With the incentive of punitive damages, professional anti-counterfeiters also have greater incentives to discover counterfeit and shoddy goods and report them to regulatory authorities. In this sense, professional anti-counterfeiters are actually helpers to regulatory authorities. It is much more efficient to discover illegal activities through the clues they provide than it is for the regulatory authorities to find the needle in the haystack on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are indeed some people who actually engage in extortion in the name of fighting counterfeiting. For example, some people frame the situation first and then &quot;crack down on counterfeiting&quot;, placing expired food taken away in supermarkets and framing merchants for selling expired food. Some people deliberately hide the food that is about to expire in the supermarket. The supermarket fails to find out that it has not been collected in time. They wait until it has expired and then buy it, claiming for selling expired food. Some even failed to find problematic products and threatened merchants with reports to pay &quot;consultancy fees.&quot; These actions are no longer a crackdown on counterfeiting, but a &quot;black crackdown&quot;, which is illegal and criminal. It is necessary to crack down on these &quot;black crackdowns&quot;. However, for the majority of professional anti-counterfeiters who legitimately exercise their rights conferred by the law and demand compensation in accordance with the law, the regulatory authorities simply refuse to accept their reports and complaints because their anti-counterfeiting behavior is &quot;profit-making&quot;. There is no legal basis and they are suspected of neglecting to fulfill statutory obligations. Responsibilities may encourage the trend of counterfeiting and selling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The criteria for regulatory authorities to identify &quot;malicious complaints&quot; include purchasing the same product again after receiving punitive damages and then complaining. But if substandard goods are completely removed from the market after being discovered for the first time, how can professional counterfeiters buy the same substandard goods again? If you continue to sell substandard goods after being punished for the first time, but the regulatory authorities no longer accept subsequent complaints, will the counterfeit merchants be able to continue selling fake goods unscrupulously? Do such regulations protect consumers or counterfeiters? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that, at least in the field of food and drugs, the judicial system supports &quot;knowing about fakes and buying fakes.&quot; The Judicial Interpretation &quot;Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Food and Drug Dispute Cases&quot; issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court in 2013 clearly states that for food and drug quality disputes, producers and sellers of food and drugs with quality problems shall use the consumer&#39;s knowledge to purchase fake products. If the defense is false, the court will not support it. That is to say, we support consumers to “know fakes and buy fakes.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a government department, the Market Supervision Bureau prohibits &quot;knowing about fakes and buying fakes&quot; and considers it &quot;malicious&quot;, which is contrary to the regulations of the judicial organs. Once the counterfeiters are sued for administrative inaction, they will be sued in court. I&#39;m afraid I will inevitably lose. According to the &quot;Rule of Law Daily&quot; report, a professional anti-counterfeiter once reported that many units in Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces were selling counterfeit medicines. After the market supervision department verified it, they found that he was not buying for consumption purposes and was seeking improper benefits. He was refused a reward and he filed a lawsuit. The court ruled that the municipal supervisory department lost the lawsuit and he should be rewarded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unscrupulous merchants selling counterfeit goods not only harm the interests of consumers, but also harm the interests of legitimate merchants. To &quot;optimize the business environment&quot; and &quot;protect the interests of business entities&quot;, we should crack down on extortion of enterprises and protect the interests of legitimate business entities. If there is a blanket ban on &quot;knowing about fakes and buying fakes&quot;, it will only condone &quot;knowing about fakes and selling fakes&quot; and objectively protect the interests of unscrupulous businessmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[摇滚之城惹热议：中国哪儿人最把摇滚刻进DNA里？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257649]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/fc790a5708bf0500e071a8465b07a524.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/25/fc790a5708bf0500e071a8465b07a524.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252071&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, cities such as Shijiazhuang and Xinxiang in Henan have also successively played the &quot;rock card&quot; and announced that they will compete for the city and hometown of rock. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Speaking of Shijiazhuang, the public may feel unfamiliar, but when it comes to some rock bands in Shijiazhuang, music fans are familiar with them.

After ten years of development, rock music also has fertile soil. As early as the 1980s, with the reform and opening up and social changes, local rock music secretly sprouted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 1986, 24-year-old Cui Jian sang &quot;Nothing&quot; in a high-pitched and roaring voice at the Beijing Workers&#39; Gymnasium. When the passionate lyrics came out &lt;span>;, thousands of spectators in the audience sang and shouted loudly, and Chinese rock music began an unprecedented process. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Subsequently, a number of outstanding bands and musicians emerged one after another. The Black Panther Band, the Tang Dynasty Band, and the Stinger Band, which originated in Beijing and Xi&#39;an, came out of nowhere and successively released albums such as &quot;Black Panther&quot;, &quot;Dream Back to the Tang Dynasty&quot;, and &quot;Chinese Fire I&quot; with lightning speed. Set off a wave of Chinese rock music. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In that era when materials were still scarce, the albums of rock bands sold like crazy. The Black Panther Band&#39;s self-titled album &quot;Black Panther&quot; sold 1.5 million copies, and the Tang Dynasty Band&#39;s &quot;Dream Back to the Tang Dynasty&quot; sold 2 million copies, becoming a hit that is still difficult to match. Young people wear big waves, bell-bottom pants, and play these albums repeatedly with tape recorders, making it fashionable to listen to these rock music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1994 is known as the peak year of Chinese rock music at that time. Dou Wei, He Yong, Zhang Chu, Tang Dynasty Band, etc. gathered in Hong Kong and performed a &quot;China&#39;s New Rock Forces&quot; concert that had nothing to do with the Hong Kong Philharmonic at the Hung Hom Arena, which represents the trend vane of pop music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the stage, with the sounds of &quot;Advanced Animals&quot;, &quot;Bell and Drum Tower&quot;, &quot;Flying Birds&quot; and other songs, in the audience, the audience from Hong Kong and all over the world watched again and again for more than three hours. He jumped up and down and roared until his throat became hoarse. After the concert, major media in Hong Kong used headlines to record this classic moment with &quot;rock soul, shocking Hong Kong&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/d5332f9dd68b222b6707f7425e603845.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/d5332f9dd68b222b6707f7425e603845.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252068 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Who is the hidden rock city in China&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Now, decades have passed since the 1990s, and the development of Chinese rock music has undergone tremendous changes. , the position of rock music is also changing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beijing and Xi&#39;an, once the most important rock and roll venues, are showing a current situation of replacement of old and new. Rock seniors such as Cui Jian, Xu Wei, and Zheng Jun have become more epoch-making memories flowing in people&#39;s minds, while new bands such as Pain Yang Band, Black Sa Band, Xuan Band, and Island Mood have become the mainstream of current performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leaping cities of Shijiazhuang and Xinxiang, Henan Province represent the extension of rock DNA. In Shijiazhuang, local bands such as Universal Youth Hotel, Relativity Band, Small Town Spring, and Plasticine Band have emerged one after another. In particular, the birth of the Universal Youth Hostel, which combines rock, punk, folk and other elements, was born like a sharp blade. Songs such as &quot;Kill That Shijiazhuang Man&lt;span>;&quot; and &quot;Qinhuangdao&quot; can be called the secret codes of many music fans. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In Xinxiang, Henan, the rock genes that once attracted Tang Dynasty, Samsara, Zero Point, Overload, etc. to perform are continued.

In the local area, even the owner of a milk tea shop or noodle shop can put down his kitchen utensils and play a musical instrument at any time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the rock flavor of Shandong is permeated in various music festivals.
