This was originally a very niche academic journal, and the notice itself could reach a relatively small number of people, but it quickly aroused heated discussion on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons for the heated discussion can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, the page fee of six to seven thousand yuan for an article is not cheap; secondly, the positioning of this journal, which was led by the Hubei Provincial Accountant Sponsored by the Society and directed by the Hubei Provincial Federation of Social Science and Technology, charging high page fees feels more like a commercial practice; the last is this preferential measure, which is very high-profile, but in fact the number of beneficiaries may be very few and can almost be ignored. , it feels more like a promotion. It’s not surprising that the combination of several factors has made it a hot spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I have always known that there is a page fee for publishing papers in academic journals, it is somewhat surprising that the fee for an article is so high. According to its official website, there are 31 articles in the latest issue of the catalog. This journal is published bimonthly. Based on the page fee of 6,000 per article, their monthly income can reach 372,000 yuan, which is 4,464,000 yuan a year. The annual income of a journal is nearly 5 million, which is definitely a good business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the important reasons is that the world has been undergoing a &quot;Great Leap Forward in Higher Education&quot; in recent decades, and the accompanying &quot;paper inflation&quot; behind it. Because China has a large population base and rapid economic development, problems in this area are particularly prominent. It&#39;s just that most of the people involved are &quot;literary people&quot; and are more or less &quot;beneficiaries&quot;. Even if they see the problem, they will not easily pierce this layer of window paper. After all, seeing through but not telling off is also a well-known survival wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the academic qualification inflation is the expansion of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. Major universities attach great importance to the number of papers, and basically require graduate students to publish a corresponding number of papers before graduation. Usually, the better the school, the higher the requirements for the level of papers. Every year, students apply to postpone graduation because they have not completed the publication of their thesis. Thesis publication is a necessity for the research community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the expansion of undergraduate and graduate enrollment will inevitably be accompanied by an expansion of the number of teachers. Throughout the education system, there is a tradition of assessing the number of published papers. There are rigid regulations that require publication of papers when promoting teachers&#39; professional titles, applying for scientific research projects, or applying for various scientific research funds. And it’s not just universities that require essays, even primary and secondary schools now have requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the education system, but also hospitals and even some units that are not scientific research institutions will use the number of published papers as an important indicator for promotion. One of the considerations is probably because it seems fair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another consideration is a certain sense of &quot;academic worship&quot;, or &quot;science worship&quot;, as if publishing a paper is making a contribution to scientific scholarship. In fact, for a long time, many places and universities in our country have been pursuing and promoting the &quot;only patents and number of papers theory&quot;. The number of papers and patents has always been the focus of their propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early August this year, the research institute of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan released a report. The report shows that China’s total number of papers accounts for 24.6% of the global share, 8.5 percentage points higher than the second-placed United States. In terms of the number of citations used to measure the quality of papers, China’s global proportions of “attention papers” and “top papers” were 28.9% and 29.3% respectively, ranking first in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We don’t need to belittle ourselves and regard this kind of data ranking as worthless. Objectively speaking, on the one hand, this data shows that China’s scientific research and academic influence is gradually expanding, which is a good thing. But on the other hand, we must also see the contrast between this quantity and reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We often say that &quot;quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes&quot;, but when the number of papers and patents is distorted by the wrong incentive system, quantitative changes may not lead to high-quality qualitative changes. On the contrary, it is more likely to lead to low-level, low-level duplication, and also produce some bizarre &quot;academic research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a few years ago, an academic journal published &quot;It is expected to improve the efficiency of building a clean government culture by targeting intestinal flora to regulate the body&#39;s material needs and desires.&quot; There are many more articles of this kind, which are completely unabashedly &quot;pseudo-academic&quot; and just to make up for the numbers. Under the improper incentive system, publishing papers has become a necessity for many people, and it is a very large &quot;market&quot;. The demand is strong but the supply is limited. There are only so many publications and so many pages, so it basically forms a &quot;seller&#39;s market&quot;, and it is not surprising that the page fees are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With high prices and huge profits, more people will definitely participate, so this forms an &quot;essay industry chain.&quot; There are writers, there are agents, there are people who are responsible for paying, and there are people who are responsible for publishing. You can basically find various channels as long as you pay. Of course, this &quot;market&quot; is not completely spontaneous, but is caused by a deformed incentive system. Moreover, under this deformity, corruption is likely to breed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Wu Dongfeng, the former editor-in-chief of Qiusuo magazine of the Hunan Academy of Social Sciences, was placed under investigation for serious disciplinary violations. The problem lies precisely in the publication fee. Later, the court determined that Wu Dongfeng had charged nearly 10 million yuan in &quot;page fee&quot; for his paper. The &quot;page fee&quot; for publishing an article in &quot;Qiusuo&quot; magazine can reach up to more than 50,000 yuan, and there are intermediaries responsible for blending these matters. At that time, this case caused great shock in the academic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to such corruption cases and problems, the &quot;paper industry&quot; has another problem, and that is the &quot;siphon effect.&quot; People in this &quot;industrial chain&quot; were supposed to create wealth, but instead they became &quot;paper brokers&quot;, helping others publish worthless articles to make profits. And some page fees are reimbursed at public expense. Except for those articles that are truly valuable, I am afraid that most of the junk articles are essentially &quot;conspiring to divide the spoils&quot; among many people. Some of them may be dividing taxpayers&#39; money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to change the status quo, I am afraid it is not a headache for the doctor. Not to ask why the page fee is so high, but to ask why so many worthless journals and articles can still live so well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[那些在互联网买“情绪”的年轻人，拜托醒醒吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259422]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;957&quot; height=&quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people may have heard the melody of &quot;love trading&quot;, but they don&#39;t know that there is also a business of &quot;emotional trading&quot; now. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Emotional Tree Hole&quot;, &quot;Good Luck Spray&quot;, &quot;Scolding to Awaken Love Brain&quot;, &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot;... Nowadays, many young people are keen on As for purchasing emotional products online, there are more and more emotional products that can be purchased for just a few dollars. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, when you have an emotional breakdown, you can buy a chat service online, talk to strangers, complain a few words, and your negative emotions seem to be released; place an order for a &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot; , there will be sellers role-playing who will &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; after breaking up, buy a copy of &quot;Scolding to Awaken Your Love Brain&quot;, and strangers will be your &quot;chat partners&quot; and treat you rationally and rationally. Move with emotion...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why are young people so keen on buying emotions on the Internet? Can buying emotions really provide emotional value? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Young people are “emo” &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Behind the purchasing emotions are the emotions of many young people Emotion has encountered some &quot;problems&quot;. To use a popular word nowadays, it is &quot;emo&quot;. Emo was selected as the Internet Word of the Year in 2021. In this year alone, Bilibili users sent &quot;emo&quot; barrages 3.3 million times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;emo&quot; comes from the English word &quot;emotion&quot;, which means emotion. In the 1990s, &quot;emotional hardcore&quot; appeared in the field of European and American pop music, which is a kind of rock music with delicate emotions, melancholy and sentimentality. After being simplified to &quot;emo&quot;, emo also has colors such as impulsiveness, sensitivity, and melancholy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo, which is now a popular vocabulary, continues this core and emotional color, representing the decadent, frustrated, speechless and puzzled mood of young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo has become a popular word not only because of the principle of &quot;language economics&quot; - this short word accurately summarizes the mentality of young people, and it is not just popular. The &quot;herding effect&quot; in the spread of vocabulary - you use it for other people and I use it for you. What&#39;s more, emo is indeed a universal emotion of the times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo is a new variant of the previously popular words such as &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;mourning&quot; and &quot;lying flat&quot;. It is related to some new changes of the times. For example, in the post-epidemic era, the global economy is recovering slowly and the economic downturn has put young people under greater work pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people feel very tired under the &quot;involution&quot;; in the busy urban life, many young people do not have much time to socialize and stay in rental houses after work Here, they will inevitably feel lonely and cold as &quot;empty-nest youths&quot;... In addition to these universal dilemmas, young people also have different and specific confusions in their own lives, which more or less affect their emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, young people can emo about everything. I can&#39;t find a job, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m under great pressure at work, I&#39;m emo; I have a conflict with my partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m single and have no partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m not ready for the exam, I&#39;m emo; my plan was rejected by Party A, I&#39;m emo...&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with words such as mourning and lying down, emo has a hint of self-deprecation of joy in suffering. It is not so negative and pessimistic, but after complaining about &quot;I am really emo&quot; , will still clean up the mess of life and move on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The comfort of &quot;emotional value&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After emo, you still have to embrace life. Therefore, young people will work hard to calm down their emotions faster and satisfy their emotional needs. They will seek &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, what is emotional value? Simply put, emotional value = positive emotion (benefit) - negative emotion (cost). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether a thing or a person has emotional value lies in its ability to bring positive emotional power to people, such as making people feel happy, secure, calm, and warm. , healing... In other words, emotional value is the ability to have a positive impact on our emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be companionship, sharing, listening, encouragement... In the end, it becomes a kind of comfort for emo emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On social media, young people also often use words closely related to emotional value, such as &quot;emotional stability&quot;, which has become the first criterion for many young people to choose a partner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;An emotionally stable partner can always handle things calmly and calmly, without losing control, without blaming each other, and without blaming each other, but working hard to solve problems. A partner who is emotionally stable will naturally bring strong emotional value to others - you will be wrapped in a sense of security, and no matter how chaotic the world is, there will be someone walking hand in hand with you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With this background, we can understand why many young people buy emotions on the Internet. What they essentially buy is &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If a person has no motivation to study, just join the &quot;virtual study room&quot;, and everyone will study together to have more atmosphere; if you want an illusion of good luck, buy &quot;Good &quot;Yuck Koi&quot;; if you want to get rid of loneliness and gain a sense of companionship, you can place an order for &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, where a seller will role-play a mosquito and &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; buy it after a breakup A &quot;scolding to wake up your love brain&quot; is not so much about scolding you as it is about accompanying you, talking to you, and listening to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255731 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not want to buy Just buy it&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is human nature that people like people and things that can provide high emotional value. Keen merchants have also seized this business opportunity - young people need emotional value, and I will sell emotional value. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The question is, can you really buy emotional value if you want to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If emotional value was such an easy thing to obtain, it wouldn’t be so scarce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As mentioned above, emotional value is a kind of &quot;ability&quot;. It must really hit your emo point, bring you strength, comfort and help you. You transcend that depression. This is not something you can achieve by typing in a dialog box and the other party saying a few words of chicken soup for the soul; it is not something you can achieve by buying a &quot;Good Luck Koi&quot; or &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot; and you will be blessed with divine help. Falling from the sky; it’s not the other party “inciting emotions”, you will be emotionally liberated...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, those &quot;sell&quot; products on the Internet for a few cents or a few dollars &quot;Emotion&quot; is just a gimmick. The sellers do not have the quality and ability to provide emotional value. They are even more routine and perfunctory than the customer service of some merchants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What young people buy is only a few minutes of freshness, which brings a few minutes of fun to the emo mood. Once the freshness is over, the emo is still the emo, and the problem has not been solved. If so, it&#39;s still not resolved. It&#39;s OK to think of &quot;emotional trading&quot; as a joke, but if you take it seriously, you may be deceived and make you more emo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the final analysis, if there is no one or thing to rely on, then the only one who can bring positive emotional value to yourself is yourself. If you haven&#39;t studied for a long time and feel that you have fallen, you will feel emo, and you think that joining the &quot;virtual study room&quot; will give you motivation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, such heteronomy is in vain. If you have more self-discipline and complete the goals you set every day, you will feel real happiness the moment you complete it - the better. Self-discipline brings freedom; if you don’t work hard at ordinary times, you will feel emo before the exam. You think buying a &quot;good luck koi&quot; will bring you good luck, but you still won’t during the exam. If you study hard and concentrate on preparing for the exam, you will Your hard work will be reflected in the exam, and what you gain is a real sense of solidity and accomplishment...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the value of emotions cannot be bought just because you want to buy them. Buying emotions is a pleasure. Yes, but getting out of emo cannot rely solely on spiritual victory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《芭蕾舞复仇曲》：韩影越来越套路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259234]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Among the new generation of Korean actresses, all Zhong Rui is an alternative existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She made her fortune in Li Cangdong&#39;s &quot;Burning&quot;. She stood out from thousands of auditions and performed a large-scale role in her first screen role. The cunning and alienation on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s face, her inadvertent dodge, and a hint of cowardice constitute her rich facial aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her new work &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, she once again demonstrates this highly recognizable performance style. This is her second collaboration with emerging director Li Chongxian. The first time the two worked together was in the 2020 crime suspense film &quot;The Call&quot;, which caused heated discussions among movie fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ballet In &quot;Revenge Song&quot;, although Jeon Jong-seo is not as crazy as in &quot;Telephone&quot;, the girl she plays, Ok-joo, is also a mistress who is not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhu once worked as a bodyguard in a security company, specializing in protecting high-level important personnel. Her superb skills and sharp mind were fully demonstrated in the opening supermarket robbery scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps for a long time Maintaining a high degree of vigilance, Yuzhu had no interest in life and was full of frustration all day long until she met her old classmate Minxi. The latter&#39;s natural affinity frees Yuzhu from the boring quagmire of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to show the contrast in atmosphere, the film specially uses colorful soft light to capture the relaxed and graceful friendship between the two girls when showing Minxi taking Yuzhu to celebrate her birthday, taking headshots and relaxing on the beach. . This is in contrast to the large number of night scenes and indoor scenes throughout the film, which basically use high contrast and low-key lighting to create dangerous and uneasy situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point of the story , appeared when Minxi suddenly committed suicide, leaving a last word hoping that Yuzhu would help her take revenge. After Yuzhu followed the clues and found a man named &quot;Chef Cui&quot;, she discovered that Minxi&#39;s suicide had a lot to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The many &quot;SM&quot; props in Chef Cui&#39;s home, as well as the large number of classified USB flash drives in the cabinet, all show that in the process of &quot;hunting for beauty&quot;, he often uses perverted methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;444&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Minxi , after being targeted by Chef Cui, he was drugged and raped while being filmed on video.

The prisoner in the case, Zhao Zhubin, established a paid &quot;room&quot; on an online platform and used the threatened girls as bargaining chips to profit from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s just that this film introduces gangster forces and makes sexual crimes bottomless, in order to amplify this despair and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some time ago, &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, which was adapted from real events, brought to the table the rarely mentioned child abduction and sex trafficking. Although the quality of the film is not good, its discussion of this topic is worthy of recognition. It allows us to see a criminal phenomenon that is deep underground and widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, as Yuzhu deepens her investigation into Chef Cui and the organization behind him, she also only avenges her best friend at the beginning, but gradually transforms into avenging the victimized woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, The killing scenes and action scenes have become the second highlight of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jeon Jong-seo cannot rely on physical confrontation and impact to create visual stimulation like Stallone and Jason Statham, nor can he use real kung fu techniques like Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Show off a pleasing figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The action design of &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; absorbs the style of the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, that is, it gives full play to the advantages of &quot;gun-shaped&quot; action movies, allowing hot weapons and fists and kicks to be used alternately. Ammunition can create explosive scenes, and the head-on confrontation of fists, feet, knives and axes can highlight the thrilling effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at the climax In the scene, Yuzhu used two pistols to fight against the entire gang, which was most obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this alone cannot make up for Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s complement in action scenes, so lens language and editing techniques have become necessary auxiliary means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quick swinging technique, the movement of the camera synchronized with the direction of the punch, and the extensive use of close-up and close-up shots, coupled with the fast and sharp editing style, make the entire movie have a clear rhythm every time it enters the action section. Accelerate and the atmosphere becomes wanton and arrogant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director Li Chongxian is familiar with action films such as Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;The Fuse&quot;, Indonesia&#39;s &quot;The Raid&quot; and South Korea&#39;s &quot;Crime City&quot;, so he can create these action scenes with ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the tilted and unbalanced camera images and the neon aesthetics with great color contrast make &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; closer to the style of Hollywood crime films in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general In other words, the crime theme of exploiting women&#39;s bodies, good fighting scenes, and Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s character arc that is sometimes conservative and restrained, sometimes sensitive and angry, make this film have a sense of entertainment that is above the pass mark. However, when we finish watching &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, we can still detect its frivolity and frivolity based on big data algorithms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the character Ok-joo&#39;s emotions continue to deepen in the process of revenge, this delicate inner change relies more on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s outstanding performance. Why did she become a bodyguard? Why are you so depressed in life? The film never explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255255&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for her being Min Xi is infected and her heart gradually melts, but it is like going through the motions, and the filming is stereotyped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most puzzling thing is the pretentiousness of the underworld gang, which is strong on the outside but capable on the inside. The boss, who is full of gangster traditions, did not see anything done after he lectured Chef Cui. He neither saw through Chef Cui’s lies nor demonstrated his strategizing of the organization. Only in the contrasting section of &quot;die from talking too much&quot; does it play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; provides a framework for female revenge, especially in terms of revenge for best friends. It is exactly the same as the summer hit &quot;The Vanishing She&quot;. But when it comes to the specific levels of criminal psychology, social ecology, etc., it seems to be discouraged. It is not like Luo Hongzhen&#39;s &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, which separates the dirty, angry and restless characters&#39; psychology and shows you in detail. Instead, it provides a visual pleasure for immediate consumption and caters to the public&#39;s emotional fast food. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable result of Netflix and other streaming media entering the Korean market. It has brought big data arithmetic and more routine formulas, and this may also become a trend in the next few years. , a signal of an overall decline in the quality of Korean films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深圳欢乐谷过山车追尾，有游客称前一天已遇故障]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259498]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:19:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project promotion picture.

The picture comes from the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 18:27 on October 27, 2023, a vehicle collision occurred in the roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; in Happy Valley, a well-known theme park in Shenzhen, injuring 8 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was sitting on the second roller coaster at the time. The speed was very fast and the impact was very strong.&quot; At 22:17, Yu Qing, who witnessed the experience, just came out of the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital. Her test result was mild. Concussion, bruises and skin injuries on hands and feet. She recalled to the Southern Weekend reporter that she didn’t know exactly what happened at the time of the incident. “I just felt that my car was sliding backwards, and finally I realized that it had hit the previous car that was discharging passengers.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;At 23:25, Shenzhen Happy Valley officially issued a situation report stating that the injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment and are in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. &quot;The cause of the incident is under investigation. The equipment has stopped operating. We will further conduct a comprehensive inspection of all equipment in the park.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of the 28th, Shenzhen Happy Valley reported again that from the 28th to the 29th, The park will be closed for two days and a safety inspection of the entire park will be carried out. Visitors who have purchased tickets can receive a full refund through the original purchase channel. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Tourists said there was a &quot;system problem&quot; the day before&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I heard a loud noise at that time, and many staff members ran in and asked us to give way. We didn&#39;t know what happened at first What happened? I found out later that it was a car crash.&quot; Zhao Xin, a student who was lining up at the scene, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Xin said that several students from Shenzhen Huitong School were on the roller coaster where the accident occurred. “Several of them went up to play together. One of them had some stomach injuries because he didn’t have time to get off, and the other one It’s more serious and I passed out.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 23:00 on the 27th, a Southern Weekend reporter called the customer service of the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital. A staff member on the line said he was unclear about the situation, but said that the current queue time in the emergency department would be It&#39;s very long. &quot;There are more people waiting in the emergency department now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley, &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has a five-star thrill level. It is a catapult roller coaster built with a huge investment of 200 million and is the tallest and longest catapult roller coaster in Asia, with a total length of 550 meters. &quot;Speed ​​up in 2 seconds, galloping at 135 kilometers per hour, falling vertically from 60 meters, heart-poundingly crazy for 90 seconds, 4G maximum acceleration, the experience of going to the sky, going to the ground, and going into the sea is thrilling to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is It is a relatively popular event, and there were a lot of people queuing up today.&quot; Zhao Xin recalled that she had been queuing for nearly two hours. If nothing had happened, it would have been her turn to get on the next bus. Finally, she left around 19:00 At the scene, &quot;When my friend went over to play, he found that the project had been closed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, the day before the incident, Chen Yuangang played &quot;Snow Land&quot; with his friends. Eagle&quot; project. She told Southern Weekend reporters that there was a problem with the system at that time: &quot;The Snow Eagle made a loud sound when it ejected, but I didn&#39;t hear it at the time, and then I found that the car had returned to the starting position. After a while, , the roller coaster ejected again, and returned to the starting position after a normal run.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yuan recalled that the vehicle system activated the emergency protection device at that time, and tourists on the roller coaster were unable to get off. &quot;The staff used the microphone to inform the remaining people in line that there was a problem with the system and needed to be repaired, so they could not continue playing. They also issued speed passes to the remaining people in line.&quot; Chen Yuan said that everyone stayed on the stalled roller coaster again. After about ten minutes, the staff adjusted and the emergency braking mode was released and we were able to get out of the car. &quot;About two hours after the emergency repairs, Happy Valley notified Snow Eagle to resume operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maintenance is done every day&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shenzhen Happy Valley has been open since 1998 and is a new generation of large-scale theme park of OCT Group. Among them, the catapult roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project was officially opened in July 2012. Its vehicle structure includes two trains (orange car and green car), each train has 6 carriages, and each carriage can accommodate 4 people. There are 24 people in the whole car and 48 people in the two cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, a rear-end collision involving an aerial sightseeing train occurred in Happy Valley. On November 1, 2018, while two &quot;Happy Main Line&quot; sightseeing trains were running over the Overseas Chinese Town tourist resort, the front train stopped due to a system failure, causing a slight rear-end collision with the rear train. There were about 20 passengers on the two trains, causing 2 People get hurt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the China Bidding and Bidding Public Service Platform, on March 21, 2023, Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company issued a bidding announcement for the overhaul service project of the Shenzhen Happy Valley Snowy Eagle Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bidding announcement shows that the overhaul service project of Shenzhen Happy Valley&#39;s &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project includes professional evaluation of the overall operation situation, carrying out Snowy Eagle&#39;s service status evaluation, safety and reliability evaluation, large-scale Repairs, condition monitoring systems and other work will be carried out, and it will pass statutory inspections, regulatory filings, etc. The planned construction period is from April 20, 2023 to June 30, 2023.

Maintenance is done every day. Weekly maintenance is done every week, monthly maintenance is done every month, and maintenance is done every year. It is impossible to say that there is any rust.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked about the cause of the accident, the person in charge said : &quot;Our company has a unified response to this aspect, and everything is now waiting for investigation and technical analysis.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(should be At the request of the interviewee, the interviewees in the article are all pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“美容腐败”Vs从“表哥”到低调腐败：性别偏好影响腐败模式丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259326]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, according to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission, a former member of the Party Group and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Yanqing District Committee of the CPPCC Chen Guifen was expelled from the party and public office, and the suspected criminal issues will be transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. The notice specifically mentioned that Chen Guifen &quot;violated regulations in accepting gifts and arrangements for beauty activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, expressions such as &quot;accepting beauty activities&quot; and &quot;addicted to beauty&quot; have appeared many times in official review reports on dismissed female officials. Chen Guifen&#39;s defeat this time has further brought the new term &quot;beauty corruption&quot; to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot; refers to cases of corruption and bribery that occur due to accepting beauty activities. Among the typical cases reported in recent years, the high amount of money involved and the bizarre corruption projects of &quot;beauty corruption&quot; have been breathtaking. The former director of the Anshan Municipal Taxation Bureau Liu Guangming’s “500,000 butt plastic surgery fee”, the latter the former mayor of Manzhouli City Xu Ailian’s “150,000 yuan for a beauty needle”, and the former vice president of North China University of Technology Shen Zhili’s “single consumption of 690,000 yuan” ”的惊人数字。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由“美容腐败”这一名词不难推断，某些类型的腐败确实与性别有关系。由于男女偏好的不一样，行贿者会有针对性地投其所好，这是不难理解的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;权力的“任性”会像生命一样找到出口，满足滥权者的个体欲望。现金房产，金银珠宝，名车名表，古董字画，总有一款适合落马官员，也是男女官员腐败的共性。但男性官员与女性官员在贪腐形式上存在爱好上的差别，也是一个看得见的现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早些年，男性展示成功的炫耀性风气对官场也有影响，出现过不少根据照片全民抓腐败的事件。有鉴于此，近年以来，男性官员的腐败多呈现“低调”“隐性”的特征，这是汲取了某些落马“表哥”“皮带哥”的“教训”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前在腐败形式上，男性官员“间接性”“迷惑性”特征越发明显，如“设立离岸账户”“退休离职之后再受贿”“影子公司”“期权腐败”等手段层出不穷。古已有之的“雅贿”也并未完全走入历史，借助古董字画的高端行贿受贿形式，仍常见于落马男性官员的贪腐细节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，男性官员也在着意隐藏自身的财富，一切以低调为上，不再像往常那样因为公开形象而被轻易抓包。在腐败细节上，男性官员也极力掩饰，尽量不留下可追踪的信息，比如孙力军收受的代号“小海鲜”的“30万美元礼盒”，以及海南省委前常委、海口前市委书记张琦“家中堆满13.5吨金条”的隐秘手法。男性官员往往还能借助自己特殊的兴趣爱好，满足贪欲的同时隐藏腐败事实：重庆市市场监督管理局原党组副书记、副局长杨宏伟则有“球书记”美名，热衷在工作时间打篮球，以打球掩护自己私相授受的贪腐行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不难看出，打球等都是更常见于男性群体的爱好，而从近年某些落马的女性官员来看，权力与爱美之心结合的腐败也不少见，从名贵饰品、服装包包到奢侈品消费，再到所谓“美容腐败”。诚如北京市卫生局工会原主席白宏的腐败纪实，“周围人群的赞美声和嫉妒声，使白宏沉浸在成功女性的快感中”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行贿者代为支付美容费用，或是送上高价美容会员卡，都能构成对女性官员行贿受贿，甚至发展出新颖的洗钱手段。现实生活中“普通人天价美容”的情况都并非罕见，而一旦女性官员的爱美之心得到权力欲的加持，那么由此催生的腐败行为就更如滔天洪水。 “权力让人永葆青春”在女性官员身上不仅是一句象征语，更是可以借助美容消费实现的写实之语。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;并非官员才腐败，在关键岗位上的人员照样可以腐败，且腐败还有年轻化的倾向，年轻人的腐败往往更大胆，更不计后果。滁州市不动产登记中心的“95后”科员张雨杰，挪用公款近7000万元，其中几万元都买了游戏卡，案发之后这张卡竟被拍卖到了8000多万。他的爱好是打游戏。在2016年的“江苏扬州4名年轻女财会贪污”案中，仅仅是高邮市农委原现金会计柏玲挪用公款就达1051万，其中800余万元用于美容消费，案发时她仅有29岁，贪污如此巨款却只是为了美容消费，实在令人咋舌。她们的偏好是爱美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国公职人员政务处分法》第34条规定，“接受、提供可能影响公正行使公权力的宴请、旅游、健身、娱乐等活动安排情节较重的予以警告、记过或者记大过，情节严重的予以降级或者撤职。”美容腐败，就形式而言属于比较隐蔽的“娱乐等活动”，而其涉案金额又往往符合两高《关于办理贪污贿赂刑事案件适用法律若干问题的解释》里“数额特别巨大”的标准，称得上灰色地带的隐性腐败。因此，整治美容腐败还需从腐败的源头着手，抑制权力任性的空间，这一点是不分男女、没有性别的。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月25日，国家数据局正式挂牌。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历经七个多月筹备，2023年10月25日上午，在一众筹备组成员和其他部委代表的见证下，国家数据局正式揭牌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至此，第九次国务院机构改革中新组建的两个部门均已完成挂牌。此前，新组建的国家金融监督管理总局已于2023年5月18日完成挂牌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新一轮国务院机构改革方案显示，国家数据局由国家发改委管理，具体负责协调推进数据基础制度建设，统筹数据资源整合共享和开发利用，统筹推进数字中国、数字经济、数字社会规划和建设等。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;发掘数据蓝海&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;国家数据局宣布组建前，数据的重要性便已被多次强调。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月，《数字中国建设整体布局规划》印发，更早之前，2022年底，中共中央、国务院出台《关于构建数据基础制度更好发挥数据要素作用的意见》。两份文件均写进加快数字经济发展的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家发改委价格监测中心副主任王建冬的表述则更为直接。2023年4月接受媒体专访时，他曾提出，到“十四五”期末，中国数据要素流通市场规模将达到万亿元规模，是一个巨大的蓝海。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现有数据已经印证了这一说法。国家网信办发布的《数字中国发展报告（2022年）》显示，2022年中国数据数字经济规模达到50.2万亿元，总量居世界第二位，占GDP比重提升至41.5%，并继续保持着10%的高位增长速度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在北京交通大学信息管理理论与技术国际研究中心教授张向宏看来，目前中国公共数据、企业数据和个人数据的开发程度还较低，利用水平也不高，存在开发动力不足、利用活力不够的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正因如此，统一数据资源管理、激活数据效能成为国家数据局被寄予的厚望。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前接受南方周末记者采访时，竞天公诚律师事务所合伙人、数据法律专家袁立志提到，2023年1月，在一场数据要素流通主题的研讨会后，国家发改委工作人员就曾同他一起，就数据要素流通的实操问题进行沟通。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;两名领导提前亮相&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;有着明确发展目标，国家数据局在人事安排方面也有体现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月18日，国家数据局首任局长刘烈宏在第三届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛数字经济高级别论坛上首次公开亮相。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简历显示，刘烈宏生于1968年，长期在工业电子信息机构任职。1990年参加工作起，刘烈宏当过助理工程师、工程师。2004年11月，刘烈宏通过公开招聘，任中国电子科技集团副总经理，后任中国电子信息产业发展研究院院长兼北京赛迪信息产业集团公司总裁，中国电子信息产业集团有限公司董事、总经理，中国电子科技集团有限公司董事、总经理等职。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年7月，刘烈宏从企业进入政界，被任命为中央网信办副主任，任职期间力推移动行业发展和5G网络应用。2021年8月任中国联通集团董事长后，他还曾推动中国联通向数字化先锋转型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与积极拥抱数字化的刘烈宏一样，10月11日被任命的国家数据局副局长沈竹林，此前也在数字经济、电子信息和大数据推广方面有着丰富经验。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公开信息显示，沈竹林长期在国家发改委工作，曾任国家发改委高技术产业司副巡视员、高技术司副司长、创新和高技术发展司司长等职。&lt;/p>;

In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences.</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被渴慕的军训丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259426]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.infzm.com/contents/258988&quot; title=&quot;How is hard-core military training accomplished&quot;>;How is hard-core military training accomplished&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interview with Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;) and Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) as a person in charge of military training, I wanted to understand the difficulties of organizing hard-core military training, but I always failed to do so. The two schools borrowed simulated weapons and combat vehicles without much trouble. The tactical training seemed to come naturally. The local garrison area and military training and education base are willing to open their doors to the school and can deliver realistic equipment and a sufficient number of active or retired military personnel to the new students participating in the training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in addition to these objective factors, I feel that there is a strong spiritual power that allows the hard-core military training in these two universities in Guangxi to be implemented smoothly. In the minds of students participating in special warfare training, military training is not an obligation that is forced to be completed, but a life experience that is desired. One kind of person looks forward to the sense of relief when everything ends from the first day of military training; the other kind of person hopes to pursue the intrinsic value of military training and is eager to continue it even after the military training ends. I think that when I participated in military training as a student, I belonged to the former; but many training students in Guilin universities fell into the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Shen Hong was interviewed, he was a little shy. Huang Yilong, chairman of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association, often said that Shen Hong was an outstanding representative of the Red Army&#39;s demining gunners. Upon hearing such compliments, Shen Hong would either bury his head in the ground or look at the street lights in the distance, deliberately hiding his smile from me. Different from the occasional erratic expression, even if the person had already stepped out of the queue, for more than 20 minutes, Shen Hong&#39;s simulated gun was fixed on his chest in a standard gun-holding posture from beginning to end, without moving at all. Two weeks of freshmen military training and two weeks of daily association training seemed to have carved his rock-solid movements into a habit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the hardships of special warfare training, Shen Hong always downplays: &quot;There are bruises on elbows, knees, legs, and feet, but they will be over with some medicine.&quot; &quot;While leaping forward, I suddenly heard something The body cannot react to the enemy&#39;s instructions on the left and right, so I keep practicing this movement and practice harder. I will do it wrong at first, but after practicing for three or four days, I can reach the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these, the &quot;soldier&quot; Identity has more appeal to Shen Hong. He was born in Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Guangxi. He is a freshman this year and has been following war movies and spy dramas for more than ten years. Recalling the time he spent watching TV with his father, Shen Hong&#39;s tone raised a few notches, &quot;Chinese soldiers are very handsome.&quot; The first time he knew that his father, a farmer, had been a soldier was because he saw his marching kettle. &quot;That&#39;s a unique kettle in the army.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Hong is convinced that if he meets the recruitment standards, he will definitely join the army after graduation. For him, this military training is not only a required course according to the syllabus, but also a serious preparatory exercise before officially joining the army. What attracted him to join the tactical company was not only the rich firearms training, but also the &quot;soldier&#39;s pride&quot; that comes with pressure. In Shen Hong&#39;s eyes, his teammates are also &quot;people with a strong sense of family and country, who speak directly and boldly.&quot; &quot;I like to be friends with people who can tell their true feelings.&quot; He also longs for the future life in the military camp: if he is bitten by ants during training on the grass, a comrade will happily hand him a dose of ointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, it was already dark when the Guihang military training performance ended. The special operations team members who had no chance to ride in the armored vehicle during the performance climbed into the armored vehicle one by one in groups of eight or nine. They sat in a small circle on the roof of the car, arms around each other, singing songs as the chariot moved forward. Everyone&#39;s face was covered with tired camouflage makeup, but the singing was still loud. They were like battle-hardened soldiers returning in triumph. Marching to the center of the playground, the armored vehicle suddenly stopped, and the team members staggered, as if they were waking up from a dream. But when they climbed down from the car, they saw other team members sitting cross-legged under the street lamp in the distance, noisy and lively, so they ran over. The WeChat messages, photos, and words of their comrades remained forever in the camouflage-colored dream. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“最后一代务农人”：他们正在消失的技艺、生活方式与价值观]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259340]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of the fourth day after returning home during the National Day holiday, my mother and I went for a walk. We met Grandma Yang in a vegetable field near the river. She was planting radish seedlings with her hunched back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother told me that Grandma Yang is 81 years old and is the oldest person in the village. Grandma Yang’s wife has passed away many years ago. Her two sons are developing in Wuhan, the provincial capital, and she lives alone. I saw that there were daikon, carrots, beetroot, and cabbage planted in the field, so I asked Grandma Yang why she planted so many. She said, &quot;Four months later, the children all went home, and together they had 9 mouths.&quot; Zi realized that the Spring Festival would be in four months. She also added, &quot;Not only do they come back to eat during the Chinese New Year, I also have to prepare some for them to take with them when they leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing that the radishes I planted earlier were not growing very well, I asked Why, she told two reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, many farmers have gone to cities to work, many fields are deserted, bushes are everywhere, and there are many more wild boars, badgers and other animals than before. Just like the numbers of people, they have Instead of sneakily eating crops including vegetables at night, they can also freely invade vegetable fields, valleys, and sweet potato fields during the day. During the day, the old man can come to the vegetable fields with a stick from time to time to guard them and drive away wild animals. , at night, she had absolutely no choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, due to the long-term use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, the soil structure of farmland has changed. The soil has become seriously compacted, fertility has dropped sharply, and the output of various crops, including vegetables, has dropped sharply. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In fact, we can’t go back&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After telling Grandma Yang to be careful, my mother and I continued walking. There was a large field of rice fields in front of me. My mother asked me which one belonged to my family. I guessed twice, but my mother shook her head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I suddenly felt ashamed. I didn’t even know where my own farm was. Probably since I started working in 2008, every time I go home, my parents rarely go to the fields to do farm work, but stay with me. Of course, I rarely have the opportunity to go to the fields. As time went by, I forgot the exact location of the fields at home. Seeing that the rice was golden yellow, I suggested harvesting it the next day and helped cut it. Unexpectedly, my mother was very worried about my rice cutting skills. &quot;It&#39;s better to wait until you return to Guangzhou. Your dad and I will take our time. If you haven&#39;t gone to the fields for many years, it will be bad if you cut your hands.&quot; I was speechless, because the fact is that although I go home often, I rarely work in the fields. I am no longer an important labor force in the family like when I was in elementary school and junior high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I work at a university in Guangzhou. I have a long summer and winter vacation. I go home for many more days every year than other young people in the village. For example, my brother started his working career after dropping out of school in his second year of high school at the age of 17. He basically works outside all year round, except for about half a month when he goes home during the Spring Festival. My brother is 44 years old and has been working for 27 years. Now, he has bought a house in Wuhan, and his sister-in-law and two nephews also live in Wuhan permanently. The eldest nephew is studying in college, and the sister-in-law takes care of the younger nephew who is in elementary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, my family of four is in Guangzhou, and my brother’s family of four is in Wuhan. We have all been actively or passively involved in the wave of urbanization, and it is difficult for us to return. The hometown is developed or settled. In fact, we can&#39;t go back because we are no longer an &quot;agricultural population&quot; and have been engaged in &quot;non-agricultural industries&quot;, which has nothing to do with my brother&#39;s household registration in his hometown. No matter whether we enjoy the various benefits or treatment of authentic Guangzhou or Wuhan citizens, we are already veritable (new) Guangzhou people or (new) Wuhan people. Guangzhou or Wuhan is our permanent residence, and it is the place where we and our children A place to eat, drink, have sex, and have basic necessities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My brother and I are born in the 1970s. What are the people born in the 80s and 90s who are younger than us in the village doing? Where now? A small number of people have left their hometowns by studying, but most of them, like my brother, work outside all year round. What they have in common is that they are away from home all year round, and they only come home for ten and a half days during the Chinese New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are those born in the 1960s who are older than us doing? There are eight people born in the 1960s in my village. Four of them went to the city to work with their children, either taking care of their grandchildren who were in school or working for their sons who were construction workers. Two of them opened decoration companies, starting in Wuhan and Xining respectively. The last two are in the education industry. One is a teacher at a university in Wuhan, and the other is the principal of a village primary school in his hometown. It is not difficult to see that the eight people born in the 1960s have basically left the countryside and agriculture, and they all only go home during the Chinese New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people born in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s have all moved into the city and are currently working hard in the city. Do they have any plans or signs of returning to the village in the future? I feel minimal. They have been in the city for many years, and their food, culture, and habits have already been highly urbanized. The post-80s and post-90s generations have experienced the rinsing of urbanization. They can no longer live without these things in shopping malls, KTVs, cinemas, fast food, and game arcades. Even Uncle Xia, who was born in 1962, said, &quot;Although I have been farming in my hometown for more than 20 years, I am no longer used to going home because life in my hometown is too inconvenient and the city is too convenient.&quot; In Northeast China Brother Wen, who works part-time, also mentioned, &quot;The winter at home is too cold and I am not used to it. I have stayed in Harbin for 32 years. Although the outdoor temperature is low, the indoors are heated and very comfortable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Farmers Vs Peasants&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It goes without saying that the only people who are still farming in their hometowns are those born in the 1940s like Grandma Yang, and those born in the 1950s like my parents. As children have gone to the city to go to school, many women have also joined the migrant workers, and the post-60s generation who went out to make a living in the early 1980s have adapted greatly to urban life. In the past, the &quot;386199&quot; army, which mainly constituted the rural population , now only the lonely &quot;99&quot; is left, and the corresponding specific groups are those born in the 40s and 50s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would like to express that this group of people is truly the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot;. In particular, the author does not use the concept of &quot;farmers&quot;. In my opinion, concepts such as &quot;farmers&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; have distinct political and identity attributes. In the context of the use of the word &quot;farmers&quot;, there are often several contrasting groups, such as &quot;which group does farmers correspond to?&quot; &quot;Farmers are in rural areas, and workers are In the city&quot;, this is not the case. In essence, they are just differences in industry or professional division of labor. There are no political or identity differences or oppositions. A similar situation exists with the word &quot;worker&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As times have changed, we are more willing to use concepts that are familiar and easier for ordinary people to accept, such as &quot;migrant workers&quot;, &quot;migrant workers&quot;, &quot;migrant girls&quot;, &quot;farmers&quot; and &quot;migrant workers&quot;. Whether they are &quot;farmers&quot; or &quot;laborers,&quot; they are all industrial workers/laborers in the true sense of the word. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The skills of farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As &quot;farmers&quot;, this group of elderly people are naturally well versed in various techniques and techniques of farming or rural areas and agriculture. They have been familiar with agricultural seasons since they were young. , know when to spring plow, when to raise seedlings, when to sow seeds, when to fertilize, when to weed, when to harvest, and what to use to store crops. They know how to use ashes from stoves or firewood piles as fertilizer, and they also know how to use human, chicken, pig and other manure as an important supplement for crop nutrients, instead of just relying on pesticides or chemical fertilizers to improve soil fertility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They will use the corner land in front of and behind the house to grow some vegetables, or reclaim idle or abandoned land in the mountains that is full of rocks or has been deserted for a long time to grow things. Before building a house or choosing a cemetery, they would ask Feng Shui masters to take a look; they invented bamboo beds for cooling in the summer, drying cages for heating in the winter, and chamber pots for using the toilet at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of them have been standard rural craftsmen since they were young, such as blacksmiths, painters, oilers, carpenters, quilters, tailors, midwives, barefoot doctors, fortune tellers, and witch doctors. When the village was renovated, they reminded young people not to easily remove the ancient trees at the entrance of the village, and strongly recommended that the old ancestral hall in the center of the village be retained. When family members have stomachaches, diarrhea, or other three diseases and two pains, they will go to the fields to find Houttuynia cordata and mugwort leaves, and use them to soak their feet, bathe, smoke them, or boil them in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no exaggeration to say that there are countless skills that they are familiar with or master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the vast majority of them have a very low level of education, with a high proportion of illiterates or semi-illiterates, but this does not hinder their deep understanding and familiarity with agricultural technology, rural memories and agricultural civilization. They may have never spoken about circular economy, ecological agriculture, intensive and economical land use, intangible cultural heritage, etc. in textbooks or propaganda slogans, nor do they know how to express them, but they have been practicing them all their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This illustrates the truth that culture and civilization often or usually have little or not much to do with educational level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; has made significant contributions to the inheritance of agricultural technology, the continuation of agricultural civilization, the harmony of families, and the country&#39;s urbanization and modernization. It is they who have succeeded their forefathers and ancestors, passing on from generation to generation, that agricultural civilization can be carried forward and passed on; it is they who guard their hometowns and rear areas so that their children and their younger generations can enter the city calmly and confidently Work hard to create a new life for the new generation; it is the kindness and hard work of them and their children that created the miracle of China&#39;s low-cost industrialization, urbanization and modernization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The lifestyle and values ​​of farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In terms of lifestyle, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; generally have a thrifty character, such as eating as little as possible and eating as much as possible. How many people eat leftovers for pigs, dogs, chickens and other livestock and poultry? Although they are very pleased with the various express delivery out of filial piety and respect for their children, they occasionally complain. They feel that their children spend money like water and spend money lavishly. . The acquisition and cultivation of thrifty character is certainly related to the most difficult and difficult years they experienced, but in that era of extreme material poverty, without frugality and frugality, there was no way to achieve the accumulation of material and wealth, as well as capital accumulation. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;capital accumulation&quot; here can be understood as &quot;without money, unable to pay tuition, even if the children are admitted to college, they will not be able to go to college. As a rural person, the biggest ambition is to &#39;jump out of the farm gate&#39; , as well as the future glory of the family and the glory of the ancestors, naturally they cannot be fulfilled.&quot; The assumption of the above statement is that children are the most important investment area of ​​the family, the expenditure on raising children is the investment cost, and the future development and returns of the children are investment income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of values, the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot; are very &quot;selfless&quot; and &quot;selfless&quot; to the extreme. The whole meaning of their lives lies in contribution and dedication. Many of them spend most of their lives or their entire lives living for others and their families. They have gone through untold hardships and have been stuck to the land all their lives. They have never or rarely left their hometowns and have been doing farm work all their lives. The so-called &quot;face to the loess and back to the sky&quot; accurately refers to their generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of them have been the main labor force in their families since they were young. They work hard and save all their lives, build houses, marry and have children, and then live frugally to raise their children and provide them with education. When the children grow up, they still think about Give your children a subsidy to share the pressure of buying a house in the city or getting married and starting a family. A few people even endured the torture of acculturation and still chose to go to the city to cook for their children and take their grandchildren to and from school when they were in their twenties. Only when their grandchildren were older could they return home to the home they had been used to all their lives. . After returning home, they finally no longer have to be busy, but they find that they have already fallen ill. Some people choose not to tell their children because they are afraid of using their children&#39;s money. Some people simply do not go to the hospital for a physical examination, fearing that if the problem is found, it will cause trouble for their children. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since they are the &quot;last generation of farmers&quot;, they are the &quot;last generation&quot;. Just like many villages that have experienced and are experiencing decline and decline, the torrent of the times will not pity them because of their hard work or hardship. them, or keep them. The exit of the old and the emergence of the new has always been an inevitable law of historical development and evolution, and no one can stop it. We can feel desolate, but we still need to let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡适之父胡铁花之死真相]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259328]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/26/cmE0watQ4X4hR3EdC4BMdX1zy6V3ZcKH0xoxzto7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/cmE0watQ4X4hR3EdC4BMdX1zy6V3ZcKH0 xoxzto7. png&quot; data-key=&quot;255537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Chuan (Hao Tiehua), the father of Hu Shi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1895, the Qing government ceded Taiwan. Hu Shi&#39;s father, Hu Chuan, was the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture at the time. Hu Shi recalled that his father was &quot;unable to &quot;Willing to release&quot; delayed medical treatment and died, and most academic circles gave a conclusion of &quot;death from illness&quot;. The author discovered from the diary of Yuan Chang, a disciple of Zhang Zhidong, that Hu Chuan was imprisoned and blackmailed by Liu Yongfu, which worsened his condition and died on the ship back to Xiamen. Liu Yongfu&#39;s final release was the result of Yuan Chang&#39;s request for Zhang Zhidong&#39;s intervention. Yuan Chang was killed in 1900 for speaking out. He was a loyal and upright person, and his record deserves attention. The content of Yuan Chang&#39;s record is consistent with Hu Shi&#39;s recollection, but the wording is slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi&#39;s father&#39;s official name was Hu Chuan, also known as Shousan and Shoushan, also known as Tiehua and Blunt Man. He experienced twists and turns in his life. He went north to Ninggu Pagoda, south to Hainan Li District, and finally arrived in Taiwan. The governor of Dongzhili Prefecture. For a long time, people have been under the impression that Hu Chuan died of illness. Luo Ergang, a disciple of Hu Shi and the famous scholar who compiled &quot;Hu Tiehua&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, also agrees with this theory. There are many people who hold this view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author also believes that Hu Chuan died of illness, but he died of an aggravation of his illness due to delays in treatment in captivity, and did not die of a normal illness. Hu Shi recalled: &quot;My father was in Taitung in charge of the defense of Houshan. Telegraphs were blocked and his salary source was cut off. At that time, he had suffered from beriberi and could no longer move his left foot. He stayed there until the third day of the fifth lunar month before leaving. Back Mountain, when they arrived in Anping, Liu Yongfu insisted on keeping him for help and refused to let him go. By June 25, he could no longer move his feet, so Liu Yongfu let him go. On June 28, he arrived in Xiamen. He could no longer move, and he died in Xiamen on July 3rd.&quot; (Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;) Hu Shi later added: &quot;But in my &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;, I stated that my father&#39;s death was due to beriberi. It can be cured. My father originally wanted to rush to Shanghai to seek medical treatment, but because Liu Yongfu refused to let him go, it was delayed for nearly two months. It was not until he was critically ill that he was let go. He arrived in Xiamen on June 28th and arrived in Xiamen in early July. He died at the age of three. My original intention (and the opinion of my late brother and late mother) is that my late father’s death was due to Liu Yongfu’s refusal to let him go.” (Hu Songping’s “First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi”, Volume 1 Page 27) The person accompanying Hu Chuan that day was Hu Shi&#39;s second brother Shaozhi, who was also responsible for carrying the coffin back home. The situation described by Hu Shi should come from his second brother. Hu Shi&#39;s addition is extremely important and is consistent with Yuan Chang&#39;s diary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Yongfu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading Hu Chuan&#39;s &quot;Taiwan Diary&quot;, he wrote to Tang Jingsong on the 6th of May, requesting &quot;to open a vacancy and return to his hometown for medical treatment&quot; and &quot;recover as soon as he obtains Yuan Shuangqiu&#39;s observation book from South Anhui Province.&quot; This diary entry proves that Hu Chuo&#39;s intention was to return to the mainland for medical treatment, and that he had frequent correspondence with Yuan Chang. Yuan Chang&#39;s official position at this time was Guangtai Road, Ningchi, Anhui Province, referred to as &quot;Wannan Road&quot;. Because he was stationed in Wuhu, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wuhu Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;, Hu Chuan was &quot;imprisoned and deprived of food&quot; by Liu Yongfu, which caused his condition to worsen. He died on the ship, and only a corpse arrived in Xiamen. Yuan Chang was a student admitted by Zhang Zhidong when he was the deputy chief examiner of Zhejiang Province in his early years. Yuan Chang&#39;s &quot;Diary of a Sanren in Bixietai Mountain&quot; collected in &quot;Diaries of the Past Dynasties&quot; has the same content as Sun Zhimei&#39;s punctuated version of &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;. It is an abridged copy of reading notes and a small number of notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the diary, in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), he met Chen Wenluo (Chen Zhongying) and recalled what happened the previous year. Yuan Chang wrote in 1896: &quot;Chen Zhongying once guarded Tainan. He talked about how his late friend Hu Shousan (biography) was an official in Taitung Prefecture. He asked Liu Yongfu for a bribe of 20,000 yuan for the commander-in-chief Liu Yongfu, but he was not allowed. He was imprisoned and had no food. Yongfu originally surrendered to the thieves. It is a true act of thieves. I went to Xia to beg the governor Zhang Gong to interrogate Liu, and released Huzhou as a pastor. Before crossing the Taiwan Strait to Xiamen, he drank wine on a ship. He was so angry that he could not pursue his ambition and became ill.&quot; (Compiled by Sun Zhimei, &quot;Yuan Chang&quot; (Diary, Volume 2, page 1224) Chen Wenluo was appointed as the prefect of Taipei in 1892. He had never been stationed in Tainan, but he obeyed the order to cross over in May. Chen Wenluo is a colleague of Hu Chuan. His official experience makes his testimony irreplaceable and authoritative, and he is closest to the historical scene. Jiawu and Yiweizhangzhidong were in charge of the governor of Liangjiang, and Wuhu Road was under the governor of Liangjiang. According to the diary, it was Yuan Chang who asked Zhang Zhidong to call Liu Yongfu to release Hu Chuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the governors of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong paid the most attention to Yi Wei&#39;s surrender. Tang Jingsong, the governor of Taiwan, and Liu Yongfu, the assistant commander of Taiwan Defense Nan&#39;ao Town, were all supported and commanded by Zhang Zhidong during the Sino-French War. , Hu Chuanze inspected the Li District of Hainan in 1887 on the order of Zhang Zhidong. These three people all have deep connections with Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in Taiwan during the Yiwei period was very complicated. Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, ostensibly complied with the imperial court&#39;s decision to cede Taiwan. He also secretly supported Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu in resisting Japan and protecting Taiwan, and provided money and weapons. However, after receiving a telegram from the imperial court to challenge him, he stopped and left Tang and Liu to their own devices. Decide on orientation. Tang and Liu were originally famous generals who fought against the French, but were misled by their fame. They initially decided to stay in Taiwan to fight against the Japanese. However, their military strength could not last long. Tang Jingsong soon sneaked back to the mainland, while Liu Yongfu was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by others. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been tricked by Zhang Zhidong. When most of the local officials had been transferred inland, it was impossible to detain Hu Chuan, the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture, to demand payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Liu Yongfu cut off support from the mainland, it was a relatively simple way to obtain military pay from local officials. After careful reading of what Chen Wenluo said about &quot;asking for bribes,&quot; I feel that it is more reasonable to interpret it as &quot;asking for salary.&quot; Liu Yongfu detained Hu Chuan and &quot;deprived him of food and drink in captivity.&quot; However, Hu Chuan had no cash in his hands, and it was very difficult to raise wages as the Japanese troops advanced deeper and deeper. Yuan Chang from Wuhu Road asked Zhang Zhidong for help and called Liu Yongfu to release him. Hu Chuan died on the ship returning to Xiamen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Chuan died because he was imprisoned by Liu Yongfu and fasted, which delayed his treatment and his condition worsened. This was not a normal death. During the Sino-French War, Tang Jingsong took the initiative to sneak into Vietnam and fight side by side with Liu Yongfu. He had a deeper understanding of Liu Yongfu. In 1884, he reported to the court through Cen Yuying, the governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, saying that Liu Yongfu &quot;valued wealth too much, treated his subordinates with little kindness, and showed no mercy.&quot; No discipline.&quot; (Page 91 of Volume 1 of &quot;The Telegram of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Unpublished)&quot;) Linking this phrase with the way he treated Hu Chuan in 1895, another side of Liu Yongfu&#39;s character becomes apparent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
