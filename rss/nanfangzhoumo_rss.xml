Sing expressed doubts, and the information quickly rose to the top of a social media trending list. &quot;Mayday&quot; has not yet responded to this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the social media blogger used human voice extraction to conduct the analysis, and the result is the blogger’s unilateral judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reporters learned this morning (December 4) that the original video and audio of the &quot;Mayday&quot; Shanghai concert have been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau Law Enforcement Team, which will review the provided audio and video content. Conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the survey results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Measures for the Self-Discipline Management of Entertainers in the Performance Industry&quot; stipulates that &quot;performers are not allowed to deceive the audience by means of lip-syncing or performing during commercial performances.&quot; The &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; also requires that &quot;Actors shall not deceive the audience by lip-synching, and the performance organizer shall not organize actors to lip-sync. No unit or individual shall provide conditions for lip-synching. The performance organizer shall send a dedicated person to supervise the performance. Prevent the occurrence of lip-syncing behavior.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the ticket price for the &quot;Mayday&quot; Shanghai concert is 355 to 1,855 yuan, and the number of attendees for the 8 concerts exceeded 360,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 13:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访国务院发研中心金研所原所长张承惠：应更好利用监管科技，避免“一放就乱，一管就死”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261808]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 13:43:41&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In 45 years, China has transformed from a small financial country to a large financial country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many financial indicators are among the best in the world. What is particularly commendable is that the stock of green loans ranks first in the world, and digital financial innovation has always been at the forefront of international peers. At the same time, both the bond market balance and wealth management scale rank second in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is no denying the current situation that finance is big but not strong. On its new journey from a financial power to a financial power, what leading indicators can China achieve to become a financial power? At the same time, risks always accompany the development of the financial industry. In the new process of deepening reform and further high-level opening up, how to resist the transmission of international financial risks? How to resolve local risks and avoid internal systemic risks? How can financial supervision improve efficiency in the digital era? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, Southern Weekend conducted an exclusive interview with Zhang Chenghui, former director of the Financial Research Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council. She is currently the executive director of the China Society of Modern Finance and a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee of Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance. Zhang Chenghui has been engaged in financial research for 30 years. He has participated in more than 30 major and key projects of the Development Research Center of the State Council, including the &quot;Overall Concept of Financial System Reform&quot;, and presided over dozens of projects such as &quot;Research on the Supervision, Control and Management of China&#39;s Money Market&quot;. , won many awards such as China Development Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend, she said that building a financial power must meet at least five conditions, such as: financial institutions must be internationally competitive, the RMB must become a mainstream international currency, and China&#39;s financial market must be in the international financial market. They must have a say in formulating rules. She also hopes that, with the rapid development of digitalization, technology should be better used to improve regulatory efficiency after the regulatory system is established, the regulatory framework and regulatory policies are clear. The use of modern regulatory technology can, to a certain extent, avoid the situation of &quot;if you let it go, it will lead to chaos, but if you put it under control, it will die&quot;, and better improve the efficiency of financial institutions in serving the real economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zhang Chenghui, former director of the Financial Research Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council, current executive director of the Modern Finance Society of China and member of the Strategic Advisory Committee of Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance.

This period was a critical period for China to promote the reform and opening up of the financial industry. What&#39;s the thing that impressed you most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was transferred to the Development Research Center of the State Council in 1993. I initially studied finance in the Macroeconomic Department because there was no Established a financial research institute. Since 2003, I have served as deputy director and director of the Institute of Finance. So far, I have been engaged in research work on financial reform for thirty years. What impressed me most during this period was attending the first national financial work conference in 1997 and listening to the passionate unscripted speech of the then State Council leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;>;Why this meeting deep impression? &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;span>;The general background of this meeting is that after China&#39;s reform entered the fast lane in the 1980s, the original administrative controls were relaxed, but the regulatory logic and regulatory structure in line with market rules have not yet been established, which has led to financial disorder and financial risks. The three typical problems at that time were random fund-raising, random financial institutions and financial business. In terms of market access management for financial institutions and quasi-financial institutions, various financial markets such as bill markets, regional over-the-counter securities markets, and futures markets have flourished everywhere. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around the core of controlling financial chaos, this meeting introduced a series of measures, focusing on rectifying and standardizing financial order, preventing and resolving financial risks. For example: the People&#39;s Bank of China reformed its own institutions; approved the establishment of the Central Financial Working Committee; canceled the control of loan limits of state-owned commercial banks; issued special treasury bonds in a targeted manner to replenish the capital of state-owned commercial banks by 270 billion yuan; replenished the capital of commercial banks; established The four major asset management companies, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The series of decisions made at this meeting are of far-reaching significance. For example, the approval of the establishment of the Financial Working Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China not only shows the importance of financial work, but also strengthens the party&#39;s leadership over financial institutions. This is a big reform; the central bank&#39;s restrictions on the loan quota of commercial banks are cancelled, and the restrictions on commercial banks&#39; loan quotas are replaced. Banks implement asset-liability ratio and risk management, and the regulatory model is closer to the direction of market economy development; capital replenishment of state-owned banks and the establishment of four major asset management companies have laid the foundation for solving the problem of deterioration of the balance sheets of the four major state-owned banks. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It now appears that these measures laid a solid foundation for domestic financial stability at that time. During the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, some Southeast Asian countries suffered heavy losses, but the domestic financial market was not directly affected, and the finance and economy continued to remain stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reports are often years ahead of reality because they are forward-looking&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;>;China has been promoting financial reform and opening up. Financial reform has also been one of your main research directions. Among the major key projects that you have participated in or chaired by the Development Research Center of the State Council, which research reports have given you a particularly sense of accomplishment? Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;span>;The State Council’s positioning of the Development Research Center is “four characteristics”, namely forward-looking, strategic, overall, and comprehensive. Therefore, one of the characteristics of our reports is that they are forward-looking. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among our many reports on financial risk prevention, capital market reform, small and medium-sized enterprise financing and green finance, the most fulfilling one was completed with my colleagues during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Asian Financial Trends Tracking Report. At that time, the Development Research Center of the State Council selected eight Ph.D.s to set up an Asian financial trend tracking group, and I was one of the members. As an advantage, the Information Center of the Development Research Center of the State Council began to establish an information system in the 1990s. This is the first among government departments, allowing us to track overseas financial trends in real time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We work overtime every day, producing one report or even two or three reports in one or two days on average, reflecting international financial trends in a timely manner and putting forward response suggestions. These reports were promptly delivered to the prime minister or deputy prime minister in charge. These reports were later compiled into two books. This was the first time since my country&#39;s reform and opening up that China had to deal with a financial crisis originating overseas. Some of our suggestions played a good role at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second thing that gives me a sense of accomplishment is that I organized and wrote several reports on the full circulation of China&#39;s stock market in 2002, and conducted an in-depth analysis of the congenital institutional defects of the capital market, namely split shares. Call for the advancement of equity split reform in the capital market. It was in 2005 that the State Council made the determination to promote the share-trading reform. The third is that based on the examination of international experience and in-depth research on the domestic financing guarantee industry, it was found that my country&#39;s commercial financing guarantee system is not sustainable, and it is recommended to establish a policy financing guarantee fund at the national level. This suggestion was later adopted and implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because we are forward-looking and because reform decisions require careful design, our recommendations often precede the implementation of policies by several years. In addition, I write a lot of reports, so I don’t pay much attention to the implementation of each report. &lt;strong>;Financial risk prevention needs to be considered in a specific context&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In addition to the major reform and opening up In addition to this topic, you have also participated in or chaired research on many major topics on financial risk prevention. Why is there so much focus on this aspect? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is very important to China. If financial risks cannot be controlled, all opening up and deepening reforms will be empty talk. Once financial risks detonate and systemic financial risks occur, it is a financial crisis, which will have a huge impact on a country&#39;s wealth, economy, financial order and financial markets. Risk prevention is the first concern of all regulatory authorities in the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are some dialectical relationships that need to be handled here. For example, how to properly handle the relationship between financial openness and financial risks, and how to properly handle the relationship between economic development and financial risk prevention and control. In different periods, the forms and degrees of risk are different, and the strategies and measures to deal with risks are also different. Therefore, attention to this area is a dynamic and dialectical work that needs to be considered within a specific historical context. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the first National Financial Work Conference, every government has paid great attention to the issue of financial risks and invested a lot of energy and resources in preventing and resolving financial risks. As a national think tank, the issues that the leaders of the State Council are concerned about are the focus of our research. Therefore, the prevention and resolution of financial risks has always been one of the important contents of our research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the 45 years of reform and opening up of the financial industry, our country has been affected by international economic crises or financial crises many times. , but there is no internal systemic financial risk. What do you think is the main reason? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Over the past forty years, there have definitely been local or certain industry risks. Being able to deal with local risks in a timely manner will have a positive impact on the entire industry. There has been no major impact on the financial system, which is an important achievement of China&#39;s financial supervision. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two main reasons: First, my country has controlled the pace of opening up the financial market and opened up to the outside world in a more prudent and steady manner. When the country does not have regulatory capabilities and financial institutions are not competitive, hastily opening the market will only bring many opportunities for international financial predators and put great pressure on domestic financial stability. This is the case in some Southeast Asian countries. National history lessons. In contrast, my country&#39;s opening up to the outside world is prudent and steady. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, after the risks are discovered, the central government’s macro-control is relatively powerful and can deal with and resolve the risks in a timely and effective manner. Taking the four major state-owned commercial banks as an example, after undergoing three major steps: financial restructuring, corporate governance reform and capital market listing, state-owned banks have successfully resolved financial risks and ushered in a new stage of reform and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Better use of financial technology and regulatory technology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The Central Financial Work Conference proposed, There are still many hidden economic and financial risks, and we must persist in preventing and defusing risks. In addition to strengthening supervision, what do you think can be done more effectively? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, it must be clear that as long as you engage in finance, there will always be risks. Because the essence of finance is to allocate financial assets across regions, time, and markets. In this process, risks such as maturity mismatch and risk-return mismatch will definitely arise. The key is how to manage financial risks. Secondly, financial supervision is to prevent individual, small-scale financial risks from spreading and developing into regional risks. Sometimes regional risks are unavoidable, so it is necessary to prevent them from becoming systemic risks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the financial history of various countries around the world, there was no financial supervision at the beginning. It is precisely because of the risks that it has had a great impact on the economy and finance. Slowly, countries have begun to establish and improve financial supervision systems. What financial supervision needs to solve is how to better handle the relationship between efficiency and risk so that finance can better serve the real economy. We can neither control financial institutions in order to control risks, nor allow them to engage in various self-liberating financial innovations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the construction of a regulatory system is very important. Today, with the rapid development of digitalization, after the regulatory system is established, the regulatory framework and regulatory policies are clarified, technology should be better used to improve regulatory efficiency. The use of modern regulatory technology can, to a certain extent, avoid the situation of &quot;if you let it go, it will lead to chaos, but if you put it under control, it will die&quot;, and better improve the efficiency of financial institutions in serving the real economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, the Financial Regulatory Authority of Singapore established a chief technology officer. The latest establishment of my country’s State Administration of Financial Supervision includes a chief risk officer, chief prosecutor and chief lawyer, but does not have a chief technology officer. I feel a little regretful. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Have a say in the formulation of international financial rules&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Since the reform and opening up, China has grown from a small financial country to a big financial country, and many of its financial indicators are among the best in the world. Which financial indicators do you think deserve special attention? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After more than 40 years of reform, opening up and financial development, my country has transformed from a weak and small country to a big financial country. The scale of our financial market, the size of financial institutions and the number of financial assets rank among the top in the world. This is something to be proud of. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, China is now the world’s largest deposit market and loan market, the world’s largest commercial banking system, the world’s second largest insurance market, the world’s second largest bond market, and the world’s second largest Wealth management market. The 2023 Top 1000 World Banks released by the British &quot;Banker&quot; magazine shows that ICBC, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China have ranked among the top four for the sixth consecutive year. Overall, China holds 32.67% of the world&#39;s first-tier capital and 27.69% of its assets. China&#39;s finance has become an important force that cannot be ignored in the international financial market. In addition, China’s financial technology is also far ahead of other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The Central Financial Work Conference proposed for the first time that we should speed up the construction of a financial power. What is the most fundamental difference between a financial power and a financial power? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A few years ago, I did relevant research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that a financial power must meet at least the following five points:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, financial institutions must be internationally competitive. At present, most of the business of major domestic financial institutions is concentrated in the domestic market. The business volume in the international market is not large, and the competitiveness of profitability is relatively insufficient. For example, in the field of wealth management, domestic asset management institutions have basically no reputation among their international peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the RMB must become a mainstream international currency and be more widely accepted by the international financial market. Data released by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication show that in September 2023, in the ranking of global payment currencies based on amount statistics, the RMB accounted for 3.71%. Although this proportion has set a new historical record, it is 40% more than the US dollar and 20% more than the euro. There is still a big gap in the proportion of %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, China’s financial market is influential in the international financial market. At present, the domestic commodity market and gold market have begun to have some influence in the international market, but there are still quite a few commodities that lack pricing power in the international market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, on the premise of effectively controlling risks, it can attract international capital to enter our country&#39;s capital market and capital market, serve the real economy and promote financial development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifth, we must have a say in formulating rules for international financial markets. For example, financial regulatory rules, ESG standards, etc. To achieve this goal, you must first do your own things well. Only by doing better than others can you have a say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Central Financial Work Conference proposed that “efforts should be made to promote high-level financial opening up” ” and “steadily expand institutional opening up in the financial sector.” What do you think are the differences between &quot;high-level openness&quot; and &quot;institutional openness&quot; compared to the past? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>; &quot;High-level opening up&quot; focuses on the market access level, opening up to foreign financial institutions including capital markets, capital markets, insurance markets, etc. Factor markets have lower entry thresholds and fewer constraints than before; institutional opening up must be based on international economic and trade rules and international financial market rules to form some institutional environments that are conducive to China&#39;s opening up to the outside world, especially high-level opening up to the outside world, and improve China’s institutional supply capacity. At the same time, the role of rule-maker is transformed from participant to rule-maker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a dialectical relationship, &quot;high-level opening to the outside world&quot; is the premise of &quot;institutional opening to the outside world&quot;, and institutional opening to the outside world is the guarantee of &quot;high-level opening to the outside world&quot;. Compared with the opening of commodity and factor markets, institutional opening is a higher level of opening and is an inevitable choice to achieve high-level opening to the outside world. Through institutional opening, we can further deepen the connotation of high-level opening up and improve the quality of opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If China wants to transform from a financial power to a financial power, what do you think it should do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Chenghui:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How to build a financial power is a big topic. I can&#39;t answer in a few sentences. To summarize at a high level, in one sentence, we must further deepen reform and opening up in the financial sector. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Chen Meixi also contributed to this article.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 13:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杨宝璋：平生就会说个相声丨逝者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261262]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/Dd34cho2HqZvGA39Sg3sgxnASTbJoXvgeQ5P3IhT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;778&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Dd34cho2HqZvGA39Sg3sgxnASTbJoXvge Q5P3IhT. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259266&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yang Baozhang (1925-2023), Henan cross talk actor&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The life of cross talk master Yang Baozhang is very similar to the script of traditional opera: he comes from a poor family and does not study hard. He often goes to Kaifeng Xiangguo Temple not far from his home to listen to cross talk, and he becomes famous. Fascinated, he finally gave up on literature and art and became a crosstalk actor. At that time, it was still the Republic of China, where storytelling, singing, juggling and fortune-telling were all commonplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Baozhang was in his teens and had no professional training. He formed a team with several other car repairmen and hairdressers who were fond of cross talk. In 1943, Tao Xiangjiu, a famous crosstalk artist from Beijing, came to perform in Kaifeng, and Yang Baozhang officially became his apprentice. After he opened the business in 1945, he stopped going to school. He got up early and memorized the passages &quot;Geographic Map&quot;, &quot;Reporting the Names of Dishes&quot; and &quot;Eight Screens&quot; three times every day. Once the technology is over, the cultural foundation becomes thin again. There is a passage in &quot;Eight Screens&quot; written by Zhuge Liang to Cao Zhen. Yang Baozhang only knew how to recite it but did not understand the meaning. He did not know many words in &quot;Geographical Map&quot;, and he had been reading &quot;Quebei River&quot; for many years. When talking about these in his later years, Yang Baozhang, who has become a master, does not hide it. He came from a grassroots background and has never left the folk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s and 1970s, he could no longer talk about cross talk, so he went to the construction site and made cement. The foreman knew that he was good at jokes, and in turn advised him to save his energy during the day so that he could have the energy to talk long stories at night. . At that time, there was no stage decoration. There was a light in the barn, and there were cows and horses around. You could stand or sit in any position. If someone listened, you would open your mouth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 10 years of doing this, my performance style has become more simple and natural. Although what he talks about is all literary, such as &quot;Su Dongpo Eats Fish Three Times&quot;, &quot;Confucius Eats Yuanxiao&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Liu Luoguo&quot;, they are either historical allusions or intellectual jokes, but Yang Baozhang can always speak in a homely and homely way without leaving any trace. After the 1980s, Yang Baozhang resumed performing. In 1993, he was invited by CCTV to record 20 episodes of the stand-up comedy &quot;The Legend of Liu Luoguo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many famous crosstalk masters have passed away, and Yang Baozhang has become almost the only living fossil in the crosstalk world. In 2010, Kaifeng City held a &quot;Celebration of 86th Birthday Celebration for 68 Years in the Arts&quot; event for Yang Baozhang. Yu Qian went to celebrate his birthday, and Yang Baozhang performed a piece of &quot;Ghost Story&quot;. When Yu Qian returned, he sighed: &quot;Master Yang has so many things in his belly.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On his 90th birthday, Guo Degang also went to celebrate his birthday. During his speech, he joked: &quot;I will definitely come to Mr. Yang&#39;s 90th birthday. Today I have promoted a commercial performance worth 80 million.&quot; &quot;Two years later, courtesy reciprocated, Yang Baozhang went to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of Deyun Society. When he came on stage, he threw away the &quot;baggage&quot;: &quot;In order to participate in this event of Deyun Society, I recommended a 160 million yuan. Tang Hui, why? It’s the acupuncture point set by my senior brother Baolin, and I don’t dare to go there!” Hou Baolin is also a famous master of the Bao generation, and he left Hexi in 1993. Two things in one sentence made the audience burst into laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 12, 2023, Yang Baozhang still could not escape the &quot;tang meeting&quot; and passed away. According to actor Yi Cun&#39;s recollection, Yang Baozhang lost his hearing and speech in his later years and relied on others to take care of him for food and movement. Fortunately, his descendants did their best and Yang Baozhang died peacefully. His funeral was simple and simple, just like what he often said during his lifetime: &quot;I am an artist.

Throughout the 19th century, old Russian literature and paintings gradually entered the golden age, Tolstoy is reflected in Liteng, that is, literature and painting. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This is an exhibition that has been&quot; long -lasting &quot;. After a epidemic, these precious works finally appeared in Wuzhen, Jiangnan Water Village on November 11, 2023. In order to borrow exhibitions, Chen Danqing got in touch with the Moscow National Lev Tolstoy Museum in 2018. In the letter to the curator, he wrote: At my age, I have no chance to see Tolstoy himself, but I write to you now, it feels like I am writing a letter to Torstai ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/29/riqziyhn4H8RX2PAZXCBW7YJWPIED9AFQFGOOHPM.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 634 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/ms/medias /Image/23/11/29/Riqziyhn4H8RX2PAZXCBW7YJWPIED9AFQFGOOHPM .jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259999 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;&quot; Tolstoy is in the cultivation land &quot;(copy of the original work), cloth Noodle oil painting, Andreyev Vladimir Ivanovic, 1887, collection: National Lev Tolstot Museum &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; When Liebin meets Lev &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Chen Danqing said that Mu Xin&#39;s desk was placed three or five frames of the world&#39;s literary photos all year round, of which Toron was placed. To Russian literature, to Tolstoy, Mu Xin was convinced. He once said envy: Look, the beard is densely densely literary. But as the painter&#39;s Muxin look down on Russian painting, including Rinbin, &quot;His paintings have hidden Fan Kuan and Ni Yan&#39;s world, impatiently the bulky and complicated Russian painting.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;But to me It is another experience. I started to read Tolstoy and Copper Pinbin at the age of 13. I never thought that one day I could see their original work, and I could invite their true traces to Wuzhen and share with you. For me, come to me. Come on me. Come on me. Said, this is a very special exhibition. &quot;Chen Danqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For several generations of Chinese readers, the name of Lev Tolstoy has a considerable amount, and it also carries many imaginations, which is &quot;a giant of the history of world literature.&quot; In the minds of many people, Tolstoy is the elder of the body, including Libin. When Liebin first saw Tolstoy in the big horn in Moscow in 1880, he was taken aback and realized that he was deceived by the pictures and portraits he had seen in the past. He always thought that Tolstoy was a tall noble count, but the Tolsta in front of him was like a weird man and evangelist. He was short, but he had a huge size! Store a gray beauty, wearing a long black regular dress. The paintings of Pinbin quickly realized that it was this huge cranial brain that made Torstai look tall and burly in portraits -people would judge his height from the usual head -to -body ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lenbin also played the same visual errors. Tolstoy in his pen still gives people a tall and towering impression, plus his deep, hard -working expression on his face , Again a sense of morality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For the first time to meet, Tolstoy left a deep impression on Lenbin. Later, Lenbin recalled the situation when they met: Tolstoy was excitedly speaking throughout the process. What is the misery in life, and people&#39;s usual indifference. This strange and weird man is also a firm evangelist. &quot;He speaks deep and sincere ... He is excited because of his excitement, a bad mood, and a sad tone in his voice. The eyes are flashing with green light. &quot;The writer&#39;s strong personality and extremely radical remarks made Libin feel fresh and creepy,&quot; as if we were on the eve of the last trial. &quot;He went home that night, and he insomnia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/q2uhm806kb5oj7cxtoatyv5hlnembzh.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;691&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/q2uhm806kb5oj7cxtoatyv5hlnemuidnybzh.jpg =&quot; 259998 &quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Tolstoy and Liebin sitting on the armchair of the former residence hall of Jasania Polya, photos, Sophia Andreyerya Tolsta , 1908, Favorites: National Lev Tolstoy Museum &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Lord of the Earl of Piece &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The curator Wo from the National Lev Tolstoy Museum of Moscow Volosevicholesia said that when Pinbin and Torstai just met, Tolstoy was close to 50 years old, while Libin was only 35 years old. Achievements can basically be equivalent to Tolstoy&#39;s literary achievements, but in the first 10 years they knew, Lenbin looked at Tolstoy to look up, just like looking up at God. Lenbin once said: All Tolstoy said that he should be carved with gold. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; After 10 years of acquainted with Terbin and Tolstoy, he got the opportunity to paint for Tolstoy. In 1891, when Lenbin came to the Poliangina Manor where Tolstoy was located, Tolstoy he saw was completely civilian. The county, one of the counts in the province, now never wear a dress. He wore a family. The black short shirt trousers, the fabric is rough and the old, wearing a white hats with a very hard wear on the head, and wrapped in slippers with bare feet. But Lenbin felt that his appearance was even more respectful than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tolstoy does not like his private life and is disturbed, nor does it like someone to draw a portrait for him, but the exception to Lenpert, because Cenbin is his eldest daughter Tagana&#39;s good friend, Tajiyanna is also an artist, loves painting, and is deeply influenced by Renbin. They have maintained frank communication and friendship for a long time. Tolsta can tolerate Lenbin from his home manor. At first, he was completely to face his loved daughter, but later, Lenbin won his recognition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is precisely because of this recognition that Lenbin can contribute to the image of Tolsta that has never seen a literary man who has never seen it: a skilled use of a knife and cable, driving away the horse gang gang Widow plowing farmers. Toning farmers are Tolstoy&#39;s best entertainment and relaxation -it is said that every time Tolstoy finishes the farmers returning to the table, the mud full of legs and the smell of horse dung on the body make the whole family secretly suffer, and his wife Sofia will meet. Complaining that he spoiled her good carpet, and had to open the windows to ventilate, letting the odor flutter, and did not affect the whole family&#39;s meals. When Lenbin sketched for him, he also clearly noticed that farmers and villagers who had passed the road showed a lot of wondering and ridicule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lenbin asked to try plowing. He soon defeated, and his painter&#39;s clever hand could not deal with heavy farm work. Libin is very diligent and he has been working in Poliangina Manor. He never felt that he was a genius and thought that everything he was based on hard work. &quot;He doesn&#39;t want to waste it for a minute, and he is working at every moment. He said that I have such an excellent opportunity, so close to Torstai, I should portray the master of this master every minute.&quot; Ao Lesia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fzCTMHHHHH1KB6RCDH0OHHCUBBYICFASBF.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;747&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/FZCTmHWphh1kB6RCDH0OQOH6MhhcubbYYICfaSBf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259997&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Tolstoy &quot;of the Muxin Art Museum&quot; Tolstoy in Liebin&#39;s pen &quot;, Tolstoy and Lenbin&#39;s handwriting &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Provide/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Bathing together and praying together &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; It is this kind of close companion that allows Liebin to draw Ter in the field of fields Stey, Tolstoy who writes in the study, Tolstoy, who is with his family, Tolstoy who is listening to music, Tolstoy who participates in the census, and Tolstoy who is with the poor Tolstoy in prayer ... Especially precious, Tolstoy usually does not let anyone see him praying alone in the forest, but Lenbin caught this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tolstoy allowed Lenbin to accompany him to take a bath in Russia, and the bath was in a very cold river. As soon as he walked out of the courtyard, Tolstoy would take off his homemade slippers, and walked quickly with his feet. Catching him on his footsteps. The emergency army of the two Russia came down, and when they arrived at the river, they were already sweating. Lenbin suggested that he was sweating for a moment, and he would have a cold when he jumped into the ice water immediately, and Tolstoy had quickly taken off his clothes and jumped into the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;This is all prejudiced, and nothing will happen.&quot; Toron said the huge head out of the ice water. Liebin was sweating yet, Tolstoy had already taken a bath and put on clothes, picked up the basket and picked mushrooms. The body that disappeared in the forest left a very extraordinary impression on Renbin: &quot;It is like a tramp with a basket in the woods and the spirit of soldiers.&quot; Lenbin wrote in the later memoirs. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Every time in the woods, Tolstoy asked a person to go away for a while. He told Renbin that he would stand alone in the depths of the dense forest. This kind of monk -like spiritual homework often passed the bell unknowingly. Finally, Libin had courage to ask whether he could hide his long prayer and sketching after he could hide in the bush. He was ready to be discussed. But Tolstoy opened his grace: &quot;Ah, there is no immorality. And in painting with me, I am now like a girl who has lost chastity and shame. Relationship! Painting, as long as you are necessary. &quot;At this point, Libin has completely won Tolstoy&#39;s trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the exhibition hall, you can see the prayer Tolstoy, from the initial sketch to the final oil painting, Liebin painted for 10 years, and Tolstoy in the painting Attacking the white robe, barefoot, and pairing in the belt with both hands, his expression was solemn and solemn as a monk. In his pocket, there was a thick book with a red cover, which could not see whether it was the Bible. Tolstoy believes that believers should often communicate with God, rather than sticking to rituals. He denies those superficial rituals on the surface. When Lenbin was finally on display this &quot;Tolstoy Prayer&quot; in 1906, Tolstoy was cleaned up by the Orthodox Church from the Religious Council because his view was not in line with the doctrine. Students, they prayed alone, praying alone, putting flowers around the portraits, and silently expressing their support for Tolstoy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/y2j1xeqocdabbfrbv6kpwze542.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;712&quot; height = &quot;960&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/y2j1xeqqocdabbfrbv6kpwze542.jpg =&quot; 260000 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; p style = &quot;colorRor : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Tolstoy of Life &quot;, cloth oil painting, Liebin, 1912, collection: National Lev Tolsta Museum &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; He Drawing Tolstoy after death &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In promoting Tolstoy&#39;s image to the world, Lenbin contributed. It is because of him that Tolstoy&#39;s appearance appeared in Russia’s On many daily necessities, it has become a well -known idol ICON: calendar, cover, prints, and even chocolate sugar paper ... Tolstoy started to spread his portrait on a large scale at the beginning, especially in favor of exposing his plowing ground, but In the end he gave up. He said to Lenbin: I respect you, after all, you are a great painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有意思的是，列宾在回忆录中多次写到托尔斯泰的笑容多么有感染力，当他策马狂奔的时候又是多么意气风发的愉快，但在他笔下， There is no portrait with a portrait of Tolstoy. It is always a serious, staring, viewing and deep face. It seems that this is the spirit of Tolstoy&#39;s spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1907, Libin returned to the Poliangna Manor again to see Tolstoy in the twilight years. This year Toron is 79 years old and can still rush. Libin once again portrays him. This important portrait that completed in 1909 almost set the last look of Tolstoy&#39;s life before his life. He was sitting in a pink armchair. He had all white hair, his face was prestigious, simple and solemn, his eyes were far away, his eyes were almost transparent. Lenbin did not draw the piano around Tolstoy, and did not draw people who were playing the piano. His Toton may be listening to music, maybe just immersed in his own world with music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lenbin describes Tolstoy&#39;s appearance in the last few years of life: &quot;looks like the chief of West Xuya&quot;, &quot;The unshakable look -the statue of alive in the Stone Age&quot;, &quot;How strange! High cheekbone, a rough nose with a ax cut knife, the chaotic long beard, the big ears ... the eyebrows on the eyes are the same as the crustacean, the appearance is terrible, and the prestige is. It has already destroyed any tools to promote violence. Their armed forces are just a docile belief in defending peaceful life and free spirit &quot;,&quot; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Tolstoy &lt;/span>;) I show their spirit to defeat the selfish desire of life with their own personality and complexion. . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Tolstoy in this period, with selfless love for the poor, and thinking about social unfairness, is preparing for the natal ser just served, dedicated family wealth and the final out of the way. Pinbin felt that it was because of the long -term communication that made this old man who was full of scary passion became calm in the final stage of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You have to pay attention to these two paintings, this portrait (&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; &quot;&lt;/Span>;) was painted one year before Tolstoy&#39;s death. After Tolstoy&#39;s death, he drew another (&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Stkaiti ; &quot;>; Tolstoy of Life&quot; &lt;/span>;), Tolstoy is in heaven, Tolstoy is going to see God. &quot;Chen Danqing pointed out the two most eye -catching masterpieces in the exhibition hall, and Between these two masterpieces, he hung Renbin&#39;s self -portrait. &quot;In this exhibition hall, when you stare at Renbin, please note that more than a century ago, the painter was staring at the great Tolstoy.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The two paintings are far away in the exhibition hall. The pink armchair, corresponding to the pink flowers on the right, Tolstoy stood in the pink glow, standing down, and seemed to be frank to God and the world. Non -human face, dusk, but new. Among all Tolstoy painted in Lenbin, no one has so many dazzling bright colors. Tolstoy stared at the sky in a bright one, and once again saw what we could not see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sketching, sketching, repeated sketching, and then creating oil paintings based on sketching. Prior to this, this was the path of realistic painting in Lenbin. A series of small drafts and sketches on Tolstoy&#39;s Poliangina, crossing the loyal path. This is also the path of Russian painting and Russian literature. However, there was no evidence that Tolstoy had a picture of the portrait of &quot;Torstai on the other side of life&quot; before his lifetime. The Sri Lanka had passed, and the realist giant Ribin lost his model, but in the end he drew the appearance of Tolstoy&#39;s soul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[重庆检察机关依法对焦小平涉嫌受贿案提起公诉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261795]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-04 10:07:08 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; Reporter today (4th) learned from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate that the former member of the party committee member and deputy commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , Jiao Xiaoping, the former deputy general manager of China New Group Corporation, was suspected of accepting bribery.

At the shooting scene of a hotel at Hengdian, the plot was slapped the actor. Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming, &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; to notify -when the news of the micro -short drama came, the free screenwriter Deng Zhuye just returned to Dali from the Hengdian visit. She was a reminder through the creator WeChat group. Realize the seriousness of the problem: Don&#39;t be sloppy, you must take it seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the critical moment of this industry, she urgently adjusted the script, and on the other hand, she could still feel the red fire of the entire short drama market. &quot;Everything is missing, and the production has always been recommended by my writer.&quot; Deng Zhuye said that the country introduced governance measures, indicating that the market size of short dramas has begun to be valued by the outside world. &quot;If it can be regulated in the future, it is a good thing.&quot; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the morning of November 15, 2023, the China Internet Audiovisual Program Service Association said that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television will carry out a one -month special rectification of online micro -drama. This series of rectifications will be exposed to a hidden but vigorous cultural industry in the public view: in 2021, the number of micro -short dramas in the year is 398, and the number in 2022 is close to 2,800 units, an increase of 600%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The special rectification is a cluttered and disorderly barbarous situation, but the entire industry is still in the high -speed development stage of &quot;big dry and fast&quot;. While the producer adjusts the script and standardized content, some major directors, actors and big companies are also actively engaged in the short drama industry, while the pace of entering the overseas sinking market is also high. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;Black Big Black Virgin&quot; is not allowed &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In fact, the competent authority has undergone multiple rounds of remediation. According to media reports, starting in late November 2022, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television focused on three months to organize the special rectification work of network micro -drama. As of February 28, 2023, a total of pornographic, bloody violence, and low style were low -line offline. There are more than 25,300 micro -drama such as aesthetic vulgarity and other content, &quot;the deterrent effect has been formed, which has effectively curb the trend of barbaric growth of the Internet micro -short drama.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recently, the short drama industry has ushered in a wave of rectification. On November 16th, Douyin announced the recently unpack 119 minimal micro -drama in the applet, and disposed of 1188 Douyin accounts that promoted micro -short dramas in violation of regulations; on November 18, WeChat shared the shared mini -programs in the lower applet. There are 114 short dramas, and 163 mini -program accounts that are seriously illegally released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The more sensitive themes must be greatly limited, such as crossing and extreme revenge.&quot; Lu Liwen&#39;s company is located in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, and also stepped on this wave of wind. Because the company&#39;s business has developed too fast, the transformation is responsible for &quot;receiving the script.&quot; The country has issued new policies to directly affect its business. For example, she is similar to the popular &quot;storyline&quot; like &quot;black maids&quot; and will no longer be allowed. &quot;Adjust according to the requirements of radio and television, too old stalks, and the draft is not so easy.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; She introduced to the reporter from the south weekend that the short dramas on the market are basically the same. The story in front of me, &quot;Binded in a system.&quot; The theme of the short drama is mainly concentrated in several categories such as the President of Battle, Romance, and Resessive. Lu Lv Wen said that, out of market and increasingly strict regulatory considerations, everyone generally dares not to make new attempts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So, the short drama market with severe homogeneity, the phenomenon of the theme is more serious. In order to avoid this problem, they will spread the Internet and choose the best choice in the same type of subject matter. &quot; If you can collect 100 books, we will basically sign about 10, and those who are the same subject will not be accepted again. &quot;Lu Liwen said that if the project is significant, she will go to the group to modify the lines according to the scene, and modify the lines according to the scene. Temporary changes make it more fit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;(rectification) mainly targets vulgar content such as bloody violence and pornography.&quot; Huang is always a producer of a film and television company in Zhejiang. . He recalled to reporters from the southern weekend that the rise of the short drama and the epidemic has a certain relationship. The impact of the epidemic on the traditional film and television industry is well known. In recent years, it is the rapid development period of short video platforms. During this period, the shooting of the vertical screens did not clearly clearly required the required regulations. Therefore, all kinds of exaggerated and unscrupulous drama dramas were all down, and there was a situation of chaotic expansion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He called the short drama market in this period as the first stage of brutal growth. &quot;Now telling you clearly, what can be shot and what can&#39;t be shot.&quot; Hua Ge said that in fact, national supervision has not been interrupted, and the business line of his company has been adjusting. In his opinion, short dramas, like movies, TV series, &quot;network big (online movies)&quot;, are a cultural product to meet the spiritual needs of the audience. Low -quality things &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the barbaric growth of the barren period may usher in the last climax in November 2023. On November 16th, the paid micro -drama &quot;Black Lotus Place Handbook&quot; was launched. According to media reports, the amount of paid for 24 hours will reach 20 million yuan. The ability to suck gold is staggering. The short and short drama of this aunt revenge is fast and reversed. It is regarded as a combination of &quot;Zhen Huan Biography&quot; and &quot;Yanxi Raiders&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But just less than one week after the launch, the play was removed from multiple platforms for &quot;rendering extreme revenge, adverse values ​​of violence&quot; and &quot;confusing right and wrong concepts&quot;. In front of this, the curtain of a new round of special rectification was revealed, and the short drama market farewell to the brutal and disorderly first high -speed growth stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Hengdian&#39;s short drama shooting scene.

Southern Weekend Reporter Zhao Ming, &lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; You can kneel on a marriage, and the housekeeper cannot kneel. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; The network micro -short drama rectification work of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television involves seven aspects. &quot;The Story of Creation and Production and Content of the Creation of Short Drama&quot;, and the offline contains micro -short dramas with vulgarity, bloody violence, low style, aesthetic vulgar and other content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Squatting in the WeChat group all day, Deng Zhuye kept asking the seniors to understand the spirit of the document. So, what kind of kneeling is reasonable -novice screenwriters have raised this doubt in the group. Analysis of mature screenwriters who have entered the industry for two or three years, the might of commemorating the deceased and the ancestors, as well as the marriage plot of the costume drama, all needed to kneel and need to kneel reasonably. &quot;However, in the general drama, the young master asked the housekeeper to kneel, which is obviously not allowed.&quot; Deng Zhuye explained that the policy was not a knife, and it was necessary to make reasonable arrangements according to the plot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The rectification work mainly focuses on the content. If you eat the spirit of the policy, it is not difficult to meet the norms. &quot;After a few overnight, keep changing the manuscript.&quot; After repeated self -examination and self -correction, Deng Zhuye deleted or changed the amount of money involved in his script, to prevent the possibility of &quot;showing off wealth&quot;. She said that the producer is only required to change the manuscript, and has not retired or reduced the supply because of the reduction of demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Deng Zhuye is a fan of Yu Hua and Mo Yan. At the same time, she maintains the habit of reading Western classic masterpieces. She often reads &quot;Camellia Girl&quot; and &quot;Anna Carenina&quot;. She loves literature and loves writing. She Hope to write your serious literature in the future. But now, she has to urge herself to go forward in accordance with the amendments of the production company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After a period of observation, in the view of Xing Jialin, a 24 -year -old &quot;horizontal drift&quot; actor, the industry&#39;s rectification is &quot;good news&quot; for himself, and &quot;at least the requirements of&quot; at least &#39;to wipe the edge &quot;are much less.&quot; The so -called rubbing edge refers to a soft pornographic area between the platform banning and non -blocking. In order to absorb the eyeballs, some directors will set up some naked shots. Relatively speaking, the remuneration of the edge actors will be much higher than the conventional actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The crew once sent a low -cut camisole to Xing Jialin to play a female prisoner. Sometimes, intimate dramas will be temporarily added. She believes that these lenses are wiped to wipe the edges, which has nothing to do with the plot, so it instincts generates resistance. &quot;Actually, the on -site scale is not too large, and intimate drama is also performed by borrowing, but it is disgusted.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Xing Jialin learns to perform performance, and he will ponder how to improve his acting skills. However, in the short drama studio, it is often &quot;a piece&quot;, and there is no time to let the actor memorize the lines. &quot;You can say about it.&quot; &quot;Micro -expressions, the details of the action, and cut it all.&quot; She said that there is a play that needs to push the heroine into the water with another character. The normal operation should be that the two people will have eye communication to show their insidiousness and heart. Ghost fetuses are not needed at all, the director&#39;s request is directly pushed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xing Jialin can receive the job of six or seven short dramas every month, and often has not remembered the title of the drama. The shooting has been completed. The busiest one was taken from 9 am to 6 am the next morning. In order to catch up, the director asked her not to remove makeup, so she was in the sultry studio, with makeup for 3 days, and &quot;shoot directly when wakes up.&quot; Xing Jialin had previously participated in Hengping Film and Television Drama, and also harvested the characters with lines in two major production. However, because of the starring actors, she was unable to broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Industry renovation did not stop this waterline to stop running. However, Xing Jialin did not have to doubt his acting road because he was tangled or not to wear suspenders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;On December 1, 2023, at the shooting scene of the short drama crew, the mass actor was resting on the set. .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/2ad3578e64.png &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;heart =&quot; 598 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/medias/medias/medias /image/23/12/03/2ad3578e64.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年12月1日， At the shooting scene of the short drama crew, the mass actors were resting on the set.南方周末记者赵明摄&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“老外也很上头”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;这近半个月来，过来咨询短剧出海业务的厂商，忽然多了起来。朱海聪意识到，短剧市场又到了一个新的节点。 “以前主要是头部的大公司在做（出海短剧），现在一些中小厂商也开始感兴趣。”他是深圳一家专门承制海外短剧公司的经理，短短半年多来的经历，让他不禁感慨，短剧市场真是风云变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;短剧出海已经形成风潮，而行业整治正在加剧这一趋势的发展。 “整顿是直接原因，主要是国内太卷了。”朱海聪向南方周末记者介绍，他们公司原本主要是承接国产品牌海外市场的宣传业务，在欧美有很多拍摄资源。大约在半年前，开始有企业找上门，想要拍摄网文改编的短剧，经过一番市场调研，其所在公司认定这的确是一个风口，便自然而然开拓业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地取景，当地现攒剧组，拍摄完毕，剧组原地解散。因为有多年资源积累，朱海聪所在公司很快解决了拍摄团队问题，核心问题还是东西方文化差异。 “本质上，短剧是一种文化输出，老外导演刚开始不是很能理解。”他回忆，公司承接的第一部短剧，讲述的是一个外卖小哥逆袭的故事：小哥发现女朋友和一名富二代有暧昧关系，并且受到对方羞辱，但是很快实现逆袭，打脸了这对“狗男女”。但这么简单的剧情，导演却不能把情绪饱满地传递出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不是因为这个导演没水平，恰恰可能是因为水平太高。”他解释，为了得到逆袭后的爽感，需要在男主角受辱的时候，给到眼神、表情很多特写，但是老外导演却运用了很多中景和远景，“运镜不到位，那种剧烈的冲突就表现不出来。”朱海聪不得不换了导演和摄影，才达到他满意的效果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，东西方观众在情感上依然有很强的相似性。 “会做一些本土化处理，但是内核是相通的。”朱海聪介绍，中国人一眼就能理解外卖小哥的设定，但在北美和欧洲，专职的外卖小哥并不算很多，相较而言，狼人、吸血鬼的故事外壳，老外们天然容易理解。 However, no matter what type of settings, the core of the story is general and revenge, and &quot;foreigners are also very good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“很奇怪、很离谱，但是也很上头，想知道接下来故事怎么发展。”朱海聪说，目前来自中国的短剧，已经在西方文化消费市场占据一席之地。不过，取得成功的厂商皆为“网文出海”多年的头部大公司，因为在海外拍短剧的成本，比国内要高出很多。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他介绍，在国内，二三十万元便可以拍摄一部100集的短剧，但是在北美市场，人力、物力和场租费用要比国内高出很多，一部短剧的成本折合成人民币，至少在100万元以上，而这个数字，是至少拍摄数量达到七八部以上之后，均摊之后的成本线，再加上运营、推广，至少具备千万元以上的项目体量，才可以考虑出海事宜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他留意到，观望和参与出海的短剧厂商，现在越来越多。 “这说明，国内的短剧厂商，其实发展得很快。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;横店一处短剧拍摄现场。南方周末记者赵明摄&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/fdac0abbd5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/fdac0abbd5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;横店一处短剧拍摄现场。南方周末记者赵明摄&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;大资本已经入场&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;夏夏（笔名）是从传统剧集转换到短剧赛道的编剧，经过几番内容调整，她敏锐觉察到，或许集中整治是行业向精品化过渡的一个契机。她向南方周末记者解释，传统剧集也会有逆袭情节，但是逆袭前后需要铺垫过程，剧情有主线、副线，人物有成长弧度，但是短剧不需要这些铺垫，短剧需要在最短时间内实现逆转，这个套路便是短剧的“精髓”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在短剧时代，观众的情绪需要得到“即时满足”。 “就是情绪PPT，上下PPT之间不太连贯，也都OK。”夏夏说，观众不希望看到主角受委屈、被侮辱，如果女主被打了耳光，女主老公必须立马两个耳光还回去，“没有啥逻辑，不停反转，不停打脸就可以了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你打我一巴掌，我扇你一耳光，没有人喜欢一直写这种剧本吧？”她说，行业规范后，那些特别浮夸、完全无脑、没有逻辑且脱离实际的剧集将受到限制，如果有大资本入局，吸引更优秀的人才入行，短剧的质量说不定也会水涨船高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，短剧市场的蓬勃正吸引越来越多的人才涌入。据媒体报道，不断有TVB的老艺人、老演员加入到微短剧的拍摄；而头部互联网平台也纷纷下场，拍摄短剧抢占市场。 “好演员加入，肯定会提升品质。”华哥说，头部平台的加入会对短剧市场发展产生比较深远的影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他介绍，当前短剧的主要盈利模式集中在付费观看阶段，而为了得到曝光，制作方要在平台上大规模“投流”，以获取流量，这一支出占很大成本。而大公司、大平台的加入，会带来新的分账模式以及IP孵化模式。甚至一些品牌方也在和短剧制作方直接接触，品牌植入式的短剧也在蓬勃兴起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，大资本方也越来越多地加入到这场盛宴。 “我们也在积极和私募机构接洽。”华哥说，公司会同时推进多部短剧的拍摄，手头刚刚杀青了4部，横店因为短剧市场的兴起，又是一幅欣欣向荣的场景。因为演员档期紧张，场地也有很多剧作排队，剧组经常要熬夜赶进度。所以，公司打算投资兴建两个拍摄棚，这种重资产需要大量资金投入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;华哥和剧组常年驻扎在横店。他介绍，剧本、演员就位后，一个星期便可以完成一部短剧的拍摄，早些时候，十几万元的成本便可以制作一部剧集，后来大概需要二三十万元。现在，制作成本已高达一百万元，两百万元的剧集也在大量出现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[上海独生女继承两亿遗产被诉离婚？婚姻不应成为财富再分配的工具丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261768]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;November 30, 2023, published by &quot;Shanghai Rule of Law News&quot; The article states: The woman comes from a well-off family and serves as the director of a foreign-funded company; the man is the receptionist at the hotel where the woman’s company’s annual meeting is held. The man pursued the woman fiercely, and later they got married. After the marriage, the woman&#39;s parents died in a car accident while traveling. Half a year later, the man filed for divorce and requested a division of the woman&#39;s inheritance from her parents. The woman&#39;s parents own nine properties and shops in Shanghai, as well as more than 10 million yuan in bank deposits and financial products, with a total value of about 200 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This article once reached the top of the hot search, with a main tag having more than 600 million views, and popular comments including &quot;I even suspected that the car accident...&quot; You can spend 10 million to deal with it, and I guarantee that the man will not get a dime.&quot; He also accused the man of &quot;taking advantage of the poor&quot;, and in short, scolded him for being shameless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This is actually a story told by lawyer Tan Fang. He neither gave a specific timeline nor presented credible evidence including judicial documents. Some netizens discovered that when she shared this story on Zhihu in 2022, she had the label &quot;the content contains fictional creations&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For this reason, some media interviewed Ma Lei, a partner at Tan Fang&#39;s law firm, who said that the case was real and only involved the client&#39;s privacy. , will fabricate sensitive information such as names. However, it is very common to use pseudonyms in news reports. Journalists only need to mark it in the text or at the end of the article. They will not consider themselves to be &quot;fictional creations&quot; by using pseudonyms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In summary, the authenticity of this case is doubtful and needs further confirmation. But the emotions and reactions triggered by this story are real and strong: as can be seen from the massive online comments, the public generally does not agree with and find it difficult to accept the legacy left by the man&#39;s parents and the girl&#39;s parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Moreover, there are indeed such cases in judicial practice. In March this year, the Guangxi High Court issued a property dispute case. In 2021, Zhang and his wife Wang agreed to divorce, and their daughter lived with Wang. On the grounds that Zhang failed to pay child support, Wang filed a post-divorce property dispute lawsuit with the court. During the trial, Wang learned that Zhang’s mother died during the cooling-off period of their divorce and left behind a property. Zhang sold the above-mentioned house, and Wang requested to divide the sales proceeds obtained by Zhang from selling the house. In the end, the court ruled that Zhang should pay more than 2.18 million yuan in the sale price of the house inherited by Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;During the relationship between husband and wife, it is legal for one party to request a division of the parental estate inherited by the other party. The marriage and family section of the current Civil Code stipulates that &quot;property inherited or donated&quot; is the common property of husband and wife and owned jointly by husband and wife (Article 1062). This is the default principle; only when &quot;it is determined in the will or gift contract that only one party will own it&quot; &quot;Property&quot; is the personal property of one spouse (Article 1063). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Such provisions in statutory law are intended to expand the scope of joint property between husband and wife, allowing the economically weaker party to have more property to divide in the event of divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The problem is that when marriage becomes a tool for wealth redistribution, both marriage and wealth become unsafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;As far as marriage is concerned, under statutory laws and judicial practices that expand the scope of joint property between husband and wife, if two people with a huge gap in property and income get married, the marriage will become It’s even more unstable because it promotes the stereotype that “marriage is to start a business, divorce is to get rich”. Whether it is adding one&#39;s name to the property before marriage (= giving away half of the property), one of the parents did not make a will and left an inheritance, or one party in the marriage has too strong wealth creation ability or becomes rich overnight, these are only the joint property of the husband and wife during the marriage. One party may not have substantial control and dominance, but as long as there is a divorce, the other party can actually obtain control and dominance of half of the property. If a person obtains a large amount of wealth through divorce, achieves financial freedom, and feels so happy, this will inevitably inspire evil in human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In terms of wealth, a property in first-tier cities often costs tens of millions, and is often the accumulation of wealth for at least two generations. Just because a marriage certificate costs Losing half of a house is very unfair and makes people who hold real estate in big cities very insecure. Therefore, more and more people ask for a match before getting married, or just hold a wedding without getting a certificate, so as to avoid being &quot;exploited&quot; in the event of divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Back to the issue of inheritance, it is natural and reasonable for parents to hope that their property will be left to their children or other blood-related descendants a hundred years from now. Consistent with natural law and customary law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In the absence of a will and legal inheritance, in accordance with natural law and customary law, the inheritance left by parents to their children should of course be inherited by their children. personal property. However, as mentioned above, current statutory law and judicial practice stipulate that it is joint property of husband and wife by default. If one parent dies suddenly without leaving a will, the greed of the other parent may be aroused. Through divorce, they can divide half of the other parent&#39;s inheritance, achieve financial freedom, and reach the peak of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Of course, many people believe in love, and also believe that being economically disadvantaged does not necessarily mean being morally despicable, but don’t test human nature, as long as a certain proportion of economically disadvantaged people can make progress Taking this step is enough to destroy the trust that should exist in marriage and make everyone fear marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Elderly people who are knowledgeable, educated and understand the law know what to do. Some media reports: Recently, 85-year-old Grandma Liu came to the China Wills Library to make a will and wanted to give her property to The granddaughter, son and daughter-in-law all know and agree. She said she lived a happy life in her later years and was not afraid of making a will. She was once the coach of a modeling team. The consideration is roughly like this: leaving it directly to the son is natural, but the daughter-in-law may be unhappy and complain &quot;you don&#39;t trust me&quot;; leaving the son directly to the granddaughter perfectly solves this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;China Will Library White Paper (2022)&quot; shows that 99.8% of the elderly who make wills state that the inheritance will be inherited by the children alone and does not belong to the joint property of the heirs. It is the so-called &quot;protection against daughter-in-law and son-in-law&quot; clause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In the final analysis, it is all forced by the current statutory law and judicial practice. The elderly have worked hard all their lives to accumulate real estate, and most elderly people cannot accept it psychologically if &quot;outsiders&quot; who are not related by blood and may divorce and leave at any time take away half of the house. However, more elderly people do not have this awareness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的父亲母亲丨逝者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261744]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/TzFsCURKUbpRWt7gkpHYGBoT44F4jGLOalCSSM4m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/TzFsCURKUbpRWt7gkpHYGBoT44F4jGLOal CSSM4m. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260020&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ma Guoguang (1928-2014) Zhejiang, Judge Zheng Ruyu (1930-2022) Zhejiang, Teacher&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bulging key bag suddenly became lighter, and the sale of the parents&#39; house was completed. They moved into this apartment in early 2009, and this house carries every bit of their old age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before his retirement, my father was the vice-president of a district court in Shanghai. He was 1.78 meters tall, handsome in appearance, upright and principled, and full of romantic warmth. Even when he was in pain, he would hold his mother&#39;s hand. The hand said &quot;the hand is too cold&quot;. My mother is the eldest daughter in the family. After graduating from nursing school, she took on the responsibility of raising her younger siblings. She has an easy-going personality and is less than 1.6 meters tall but seems to have endless energy. She was still tenacious before being sent to the ICU. Swallow food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let us have food to eat and eat well, which is my mother’s lifelong obsession. Materials were scarce in the 1960s, but as long as she was at home, every meal in our family would be delicious, with both meat and vegetables. Even the presentation was unambiguous. When the dishes were put into the bowl, there would be soup splashing on the edge of the bowl. She Be sure to wipe it clean before serving it. Every New Year&#39;s Day, the house is filled with the aroma of meat and rice dumplings... My mother&#39;s cheeks, red from overwork, show a smile of contentment, enjoying a rare moment of rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we got married, every weekend when we went there, she would happily take out large and small boxes and bottles filled with vegetables and soups, with &quot;food instructions&quot; written on medicine box paper attached. She said, &quot;If I have a fever one more time, you can eat one more time.&quot; In this way, she stubbornly persisted until she was hospitalized last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At work, my mother is equally serious and hardworking. After a day of housework, she often uses her chair as a table to study by herself, prepare work materials, and write teaching materials. She graduated from a nursing school and later worked as a teacher, gradually becoming a leader in the nursing discipline in Shanghai. In the 1970s, my mother signed up to support the Huaibei Medical Team. In order to travel more points, she sometimes had to walk dozens of kilometers a day on mountain roads. At that time, she was over 40 years old, and she eventually fell ill with pneumonia from exhaustion. My mother worked until she was 70 years old and retired with the title of senior lecturer. She was famous all over the world. The &quot;Nursing&quot; textbook she participated in compiled laid the foundation for the development of today&#39;s nursing field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retirement, my mother was not idle. She learned English, sang, knitted sweaters for relatives and friends, and wrote memoirs... She said, &quot;I have to do something while I&#39;m alive, so I can&#39;t live in vain.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child, every evening we would wait for my father’s tall figure to appear at the entrance of our house at the entrance of the alley. My father loved reading. In that spiritually barren era, we were delighted to get a book. After retirement, biographies of famous people became the books my father often read. He is erudite and has a strong memory, and often discusses current affairs with his colleagues and juniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, my father was sent to a ferroalloy factory to do manual labor. He had to carry dozens of kilograms of sledgehammers every day. This was a great test for him who grew up in a scholarly family. But he comes home happy every day. He sincerely mingled with the workers. At that time, our family often gathered workers and friends to talk and laugh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father was sincere, upright and aboveboard throughout his life, never ambiguous about right or wrong. In his will, he also told us to &quot;be upright and upright.&quot; He never judged people by money and status. Once, a part-time worker who had worked in our family for several years became seriously ill. He was very concerned and asked us to send money to help. This part-time worker would make a special trip to visit his father every time he returned to Shanghai for medical treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father has always kept his home spotless. In the last three months, he could no longer walk, and he still looked in the mirror to neatly style his hair. In the early summer of 2013, feeling that his life was coming to an end, he made a will: &quot;I am 86 years old, and I have no regrets...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents have gone through 53 years of ups and downs together, which is rare in my memory. They blushed, let alone argued. Our parents gave us a warm home with their lifelong efforts and love; they taught us how to face the impermanence of the world with a positive and optimistic attitude towards life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents were reunited in heaven. Our golden years as siblings are gone forever. We feel so deeply the loneliness of the soul and the sadness of being homeless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The love between parents is as deep as the ocean, and the son wants to support him but refuses to take care of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
