In China, almost no one knows his name, but his vague image is limited to a reformist politician, the author of &quot;Young China&quot;, and a father who raised many outstanding children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was born in Chakeng Village, Xinhui County, Guangzhou Prefecture in 1873. In &quot;Autobiography at Thirty&quot;, Liang Qichao used major events in Chinese and world history to find coordinates for the year of his birth: it was the tenth year after the fall of the Taiping Rebellion, one year after Zeng Guofan&#39;s death, and the third year after the Franco-Prussian War ended. Of course, when he was born, the chronology was the twelfth year of Tongzhi, Guiyou. The AD calendar was not widely adopted until the founding of New China. It was through Liang Qichao that the sayings of the 19th and 20th centuries spread in the Chinese-speaking world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was one of the first Chinese to realize the turn of the century. At the beginning of 1900, he wrote &quot;The Song of the Pacific in the Twentieth Century&quot;, predicting that the new century would usher in the Pacific Age. Chinese people in the 19th century did not realize that they were in the 19th century. Only in the 20th century will we look back with the help of new historical coordinates to describe this era of sinking, humiliation and endeavor, and salvation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1898, after the failure of the Hundred Days Reform, Liang Qichao went into exile in Japan and traveled around the world. After the founding of the Republic of China, Liang Qichao returned to China, and the main stages of his activities were in the ice drinking rooms in the capital Beijing and Tianjin. For him, his hometown in Guangdong has become as far away as his boyhood. But this does not mean that he bid farewell to his hometown. In fact, many of Liang Qichao&#39;s activities in Yokohama, Japan, North America and Australia relied on the huge support of the overseas Chinese network in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/YH8F41xHIdF3FC0Vzqv5AIn8UTkKPK3nlVfGX4Ax.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height= &quot;1055&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/YH8F41xHIdF3FC0Vzqv5AIn8UTkKPK3nlVfGX4Ax.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254309&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liang Qichao during his time in Japan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we focus on those people who have no names in history, we will find that from ten Since the middle of the ninth century, a large number of Cantonese have gone to North America and Japan. The use of steamships has enabled Cantonese expatriates to no longer just go to Southeast Asia, but to travel across the Pacific to all parts of the world.&quot; &quot;Regional Culture and National Identity: Late Professor Cheng Meibao, author of &quot;The Formation of Guangdong Cultural Concepts since the Qing Dynasty,&quot; told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;There are traces of Cantonese in every port on the Pacific coast. They have established guilds, temples, hometown associations in foreign countries, or organized themselves in the form of companies. , so when Kang Liang, Sun Yat-sen and others were active overseas, someone would contact them and arrange accommodation and itinerary. Behind the activities of these historical celebrities are decades of preparation by unknown groups.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Many people have tried to write a biography of Liang Qichao. The historian Wu Qichang of the Republic of China wrote half of it until the Reform Movement of 1898; Xie Xizhang&#39;s &quot;Biography of Liang Qichao&quot; is divided into chapters based on Liang&#39;s interactions and relationships with different historical figures; the writer Wei Wei Before publishing the novel &quot;In the Misty Clouds&quot;, she spent several years writing a biography of Liang Qichao. When she had written more than 100,000 words, she felt that the thread was too complicated, so she put it down and started writing novels first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Liang Qichao, and the second part of Xu Zhiyuan&#39;s &quot;Liang Qichao&quot; has also been published. The first part is titled &quot;Young Revolutionary&quot;, about Liang Qichao from 1873 to 1898, and was published in 2019. Xu Zhiyuan originally planned to write it in three parts, but now the writing plan has been expanded to five parts. The second part, &quot;Desperation&quot;, was written from 1898 to 1903. The complex historical clues and the many characters who interacted with the Liang family made Xu Zhiyuan feel that, It is necessary to expand his version of Liang Qichao&#39;s biography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Everyone is a contemporary.” This is how Xu Zhiyuan reminds his writing and the way each reader enters Liang Qichao’s world. Liang Qichao does not just belong to yesterday, maybe he also belongs to the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Danni, the editor of the second part of &quot;Liang Qichao&quot; told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Xu Zhiyuan&#39;s writing context is different from that of historians and scholars, not in response to a problem in a specific academic history context, but out of A very pure curiosity about another person. It is curiosity about how another scholar, who is also in a period of unknown changes between the old and the new, faces the changes and participates in them. So his Writing is a kind of writing that empathizes with others and has a sense of empathy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend conducted an exclusive interview with Xu Zhiyuan in a one-way space beside the Grand Canal in Hangzhou. Xu Zhiyuan is very busy. In addition to recording the program &quot;Thirteen Invitations&quot;, he is traveling to various cities to promote his new book. When a reporter asked how to balance Liang Qichao&#39;s ideological trajectory and social picture in the book, Xu Zhiyuan said: &quot;Sometimes I feel that there is too much about the era, and the era overwhelms the individual. Sometimes I feel that there is too much about the individual and lack of the era. Reflection, this is a process of constant searching.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/nlIotn1FEjTnSnyYbRhNNETePlneXvpjW1cgOyTs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/nlIotn1FEjTnSnyYbRhNNETePlneXvpjW1cgOyTs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254310 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In September 2023, Xu Zhiyuan talked about Liang Qichao in Hangzhou. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Pumpkin Vision)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I especially hope to have an ideological adventure with the protagonist Liang Qichao, and you don&#39;t know What will happen next? I have only written the second volume so far. His thoughts are still evolving. I am not willing to use hindsight to evaluate whether his thoughts have matured. During that time, he had Such a state of mind. I want to go back to the historical scene as much as possible to create some possibility. The writing process of this set of books does not mean that I started after 20 years of research, careful consideration, and a lot of understanding about it. Putting pen to paper, no. My understanding will continue to deepen as I write. For example, when I write the second volume, I understand him better than the first volume. When I write the third volume, I may understand him better than the second volume. But it is also possible that when you finish writing the last volume, you will realize that your initial understanding of his thoughts was not accurate because it is a larger framework.&quot; Xu Zhiyuan told a reporter from Southern Weekend. In a sense, Liang Qichao&#39;s world is already Xu Zhiyuan&#39;s parallel universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Constructing Liang Qichao’s world like a puzzle&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;There have been some previous works that discussed Liang Qichao from the perspective of intellectual history, such as &quot;Liang Qichao and Modern Chinese Thought&quot; by American scholar Levinson, &quot;Liang Qichao and the Transition of Chinese Thought (1890-1907)&quot; by Zhang Hao, etc., and you The main interest in writing a biography of Liang Qichao is to describe the social transformation experienced by Liang Qichao&#39;s generation. What do you think is the main difference between the two kinds of writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The books by Levinson and Zhang Hao were the first books that influenced my interest in Liang Qichao, and they were of great ideological enlightenment to me. . Levinson puts Liang Qichao in a larger context to view his role in Chinese tradition, covering his life in a short space. Mr. Zhang Hao&#39;s book mainly discusses Liang Qichao&#39;s ideological process before 1907. About ten years ago, I met Mr. Zhang Hao in Washington, USA. I went to his home as a guest and had a couple&#39;s lung slices together. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are ideological biographies, and what I want to write is one that is more people-centered, literary, historical, and in a sense encyclopedic. Book. I spent a lot of pen and ink not only writing about Liang Qichao, but also his contemporaries, the spirit of the entire era behind him, the changes in China as a whole, the changes in Japan, and the changes in the world, so it is more like &quot;Liang Qichao and his era&quot; . I hope to regard Liang Qichao as a representative figure in the transformation process of global modernity. He belongs not only to the Chinese tradition, but also to the tradition of Asia and the world. Therefore, I want to describe the living space and scenes behind him. I wrote a lot about him as a doer. He is not only a thinker, but more importantly, a doer. I wanted to give him a more three-dimensional presentation using a modern biographical writing method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If we want to analyze his ideological trajectory more, we will add more discussion For this part, your writing method is to use historical data as much as possible and rarely discuss it. What is the reason for this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I try not to destroy the narrative rhythm. Whether the narrative has a sense of music or a logic, I try to follow the narrative itself. The structure, the characters gradually become fuller and more vivid on each page as each volume progresses. He has his own character, which I cannot completely control and regulate, and his character is made up of those realistic characters. It is composed of materials and perhaps some of my imagination in reorganizing materials. My subjectivity is completed in the preface. Once I enter the main text writing, I hope to hide my subjective emotions behind the words. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reading the just-published second part of the biography of Liang Qichao When &quot;Desperation&quot; and &quot;Young Changemakers&quot; were published a few years ago, a large part of the reader&#39;s pleasure was that through your writing, you could build up a perception of the life experience of a part of the Chinese people more than a hundred years ago. For example, when scholars from Guangdong in the late Qing Dynasty went to Beijing to take exams, they took the sea route instead of land. They usually had to stop in Shanghai, so Shanghai naturally became a stage for their activities; for example, when they arrived in Beijing, they would stay in the hometown guild hall. What difficulties did you encounter when collecting these materials? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When collecting materials, one is to imagine his living space. For example, Liang Qichao is often abstracted into a simple ideological figure. Of course this is also very important, but he not only lived in an ideological context, but also lived in a realistic context. He was not only a thinker, but also an important witness and participant of that era, so for me, It became very important to create the context of that era. Only by better understanding the background of that era can it be easier to understand the excellence and difficulty of his actions. So I spent a lot of energy to construct the space of the times, to understand how a scholar or a scholar went to Beijing to take the exam, and what the daily life of a scholar was like. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only if you better understand the daily life of a scholar, for example, what kind of works he reads in Xuehaitang, will you understand the ideological context of his suddenly going to Japan and entering the Western context. Extraordinary. Therefore, I will describe the daily life of scholars, what it is like in Guangzhou and Beijing, and how to interact with people in the guild hall. I will rely on diaries and notes from that year, some records that seem to have nothing to do with Liang Qichao, to create a world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am very influenced by Shi Jingqian in this regard. You see when he wrote &quot;The Death of Wang&quot;, Wang did not have any records, but he used Pu Songling&#39;s novels to imagine what Shandong was like back then. The living atmosphere of the Qing Dynasty at that time. I also relied heavily on such notes and even novels at the time to construct such an atmosphere, including other candidates&#39; daily records. The second volume is to create a time and space of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Melbourne from the late 19th to the early 20th century. , but also to travel through this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I liked to read all kinds of miscellaneous books. This is the role of miscellaneous books. For example, I have read a lot of books on Australian history, and when I was writing, to describe Sydney in 1900, I had to collect a large amount of newspaper documents from that time, and probably only used a few strokes. What was the Australian overseas Chinese leader Mei Guangda like at that time? What is the situation of the Ye family in Vancouver? You need to go through all kinds of strange information, just like doing a puzzle, it may not be complete, try to put together as many pieces as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, if you write about the relationship between Liang Qichao and his wife, and how he There is very little information about a fruitless love affair in Hawaii. On the one hand, he is a precocious cultural star with social prestige that is not commensurate with his age. On the other hand, he seems to be a person who does not need an affair between his children and his wife. Don&#39;t travel with him or stay with him. Today&#39;s readers would have a hard time understanding this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was a male-centered era. For these scholars who took the world as their own responsibility, although family was very important, it was often neglected by them. The narrative is ignored and few records are left. Including overseas Chinatowns, it is basically a male world. Except for overseas Chinese leaders who may bring their wives with them, most of their families stay in their hometowns in Guangdong and Fujian. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao has been wandering around the world and has a huge emotional void. He will reveal his anxiety, loneliness and frustration in poetry. He wrote 24 love poems depicting Only when his strong feelings for Miss He are placed in such a time and space can his emotions be easily understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Youwei&#39;s emotions were even richer. He went into exile, married different wives, and had various affairs. Liang Qichao&#39;s wife&#39;s brother was his examiner. This was a family that was kind to him. However, because of his actions, his wife and the whole family were involved in danger and panic. He felt a lot of guilt in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can we say that Liang Qichao is a relatively ascetic person? Zhang Hao&#39;s book talks about &quot;self-denial&quot;, and self-denial also includes the aspect of abstinence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Liang Qichao is very emotional and very self-disciplined. His enthusiasm and desire have been greatly reflected in his actions and writing. display. If you think about it, he has written so many works and done so many things in a short period of time, ranging from political organizations to founding magazines, and covering everything from political economy to how to write novels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The psychological motivations of many people constitute the driving force of history&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You say that Liang Qichao may be China&#39;s earliest global traveler, but Chinese literati have no habit of paying attention to details such as food, clothing, housing, transportation, customs, and landscapes during the journey. How did you add these details? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He himself has written part of his story about seasickness across the Pacific and his experiences in New York and the United States. I still need to read the newspapers of that year to see how American and Australian history described the country and society at that time, mixed with Liang Qichao&#39;s personal experiences and feelings, to form the world in his eyes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before Liang Qichao, Huang Zunxian also followed his diplomacy Activities, living in Japan, the United States, and Singapore for a long time. What role did the networks of overseas Chinese in Guangdong play in their travels? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Cities on both sides of the Pacific gathered many Cantonese people, forming a network of funds and ideas. This network supported the revolutionaries in modern China . Without the overseas network of Cantonese people, many things would not have happened, and Kang Liang would not have been able to play such an important role. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then why were these revolutionaries not born in Fujian? There are also many overseas immigrants from Fujian. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;On the one hand, it is related to the birth of outstanding figures, on the other hand, Hong Kong has played an important role. Hong Kong is a place where new ideas radiate. At the same time, Guangzhou is also a cultural center, and interesting cultural tension and cultural dynamics have been formed between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Liang Qichao’s travels in Australia and the United States attract you the most What is the place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is his interaction with the local society and how to stimulate the local people’s interest and enthusiasm for his political ideas, so I spent A lot of time was spent trying to find out how the local Chinese reacted to Liang Qichao. I was very happy to find a piece of material. When Liang Qichao gave a speech in Seattle, a Japanese student happened to record the grand occasion of everyone in the Chinese Theater enjoying Liang Qichao&#39;s speech. This description is very important to me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another thing that interests me is the differences between the different Chinese worlds. For example, in Melbourne, San Francisco, and Vancouver, the Chinese communities in each city have their own characteristics, and these characteristics will also be reflected in their attitudes towards exiles. Including the divisions and tensions within Chinese society, what wealthy businessmen want to gain from the Royalist Society, and what ordinary people want to gain. Everyone has complex psychological motivations, and these psychological motivations constitute the driving force of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What new observations do you have about today’s overseas Chinese? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We can see the overlapping waves of immigrants. They will leave different legacies. On the one hand, there is the old-fashioned Chinatown composed of Cantonese people. On the other hand, changes can be seen in the diet. Nowadays, overseas Chinese food not only includes Cantonese cuisine, but also more and more Sichuan cuisine. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The most important mode of transportation in that era was Ships, the risks of shipping, the long time, and the pain of seasickness are difficult for today&#39;s travelers to understand. Have you ever experienced or planned a long-distance ship ride? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, it is difficult to have. The sense of time at that time was different from ours now. They may have thought that it was normal to cross the ocean by boat in a month. Because they don&#39;t have planes. The sense of time is all relative. For them, taking a boat from Yokohama to Hawaii in 10 days is already very fast. Liang Qichao experienced an era when the earth suddenly shrunk and accelerated. He was able to travel to many different states and countries in such a short period of time. This was a brand new experience. Changes in the sense of time and modernity were very important to the formation of Liang Qichao’s thoughts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today’s readers must understand Liang Qichao’s era.

After all, although the rhythm of daily life is different, it is not that difficult either. grasp. It is very difficult to understand the changes in his thoughts. He suddenly went from a young man who read the Four Books and Five Classics, or who only read a few words about the outside world from the &quot;Global Gazette&quot;, to enter Japan in the late Meiji period and face so many different things. The impact of ideas, from social Darwinism to liberalism and constitutional monarchy, as well as novels, science, and economics, all of these things are coming at him. How can he understand such a new world, that kind of explosion of ideas? Of course, we are now in an era of great technological changes, and there are many unfamiliar terms that we do not know, but after all, we have received some training in modern education. At least these new changes are carried out along the basis and context of modern education. Liang Qichao and others were trained by It is traditional education. This huge impact on the thoughts and feelings is a process that is difficult to describe. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s like you were trained in Newtonian mechanics, and you are suddenly thrown into the world of quantum mechanics. How does it feel? When we describe such changes in thought, we cannot always think with hindsight that those nouns have become fixed common sense. Those nouns themselves were created by Liang Qichao and others. Through the translation of Japanese, we can wonder whether this new word is It is available, and I have to start using it without even having time to think too much. If I want to tell others about it, I think it is a very panic process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A big paradox or challenge in writing the biography of Liang Qichao is, Many of the concepts and vocabulary we Chinese use today were originally created by Liang Qichao, but we have to use the words he created to repeat him like a &quot;tail-biting snake&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;So how to return to the strangeness at that time is a question.

Liang Qichao must have been deeply affected by this, because he was in a state of exile, where everything was full of uncertainty, and personal initiative became crucial. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Liang Qichao is a scholar, media worker, and As an educator and author, which of his identities attracts you the most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, there is another identity as a politician. I think he is first of all a writer, and his other actions are constantly unfolding. Those roles are also very important to him, but the writer is the role that can best display everything about him and display his talents. Liang Qichao is a writer of the Encyclopedia School, an Enlightenment thinker in the era of transition. His writing is like Japan&#39;s Fukuzawa Yukichi, or Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot during the French Enlightenment. It touches every aspect and can be used in words. exert a very direct political and social influence. His era was also going through the process of the formation of various modern disciplines in China. Liang Qichao was involved in it, and then he had the style of a Chinese literati. In such a transitional era, his writing was very mixed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have a lot of media work experience, and you will know Liang Are you particularly interested in Qichao editing newspapers and magazines? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Writing a biography, of course the author will have a subtle influence on you. Liang Qichao and I are separated by a hundred years. He was born in 1873 and I was born in 1976. There may be a subconscious echo. But what I am more interested in is that from the 19th century to the 20th century, during China&#39;s dramatic transformation and entry into the modern world, Liang Qichao was a representative of the spiritual world, and his extensive social participation also provided a rich sample. Next, I want to write a biography of Li Hongzhang. His character and experience are completely different from mine. I hope to describe that historical stage, China&#39;s difficulties in entering the world stage in the 19th century, and personal failures. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Liang Qichao was the bridge from the 19th century to the 20th century. Li Hongzhang is the elegy of China&#39;s 19th century. You were the editor-in-chief of &quot;Oriental History Review&quot;. &quot;Oriental History Review&quot; pays great attention to the history of China and its surrounding areas, and Chinese overseas immigrants. Writing biographies of modern historical figures is also an extension of this interest, right? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After writing the biography of Liang Qichao and Li Hongzhang, I also want to write the biography of Lin Yutang. The three of them represent the power of the Chinese people. ), idea (concept), and identity (identity). It is estimated that I can write it until I am eighty years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always liked the style of such a magazine. It is a carrier between the academy and mass media. It is very readable, but has a strong academic background behind it, and the subject matter is also very widely. I have always had a strong passion for history. Influenced by Shi Jingqian, I think there should be a kind of historical writing that combines ideological and literary aspects. Historical and biographical writing should be a very important intellectual product of ours. Some eras are the era of poetry, some eras are the era of novels, some eras may be the era of prose or travel writing, and I hope there are still some eras that belong to history and biography writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said that one-way space was opened in Japan, and you also wrote the biography of Liang Qichao As a by-product, what are the difficulties of opening a bookstore in a foreign country? In particular, Japan is a country with a well-developed bookstore and publishing industry and a self-contained system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Talking about by-products is actually a joke. I was trapped in Japan due to the epidemic in 2020, so I wanted to do something. As a result, I was in Tokyo The landlord became a partner in the bookstore. Although there are many bookstores in Japan, there are no good contemporary Chinese bookstores. Seventy percent of the one-way space in Tokyo is Chinese books, and there are also Japanese, English, and Korean books, so it is also an Asian bookstore concept. Just like One Direction in China, it will provide salon activities and is a place for communication. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course there are many difficulties. It is not easy to find a place in Ginza, and the cost is relatively high. I haven’t figured out its business logic yet. In China&#39;s one-way space, we are the exporter and manager of brands. We do not rely on retail to make profits. We are more like a cultural company in a comprehensive sense. This is not the business logic in Tokyo. It depends on whether it can continue to be supported, so it is a very reckless product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Bookstores in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China often had the function of publishing, which was also a new As an information distribution center, have you considered echoing this tradition through one-way space? In the current mobile Internet era, what special role do bookstores play? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A bookstore is not only a physical space for knowledge storage, but also a place where people gather, knowledge flows, and ideas are produced. It is actually a spiritual place. Community support is very important. Our Tokyo store is launching a membership program, hoping that members can find a sense of community. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a sense, books and print media have It is called a sunset industry. The &quot;Thirteen Invitations&quot; you made on streaming media has more attributes that correspond to the new media of Liang Qichao&#39;s era. How do you think the two have different meanings to you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, they are not that big of a difference in nature. They are both expressions of thoughts. Of course, different media have different media characteristics. For example, writing is an older medium. It has a closer relationship with my personal heart and my thoughts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Making videos is a product of the team. It can express a certain part of me, but it is often a collective expression. The same goes for companies. In the company, I am one of the founders or the soul, but its entire operation is often beyond my control, and even a process that gradually gets out of control. Writing a book is an act that you can control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chinese scholar-bureaucrats, they might print some collections of poems and essays by themselves, so in Liang Qichao’s generation, magazines and newspapers were their super new media, with a new issue published every ten days. Tens of thousands of people can see that this impact is very direct and quickly forms a resonance effect. Most of Liang Qichao&#39;s articles are published in newspapers and magazines, which is really like doing live broadcasts and videos now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;And Liang Qichao also faced situations where he lost control, such as a conflict with Wang Kangnian etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, and then he was deceived by the accountant, and the fund-raising was not smooth. He also has to consider operational issues, revenue pressure, pay dividends to shareholders, and what to do if the printing factory catches fire. People tend to overlook one thing. Liang Qichao was a serial entrepreneur. After running &quot;Qingyi Daily&quot;, he started &quot;Xinmin Series&quot;, and then &quot;New Novel&quot; and Guangzhi Bookstore. Moreover, he found investment in both of them, as editor and chief writer. , accounting for 20% to 40% of the shares. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Liang Qichao is mainly a writer and editor. You In addition to content production, there are many commercial activities. Are you bothered by the energy these activities take up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhiyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Of course sometimes it distracts the energy, but sometimes it also promotes each other, because when you are filming a show or participating in many things in the company, When you are writing, you are often frustrated and distracted, and of course you are also very excited, but when you write, you return to your more focused self. I think that is the avoidance and avoidance of other lives, and some of the chaos you face in daily life.和失控，也可以把它带到书里，帮你更好地理解梁启超的世界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一些历史材料受到了怀疑，我尽量把这种怀疑也呈现出来&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超通过他大量的写作，创造了一种新的语体，我们现在的文法和语言风格则受到了大量外国译作的影响。有人说你的写作是“翻译体”，你怎么看待这个问题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们这代人都受翻译很大的影响，读的很多书是翻译过来的，而且会感到翻译的文体的新颖性。其实梁启超也是翻译体，受到很多日本的影响。更别说五四时期，鲁迅等人的语言。我们白话文的语感就是在翻译的影响下产生的，而且我觉得已经找不到一个纯粹的不受外来语影响的文体。其实最重要的是，你能不能从中找到阅读的快感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你是一个经验丰富的媒体写作者，非常注重公共写作的可读性，但是写作梁启超传需要参考大量的学术著作和史料。你会不会担心，对于普通读者来说，你的梁启超传太艰涩，对于学界来说，信息密度又不够？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对学者来说，信息密度也是非常大的。你看我们出版的各种论文，很多也没多大的信息密度。我写梁启超传，用了非常多的新材料，但是我希望它同时有很强的可读性。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有一些史料，比如冯自由的《革命逸史》，它的可靠性受到了学界的很多质疑，但冯自由的演绎又是很有戏剧性的。对待这一类史料，你是怎么处理的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有一些历史材料受到了怀疑，我尽量把它受到的怀疑也呈现出来。尽管冯自由的很多东西有道听途说的成分，但当时很多史料都是道听途说的，甚至说不那么确切的材料，也是构成那个时代场域的重要部分。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于梁启超的传说，或者他的同代人的很多传说，也是当时的史料，并没有一个完全纯然的hard fact，就像今天我们俩在这谈话，这中间很多信息在产生，但它并不一定是准确的信息。所以我觉得，要理解历史的这种多样性，对材料本身的引用和怀疑，你给它一个展开的空间，读者自己会感受到的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超认为，20世纪是民族帝国主义的时代，他后来的思想有浓重的社会达尔文主义的色彩，如何看待他的这种思想倾向对后世产生的影响？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得每一代人要解决每一代人的问题，我们不能要求一代人解决100年之后的问题，有的先知者会看到他的困境是什么，但是对于梁启超那代人来讲，他面临的现实是国家受到羞辱，进入历史的谷底，富强是他们最重要的目标，而他们认为现代民族国家是参与全球竞争的最重要的一种角色，所以他们要去塑造一个现代的民族国家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于它的内在矛盾性，它可能产生的一种压迫性，是逐渐发展出来的，章太炎对这个问题更敏锐。梁启超可能也感受到这部分，但他有他的迫切性，每个思想家的特质是不一样的，所以我们无法去要求每一个思想者既做出迫切的选择，又有长远的观照。韦伯看到了更长远的东西，看到现代性作为铁笼子的一面，他就是更伟大的一个思想家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然我觉得思想者只能负思想者的责任。历史上一个思想观念的形成，它对我们的影响，不仅来自思想家本身，还来自后来的社会和教育体制的塑造。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梁启超徘徊于中国的传统文化与西方的知识之间，他的后代也多是考古、航天等领域的专家，而在今天，我们的困境却是学科太过专门化、辖域化，梁启超式的综合性的人文知识分子越来越缺乏。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;随着学科的细分，那种纵横式的思想者，不仅中国，全世界都稀缺。可能当时代发生新的巨大变化，大家就渴望综合性的思想者出现。比如说为什么全球这么多人要读赫拉利的作品，它谈不上多么伟大或深刻，但他具有某种综合性，他对眼前迫切性的问题提出了自己的某种回应，这种回应就会引起大量的注意。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在大众认知中，梁启超是一个被高度窄化的人，今年是他150周年诞辰，梁启超传当然也是改变公众对他的认识的一个重要努力。你觉得在他卷帙浩繁的著述中，有哪些是最值得被今天的读者阅读的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;梁启超写了1400万字，非常庞杂，他的经历和作品一样重要。他的思想史著作，关于清代学术三百年，还有《少年中国说》《新民说》这些散文，都值得被不断重读。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;与梁启超相比，大众对鲁迅作品的阅读就要全面得多。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;许知远：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;20世纪是一个革命的世纪，鲁迅是作为一个革命作家被铭记的。梁启超长期以来被认为是维新力量的代表，而维新是被革命叙事所压抑的。其实，在梁启超的时代，他是一位国民作家，从比他年长的人，到他的同代人，再到下一代的陈独秀、毛泽东、胡适，所有人都在读他。此外，梁启超的写作还处在文体转化的过程中，而鲁迅他们已经探索出一种新的白话文的写作方式了。其实，被窄化的不光是梁启超，我们对蔡元培、林语堂的认识也还远远不够，所以我觉得应该有更多写作者加入到重估和重新发现他们的工作中。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;身兼数职的叶刘淑仪，仍然在政坛上，书写风云。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（姚忆江/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接受南方周末专访前，叶刘淑仪递过来四张名片，头衔分别是“立法会议员”“新民党主席”“香港行政会议非官守议员召集人”“海上丝绸之路协会联席主席”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些身份占据了她的大多数时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为立法会议员，叶刘淑仪在在议会上质询官员时，官员称都要“打起十二分精神”。因为官员面对的，是一位曾经在政府体制中摸爬滚打了几十年的前高官，对香港情况了如指掌。作为香港新民党主席，叶刘淑仪曾称要推动香港发展优质民主，竭力为香港市民服务。繁忙的事务、频繁的曝光率，身兼数职的叶刘淑仪，仍然在政坛上，书写风云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，对这位香港特区首位出掌纪律部门的女性，人们评价褒贬不一。支持她的人认为，她担任香港保安局局长期间，在《公安条例》争议、居港权问题、入境事务大楼纵火案等多起事件中处事果断、作风硬朗和建树良多，是不可多得的“香港铁娘子”。但也正是这种硬朗作风，引来不少反对的声音。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她还曾在2012年和2016年两次宣布参选香港特首。虽然都以惜败告终，但参选口号“赢返香港”依然让不少港人为之振奋。参选过程中，叶刘淑仪一再强调“如果当选，将率先处理香港核心管治问题”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她如何看待香港在海上丝绸之路上的独特作用，对香港的发展又有怎样的期待？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;串起&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;全球&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“朋友圈”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;香港作为海上丝绸之路联盟城市之一，具有地理优势。香港该如何利用海上丝绸之路促进香港经济的发展，串起“朋友圈”？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我创办的海上丝绸之路协会是在2015 年成立的，是共建“一带一路”倡议提出后最早回应倡议的香港组织。丝绸之路是中国很重要的品牌，也是个全球的品牌。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实中国是最早推动全球化，对外开放的。张骞通西域是一次伟大的远征，搭建起了连接世界的桥梁。香港的地理位置在南方，也是海上丝绸之路一个非常重要的节点。历史上，自中国出海的中国商船，或回航的蕃舶，多会待冬季东北风发之便，经香港屯门出海，南驶中南半岛及南洋群岛，再到印度及波斯湾等地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丝绸之路就是一个非常重要的文化符号，应该多利用软力量向年轻人推广。比如我们安排免费的电影如《大唐玄奘》给观众欣赏，讲述商人把中国的蚕桑带到西域，也把西域一些葡萄产品带到中国这种交流的历史。利用这种软力量，帮助香港年轻人理解中国伟大的发展历史，以及深厚的文化底蕴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;香港社会还有一个特色，就是很多华侨，包括很多东南亚的大家族在香港都有分支。香港跟东南亚的关系非常好。比如菲律宾大部分是福建人，新加坡有福建、潮州客家人，泰国也是很多潮州人，商业的来往非常频密。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我觉得我们应该成立一个协会、联盟，连结海丝会沿岸的省市以及东南亚的国家。创办的时候，希望能在人心相通方面多做工夫，也希望能够教育香港年轻人多理解中国伟大的历史文化。所以协会部分重要的活动，都会安排一些年轻的大学生去海丝地区的国家走走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这就是“张骞计划”吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，学习当年张骞勇敢的开创精神。我们成立的时候，荷兰商会的会长很感兴趣，“一带一路”的终点是欧洲的鹿特丹，所以他也有兴趣加入。我们还安排了大学生到内地的广西、广东，以及东南亚的国家，如泰国、马来西亚、新加坡。另外还去了东非吉布提、欧洲伦敦。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得一提的是，应希腊一个小岛的邀请，我们安排了负责中国文化的老师暑期到希腊宣传中国文化，教中文，也很受欢迎。但是疫情原因，停滞了三年，今年我们又重新启动，也得到很多企业的支持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这个计划最高的时候派了一百个学生出去。今年大致有多少人？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;今年也起码有一百人了。因为陆陆续续有很多的中外企业参与支持，让大学生有机会去学习、实习，开阔眼界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;除了“张骞计划”，海上丝绸之路协会还有什么样的工作思考？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们开展了很多论坛，包括不同的国家以及东南亚国家的论坛。我们的目的，是希望扩大朋友圈。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;软力量”推动中国文化&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如今，湾区的融合互动越来越大，作为海上丝绸之路的协会主席，你有什么相关的计划和设想？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;李特首已经举行了上任以后第一次的粤港研习会议，其中加强科技、金融，人才的交流，文化的加强和交流也非常重要。澳门是海上丝绸之路的一部分，我们也想跟澳门加强合作。同时，希望将来安排多点学生去大湾区学习考察、加深他们对岭南文化的理解。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在香港学生对海上丝绸之路的文化，包括中国传统文化的熟悉程度和理解，达到什么样的程度?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得比较遗憾的，是香港的教改。 2009年推出的教改，我觉得走错了路，就好像台湾一样，把中国文化的元素大大减少。因为中史不是必修课，五万多个高考生只有五千人学习中史，学习世界史更少于五千人，学习中国文化典籍的考生只有两千人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我本身是念英国人的学校，但我小时候也念过很多的典籍，包括《经史子集》都读过一点点，现在的学生大部分都没有接触过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们安排了内地春节期间热映的《满江红》给年轻人免费观赏，但是他们不知道故事是发生在什么样的历史背景下，反响也一般。所以我觉得是教育出了问题，但现在已经加强中国历史典籍的教育传授，加强中史以及国情教育的传授，这些具有非常重要的意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“香港未来的前途跟中国密不可分”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;作为汇贤智库的负责人，也是海上丝绸之路协会的负责人，同时还是立法委员，也曾担任保安局局长。通过综合身份，你怎么看香港的未来？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很多香港人都不明白，但也越来越多人在明白、觉醒。其实二十多年前，香港还没有回归祖国时，新加坡总理李光耀来香港考察时说，“香港未来的前途跟中国密不可分。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确实，香港跟国家是风雨同路的。所以我们也很感谢国家不断地支持香港，香港今天稳定安全的局面得来不易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，虽然《国安法》平息了2019年的骚乱，但是仍然有一些敌对的势力在香港蠢蠢欲动，所以还需要提高警惕。香港还没有为《基本法23条》立法，而澳门已经在2009年完成了这项工作。所以李特首已经表态，这是一个非常重要且需要优先的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你怎么看待香港的危机和机遇?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;中国有五千多年历史，国家有非常古老的一面，也有非常现代先进的一面。比如有部电影《流浪地球》，就充分地表现了中国在科技方面的发展，包括航天方面的不凡成就。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们要向香港年轻人多介绍中国各方面的成就。现在香港有故宫文化博物馆，是一个非常重要的传播载体。另外，香港也举办了如“三星堆”展览，我希望将来能有多一点中国现代化方面的成就在香港展示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实内地文化软力量很厉害。现在很多年轻人包括一些在外国留学的年轻人，也非常喜欢看内地的电视剧，内地的偶像顶流在香港也有市场，而且他们的水平很高。比较现代化的街舞等表演在香港很受年轻人的欢迎，我也希望香港的文化表演团体，能有机会到内地演出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我听说今年过春节时，有一部非常卖座的电影《毒舌律师》是律政片，在内地很受欢迎，所以期待将来香港与内地能在文化方面多点交流。香港是个中西文化交流的中心，我希望未来在这方面，无论是新民党、海上丝绸之路协会，都能为此多做一点贡献。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;新民党于2011年1月9日在香港正式举行成立典礼，当时只有我一位议员。但在2021年的大选中，我们赢了3个议席，又在2022年的补选中多赢了一个议席。所以新民党现在已经有6位立法会议员，1位区议员。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不同的政党都有不同的代表性。当年创党，是因为我觉得香港有一大部分的市民如中产阶级的市民、在国外接受教育的市民，以及思想比较西化的市民，他们都很爱国爱港，但没有党派为他们发声。所以新民党吸纳这些人员，教育水平也都比较高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我跟黎栋国（前保安局局长）是前官，所以我俩有很多公务员支持，包括纪律部队；容海恩议员是一位大律师；李梓敬在美国受过高等教育；陈家珮由地区直选。 2022年补选的、赢得一席的何敬康是澳门原特首何厚铧先生的侄儿，他可以协助我们加强跟澳门的联系，而且他也是留英留美的，非常理解西方的文化价值，有助香港发挥“中介人”“超级联络人”的作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;香港特区政府成立以后，你是首位女性保安局局长，现任特首李家超也是保安局局长出身。你们之间有没有怎样的交流与合作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;叶刘淑仪：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我跟李家超特首的交往很有趣。我当香港保安局局长时，李家超是有组织及严重罪案调查科的主管，当时他的外号就是“神探”，因为其心思非常缜密。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论他当保安局局长还是当特首，我也跟他合作得很好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在立法会发言前，我会询问李家超一些材料，形成工作默契，为现在的工作配合打下基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李特首有一个非常好的本领，他很愿意夸奖他的下属。工作表现好的时候，很愿意表扬他们，肯定其贡献。而且他能团结公务员、议员、行政会议成员。所以李特首上任之后，我们的氛围很好。我觉得2023 年真的是香港随着国家经济复苏，值得拼搏的一年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国内首部放生法规将生效：科学放生才是行善丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258752]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;国内第一部专门规范野生动物放生的地方性法规《广州市野生动物放生管理规定》，将自2023年11月1日起实施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放生，在佛道两教中都是“善行”。佛教《梵网经》有言，“佛子应以慈心行放生之业……若见世人杀畜生时，应方便救护，解其苦难。”道教经典中也有《放生文》《杀生七戒》等劝人不杀生、放生的经文。中国佛道两教信徒众多，因此放生的事近年来也越来越多。但是，不科学的盲目放生，不仅不能给被放生的动物带来好处，还有可能造成生态灾难，有必要对放生活动进行规范。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州市人大制定的放生管理规定，首先规定禁止放生所有的外来物种，并列举了鳄雀鳝、豹纹翼甲鲶（即俗称的“清道夫鱼”）、齐氏罗非鱼、淡水白鲳、食蚊鱼、埃及塘鲺、泰国鲮鱼、大鳄龟、红耳彩龟（俗称巴西龟）、美洲牛蛙等重点物种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放生这些外来野生动物，可能给本土生物带来严重的威胁。比如鳄雀鳝，这是一种凶猛的肉食鱼类，成体体型巨大，最大可达3米，号称一条就能吃掉一片湖里所有的鱼，甚至会咬人。鳄雀鳝原产于北美洲南部，但近年来国内不少地方都出现了它的身影。这种鱼在国内水域中几乎没有天敌，一旦在野外泛滥，后果不堪设想。河南汝州中央公园曾经排干了20万立方米的湖水，就为了捕捉一条鳄雀鳝。罗非鱼、清道夫等外来物种，也会严重挤压本土生物的生存空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放生了一种动物，却给另外的动物甚至整个生态带来灾难，恐怕也不是“善”。事实上，擅自放生外来物种，已经被明确规定为违法甚至犯罪行为。 2021年4月15日生效的“生物安全法”规定，未经批准，擅自释放或者丢弃外来物种的，责令限期捕回、找回释放或者丢弃的外来物种，处一万元以上五万元以下的罚款。 2021年3月1日起生效的刑法修正案（十一）规定，非法引进、释放或者丢弃外来入侵物种，情节严重的，处三年以下有期徒刑或者拘役，并处或者单处罚金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而有些物种，虽然不是从境外来的，但是放生到不合适的地点，也可能适得其反。中国幅员辽阔，很多地方有自己独特的生态系统。某个地方的本土物种，到了其他地方，可能无法适应环境而死亡。比如适合在温暖水域生活的鱼类，到了北方的冬天就会被冻死。盲目放生，把动物放生到不适合其生存的环境中，这些动物不仅不能“生”，反而会加速死亡。甚至有些人把淡水鱼类拿到大海去放生，这不是放生，而是杀生。大批被放生的动物死亡，也会造成环境污染。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一种可能，就是一地的本土物种，到了另一地，可能成了“入侵物种”，破坏当地原生生态。这种来自境内其他生态系统的物种，对本土生态来说，本质上也是外来入侵物种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，广州放生管理规定要求，放生要选择适合放生地野外生存的野生动物，并严格控制放生数量，不得对生态系统造成危害。法规还要求管理部门制定公布适合放生的本土野生动物名录，公众可从名录中选择放生的物种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了物种的选择，放生地也很重要。不合适的放生地点，除了被放生的动物可能无法生存之外，还可能给人类带来危险，比如在靠近人类活动的区域放生凶猛有毒的动物。曾经有人在公园放生毒蛇、鳄鱼，在海滩放生电鳐、海鳗等，都严重威胁到游客的人身安全。为此，广州放生管理规定要求管理部门划定并公布适合放生的区域，禁止在放生区域以外的地方放生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法规还规定了违法放生的后果。放生野生动物外来物种的，按照野生动物保护法的规定处罚；在放生区域以外的其他地方放生的，处二千元以上一万元以下罚款；对生态环境可能造成损害的，责令限期捕回，已经造成损害的，并处一万元以上十万元以下罚款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放生，在宗教观念中是“善”。但盲目放生却未必是好事，甚至可能对被放生的动物本身、对其他生物和生态环境、对人带来严重的危害，那就不是行善，而是作恶了。对放生进行规范，很有必要。应加强宣传，普及科学放生知识，更要加大执法力度，对违法放生行为加以处罚，避免盲目放生造成严重损害。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一位34岁的也门人，在三亚开了两家“万亿级”公司]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258780]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/17/Wm2jjWukGfmx50lErAsIuDMgTiDL8oeQrW33PL1X.jpg&quot;

Secondly, companies with high registered capital will have certain advantages when participating in some large-scale projects, bidding and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wang Yuchen also pointed out that if the registered capital is too high, there will be certain legal risks. First of all, if the registered capital is falsely high but the actual operating capabilities are not strong, it may cause the company&#39;s financial situation to be strained and affect the company&#39;s normal operations. Secondly, it will increase the risks for shareholders. For example, if the actual capital contribution is not made in accordance with the commitment of subscribed capital, the relevant shareholders may bear corresponding liabilities within the scope of subscribed capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that when a company sets its registered capital, it should take into account not only the need to improve the company&#39;s credibility, but also its own financial capacity according to its actual situation, and avoid falsely reporting registered capital. legal risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to having similar registration times, the four companies have the same registered addresses, all located on the 10th floor of the Glory Century Building, Yingbin Road, Jiyang District, Sanya City, Hainan Province.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae has no cell wall structure, like bacteria without a &quot;coat&quot;. Both 75% alcohol and chlorine-containing disinfectant (such as 84 disinfectant) can kill Mycoplasma pneumoniae. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/477dce0e66baefc1fe83bdbeb2bd445b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;626&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/477dce0e66baefc1fe83bdbeb2bd445b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254303&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important pathogen of acute respiratory infections in Beijing. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is divided into two subtypes, type I and type II. Currently, type I is the main prevalent subtype in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The population is generally susceptible to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, but it is more common in children and adolescents over 5 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can occur throughout the year. The high incidence period of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in Beijing is from August to December every year, and usually reaches its peak around November every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;02&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;How is Mycoplasma pneumoniae spread? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and asymptomatic infections are the main sources of infection. The incubation period is 1 to 3 weeks, and they are infectious during the incubation period until symptoms subside for several weeks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is mainly transmitted through droplets, and the pathogen can be carried in secretions during coughing, sneezing, and runny noses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;03&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;What are the symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The main symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are fever and cough. Generally, the cough is severe, and the cough may continue for 1-2 weeks after the fever subsides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can cause upper respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, and extrapulmonary complications, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the main pathogens causing the high incidence of pneumonia in autumn and winter in Beijing. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is generally an interstitial pneumonia, so the clinical signs are often lighter than the imaging examination results, and after the clinical symptoms disappear, lung imaging examinations may still show inflammation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Mycoplasma pneumoniae does not have a cell wall, the familiar penicillins and cephalosporins, which are antibiotics that target the cell wall, are completely ineffective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Macrolide antibiotics, such as roxithromycin and azithromycin, are currently the first-choice treatments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if citizens have fever accompanied by severe cough, they should seek medical treatment in time, identify the cause as soon as possible, standardize treatment, and avoid blindly taking medication on their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;04&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;How to prevent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There is currently no vaccine to prevent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The most important thing to prevent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is to develop good personal hygiene habits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Try to avoid going to public places with dense crowds and poor ventilation, and wear a mask to protect yourself when necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or cover it with your elbow or upper sleeve, and throw the used tissue into a covered trash can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3.

It shows 23 Chinese graduates who studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania between 1918 and 1941. After returning to China, these students became pioneers in opening up China&#39;s construction industry and architectural education, and devoted themselves to building China&#39;s rapidly developing cities and towns. , so he is known as the &quot;first generation of Chinese modern architects&quot;. At the center of the panel is Lin Huiyin, the only female among these students, and the only one who was not awarded a degree in architecture from Penn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the chief curator of the exhibition, Professor Lin Zhongjie from the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania, Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng entered the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 1924. At that time, they both wanted to pursue a degree in architecture. However, at that time, due to the fact that the required art courses including male model sketching and construction courses teaching construction techniques were not suitable for girls, the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania did not recruit girls, so Lin Huiyin had to register in the Art Department. However, she not only took all the architectural design courses, studied design theory, painting and architectural history, but also served as a teaching assistant in architectural design. Her academic performance was better than that of most of her male classmates. On her transcript, many classes received &quot;Excellence&quot; ( Distinguished) rating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng worked together and made great contributions to reshaping China&#39;s architectural history, education and practice. “When you come to the United States, everyone knows Frank Lloyd Wright. And when you go to China, everyone knows Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng.” Weizman School of Design City and Region said Genie Birch, professor of urban studies and education in the Department of Planning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1934, the University of Pennsylvania’s architecture major began to admit female students. Since then, the School of Fine Arts (the original name of the Weitzman School of Design in the 20th century) has awarded supplementary architecture degrees to women who had previously studied architecture at Penn, including Georgiana Pope, the first female director of the Philadelphia Department of City Building. Georgiana Pope Yeatman. But Lin Huiyin&#39;s case has been ignored, even though she completed more architecture courses than any other female student of her time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Judging from records at the time, it is clear that Lin Huiyin wanted to study architecture and become an architect, and she later achieved great success in this field.&quot; Dean of the Weizman School of Design Fritz Steiner, Paley Chair Professor, initiated an investigation and review process into Lin Huiyin’s degree starting in 2022. “As our research continues to deepen, it becomes clear why she was not awarded a degree. Her identity as a woman. This is a historical mistake and it’s time to correct it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/17/6297d1bb86516148ed8689a960d73cfd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/17/6297d1bb86516148ed8689a960d73cfd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254307&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning that the University of Pennsylvania decided to posthumously award Lin Huiyin a degree, her family expressed their pride, gratitude and joy. Feeling. &quot;For my mother to be recognized by the school a hundred years later, it reminds me of her bravery and determination in choosing this major. She identified architecture as a teenager and determined to become a new generation of female architects. She enthusiastically guided and encouraged her father Liang Sicheng fell in love with her and chose architecture together. From then on, she was loyal to her choice throughout her life and sacrificed everything for her choice.&quot; Lin Huiyin&#39;s daughter Liang Zaibing said with emotion that today, on Lin Huiyin&#39;s tombstone, her husband Liang Sicheng inscribed &quot;Architect Lin Huiyin&quot; can be said to be a high-level summary of her life. &quot;As her descendants, we admire and appreciate her fearless spirit in pursuing her artistic dreams.&quot; Lin Huiyin&#39;s granddaughter Yu Kui said that the University of Pennsylvania chose to honor Lin Huiyin on the occasion of the 120th anniversary of her birth and the 100th anniversary of her enrollment. Teaching a degree in architecture will inject more hope and strength into the pursuit of dreams for future generations, especially women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[既嫌弃又上头，霸总式微短剧正成为00后的电子榨菜？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257206]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;The President&#39;s Billionaire Imprisoned Wife&quot;, &quot;The Heaven-defying Princess Leaves Too Wild&quot;, &quot;Son-in-law Dominates the World&quot; and &quot;Security &quot;The President&#39;s Daughter and Little Beloved Wife&quot;... If you come across micro-short dramas like this on short video platforms or other social platforms, don&#39;t be surprised. These micro-short dramas are becoming a creative craze, with people complaining about tyrants. Young people who always follow the same old tricks quietly hide in bed at night and start practicing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Detawen&#39;s Micro Short Drama Market Report for the First Half of 2023&quot; shows that a total of 481 new micro short dramas were released in the first half of 2023, compared with only 454 new ones in the whole year of 2022. This year The number of micro-short dramas in the first half of the year has exceeded that of the whole of last year. In July alone, 361 online micro-short dramas were recorded and announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, micro-short dramas are becoming a creative trend, on the other hand, the roughness and vulgarity of micro-short dramas are also despised by many netizens - why are micro-short dramas so popular? Is the only way for micro-short dramas to break out of the circle is the &quot;three vulgarities&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/gKB1xSTLiZ9trVAlnaHNSx5FO0tI7vY3tA5mLdg7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;947&quot; height= &quot;627&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/gKB1xSTLiZ9trVAlnaHNSx5FO0tI7vY3tA5mLdg7.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253986&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Short, flat, fast&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with previous long dramas or short dramas, the difference between micro-short dramas is the length. Each episode can be up to ten minutes, and the shortest can even be only A few dozen seconds is in sharp contrast to the average length of a long drama episode of 40 minutes. In the past two years, the creation of micro-short dramas has become a trend, mainly due to the &quot;short, flat, and fast&quot; nature of its creation form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Short&quot; means that the duration of micro-short dramas is very short, the shooting threshold is very low, and the shooting techniques are much simpler. It can be said that as long as you have a mobile phone and a story outline, you can shoot a short drama. A short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Assuming 20 episodes, each episode is 1 minute, a short drama is only 20 minutes long, which is less than the length of one episode of a long drama. With such a low threshold for creation, everyone can enter. Various small film and television production companies have used micro-short plays as the starting point for creation, easily triggering a creative boom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Plain&quot;, micro-short dramas are generally not so particular in film and television arts, and can be plain and mediocre. This is because micro-short dramas are parasitic on short video platforms. They are not meant to be viewed on large screens such as TVs, and mobile phone screens have limited capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially for micro-short plays with a vertical screen, if you take a close-up shot and see the expressions of the characters clearly, you can probably only accommodate two characters. It is difficult to pay attention to the depth of field and the depth of field. Space layout and shot scheduling. Therefore, many micro-short dramas are just about filming the characters and the plot, and they are all about saving money on the art and scenery, the service, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fast&quot; means that the filming time of micro-short dramas is very fast, the broadcast cycle is very fast, and more importantly, the money comes in very quickly. The cost of many micro-short dramas is only a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. You can shoot one in three to five days. After shooting one, you can directly launch a short video or small program. If it becomes popular, you can copy another one in ten days. It&#39;s a good money, you can quickly get a lot of traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many ways to make money from micro-short dramas. Although micro-short dramas with an episode length of one or two minutes are not available on long-form video platforms such as &quot;Youai Tengmang&quot;, they are very popular on short-video platforms. After micro-short dramas become popular, the protagonists of micro-short dramas can transform into Internet celebrities and carry out live broadcasts to promote products; some micro-short dramas are customized by advertisers, and the entire episode revolves around the advertising brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those micro-short dramas that are parasitic on small programs can also be watched on a paid basis. A drama usually has more than 100 episodes, and each episode is one minute. The first part can be watched for free, but the subsequent episodes require payment. Unlocked viewing, watching a mini-series is even more expensive than watching a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The creative threshold is very low, the creative techniques are simple, the shooting time is short, and the money comes in quickly... It is not surprising that micro-short dramas have become a new trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/KEwiaPCVhglej8e5wja668usJKahucGEiupeCjE4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/KEwiaPCVhglej8e5wja668usJKahucGEiupeCjE4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253984&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Vulgar, vulgar, kitsch&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, it is worth noting that on the one hand, micro-short dramas are very popular, and on the other hand, micro-short dramas have been criticized and criticized by many people. The root cause is that a large part of micro-short dramas on the market have strong &quot;three vulgarities&quot; characteristics: vulgarity, vulgarity, and kitsch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swarmed are all micro-short dramas. There are too many content for the audience to choose from. If you don’t find it interesting, just flick it by in three or two seconds, and the micro-short dramas will not get traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to catch the attention of users at the first glance, the orientation of many micro-short dramas can only be very &quot;vulgar&quot;. As some netizens summarized, they are nothing more than &quot;The Domineering President Falls in Love with Me, The Hero&quot; Saving an American but being rescued, falling in love while playing hard to get, seeing the true love in a kidnapping case&quot;... It&#39;s just a &quot;picking up&quot;, &quot;picking up a boss as a girlfriend&quot;, &quot;picking up a boss as a boyfriend&quot;, &quot;picking up a boss as a husband&quot;, &quot;accidentally picking up a boss&quot; Contents such as “Get a CEO Husband” are flying all over the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some micro-short dramas have further slipped into &quot;vulgarity&quot; and made a big fuss over the edges. In particular, some micro-short dramas in mini programs have not obtained online registration numbers. The content is very large, full of sexual innuendo, or has bloody and violent scenes. Moreover, because the broadcast channel is very hidden, it has repeatedly escaped supervision, which is quite bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is vulgar or vulgar, it is all about pleasing and flattering the audience. It not only caters to the instinctive parts of human nature, but also tries its best to tease users&#39; emotions and create traffic by selling emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This emotion is composed of &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot; - many micro-short dramas remind us of Mi Meng in the public account era - interestingly, after the transformation, Mi Meng has also become a micro-short drama The manipulator behind the show: The targets of the micro-short drama are &quot;bitches, low bitches, scumbags, scumbags, and vicious female supporting characters.&quot; These &quot;enemies&quot; combine all kinds of personality flaws that the audience is tired of. The method maximizes the various flaws of the &quot;enemy&quot; to arouse the audience&#39;s hatred, and then humiliates, criticizes and attacks these villains through the protagonist&#39;s counterattack, allowing the audience to gain a sense of emotional catharsis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; brought about by this kind of kitsch simplify human nature, breed intolerance between people, intensify estrangement, and have a subtle influence on social mentality. negative impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/HZf8qSQLY6dllV6303J3HB0mSaiUAleQfqMVMN0W.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/HZf8qSQLY6dllV6303J3HB0mSaiUAleQfqMVMN0W.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253985&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;The possibility of being &quot;micro&quot; but not &quot;vulgar&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The recklessness of micro-short dramas has attracted official attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially in May this year, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television issued new rules for the broadcasting of online dramas. After June 1, 2023, online dramas, online mini-series, online movies, and online cartoons that have been planned and registered will be Adopt a management approach with full license coverage. Only broadcasts can be broadcast after obtaining the &quot;Online Drama Distribution License&quot; in accordance with the law. Those without a license are not allowed to be broadcast; for those that have previously passed the planning and filing, licenses or numbers will be issued based on the circumstances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, starting from June 1, 2023, newly launched online dramas, online micro-shorts, online movies, and online cartoons must be declared through the &quot;Key Online Film and Television Drama Information Filing System&quot; , and works that have obtained the &quot;Online Drama Distribution License&quot; or online registration number after passing the content review of the radio and television management department at or above the provincial level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this, there was a brief regulatory blank period for micro-short dramas. That is, many micro-short dramas were filmed and released casually. Take whatever you can to catch people&#39;s attention. Some short dramas on mini programs have become a place for &quot;harboring evil and evil people and practices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the new regulations are released, the creation and broadcast of micro-short dramas will also face strict review. Only those that pass the review can be broadcast online on the platform. This also means that it is difficult to follow the &quot;three customs&quot; path of micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Micro short plays can only be &quot;micro&quot; but not &quot;vulgar&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, micro-short dramas can also be &quot;high-quality&quot;. For example, &quot;Youai Tengmang&quot; is also entering the micro-short drama industry. Each episode of the micro-short dramas they produce is only ten minutes long, and they use regular techniques for filming film and television dramas to shoot micro-short dramas. This makes micro-short dramas have A certain aesthetic style makes it more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in this year&#39;s popular &quot;Invitation&quot;, director Zeng Qingjie&#39;s camera language is very sophisticated, and he shoots a story in a pure and beautiful way. It has the simplicity of a short play and the texture of a long drama. The box office is divided into two. More than 16 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, for those micro-short dramas with a single episode of only tens of seconds or two or three minutes, the production team does not have the money to pay attention to quality, so they have to make a fuss about the theme expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it cannot be &quot;vulgar&quot;, it is necessary to find another way, either to maximize the &quot;refreshing feeling&quot;, or to refresh the audience through creativity. Otherwise, the micro-short drama will either end up being filmed but not broadcast, or it will be passed over by the audience after it is broadcast. Even if the cost is not high, it will end up in the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恶狗撕咬幼童引发强烈关注，防止烈犬伤人重在防患未然丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258775]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 20:56:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a video of a vicious dog biting a child went viral on social networks, and netizens strongly demanded that the vicious dog be severely punished. Owner. According to the latest report from the joint investigation working group of Chongzhou City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Chengdu City): At about 3:00 on October 17, Tang Mou, the owner of the black Rottweiler, arrived at the case. At present, the police have opened a case for investigation into the incident and have taken criminal coercive measures against Tang, the owner of the black Rottweiler dog, in accordance with the law. The case is under further investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video posted online showed a big black dog wandering in the open space in front of the building. As soon as a child and his parents walked out of the corridor, the black dog stepped forward and bit the child. The parents quickly protected the child. , but the big dog threw them both to the ground and continued to bite. It wasn&#39;t until the neighbor brought a mop and stick that the big dog was driven away. On October 16, the Chongzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that in the morning, when Deng and her daughter Tang were walking downstairs in the community, a black dog attacked Tang and bit her. Tang suffered multiple bites all over his body, contusion and laceration on his right kidney, and fractured ribs on his right side. After all-out treatment, the wound debridement surgery was completed and his vital signs were stable. Deng suffered abrasions on his body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police have taken criminal coercive measures against the owners of vicious dogs, but this wounding incident has once again reminded us that illegal dog-raising must be severely cracked down on, and we must take precautions before it happens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there have been many similar incidents of vicious dogs hurting people recently. In April 2021, a second-grade student in Chongqing was bitten to death by a neighbor&#39;s dog on his way to school, and a pit bull bitten four adults in Huangshi, Hubei; in December 2020, a 3-year-old child was bitten to death by a dog in Hebi, Henan. ; In November, a mother and daughter were bitten by their own dogs in Dujiangyan, Sichuan. The mother died and the daughter was injured...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the dogs that killed and injured people were stray dogs, and many had owners. Raised. Is it because similar incidents occur frequently because there are no regulations regulating dog breeding? No. From the national level, the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law, which will take effect on May 1, 2021, has a special provision for dog breeding, requiring dogs to be vaccinated regularly and to wear dog tags and leashes when taking dogs out of the house. Major cities have already enacted local regulations regulating dog keeping. The Standing Committee of the Chengdu Municipal People&#39;s Congress formulated regulations on the management of dog breeding in 2009, which stipulates that individuals are prohibited from raising aggressive dogs and large dogs. In restricted areas, dogs must be registered with the public security organs and apply for certificates. When taking dogs out of the house, dogs must be put into dog cages and dogs. The dog must be held in a bag or led by a person with full capacity for civil conduct using a dog leash to promptly stop the dog from barking and attacking pedestrians. In 2018, Chengdu police also carried out the work of collecting and disposing of prohibited dogs in restricted areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2018 police interpretation, the restricted breeding areas in Chengdu include Wuhou District, Chenghua District, Jinniu District, Jinjiang District, Qingyang District and High-tech Zone, as well as restricted breeding areas designated by other districts, cities and counties. It is not clear whether Yangma Street in Chongzhou City, where the vicious dog wounding incident occurred, is a restricted area. Rottweilers that bite people are not among the dog breeds banned in Chengdu’s restricted areas. However, even if it is not illegal to raise a Rottweiler, if the owner allows the dog to roam freely in the public area downstairs, without a leash, without a lead, and fails to stop the dog from attacking others in a timely manner, he must bear corresponding consequences for these actions. legal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is civil liability for compensation. The dog owner must bear the medical expenses of the bitten girl and the injured parents, and must also compensate the victim for her mental losses. Being bitten by a vicious dog not only causes serious physical injuries, but also causes huge psychological trauma to young children, and they should receive corresponding compensation. It should be pointed out that China’s mental damage compensation standards have always been on the low side. For example, in the case of a primary school student in Chongqing who was bitten to death, the dog owner only paid 550,000 yuan in compensation. It should be greatly increased so that dog owners who cause harm to others pay a high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dog owners should also bear criminal responsibility. If the injuries suffered by the bitten girl are judged to be minor injuries, the dog owner can be held criminally liable for the crime of intentional wounding (an adult should be presumed to know the consequences of not restraining a vicious dog). If the injury does not amount to minor injuries, you can also be convicted of &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot; because allowing ferocious dogs to roam freely in public areas has seriously threatened the safety of unspecified members of the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s more important is that dog-raising laws must be strictly enforced in normal times, and illegal dog-raising behaviors must be severely punished. You cannot always wait until the damage is caused before dealing with it, because it will be too late. If the law stipulates that aggressive dogs and large dogs cannot be kept, dogs must be tethered when taking them out of the house. But in reality, there are quite a few people who keep aggressive dogs and walk their dogs without leashes. Dog-raising management regulations in various places stipulate the management departments for dog-raising behavior. These departments should take responsibility and strictly punish illegal activities in accordance with the law. Those who illegally raise vicious dogs, neglect their management, and allow dogs to roam freely in public places must be strictly punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the demarcation of restricted areas and prohibited dog breeds in various places should be more detailed and scientific. The Rottweiler that bit people this time is also a violent dog that is banned in Hangzhou, Beijing and other cities, but it is not on the banned list in Chengdu. It is necessary for all localities to delineate the list of prohibited dogs in a more scientific and detailed manner, and at the same time, individuals should be prohibited from keeping aggressive dogs, regardless of whether they are in restricted areas or not. The very few who need care and need to keep aggressive dogs must obtain permission in advance, but the dogs must be kept in captivity and must not be allowed to go out. Violators will be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps it was influenced by the vicious dog bite incident in Chongzhou. Targeted measures such as the &quot;Special Action on Civilized Dog Breeding&quot; have been carried out in many places recently. I especially hope that all parts of the country will take action and continue to do so, so as not to become a gust of wind and &quot;nephew lighting up lanterns&quot; again in a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海底捞拒绝给玩偶过生日：应尊重企业的自主经营权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258738]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens posted on online platforms to complain, &quot;Does Haidilao discriminate against people who bring cotton dolls?&quot; , became a hot search topic. The post wrote that when he and his friend each brought a cotton doll to Haidilao for dinner, the waiter showed incomprehensible emotions when he asked for the doll to sit in a baby chair in the store. During the meal, the two also experienced bad experiences such as service that felt like they were being neglected, missing dishes that were not replenished until almost finished, and being rejected by the waiter when they wanted to celebrate the birthday of Cotton Doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cotton dolls are a type of doll that has frequently appeared in the entertainment industry in recent years. By matching clothes and changing hairstyles, you can create a unique and exclusive doll, which is sought after by many young people. Regarding whether the doll can sit in a baby chair, Haidilao customer service said that the company has no relevant regulations and needs to consult the store. Regarding whether it is possible to celebrate the birthday of the doll, the customer service said that it is also necessary to consult the store. &quot;Under normal circumstances, birthdays are celebrated for customers.&quot; This matter has caused waves on the Internet, and it is worthy of discussion and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haidilao is well-known in the industry for its &quot;god-like service&quot;. Many unique service categories have also won the reputation of &quot;Haidilao, you can&#39;t learn it&quot;. &quot;Celebrating birthdays for customers&quot; is one of them. As a special service, we even created derivatives such as &quot;Birthday Culture&quot; and &quot;Haidilao Birthday Song&quot;, which have won the favor and recognition of customers. If a customer goes to eat hot pot alone, Haidilao will also place a doll opposite to provide this kind of personalized service to &quot;accompany you when you go to Haidilao alone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The customer’s behavior of “giving the doll a birthday” may be inspired by this special service. There is no shortage of posts on social media about &quot;birthday for Cotton Doll&quot;, and there are also popular posts that read &quot;Waiters are forced to stay open&quot;. The person involved this time also mentioned this in the article. I am afraid that he did this after seeing similar &quot;experience posts&quot;, intending to follow the same example and enjoy Haidilao&#39;s birthday service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, do waiters have an obligation to be &quot;forced to open for business&quot;? Obviously, there is a difference between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;should.&quot; Haidilao &quot;can&quot; celebrate the birthdays of previous cotton dolls, but it does not mean that they &quot;should&quot; celebrate the birthdays of future cotton dolls. It can also be seen from Haidilao&#39;s response to this incident that they only have a service habit of &quot;celebrating birthdays for guests&quot;, but they do not have a service commitment of &quot;celebrating birthdays for guests&#39; dolls&quot;. Celebrating a doll’s birthday is not written into Haidilao’s service contract, nor is it an agreed-upon special service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, Haidilao is just a catering company. Its main business is to provide catering services to customers, providing consumers with a variety of drinks, food, consumption venues and facilities, integrating &quot;instant processing and production, commercial sales and Service labor&quot; in one. Unique and special services are additional &quot;add-ons&quot; and are no different from marketing methods such as discount coupons, consumption coupons, and membership coupons. In addition to birthday celebrations, Haidilao also provides free manicures, free snacks and other special services, which all fall within the scope of the merchant&#39;s independent operating rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Haidilao’s starting point for providing these special services is to enhance customers’ consumption experience, increase the reputation of its own brand, and bring positive feedback to business operations. However, these special services are a matter of affection, not duty. Therefore, Haidilao certainly has the right to operate independently on &quot;how to provide goods or services&quot; and has the right to adjust the rules and scope of special services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Haidilao has also made many adjustments, such as canceling free beef cubes, canceling free manicures in some stores, requiring at least one pot base to be ordered, no longer allowing bring-in dishes, etc. Similar measures have triggered great discussions, but they still fall within the scope of autonomous business rights and do not involve public interests such as food safety. Haidilao has the right to decide how to adjust the transaction rules, and customers also have the right to decide whether to come and consume. Everything will be left to the market to judge and let consumers choose. There is room for two-way choices between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that if the waiter really fulfills the client&#39;s wish and gives the cotton doll a &quot;birthday and a doll chair&quot;, then it may also squeeze out the opportunity for customers with children to obtain the doll chair service. , or push up Haidilao’s operating costs. If some kind of incentive is formed, more dolls and even pets will celebrate their birthdays. Who will bear the rising costs? If the dining environment is regressive for ordinary customers, it is a lose-lose situation for both Haidilao and ordinary customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the party’s “let me go” mentality displayed between the lines of the text is also suspected of emotional blackmail: asking the merchant to provide special services that it is not obliged to provide, or even It is also unreasonable to satisfy its emotional value and cater to certain preferences of subcultural groups. Haidilao naturally has the right to refuse certain excessive or unreasonable requests. The parties concerned can look for restaurants willing to provide such services, or simply organize their own friends to open a Cotton Doll themed hot pot restaurant at their own risk and bear their own profits and losses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, even if it is &quot;celebrating a customer&#39;s birthday&quot;, members and non-members can enjoy different services in Haidilao. After all, the cotton doll is not a real baby, and the store has the right to decide whether to treat the two-dimensional and three-dimensional dolls equally. In short, the &quot;controversial points&quot; in this incident are still within the scope of independent management rights. &quot;Whether to celebrate Cotton Doll&#39;s birthday&quot; should be left to Haidilao itself to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第134届广交会开幕，展览总面积、展位数和参展企业数量均创历史新高]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258741]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 16, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, two overseas buyers visited the Canton Fair venue The bustling crowd inside took photos in the background.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/218f8aca90.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height =&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/218f8aca90.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254274&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, two overseas buyers took a group photo with the bustling crowds in the Canton Fair venue as the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 15, 2023, the 134th China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair) was officially launched.

That scenery is my hometown in a previous life. This feeling is very strong and real.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1980, this feeling became the creative inspiration of Shinji Tanimura. He wrote his most famous masterpiece &quot;Subaru&quot; (also called &quot;Subaru&quot;) in the future. In China, fans are accustomed to (called &quot;Star&quot;): I closed my eyes, my heart was at a loss, I looked up sadly, my eyes were full of desolation, there was only one road leading to the wilderness... I will travel far, see you again, the Pleiades hang high! ——The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation Taurus and consists of more than 3,000 stars. It is extremely bright in the night sky and is especially dazzling in autumn and winter. The brighter ones form the Pleiades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 1980, this song was included in the album of the same name. On the album cover, a line of light and shadow cuts across the darkness. Half of Tanimura&#39;s body is buried in the darkness, and half of his body stretches out from the light. He nods slightly, eyes fixed forward, and is ready to go. This song has a melancholy tone, bleak lyrics, and sad images, but its perspective is bright. After the song came out, it became very popular in Japan and sold more than 600,000 copies. In 1987, Shinji Tanimura participated in Japan&#39;s annual &quot;Red and White Song Festival&quot; for the first time, singing &quot;Subaru&quot;, and the TV ratings exceeded 63%. Since then, he has participated in the &quot;Red and White Song Gala&quot; for many years and has become a veteran singer in this most representative show at the end of the year in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1980, the ATV TV series &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot; was launched. In early 1981, singer Guan Zhengjie included the Cantonese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his TV original soundtrack album &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot;, with lyrics written by Zheng Guojiang . In 1982, Teresa Teng sang the Japanese and Cantonese versions of &quot;Star&quot; at the Elizabeth Stadium concert in Hong Kong. As a result, this song became popular in southern China and radiated to the north. Singer Shen Xiaocen included the Japanese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his second album. Since then, this song has been covered by singers such as Alan Tam, Xu Xiaofeng, Feng Feifei, Han Baoyi, and Cheng Lin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend told Shinji Tanimura that the picture in his mind seemed to depict Northeast China, so going to China became his dream. &quot;I have always wanted to visit China, but I don&#39;t know why. But I know that as long as I go, I will understand why I want to go to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2004 On November 5, 2019, Shinji Tanimura participated in the &quot;Jewel Heart&quot; Shanghai Concert&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, Tanimura Shinji participated in the &quot;Hand in Hand Beijing&quot; concert held at Beijing Workers&#39; Stadium with Chinese singers. He recalled that as soon as he landed at the Chinese airport, he felt like going home. &quot;Even the earthy smell that hit my face felt very familiar. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert lasted for two days. At this time, pop music was in its infancy in China. The tens of thousands of spectators in the work hall sat in silence, with no applause or cheers. They were used to the warm live atmosphere in Japan. Tani Cun was very uncomfortable with it. He and the members of his rock band Alice tried every means to mobilize the audience. After they sang a rhythmic song, people in the venue stood up and applauded continuously. Shinji Tanimura was very excited: &quot;Everyone feels the same about music, and music has no national boundaries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He sang &quot;Subaru&quot; live. This was the beginning of his singing reaching the ears of Chinese audiences. So far, nearly 50 of his works have been adapted into Chinese songs, including Leslie Cheung&#39;s &quot;Who Resonates&quot; (adapted from &quot;Like a Dream&quot;), Anita Mui&#39;s &quot;Walking Alone&quot; (adapted from &quot;This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;trial&quot;) &quot;), Jacky Cheung&#39;s &quot;The Distant Her&quot; (adapted from &quot;Romantic Railway&quot;), Priscilla Chan&#39;s &quot;Forgetting Sorrow&quot; (adapted from &quot;Autumn Stoppers&quot;)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254294&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2007 On September 20, in Nantong, Jiangsu, at the opening ceremony of the 9th China Asian Arts Festival and the Gala &quot;Under the Same Starry Sky&quot;, Shinji Tanimura sang &quot;Flower&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2001, Shinji Tanimura, who was already successful, came to the Yellow River specifically to try to find similar feelings from his childhood, but found nothing. From this, he became more certain that the scene should be near Heilongjiang in Northeast China. Tanimura said with a smile: &quot;Maybe I was Chinese in my previous life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China suffered from the SARS epidemic. In order to help China fight against SARS, Shinji Tanimura held a &quot;Concert to Support China in Fighting SARS&quot; in Osaka and donated all the 15.34 million yen (approximately US$120,000) raised to the Red Cross Society of China. After SARS ended, he flew to China and held a concert to thank medical workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, Teng Junjie, the chief director of the opening and closing ceremonies, invited Tanimura to perform on stage at the opening ceremony, and Tanimura agreed. For this reason, he canceled several performances in Japan and made compensation. On the evening of April 30, 2010, at the Shanghai World Expo Cultural Center, Asian girls walked out from both sides holding stars in their hands. They complemented the lights of the audience and seemed to stretch out into a galaxy. Shinji Tanimura, China&#39;s overseas promotion ambassador for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, brought the audience to the audience. The familiar classic song &quot;Subaru&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teng Junjie and Tani Cun have been friends for nearly 20 years. He recalled in an interview: &quot;When Abe and Koizumi were in office, (Japan) had trouble getting along with China, he went directly to Koizumi and told him that his attitude towards China must change. Japan must stand with China, and we two Asian countries must Take this responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura is very willing to spend time face-to-face with young Chinese people. In March 2004, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music hired Shinji Tanimura as permanent professor of the Department of Music Engineering and consultant of the Sino-Japanese Music Culture Research Center. This job lasted until 2008. While serving as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shinji Tanimura spent one week every month in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of Tanimura&#39;s class is &quot;How to express music.&quot; Start with the lyrics first. A reporter visited his class. Tanimura entered the classroom, first put half a glass of water on the table, pushed the glass over, and the water came out. He asked the students to write lyrics about it. He left the classroom for 20 minutes and came back to check. The lyrics of a classmate impressed him deeply: When water flows outside, water never knows what its own shape is... &quot;The most important thing is the inner feeling. Only there are people, and I am. If people want to be connected, music is The best medium. Music can best enter people&#39;s hearts, resonate and move, and hearts can meet.&quot; Shinji Tanimura told the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspiration and core of the song &quot;Subaru&quot; became one of the important narratives of Shinji Tanimura&#39;s future life. As written in the song, he has always felt that &quot;starlight leads the way.&quot; When the 32-year-old Tanimura composed this song, he had no idea of ​​its vast magic, which could transcend time and travel through space, and continue to echo throughout his artistic career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, Japan&#39;s economy was developing rapidly, giving people the illusion that as long as they had money, they could buy everything. But this song tells people: truly precious things need to be felt with the heart. Care, tenderness , consideration, love, etc., these invisible things are crucial to us.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 40 years, he has performed and visited various Asian countries and often heard local people singing this song, regardless of gender, young or old. The other person even thought it was the song of his own country. He was once asked: &quot;Do you know this song?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;Subaru&quot; is the key to opening the door to all Asia and can connect everyone together. .&quot; Tanimura said, &quot;There is no doubt that &quot;Subaru&quot; changed my life. This song took me on a magnificent journey.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;589&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254293&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shinji Tanimura and Teresa Teng Singing on the same stage &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Showa &quot;Legendary&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On September 21, 2018, Shinji Tanimura, who was almost 70 years old, held the &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the age of 25, Tanimura&#39;s hairline began to recede, and he began to grow a beard to achieve visual balance on his face. Nearly 45 years have passed, and his works have stayed at a certain point like his hairline, becoming synonymous with his achievements. And his voice is inevitably aging like his hair color. His beard and hair are all white. Even if he sings &quot;Pleiades&quot; with exactly the same arrangement, you can hear the decline in function, but there are gains and losses. At this time, It has the mellowness and sweetness given by age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura Shinji grew up and became famous during the Showa period, and he has obvious Showa characteristics. Shinji Tanimura appears in public and has a decent image. He always had a smile on his face, and his eight teeth were gleaming white. He is diligent, confident, vigorous and friendly, and uses subtle strokes to outline the complexity of the grand narrative. Since his debut, he has held 3,620 concerts in Japan and is still the number one in Japan. He has released 63 albums and 62 singles, with a total sales volume of more than 30 million. He is called the godfather of the Japanese music industry. In the media description, he always promotes Sino-Japanese friendship from the bottom of his heart, cultivates young people with full expectations, and pours his blood into music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps partly due to the language barrier, Chinese reporters said his voice was soft and slow. If you don’t prick up your ears to distinguish it carefully, it may even be masked by the sound of the indoor air conditioner. &quot;People are as quiet as songs.&quot; But if you listen to his works and understand his experience, both the premise and the conclusion of this sentence will be invalid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, Shinji Tanimura was born in Osaka. When he was a child, he was overweight and was nicknamed &quot;Fat Pig&quot; by his classmates. His self-esteem was greatly affected. When he was in elementary school, he heard singer Xiao Linxu singing &quot;Migratory Bird&quot; in a performance. He was attracted by Xiao Linxu&#39;s gesture of strumming the guitar and started learning guitar, deciding to regain his confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, he formed the band Rock Candie with his classmates. Their style was more country folk and their rebellious playing style made the audience feel novel. In 1970, this band held an &quot;American Continent Tour&quot;. They first arrived in Vancouver. Because they were too poor, they had to take a bus across the North American continent all the way to New York. After ten days of tossing, they finally reached their destination. In New York, Shinji Tanimura watched a local rock performance. He shed tears at Janis Joplin&#39;s performance, &quot;It turns out that music still has such a possibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, He formed a new band, Alice, but the band&#39;s American blues style was not accepted by the Japanese audience. Alice had to perform in various places to meet daily expenses and continue her acting career. During her frequent performances, Alice set a record of holding 303 concerts a year. As the band&#39;s popularity expanded in various places, their songs such as &quot;Winter Thunder and Lightning&quot; and &quot;The Pledge of Tears&quot; also gradually became popular. In 1978, they became the first group of Japanese artists to successfully hold a three-day concert at Nippon Budokan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2018, in Beijing, Shinji Tanimura held the &quot;38 Years of Stars&quot; concert &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 1974, Shinji Tanimura&#39;s first solo album &quot;蜜&quot; was released. He wrote the lyrics and music for the entire album. One year later, in December, Tanimura Shinji released his second solo album &quot;Umimako&quot;. In this quiet work, there are many shining works, such as &quot;Port Lights&quot;, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, &quot;Warmth&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;The Road of Sand&quot;... After entering the 1980s, Tanimura produced more and more excellent works. In the 1990s, the theme song &quot;Fengzihuaden&quot; of Toei animation &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; was released, and &quot;Hometown&quot;, a collaboration with singer and actor Yuzo Kayama... are all Widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura’s life is very interesting. After a concert, he once walked into a small bookstore and offered himself to collect money for the store manager while he was having dinner. Fans who come to the bookstore after listening to Tanimura&#39;s concert will receive an oncoming surprise when paying. In Japanese variety shows in the 1990s, he was experienced, relaxed, unencumbered, and spoke humorously. One second he was not ashamed to share his embarrassing story with the host: due to a bad gastrointestinal condition, the stool collapsed in his pants when he farted; the next second he picked up the guitar and taught them his valuable experience in the music industry for many years: the most important thing is the song Express your heart, not whether it can be passed down to the world or how many people will sing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his later years, Tanimura conducted a deeper exploration of musical expression. The subtleties of his singing have been accurate to every modal word. In the song &quot;Woo Hu&quot;, he poured different techniques into each &quot;ah&quot; to achieve the emotions he expected, such as the feelings in his heart that he wanted to suppress but couldn&#39;t. Sigh while staying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Tanimura held a concert &quot;Commemorating the 45th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan - 2017 Shinji Tanimura&#39;s 45th Anniversary of His Performing Career in Shanghai&quot; at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the scene, a beam of chasing light hit the side of the stage and enveloped an empty chair. The prelude of &quot;Restaurant Corner&quot; sounded, and on the other side of the stage, Tanimura picked up the microphone and said: &quot;Next, I will sing a set of narrative love songs for everyone...&quot; &quot;Narrative Love Songs&quot; is his new attempt ——&quot;Explain&quot; the ins and outs of creating the song at the beginning of each song by chatting and heart-to-heart with the audience. In a set of five &quot;narrative love songs&quot;, Tanimura uses the woman&#39;s mood and the man&#39;s perspective to connect the ups and downs of love emotions, just like a love short film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To commemorate the &quot;two 45th anniversaries&quot;, Tanimura released a set of three albums called &quot;Standard&quot;, each with 15 songs, for a total of 45 songs. The first album is representative works selected from the songs he composed; the second album is taken from Alice&#39;s period works; and the third album is Japanese classic songs sung by him. His criteria for selecting tracks to enter this album are: &quot;Children 100 years from now will think that these works are indeed classics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These tracks are also arranged in the order of the ups and downs of life and the ups and downs of emotions. The first part is full of ambition, and in the end there will be a starry reverie like &quot;Pleiades&quot;: &quot;A person&#39;s daily life must be ups and downs, but he will not stick to these emotions and feelings every day. Life and music have something in common . I want to reflect the ups and downs of life into music... Even if the melody on the stage is occasionally sad and disappointing, it must be exciting and upward in the end!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 28, 2018, The &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert in Beijing became Shinji Tanimura&#39;s last public performance in China. On October 8, 2023, Shinji Tanimura died of illness at the age of 74. The funeral was held on October 15, with only close relatives in attendance. On October 16, the news of his death was made public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Comprehensive reports from Global Figures, The Paper, Xinmin Evening News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
