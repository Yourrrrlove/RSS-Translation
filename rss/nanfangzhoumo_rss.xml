The competition events of this Asian Games include 40 major events, 61 sub-events, and 481 minor events. It is the Asian Games with the largest number of events. It is worth noting that non-Olympic events, as the distinguishing mark of the Asian Games from the Olympic Games, mostly originate from traditional folk sports activities and have a deep public base and strong regional characteristics. This Asian Games has added new non-Olympic sports such as skateboarding, break dancing, and e-sports, which not only increases the enjoyment of the games, but also demonstrates the diversity and inclusiveness of Asian sports culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 24, 2023, the e-sports events of the Hangzhou Asian Games kicked off at the Hangzhou E-sports Center in China.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/09/27/edbca512b6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;808&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09 /27/edbca512b6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252481&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 24, 2023, Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports events The tournament kicked off at the Hangzhou E-Sports Center in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Behind every game and every medal is the sweat and hard work of the players. The Hangzhou Asian Games brought unlimited passion to the Asian region and demonstrated the elegance of Asian sports on a global scale. However, the Asian Games is not just about the medals, it is also exciting both inside and outside the stadium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 22, 2023, the Hong Kong, China delegation attended the welcome and flag-raising ceremony and officially stationed in the Asian Games Village in Hangzhou.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/27/c0c0d7c38e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/c0c0d7c38e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 22, 2023, the Hong Kong delegation from China attended Welcome and flag-raising ceremony, officially stationed in Hangzhou Asian Games Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 22, 2023, Fok Qigang, head of the Hong Kong Asian Games delegation, accepted media interviews at the welcome and flag-raising ceremony.&quot; src= &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/7cbd514ecd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/7cbd514ecd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252483&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot; >;On September 22, 2023, Fok Qigang, head of the Hong Kong Asian Games delegation, was interviewed by the media at the welcome and flag-raising ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, the host Chinese delegation entered the venue to the music of &quot;Singing the Motherland&quot;.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/09/27/16b0743b90.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /09/27/16b0743b90.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252484&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, the host Chinese delegation Enter the stage to the music of &quot;Singing the Motherland&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Hangzhou Asian Games is the second international sports event held by China after the Chengdu Universiade. It is also an important window to showcase China&#39;s image in the new era. Like the Chengdu Universiade, domestic and foreign sports audiences can enter the venues and watch the fierce competitive events at close range. Swimming, basketball, table tennis, etc. are the most popular sports in the first week of the competition. Southern Weekend reporters saw at the venue that many enthusiastic spectators would arrive at the ticket gate two or three hours in advance to wait for admission. On the Internet, discussions about athletes&#39; competitive skills, figures, and even appearance and temperament remain high among Asian Games-related categories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 20, 2023, an Asian Games-themed light show will be staged every night on the Qiantang River.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/d3f4a4cf5f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 27/d3f4a4cf5f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252485&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Every night there is an Asian Games themed light show on the Qiantang River.

The Asian Games-themed light show on the banks of the Qiantang River lights up on time every night, attracting many tourists to watch. The overall environment, accommodation conditions and food arrangements of the Asian Games Village were praised by the athletes and Asian Games technical officials.

However, many companies have recently announced that they will abandon this approach and focus more on their own carbon emission reductions. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nongjian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Forests are no longer humans&#39; friends in reducing carbon emissions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early September 2023, the famous American climate reporter David Wallace Wells lamented in a commentary article about forest fires. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wildfires that are raging across Canada this summer are burning not only forests, but also the forest carbon offset projects behind them. Along with the thick black smoke, the carbon collected through photosynthesis is released, turning the forest into a huge carbon source. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The forest carbon offset project is an important carbon credit. By purchasing carbon credits to offset one&#39;s own carbon emissions, it was once a &quot;fast lane&quot; for companies to achieve their carbon neutrality goals, and was especially popular among households &quot;difficult to reduce emissions.&quot; Such as the petroleum industry, aviation industry, etc. However, in recent years, carbon offset projects, especially forestry carbon offset projects, have been increasingly questioned and even accused of &quot;greenwashing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, the international oil company Shell announced that it would abandon its US$100 million annual carbon offset plan because the current &quot;carbon offset&quot; projects failed to meet the company&#39;s quality standards. Bloomberg New Energy Finance pointed out in its &quot;Long-term Carbon Offset Outlook&quot; report that due to concerns about reputational risks from purchasing low-quality carbon credits, globally, corporate carbon offset quotas will drop by 4% in 2022 compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are forest carbon offset projects becoming less popular? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Carbon dioxide is not a “first-class, first-class” exchange relationship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The fundamental reason for the doubt lies in the limitations of the forest’s “emission reduction principle”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The carbon dioxide absorbed by forestry carbon sinks and the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning are not in a &quot;one-to-one&quot; interchange relationship. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) specifically distinguishes between two &quot;carbon cycle&quot; models: the long carbon cycle (or slow carbon cycle) and the short carbon cycle (or fast carbon cycle). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The carbon in the long carbon cycle is mainly stored in the lithosphere, that is, in fossil fuels that have been fixed over millions of years. If this part of carbon is not mined and burned, it generally does not participate in the carbon cycle in the atmosphere. Because the process of storing carbon compounds underground is slow, the &quot;long carbon cycle&quot; may take thousands to tens of thousands of years to complete a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Carbon in the short carbon cycle is stored in vegetation and soil. The cycle of carbon is short, and the time depends on the lifespan of the plant, usually within 100 years: plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis - the plant dies or is destroyed by animals. , fungi or microorganisms decompose – the carbon is returned to the atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;short carbon cycle&quot; and the &quot;long carbon cycle&quot; in nature rarely overlap and do not overlap. Using &quot;tree planting to absorb carbon&quot; to absorb the carbon released through the extraction and burning of fossil fuels is an artificial equal replacement between the two systems, which does not comply with mathematical logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The principle of carbon absorption by planting trees is photosynthesis, but it is worth noting that only forests in the growth stage have strong carbon absorption capabilities. After trees gradually grow into old trees, their metabolism slows down and even dies. will no longer apply to carbon sequestration projects. Therefore, the general cycle of afforestation carbon sink projects is 20-60 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the carbon sink during this period was also unstable. During the growth period of trees, forests may be damaged or even die due to pests, diseases, fires, or logging, and the forest will transform from a &quot;carbon sink&quot; to a &quot;carbon source.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most prominent issue is the wildfire problem. Since 2015, wildfires in California, USA, have destroyed six forest carbon offset projects and released 5.7 million to 6.8 million tons of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. In the 2021 fires, forest offset projects purchased by Microsoft and BP were also burned, putting a lot of pressure on the company&#39;s &quot;climate performance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, a research result published in the magazine &quot;Nature&quot; even showed that under the dual impact of logging and forest fires, the tropical rainforest in the southeastern Amazon has become a carbon source and is no longer a source of carbon. exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of global warming, the risk of wildfires in forestry carbon sink projects has further increased. Analysis by WRI shows that the global forest fire rate has almost doubled over the past 20 years. The United Nations Environment Program predicted earlier in 2023 that the number of extreme wildfires worldwide would increase by 30% by 2050 and by 50% by the end of the century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if people can ensure that the forest carbon sink project will not be interrupted, there may not be so much land in the world. Switzerland, for example, recently struck carbon offset deals with Peru and Ghana, and even a country as small as Switzerland would likely require an area nearly equivalent to the entire island of Puerto Rico to grow trees. The four major oil and gas companies - BP, Eni, Shell and Total Energy - will need to plant trees on an area more than twice the size of the UK if they are to achieve their 2050 net zero target. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Oxfam report estimates that achieving the carbon reductions companies are committing to today would require an area roughly five times the size of India and more than all farmland on Earth combined. Similarly, another &quot;Land Gap&quot; report (Land Gap) released in 2022 by a total of 20 scientists from many countries showed that to achieve the climate commitments of various governments, an area equivalent to four Indias is required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large amounts of land required may also trigger negative impacts on ecosystems. The IPCC’s land use report states that “Afforestation activities may exacerbate risks to biodiversity, water and food security if deployed on naturally forest-free land.” Recently, it was reported that a bluecarbon company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, would purchase 10% of Liberia&#39;s land to develop carbon offset projects, triggering international concerns about the livelihood of local residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some companies have realized the risks of carbon offset projects and have pledged to abandon this path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, EasyJet, the British airline, was the first company to announce that it would abandon its carbon offset plan and announced that it would increase investment and develop direct emission reduction technologies, such as developing hydrogen fuel and optimizing operating efficiency. EasyJet said it expects these direct emission reduction technologies to reduce the company&#39;s carbon emissions by 78% by 2050, while the remaining 22% of carbon emissions will rely on carbon capture technology. In June 2023, France&#39;s Nestlé announced that it would no longer use carbon offsets to achieve the company&#39;s carbon neutrality goal and would &quot;commit to investing in projects that can truly bring emission reductions to the supply chain and operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Protect forests and benefit local people&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 15, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment reviewed and approved the &quot;Greenhouse Gas Voluntary Emission Reduction Trading Management&quot; Measures (Trial)&quot; means that the national voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction trading market is about to restart, which also includes projects such as forestry carbon sinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since mid-2022, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has made a series of statements regarding the CCER (China Certified Voluntary Emission Reduction) project, indicating that the restart button has been pressed on CCER approval, which has also triggered domestic carbon emissions reductions. Credit development. Forestry carbon sinks have shown explosive growth in the past year. Since February 2023, at least 30 forestry carbon sink projects have been implemented. Many companies have made plans in advance and signed contracts with local forestry companies in areas rich in forestry resources to develop forest land into carbon sinks, hoping that once CCER is restarted, transactions can be carried out (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/230498&quot; title=&quot;&quot;Air can also be sold for money&quot;: overheated forestry carbon sink&quot;>;&quot;Air can also be sold Selling money”: overheating forestry carbon sink&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the long run, whether the forest carbon sink has achieved &quot;additional&quot; emission reduction effects, ensured the durability of the carbon reduction effect, and can withstand third-party verification is still a core issue. The low-carbon think tank Yike Dual Carbon Center recently released a report &quot;It&#39;s an Opportunity and a Risk. What Does Carbon Offsetting Mean to Enterprises?&quot; 》Provides suggestions on how companies should choose appropriate carbon offset projects: try to protect intact or basically intact forests, with the main task of protecting forestlands and surrounding biodiversity and ecosystems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the new version of the CCER methodology, updated provisions are also made for the emission reduction verification, approval and verification agencies of forest carbon sequestration projects, placing more emphasis on the verifiable attributes of the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the authors of the aforementioned &quot;Land Gap&quot; report also mentioned that the focus of forest carbon credit development should be on preventing the felling of ancient, virgin forests and benefiting local residents and communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the topic of abandoning forest carbon offsets is a protracted debate about &quot;Carbon Dioxide Remove (CDR)&quot;. CDR includes measures to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a broad sense. At this stage, it mainly refers to traditional methods such as forest carbon sinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, CDR technology may be expanded to capture carbon directly from the air and store it long-term on land, oceans or caves. In its latest Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC made policy recommendations on CDR for the first time, believing that if the goal of controlling global warming to 1.5°C is to be achieved, large-scale CDR applications will be inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But CDR technology other than “planting trees” is even more controversial. Therefore, the IPCC also emphasizes that any carbon removal method cannot replace deep emission reduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[双节有奖征集丨归与游，我的城市印记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257396]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 20:58:49&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival meets the National Day, which is another double festival of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rare double holiday allows us to go home for reunion and travel together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From small towns in rural counties to bustling cities, from hometowns to tourist destinations;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They have all left you with unforgettable memories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it the lake where you hung out as a child?

Since the Honor of Kings World Champions Cup was held in 2019, no team outside China has won the championship. Experienced reporters come to the scene not to watch the game, but to see the status of the players. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of a reporter from an e-sports magazine, among the seven e-sports events in the Asian Games, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; is not very competitive, but it has the largest number of domestic players among the seven events. The most well-known game was the first to reach the finals in the schedule, so this game has a deeper historical significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, the Chinese team won the championship in the &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; event, but it was an exhibition match. Today&#39;s gold medal is legal.&quot; Two-time Asian Games winner The gap is reflected in his experience.

Outside the venue, the official licensed merchandise retail store of the Hangzhou E-Sports Center is taking final orders before the audience enters. In addition to mascot items like other projects, souvenirs surrounding e-sports projects also include categories co-branded with game IPs, which “sell out very quickly.” When faced with the question of why there are so few e-sports souvenirs in e-sports venues, the young The counterman replied, &quot;Mascot badges are basically hard to buy. There are hundreds of them a day and they are sold out in the morning. The popular character badges were sold out two days ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to prepare for the finals, the warehouse I urgently restocked the goods the night before and replenished a batch of souvenirs through all the channels I could find, including the Gongsunli badges of &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; that had already been sold out, but I couldn&#39;t wait for the final audience to enter. &quot;Before the third place match in the afternoon.

This character is very popular, and there are only two of her bookmarks left.&quot; The cabinet brother thinks they belong to the contestants. Hobbies drive consumption. He heard from the audience that the character commonly used by contestant Xu Bicheng (ID: Yinuo) is Gongsun Li. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Brother Cabinet’s job is to sell goods, he was also puzzled by the purchasing power of the audience. He opened the stationery gift box on the shelf nearby, “The gift box contains 4 items, notebook, pen, Exclusive bookmarks and sticky notes are priced at 208 yuan. I thought no one would buy them at first, but they have almost sold out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/09/27/cD1FMIJlvjfDI1M24YTRNBk6a04y1YojTNWhkdRM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;724&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /09/27/cD1FMIJlvjfDI1M24YTRNBk6a04y1YojTNWhkdRM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252465&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 26, 2023, Hangzhou Asian Games Electronics The final of the Asian Games version of Honor of Kings, players from the Chinese team (right) and the Malaysian team in the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;PM 1&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;7&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;30&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The audience is about to enter. Without enough time to wait for the store manager&#39;s reply, another counter girl in the franchise store went to the warehouse and moved the remaining seal keychains, which belonged to the characters Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao. As soon as they were put on the shelves, a male spectator took away all the three Daqiao keychains. Seeing this, the counter girl stuffed the Xiaoqiao keychains she wanted to put on the shelf back into the box, &quot;Hide some first, otherwise there will be no more.&quot; Things are sold.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More spectators crowded into the hall at the entrance. Seven cosplay game character actors were invited to stand in the center of the hall for a group photo. People waiting for the group photo volunteered at the venue. There was a long queue behind the audience, and almost every audience member who came through the door stopped to identify the characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gathered crowd made it easy for media reporters to find the people they wanted to interview. A media from Hubei wanted to interview fans of the Wuhan eStarPro team. Two players from this team were selected for the national team, namely Luo Siyuan (ID: Huahai) and Sun Linwei (ID: Tanran). Young girl Yang Yiqing was chosen as the interviewee from the crowd. She was easily identifiable as she was wearing the uniform of the eStarPro team and carrying a bag of support materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the camera, Yang Yiqing enthusiastically praised the positive value of the players, &quot;I want to say something about Luo Siyuan. He has taken on the responsibility of captain and has always been very responsible, very determined, and very diligent in training.&quot; , led the team members to help the team win so many championships, I think they represent the spirit of perseverance and hard work.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eStarPro team has won 8 championships in previous competitive competitions. Regarding tonight&#39;s championship, the mentality of fans is much better than that of the media. Yang Yiqing said: &quot;Player Sun Linwei has just celebrated his 20th birthday. I am also here to wish him the first gold medal at the age of 20.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The support materials brought by Yang Yiqing include banners and small flags, which are spontaneously produced by the players or their team&#39;s fan clubs. A few days before the finals, each support club chose to distribute the materials at the Intime Department Store at the intersection away from the e-sports center. The materials with the personal photos of the players were to express their stance, and all the players of the national team were printed to show the pattern. The biggest one is Xu Bicheng’s (ID: Yinuo) Zebra Paradise Support Club. They set up a display area directly in the atrium on the first floor of the shopping mall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the game started, each company’s support materials competed in a round. When the venue’s cameras scanned the auditorium, the fans held up their banners high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/sBFZOTT3mdSIpJs8yAHJQQbm0uApeUfFLuBic1qZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/sBFZOTT3mdSIpJs8yAHJQQbm0uApeUfFLuBic1qZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;E-sports souvenir shelves in Hangzhou E-sports Center&#39;s licensed merchandise retail store&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Yangxin/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;In the evening 1&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;8&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;30&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The auditorium is filling up one after another , the warm-up music before the game was played loudly on the field, and the DJ chose a RAP version of &quot;Good Luck&quot;.

It is the only event where ticket purchase qualifications are determined by drawing lots, and it is also the most expensive event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no statistical data on the winning rate of single-game tickets, but according to the official blog of the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee, there are at least 5 million users who apply to purchase tickets for e-sports events, and the maximum number of spectators for each game is no more than 4,000 people. Among them, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot; and &quot;Dota2&quot; are particularly popular.

When the emcee picked up the medal and hung it up for Lin Heng (ID: Nuanyang), Chi Xiaoming (ID: Ming) next to him lowered his head in misunderstanding, then stood up quickly, revealing a trace of his nervousness. Xu Bicheng also showed nervousness. Facing the cheers of the audience, he raised his right hand and scratched his head unconsciously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After exiting, the six contestants passed through the mixed interview area. The long passage was filled with reporters and volunteers. A small blackboard was erected at the media entrance, &quot;The mixed interview area is full.&quot; Several young people who had just won the award dispersed and expressed their excitement at the moment to the microphones and cameras swarming in front of them. Jiang Tao (ID: Adou) finished his speech and was about to leave when he was stopped by a bunch of voices. Dozens of reporters immediately surrounded the place where he stopped. Only the one with the loudest voice could get the right to ask questions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last question was grabbed by a female reporter: &quot;What do you want to say to our audience?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I did it, and I believe you can do it too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After saying this, Adou walked towards the exit accompanied by the team manager. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[减持“新规”从严落实！沪深交易所进一步明确破发、破净、分红不达标条件]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257772]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 19:37:58&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After the China Securities Regulatory Commission launched the &quot;new regulations&quot; on shareholding reduction, the market is in urgent need of detailed rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges issued relevant notices clarifying some of the constraints in the new regulations on shareholding reduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission’s requirements for share reductions on August 27 show that controlling shareholders and actual controllers of companies whose shares are broken, broken, or whose dividends do not meet the target are not allowed to reduce their shareholdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the requirements were issued, many listed companies announced the early termination of their shareholding reduction plans. Taking the Shanghai Stock Exchange as an example, the controlling shareholders, actual controllers, directors, supervisors, and senior executives of 35 companies terminated their shareholding reduction plans in advance, and the &quot;key minority&quot; personnel of 18 companies voluntarily promised not to reduce their shareholdings in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the market has also raised through various channels a series of implementation standards issues such as how to judge relevant conditions and what methods to limit shareholding reduction. To this end, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges have conducted systematic and in-depth research to refine relevant implementation standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice issued by the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges clarified the standards for breaking the issue, breaking the net or failing to pay dividends, clarifying the scope of the secondary market holding reduction, clarifying whether the conditions are met during pre-disclosure, etc., responded to market concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;You can reduce your holdings only if you cannot break the stock price or break the net price for 20 consecutive days&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As we all know, a stock price break means the stock price is lower than the issue price when it was first issued. To avoid artificial manipulation, a break here means that the closing price of the stock on any of the 20 trading days before the announcement of the shareholding reduction plan is lower than the stock issuance price at the time of the initial public offering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges require that the stock price does not break for 20 consecutive trading days before they can reduce their holdings. This article is applicable to the controlling shareholders, actual controllers and persons acting in concert at the time of the initial public offering of the listed company; if the issuer discloses that it has no controlling shareholder or actual controller, it applies to the largest shareholder at the time of the initial public offering. and its actual controllers and persons acting in concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Net-breaking means that the stock price is lower than the net assets per share. The notice shows that the so-called net loss here refers to the closing price of the stock on any of the 20 trading days before the announcement of the shareholding reduction plan is lower than the net assets per share at the end of the most recent fiscal year or the most recent financial accounting report period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Senior market insiders pointed out, “In order to improve the accuracy and timeliness of judgment, two comparison benchmarks are set (for the net breaking situation), namely the latest financial report and the audited annual report for the most recent year. , the holdings can be reduced only if the net is not broken. Same as the break, twenty trading days are also selected, and the holding can be reduced only if the net is not broken.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in order to ensure the comparability of prices, the net is broken and the net is broken. All adopt the backward re-weighting calculation method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market participant said, &quot;This notice strictly identifies the circumstances in which holdings cannot be reduced. For example, for breaking the stock and breaking the net, it is not simply that the stock is not broken or the net is not broken on a certain day as the conditions for reduction, but It is required to not break the stock price or net profit for 20 consecutive trading days. This can prevent controlling shareholders and actual controllers from manipulating the stock price to cooperate with the reduction of holdings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Excluding fiscal years with negative net profits&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Dividends that do not meet the standard include two types of situations: one is that there is no dividend for three years; the other is that the accumulated amount of dividends over the three years does not reach 30% of the three-year average annual net profit. The year of judgment is the fiscal year for which the audited annual report is disclosed. It is worth noting that fiscal years in which net profits are negative are not included. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some special circumstances in the calculation of whether dividends meet the standards. For example, if there are losses for three consecutive years but profits are distributed because the accumulated undistributed profits are positive, if according to the natural algorithm, the average annual net profit for three years is negative, a small amount of dividends can meet the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, one or two years in the past three years have been profitable, and the remaining years have suffered losses and the losses have been huge, resulting in a negative average annual net profit in the past three years. According to natural calculations, a small amount of dividends may be appropriate. Achievable standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid such a situation, this time it is stipulated that the loss-making years will be excluded from the calculation standard, and only the dividend amount and average annual net profit of the profitable years will be calculated. According to this standard, if there are losses in the last three years, there are no years that can be calculated, and the standard cannot be met, and the shareholding cannot be reduced; if the cumulative net profit in the last three years is negative, the loss-making years will be eliminated, and the dividends for the remaining profitable years will reach 30%. Only then can we reduce our holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of industry insiders, in fact, the elimination calculation method and standards are more stringent, basically achieving the effect that controlling shareholders and actual controllers of loss-making companies are not allowed to reduce their holdings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Block transactions are included in the scope of secondary market holding reductions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges pointed out that according to general understanding, the secondary market refers to centralized bidding transactions and block transactions. If other methods of reduction are achieved through the above two methods or are similar to them, they should also be implemented with reference to the same standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This notice also adds pre-disclosure requirements for large transactions. The current holding reduction rules do not force major shareholders to disclose in advance before reducing their holdings in large-scale transactions. In order to prevent controlling shareholders and actual controllers from reducing their holdings through large-scale transactions without meeting the conditions, new rules for large-scale transactions have been added this time. The pre-disclosure obligation requires them to pre-disclose 15 trading days in advance with reference to the regulations on centralized bidding, and to make disclosures during and after the event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analysts believe that &quot;this move further improves the transparency of shareholding reduction and facilitates small and medium-sized investors to understand the holding reduction arrangements of controlling shareholders and actual controllers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of disclosure requirements , when the shareholding reduction plan is disclosed in advance during the start-up stage of the shareholding reduction, the controlling shareholder and actual controller should determine whether the conditions that prohibit the shareholding reduction are met. If it is met, it cannot be disclosed; if the conditions for shareholding reduction are met, the shareholding reduction plan can be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Strengthen supervision of violations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What will be done if relevant entities violate relevant regulations? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that exchanges can take self-regulatory measures according to their rules, including self-regulatory measures, disciplinary sanctions, trading restrictions, etc. The China Securities Regulatory Commission may impose administrative penalties or take regulatory measures in accordance with the Securities Law and the Certain Provisions on the Reduction of Shareholdings by Shareholders, Directors, Supervisors and Senior Management of Listed Companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from past cases, the exchange has taken disciplinary actions and restricted trading measures for serious violations. The China Securities Regulatory Commission also imposed severe fines and heavy penalties. For example, Shanghai Yingyi violated pre-disclosure requirements and reduced its holdings of WuXi AppTec shares and was fined 200 million yuan; Yu Fanyi and others violated regulations by reducing their holdings of Wole Home shares, and their illegal gains were confiscated and severely punished. A fine of more than 30 million yuan was imposed; the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued a notice of criticism and disciplinary sanctions to the shareholders of Xtest Testing on the day they announced the illegal reduction of holdings. The company&#39;s shareholders promised to repurchase the excess reduction of shares and hand over the illegal gains. The relevant measures have been completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in recent cases, parties that have illegally reduced their holdings have repurchased the shares that have been illegally reduced. It is expected that stock repurchases will also become one of the important measures to punish violators and will never be allowed. The offender benefits from the violation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will further strengthen the supervision of shareholding reduction behaviors: First, it will improve the transparency of information disclosure of shareholding reductions. For pre-disclosure announcements of shareholding reductions, it is required to fully explain whether the conditions for shareholding reductions are met. The second is to strengthen the monitoring of holding reduction behaviors, strengthen transaction supervision, and promptly discover illegal holding reduction behaviors. The third is to do a good job in rule consultation and policy interpretation, and guide listed companies to ensure the first compliance level in the disclosure of information on shareholder reductions; the fourth is to take regulatory measures in a timely manner, and in the case of suspected violations, send letters to inquire, Telephone reminders and other measures will be taken to verify that violations are involved, and disciplinary sanctions will be implemented quickly and strictly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shenzhen Stock Exchange stated that it will also further strengthen supervision work: First, improve the supervision of information disclosure of shareholding reductions. For pre-disclosure announcements of shareholding reductions, it is required to fully explain whether the conditions for shareholding reductions are met. The second is to improve the functions of the shareholding reduction monitoring system, strengthen transaction supervision, and detect violations in a timely manner. The third is to take regulatory measures in a timely manner. For suspected violations, measures such as sending letters to inquire and calling reminders will be adopted as soon as possible to verify that violations are involved, and disciplinary sanctions will be implemented quickly and strictly. maintain behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中共中央政治局召开会议 审议《关于二十届中央第一轮巡视情况的综合报告》 中共中央总书记习近平主持会议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257776]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 19:46:38&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting on September 27 to review the &quot;About the First Round of Inspections of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China&quot; Comprehensive Report.

It is necessary to pass on the strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere to the end, urge the inspected party organizations, especially the main responsible comrades, to take on their responsibilities, carry out rectifications strictly and practically, and implement the inspection rectification and learning in the new era of Xi Jinping The education on the theme of socialism with Chinese characteristics should be combined to deeply understand the decisive significance of the “two establishments” and resolutely achieve the “two maintenances”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting emphasized that we should take the inspection and rectification as an opportunity to further strengthen the party&#39;s overall leadership, urge the inspected party organizations to improve their political positions, conscientiously perform the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Party Central Committee, and continuously enhance the core functions and functions of state-owned enterprises. Core competitiveness, consolidating the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, increasing the efforts of financial enterprises to serve the real economy and national strategies, and promoting high-quality development. It is necessary to coordinate development and security, establish bottom-line thinking and extreme thinking, take effective measures to prevent and resolve major risks, and firmly maintain the bottom line of safety. It is necessary to promote the in-depth development of comprehensive and strict party governance, tighten the responsibilities of the party committee (party group) secretary as the first responsible person, the members of the leadership team with &quot;one post and two responsibilities&quot;, and the supervision responsibilities of the discipline inspection and supervision agencies, and highlight the strengthening of the &quot;top leaders&quot; at all levels. We will strengthen the supervision of corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, in-depth rectification of the &quot;four styles&quot;, deepen the use of cases to promote reform and treatment, and promote the integrated promotion of those who do not dare to corrupt, those who cannot corrupt, and those who do not want to corrupt. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the party&#39;s organizational line in the new era and strengthen the construction of leadership teams, cadres and talent teams, and grassroots party organizations. It is necessary to make full use of the inspection results, deepen reforms, improve systems, promote source control, and promote treatment of both symptoms and root causes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other matters were also considered at the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[家长花50万为自闭症儿子“经络重构”：业者涉嫌诈骗+非法行医丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257730]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a piece of medical news has attracted attention. According to &quot;Shangguan News&quot;, the three-year-old son of Mr. Wang from Changshu was diagnosed with autism two years ago and has been seeking medical treatment to no avail. In the first half of this year, Mr. Wang came into contact with an organization that claimed to be able to cure autism, and joined a WeChat group with nearly 500 people. There is a &quot;warm atmosphere&quot; in the group, and group members often share successful treatment cases. Over time, Mr. Wang couldn&#39;t help but be moved, so he signed a &quot;Modern Traditional Chinese Medicine Technology Meridian Conditioning Service Agreement&quot; with this organization called &quot;Qiawei&quot; and gritted his teeth and paid 503,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after eight times of &quot;conditioning&quot; from this institution, the child still showed no improvement. He reported this situation in the WeChat group, but was directly kicked out of the group chat. Mr. Wang&#39;s experience is not an isolated case. Another child who purchased &quot;conditioning&quot; services also did not improve. According to media reports, what this institution has done has been suspected of fraud, and its fraud methods have also been packaged in multiple layers. Upon closer inspection, it can be described as a nested &quot;pig-killing plate&quot;, but it is wrapped in seemingly ordinary medical services. In the service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this organization invented a wonderful and mysterious story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;therapy&quot; called &quot;Meridian Reconstruction&quot; itself is very similar to the Taoist art of &quot;opening up the two meridians of Ren and Du&quot;, and this organization has added another layer of packaging to it: &quot;using clustered pressure wave technology&quot; &quot;Modern technology&quot; filter creates the so-called &quot;integration of diagnostic indicators of Western medicine and syndrome differentiation methods of traditional Chinese medicine&quot;. It looks amazing, but also has some black humor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the treatment details of the &quot;conditioning service&quot;, the staff member held the child&#39;s arm with one hand and held a pistol-like instrument terminal in the other hand, moving it back and forth on the child&#39;s arm. As can be seen in the video, Mr. Wang&#39;s child was quite frightened and impatient during the treatment process. The true efficacy of this &quot;conditioning service&quot; is probably self-evident. The image of the staff holding &quot;pistols&quot; is very reminiscent of the Yuzhang Academy-style &quot;electric shock therapy&quot;. So, how is it different from &quot;science pretends to be magical and technology makes ghosts&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this organization has also played a long-standing quasi-MLM scam, which even includes the method of &quot;killing pigs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Qiawei Health&quot; carefully sets up the rhetoric of &quot;public welfare treatment&quot; and &quot;commercial treatment&quot;, which not only creates an image of &quot;public welfare and charity&quot; on the surface, but also artificially creates &quot;scarcity&quot; anxiety, step by step Inducing Mr. Wang to spend money: Spend money to buy &quot;commercial treatment&quot; so that you don&#39;t have to wait for &quot;public welfare treatment&quot;. At the same time, they also lost no time in letting the &quot;medical care&quot; appear in the group chat and talk about the &quot;miraculous curative effect&quot;, which is very similar to the classic &quot;medical care&quot; scam performed in the movie &quot;I am not the God of Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Wang, who was eager to treat patients, finally fell under the psychological offensive of &quot;enthusiastic patients&quot;. There were five other families who signed the agreement with Mr. Wang in this scam. The WeChat group chat where you could see various successful cases every day was forcibly disbanded shortly after the payment was made. This method, which is exactly the same as telecommunications fraud, can be called an alternative &quot;pig-killing plate&quot;, but the target has changed from &quot;investment/marriage&quot; to medical services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 266 of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that whoever defrauds public or private property, if the amount is particularly huge or there are other particularly serious circumstances, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years or life imprisonment, and shall also be fined or have property confiscated. Mr. Wang paid exactly 503,000 yuan in &quot;treatment fees,&quot; which exceeded 500,000 yuan, meeting the standard of &quot;extremely large amounts&quot; in the &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Specific Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Fraud&quot; of the two top governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the suspected criminal behavior of this institution may go beyond what happened to Mr. Wang and others in this report, and it deserves further investigation by the police and medical supervision departments: This is a qualified and legal medical institution. ? Is the treatment performed a legal medical treatment that has been proven to be safe and effective? Are the people performing the treatment qualified to practice medicine? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If, as reported by the media, the staff did say &quot;approved by the state,&quot; then this is a blatant use of public power to endorse themselves, and may also be suspected of forging, altering, and buying and selling official documents of state agencies. Certificates and seals; at the same time, the main business of &quot;Qiawei Health&quot; registered with the Industrial and Commercial Bureau is &quot;health consultation&quot; and &quot;health care&quot;, and may not be qualified to practice medical treatment. In this way, it is suspected of illegal medical practice; the expensive &quot;treatment&quot; &quot;The cost&quot; far exceeds the reasonable price range for &quot;consultation&quot; and &quot;health care&quot;. This is another out-and-out price fraud and is suspected of being illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the medical community still has not yet reached a completely clear consensus on the pathology, symptoms and treatment options of autism. The range of autism symptoms is also very wide, and different patients may need completely different treatment plans. There is no such a one-size-fits-all so-called &quot;meridian reconstruction&quot; therapy, and it is difficult for formal treatment to achieve a once-and-for-all effect. &quot;Qiawei Health&quot; took advantage of the information asymmetry of the patients&#39; families to carefully design such a scam, and almost every aspect was suspected of illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the &quot;service categories&quot; of this institution, the list of &quot;difficult and complicated diseases&quot; advertised by it actually includes &quot;stroke, rheumatoid, ankylosing spondylitis, and ALS.&quot; &quot; and &quot;a total of 21 diseases&quot;, which seems a bit &quot;surprising&quot; to the outside world. As far as ALS is concerned, how can Qiawei Health be able to treat this rare disease that the world&#39;s top medical scientists are still trying to challenge? If it&#39;s true, I&#39;m afraid the world owes them a Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, &quot;Qiawei Health&quot; has been suspected of multiple illegal and criminal acts, including fraud. The public department should conduct an in-depth investigation into its illegal and criminal facts, seriously investigate its civil and criminal responsibilities, and compensate the victims. financial losses to the victims’ families and combat similar medical scams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[政府办马拉松，摊主开新店：淄博烧烤国庆“再拼一把”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257758]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 13, 2023, the 4th China International Cultural Tourism Expo was held in Jinan , Zibo barbecue model is on display in the exhibition area.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past &quot;May Day&quot; and the approaching &quot;National Day&quot;, Dr. Sun from the emergency department of Zibo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital went on two missions during two consecutive long holidays. In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out. Just like that, half a year passed in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this summer vacation, the streets have indeed regained some calm, but after a marathon, the streets are noisy again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There will definitely be a wave of traffic during the National Day holiday. This is what it means to hold a marathon at this time.&quot; On September 24, the last weekend before the National Day holiday, this internet celebrity city held its first marathon Marathon. Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal. They queued for an hour and a half, and many people in front of the store were carrying Marathon on their backs. The pre-game package looked like a contestant who stopped by for the tooth festival. &quot;Zibo people are very welcoming, and the barbecue is very affordable and delicious.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several months of &quot;turbulent&quot; drama, Zibo Barbecue has experienced a fierce evolution from explosion to crazy expansion, and then to a brief period of calm. Many interviewees said that after the summer vacation, the market showed obvious signs of calming down. However, whether it will return to its original shape before the epidemic or maintain an average value of warm but not cool, people are still waiting and watching, and it is difficult to tell. Conclusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the interviewees agreed that at least during this National Day Golden Week, Zibo will still see a peak of tourists. For this reason, businesses and citizens are eager to try to seize this possible &quot;last wave of traffic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Barbecue shop owner: Give it a try again on National Day&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The obvious &quot;turning point&quot; occurred after the summer vacation. &quot;You can see it all at a glance&quot; on Badaju Street, which is booming. The popularity of Zibo barbecue has dropped after half a year. &quot;It was still very busy in July and August, but after September, it subsided a bit quickly.&quot; Standing at the fork in the traffic flow, whether to advance or retreat, the owner of a barbecue restaurant in Zhangdian District, Zibo City was a little undecided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Boss Shan’s shop was featured in the documentary &quot;A String of Life&quot;, coupled with the super popularity of &quot;Going to Zi for Barbecue&quot;, the business has been really booming for a long time. &quot;It was a bit broken at the time. There were too many people, and the whole store was spinning.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that he had hired a lot more waiters, and his salary also increased from 2,800 to 3,000, and then from 3,000 to 3,500. &quot;Salaries must not be reduced, and personnel cannot be laid off.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were too many stores, and the problem spread out. At that time, people all over the country went to Zibo, and no matter how many stores they had, they could digest it. Afterwards, the customer flow continued, but it was not as turbulent as before. Stores in poorer locations, or newer stores that were not well-known, did not even have many customers, so the wave of store openings slowed down. &quot;Newly opened stores have to hold activities, so they will have more customers, and old stores will be affected. New stores can&#39;t always hold activities, and if they don&#39;t hold events, they will have fewer customers.&quot; Boss Shan said that the Zibo barbecue industry has evolved from the previous &quot;dissuading customers&quot; to Now we need to compete on price and do fancy things to attract customers, &quot;it&#39;s starting to get rolled up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Boss Shan’s “apprentices” resigned from his position as a bank lobby manager and joined the barbecue industry. He once doubted his choice, but persevered and caught up with the wave of traffic. He said that the barbecue industry is a low-investment, asset-light industry. After purchasing a store, it can open for business very quickly. Even so, without technology, it will still not be able to operate well. &quot;Making barbecue is very tiring, and you have to pay attention to quality.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It would also be a good thing to eliminate a number of hastily launched stores as the popularity drops. Boss Shan’s “apprentice” believes that the barbecue industry will get better and better, and he is actively stocking up to prepare for the National Day holiday. &quot;Keep your own quality and do long-term business. It&#39;s easy to open a store but difficult to maintain it. Now it&#39;s up to you to see who can endure it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I say that the heat is down, but I am very honest. Boss Shan is also planning A new store is planned to open during National Day. His judgment on the barbecue industry is that a number of stores will close down quickly and the customer flow will still remain at a high level. Therefore, taking advantage of the window period in September, he quickly decided to &quot;go against the market&quot; and expand. Coincidentally, the employees who were previously recruited do not need to be laid off and can be transferred to the new store on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course he is optimistic about the future market development, so he continues to bet on barbecue. More importantly, he has been doing barbecue for more than 20 years and can’t do anything else. &quot;I am in my forties. All my youth is invested in it.” At the beginning, Boss Shan called his mother and sister to work together. They worked from morning to night but could not make much money. After many years of persistence, the business started to pick up around 2014, and I slowly found my way into this industry. &quot;I get up earlier than a chicken and go to bed later than a dog. In the final analysis, I still earn hard-earned money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am just looking forward to the arrival of the National Day holiday and opening a new store. I plan to open a new store during the National Day holiday.&quot; Let&#39;s fight together.&quot; He said&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zibo residents: Eat barbecue in the first half of the year and visit scenic spots in the second half of the year&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I feel like I hope to continue the good impression of Zibo among the people across the country. .&quot; This Zibo Marathon is Feng Yanhua&#39;s 66th full marathon. She said that in marathons held in various places, due to the large number of applicants, qualifications often require a systematic lottery. This time, she and several friends won the lottery. Later, she learned that the organizers mainly reserved the places for out-of-towners. Although there are still many details of the event that need to be improved, runners clearly felt that Zibo left all the good things to the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Very frank and enthusiastic, and the people here are very simple.” Feng Yanhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the Zibo Propaganda Department and the Zibo Barbecue Association to try to understand the preparations for the National Day in this Internet celebrity city, but the other parties declined the interview request. However, in the eyes of the outside world, Zibo has intentionally gradually increased its popularity. In the tweets on various platforms for this marathon, &quot;Zibo Barbecue&quot; was highlighted as a highlight of the event: &quot;Eat Zibo Barbecue, run Zibo Marathon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he learned that his hometown had organized a marathon, Jia Yanhao, a Zibo native who was studying in Qingdao as a graduate student, realized that the government’s strategy for dealing with traffic had changed. From being inactive before and after the May Day holiday, It has even become so popular that it now actively spreads the topic. &quot;I definitely hope that the enthusiasm will last longer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During May Day, Jia Yanhao was still studying as an undergraduate. Because he couldn&#39;t get a train ticket, he didn&#39;t go home to experience the enthusiasm of the people across the country. I went back to live for a while during the summer vacation, and I still saw many foreign license plates and tour groups. In addition, he found that the government has done a lot of basic work: renovating some convenience markets, renovating municipal facilities, making roads much smoother, and streets becoming cleaner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key is that stars have come to Zibo to hold concerts, and marathons have also been held. The popularity is rising in waves, all in the relay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know whether it is intentional or God’s blessing. Since 2023, traffic has indeed favored Zibo. &quot;Because of Daolang&#39;s song, Pu Songling&#39;s former residence in Zibo has become popular again.&quot; Qi Feng is a native of Zibo, but he rarely visits these scenic spots. However, in line with the fine tradition of &quot;prioritizing outsiders&quot;, he decided to It’s better to wait until the heat subsides a little before visiting again. Unexpectedly, a friend from out of town came to visit and asked him to be a tour guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Songling’s former residence is located in a small village with narrow roads and inconvenient transportation. The government worked overnight to repair the road. Soon, stage plays adapted from Liaozhai stories came one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the first half of the year, I was doing receptions and having barbecues, which made me vomit. In the second half of the year, I mainly went to tourist attractions.&quot; Qi Feng said that recently, friends from out of town have been coming to Zibo one after another. She said she wanted to eat barbecue, but instead she named the ancient capital of Qi State, Liuli Museum, Pu Songling&#39;s former residence, and the Zhoucun Ancient Street where the TV series &quot;Da Ranfang&quot; was filmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that the popularity of barbecue has begun to spill over to tourism projects. He felt a little relieved, but also a little regretful. &quot;After all, Zibo is not a traditional tourist city, and there are no good attractions.&quot; He explained that these attractions are relatively scattered, and they are not the kind of &quot;big-name&quot; leading scenic spots, so the tourist attraction is still limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancestors are still not strong enough, and God is not very good at receiving the rice. Qi Feng said that as an ordinary citizen, he certainly hopes that Zibo&#39;s popularity will stay as long as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Haiyue Dragon Palace BBQ experience venue on June 24, 2023.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Entrepreneur: Taking over cultural and creative industries, sales of barbecue robots are bleak&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Pu Songling’s former residence became popular, Hu Changyue was not complacent about his forward-thinking vision. Instead, we need to take a serious look at this cultural out-of-circle phenomenon. &quot;Several cultural labels in Zibo have become popular in turn.&quot; He is the owner of a design company in Zibo. After Zibo barbecue became popular, his company designed a set of cultural and creative products with Zibo cultural themes. One of them is Liaozhai culture. Thinking of locking in the market demand in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that their cultural and creative products are mainly tourist souvenirs such as fans and refrigerator magnets, and they have designed three major categories of themes: fireworks in the world, Qi culture and Liaozhai culture. At that time, the streets were full of banners saying &quot;Come to Zibo for Barbecue&quot;, and the focus was on the four words &quot;Zibo Barbecue&quot;. Therefore, the best-selling souvenirs at that time were &quot;Human Fireworks&quot;, and the theme was consistent with barbecue. , and even directly printed with the pattern of a barbecue grill, &quot;It must have the word Zibo, or the element of barbecue, to be easy to sell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, colored glaze and calligraphy and painting became the top trend. At the small stalls on the roadside in Ba Daju, the previous purple potato cakes and wok cakes were all replaced by colored glaze handicrafts and fans with calligraphy and painting elements. . Hu Changyue didn&#39;t notice how they became popular, but they were popular anyway. &quot;This shows that the outside world is beginning to understand Zibo&#39;s culture through barbecue.&quot; He said that at this stage, the sales of Qi Culture&#39;s products soared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Pu Songling’s former residence became popular, Hu Changyue suddenly felt that God was indeed favoring Zibo, and hot topics came one after another, &quot;In fact, our government is also quite good at it. If one falls, it will catch up with them all.&quot; &quot;. As a result, their company&#39;s products completely covered all stages of Zibo&#39;s traffic curve and fought a beautiful surprise battle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave, there are also those who are frustrated and unable to get a share of the pie. &quot;I feel that my thing is too advanced, and the development of Zibo&#39;s barbecue industry has not been able to keep up.&quot; Before the epidemic, intelligent robot entrepreneur Li Guohua developed his exclusive product &quot;BBQ Robot&quot;. On May 1st in 2023 , he also applied for a booth from the government department to display and promote in the barbecue city. He thought that the opportunity had come, but he did not expect that the sales were dismal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He claimed that in 2019, he received an order from a large domestic chain restaurant giant. The company planned to create a barbecue sub-brand and asked him to provide a full set of automation transformation solutions. So he developed the barbecue robot. Unexpectedly, after three years of epidemic, the barbecue sub-brand project was scrapped, and his barbecue robot had no use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guohua realized that compared with chain catering giants, Zibo’s barbecue industry ecosystem was still in its infancy, and the automation equipment was too advanced. The two were not well matched and could not handle Zibo’s traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Stall owners of the Eighth Bureau: Worried most about the transfer of leaders&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Dong, who runs a calligraphy and painting stall in the Eighth Bureau of Zibo, is not worried at all that the traffic will never return. &quot;I am very confident that Zibo has many ways and means to continue its popularity.&quot; Li Dong gave an example. The marathon is a government initiative to attract tourists to Zibo. The popular Liaozhai story not long ago can be regarded as the &quot;passive business&quot; of Pu Songling&#39;s former residence. Zibo Capture this hot spot astutely and follow the trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What I am most worried about now is the transfer of (government) leaders.&quot; Li Dong was originally a literary enthusiast who liked to write, draw, and collect. He heard that the government would set aside a part of the Eighth Bureau The stalls were provided to the public free of charge, but priority was given to culture and cultural and creative industries, so he took the initiative to apply. With his profound attainments in calligraphy and painting, he passed the review. Now, not only do I have room to display my literary and artistic talents, but I also gain a lot of income every month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A popular barbecue spot in Zibo is the Badaji Convenience Market.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the National Day holiday approaches, he is full of energy and ready to do something big. Taking advantage of the short off-season in September, he stepped up stocking and rushed to produce a batch of works. Moreover, when the time comes, he also plans to bring out the best products he has at the bottom of the box to dominate the scene. &quot;Large pieces of work, as well as meticulous paintings, will definitely be popular if they are brought out,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, it is closely related to his personal interests, and secondly, he is proud of being a Zibo native. He strictly demands himself, no longer running red lights when crossing the road, no longer littering when going out, and after smoking a cigarette, the cigarette butts are left behind. Be sure to find a trash can before throwing it away. &quot;Pay attention to your personal qualities. With so many outsiders looking at you, you can&#39;t discredit Zibo.&quot; He said that after the National Day, the weather gradually gets colder, and tourist attractions across the country are also in off-season, so We must take advantage of this &quot;Golden Week&quot; to do something big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before it became popular, Sister Fang opened an Italian pizza restaurant in Badaju. For dinner the day before the marathon, she hosted a local marathon runner. Sister Fang said that the purpose of foreign tourists coming to Badaju is usually very clear. The main meals are local delicacies such as barbecue or Boshan cuisine. Therefore, the business of the Italian restaurant is not directly affected. However, being in the core area, they still Received many benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a more stylish restaurant owner in Zibo, Sister Fang found that in addition to marathons, Zibo has more and more cultural attractions such as musicals and stage plays, so &quot;National Day&quot; will definitely There is a wave of tourists. However, after experiencing the baptism of &quot;May Day&quot;, she is now well-trained and does not need to be too nervous.

However, there are still people who go against the trend and commit crimes, seriously disrupting market order and damaging the credibility of the environmental impact assessment system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May and September 2023, verdicts were announced respectively in the environmental assessment fraud case of Shandong Jinhua Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. and the environmental assessment fraud case of Jiangxi Zhanhang Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. The actual controller, legal representative, and &quot;Affiliated&quot; environmental impact assessment engineers and many others were sentenced. As typical cases, these two cases of environmental impact assessment fraud have aroused widespread concern in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We must learn lessons deeply, use cases as lessons, draw inferences from one instance, and strengthen the implementation of responsibilities.” Liu Zhiquan said. While adhering to the &quot;strict&quot; tone, environmental impact assessment supervision will further improve daily supervision and long-term mechanism construction. Specific measures include continuing to strengthen daily supervision and carrying out quarterly early warnings for abnormal situations in the work of environmental impact assessment personnel. We will use intelligent review of environmental impact assessment documents to detect emerging problems in a timely manner, and jointly conduct regular inspections with the human resources and social security departments to strictly crack down on &quot;affiliation&quot; and other behaviors. We will revise the &quot;Supervision and Management Measures for the Preparation and Supervision of Environmental Impact Reports (Tables) for Construction Projects&quot; to comprehensively strengthen the quality of environmental impact assessment documents.
