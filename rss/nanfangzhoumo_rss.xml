Her relatives contacted the Ngari region through the Shanghai Health Commission and mobilized all civil servants Donate blood for it? Recently, this news has attracted great attention on the Internet, and netizens have questioned whether there is a privilege issue behind it. Although the person concerned continues to deny that any relatives are public officials, many netizens do not buy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Beijing News and other media, a woman who calls herself Xiaoyu recently posted a short video on social media, saying that she had a serious car accident while traveling by car to the Ali area of ​​Tibet during her honeymoon. Her liver ruptured, she lost serious blood, and she was injured. Danger to life. Her husband’s aunt contacted the Ngari area of ​​Tibet through the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and coordinated with medical experts from Shanghai to assist Tibet to treat her. She also mobilized “all public servants” in the Ngari area, including police station police, fire officers and soldiers, and army officers and soldiers, to donate blood. In the end, more than 7,000 ml of blood was used to bring her back from the brink of death. Subsequently, she was transferred to West China Hospital in Sichuan via a medical charter flight for further treatment. After her injury stabilized, she returned to Shanghai from Sichuan to continue treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video quickly attracted a lot of attention. Many netizens question who the &quot;little aunt&quot; is. She can actually allow the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission to mobilize medical experts to aid Tibet, and can also mobilize all civil servants in the Ngari region to donate blood to her. Is she suspected of taking advantage of her privileges? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arousing great public opinion, all parties involved accepted media interviews and responded, denying the existence of privileged interference. However, these responses failed to dispel public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, who is the &quot;little aunt&quot;. Ms. Yu’s husband, Mr. Tao, later told the media that his aunt was not a public official in Shanghai. It was after his wife’s car accident that the local authorities suggested asking the Shanghai Health Commission for help. The aunt, who was usually close to him, “find a way” to contact the Shanghai Health Commission. Committee. The Shanghai Health Commission stated that they received a letter from &quot;relevant departments&quot; at that time, requesting Tibet-aid doctors who were in Shigatse City, Tibet, to go to the hospital involved to participate in the treatment. There was no action caused by improper factors such as personal relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that this little aunt is indeed able to contact the Shanghai Health Commission and can also get the &quot;relevant departments&quot; to send letters to the Health Commission. In the eyes of ordinary people, an ordinary citizen may only be able to call the National Health Commission&#39;s hotline at most, so &quot;little aunt&quot; will inevitably raise questions. The Shanghai Health Commission needs to provide more explanations. Which department has received the letter? The department also needs to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Ms. Yu was later sent to West China Hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan for treatment on a medical charter flight. The medical charter flight was expensive. Her father said that they were an ordinary family and the charter flight cost more than 1.2 million yuan, which they borrowed from relatives, friends and leaders. But this statement is also questionable. Although the purpose of spending one million yuan to charter a flight from Tibet to a better hospital in the mainland was to save her daughter&#39;s life, it was not easy to raise such a huge sum of money in a short period of time. According to Mr. Yu, he &quot;driving at work.&quot; Such a unit and such a good leader have aroused the envy of many netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, what netizens are most concerned about is whether &quot;all public servants&quot; were mobilized to donate blood for her. Mr. Tao later said that his wife had just undergone surgery and was still seriously injured. He said this to encourage his wife to have the will to survive. In fact, it was the hospital staff who posted messages in Moments and groups, hoping that well-wishers would donate blood. , I also contacted the local police station, fire department and other departments, hoping to get their help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba government staff said that cadres and employees did donate blood to the injured woman, but it was not officially organized, but voluntarily donated blood after seeing relevant news. Ali Hospital staff also said that after the blood bank inventory ran low, the hospital asked employees and social workers for help, and family members also asked multiple local departments for help. Later, many people came to donate blood, including dozens of public officials. The aforementioned government staff also said that the medical conditions in the Ngari area are relatively backward and the blood inventory is already very tight. If someone asks for help, many cadres and employees will voluntarily donate blood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Shanghai tourist had a car accident in Tibet. The relevant departments in Shanghai and Ngari worked together to coordinate the treatment of Tibet experts while voluntarily donating blood to save lives. Finally, the seriously injured tourist was rescued. This should have been a touching moment. s story. However, a short video caused an uproar on the Internet questioning privileges. The reason is that the public has seen too many unfair phenomena of using power for personal gain, and has also seen too many incidents where people show off their wealth and power online and inadvertently expose corruption issues. The short video posted by Ms. Yu may also give people the feeling of showing off her &quot;little aunt&#39;s&quot; abilities (that is, showing off her family&#39;s abilities). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, no wonder the public suspects that there is privilege here. If you want everyone to believe that this is a purely touching incident, the parties involved, especially the official agencies involved, should come up with more Compelling evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[查理·芒格逝世 “我没有什么要补充的了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261619]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/65rPbMhQMAk6Wb5LlOGb5rwNujlbtMcUqyWfR7Dm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/65rPbMhQMAk6Wb5LlOGb5rwNuj lbtMcUqyWfR7Dm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260229&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;May 3, 2019, Burke, Omaha, Nebraska, USA Hill Hathaway CEO Buffett (left) and Vice Chairman Munger &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;&quot;Less crazy and stupid than most people&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A month before his 100th birthday, Charlie Munger died in a hospital in California. Warren Buffett has lost his best friend forever, and the world has lost another humorous and unruly wise man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger, 99, is a partner of Warren Buffett. He has served as Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway since 1978. Over the past 40 to 50 years, the two have worked together to build Berkshire from a shaky textile manufacturing company into one of the most successful multinational conglomerates in history. The group&#39;s subsidiaries have covered many fields such as insurance, rail transportation, energy, manufacturing, retail and services, and hold shares worth more than US$318 billion, about half of which are Apple shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two weeks ago, Munger was interviewed by CNBC reporter Becky Quick. Compared with the shareholders&#39; meeting half a year ago, his thinking is still sharp and he likes to use long sentences when stating his views, but his voice has become increasingly hoarse and difficult to understand. The limitations of the body cannot be overcome by the intellect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quick asked him what he wanted to do in particular at the moment, and got a negative answer. His hands can no longer feel the tension of the fishing line when different fish bite the hook like they did when he was young. He no longer insists on crossing &quot;catching a 200-pound tuna&quot; off his bucket list. &quot;It requires too much physical strength. Even if I have the chance now, I won&#39;t go there, I won&#39;t even chase them. Time will always make you give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with when he was 96 years old, he We are increasingly aware of aging and weakness in our body. When asked about it by Quick, he said he no longer had a plan. He &quot;happily accepts&quot; all kinds of changes. During the interview, he was sitting in a sunny courtyard, with a row of anthuriums, also known as flower candles, placed on the lawn beside him. This kind of flower has bright color and long-lasting flowering period. From blooming to withering, it will show beige, milky white, green and yellow, each with its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260223&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From &quot;The Way of Munger&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by CITIC Publishing Group)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Buffett often jokes that in front of Munger, he is still a young man. Just a week before Munger&#39;s death, 93-year-old Buffett had just announced a donation of approximately $866 million worth of Berkshire stock to four family charities. This is the latest step in his commitment to donate more than 99% of his net wealth to charity. Since 2006, every year on the eve of Thanksgiving, the &quot;Stock God&quot; has donated to the above four family charities. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said that he is 93 years old and feels very good about himself, but he is also fully aware that he has entered &quot;overtime.&quot; A week later, in the &quot;overtime&quot; game, his most tacit teammate bid farewell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has always believed that the important reason why he and Buffett have had outstanding careers is to stay on the scene long enough, but the prerequisite for the magic of &quot;compound interest&quot; to be cast is still &quot;more than most&quot; People are less crazy and stupid”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger was born on January 1, 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska. He has loved reading since he was a child, is especially fascinated by biographies, and has a strong logical thinking ability. After graduating from Harvard Law School as a magna cum laude graduate, Munger followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father and started his career as a lawyer in Los Angeles. Subsequently, in order to earn more income than a senior lawyer, Munger began to rely on existing client resources to carry out investments outside of his legal business and created his own investment partnership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;959&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260228&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 9, 1988, Munger was in California, USA&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1959, Munger&#39;s father passed away. When he returned to his hometown to take care of his funeral, he met 29-year-old Warren Buffett at a dinner arranged by a friend. The two, who were 6 years apart, hit it off immediately. At Buffett&#39;s suggestion, Munger began to focus on business in 1965. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two were each other&#39;s confidants and contributed to an important turning point in each other&#39;s lives. Buffett once said that it was Munger&#39;s ideological power that expanded his horizons and allowed him to &quot;evolve from apes to humans at an extraordinary speed.&quot; Otherwise, he would be much poorer than he is now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of his career, Buffett was a loyal follower of Benjamin Graham, known as the &quot;Father of Value Investing.&quot; Graham advocated finding company stocks that were selling for less than working capital, buying them cheap, and then selling them when the stock price rose, leaving a sufficient margin of safety. These &quot;cheap and unloved stocks&quot; he compared to &quot;cigarette butts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1592&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260227&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Munger&#39;s Way&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key force driving the evolution of Buffett&#39;s investment philosophy is Munger. Munger believes that Graham&#39;s investment strategy is based on the assumption that the future will be &quot;more dangerous than full of opportunities.&quot; But in fact, investing in great companies with fair stock prices is far better than investing in ordinary companies with ultra-low stock prices. Influenced by Munger&#39;s ideas, Buffett gradually moved away from the limitations of Graham&#39;s theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They found that some stocks are still very cheap even though the price is two or three times their book value, because the company may be on a growth path, have very good managers, or The whole management system is excellent and so on. Through detailed analysis of balance sheets, social and economic trends, etc., Buffett and Munger detected high-quality stocks from the vast stock market that they regarded as &quot;compound interest machines.&quot; Holding these stocks over the long term will result in excess profit returns, and these funds will be reinvested. Buffett compared this process to &quot;snowballing&quot;. &quot;You can only roll a snowball if you find the right snow.&quot; &quot;Choose a snowy place while moving forward to let the snowball get bigger and bigger.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since From 1965 to the end of 2022, Berkshire&#39;s annual compound return was 19.8%, and its total return in 57 years reached nearly 37,900 times, far outperforming the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Without Charlie Munger’s inspiration, wisdom and involvement, Berkshire Hathaway would not be able to develop to its current position.” After Munger’s death, Buffett wrote in a statement road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260226&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 6, 2023, Nebraska, USA, shareholders listened to Munger (right) and Buffett via video at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Deliver a speech &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acquiring wisdom is a moral responsibility&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;According to Forbes, as of November 28, 2023, Munger&#39;s net worth was approximately US$2.6 billion. However, compared to his difficult-to-replicate wealth and life, what benefits ordinary people more is Munger&#39;s thinking mode. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett calls Munger &quot;the best fast thinker in the world.&quot; As a stock picker, Buffett would test his ideas through Munger&#39;s questioning. &quot;He can think from A to Z in one go, and he can see the essence of everything even before you finish speaking.&quot; Behind this insight is Munger&#39;s long-trained thinking method, which he calls &quot;multiple Thinking Model”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has spoken many times in public about the value and importance of using &quot;multiple thinking models&quot; in the business world and real life. For example, before making an investment decision, he will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the internal operating conditions of the intended company and the larger overall &quot;ecosystem&quot; in which it operates, so he can always &quot;find convincing weaknesses within 60 seconds.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Munger&#39;s estimate, he has as many as a hundred multiple thinking models stored in his mind. These models will help him collect and process information and provide decision-making guidance on this basis. These models need to borrow and combine analytical tools, methods and formulas from various traditional disciplines, including the redundant backup system model of engineering, the compound interest model of mathematics, the breakpoint of engineering, the overturning moment of physics and chemistry, and the autocatalytic model. Modern Darwinian integrated models in biology, and cognitive misjudgment models in psychology, to name a few. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1525&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Poor Charlie&#39;s Almanac&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the so-called &quot;intuition&quot; is actually the end point of a long thinking journey, which is Munger&#39;s understanding of human behavior and business systems. and other products of long-term interdisciplinary research. He advocated &quot;quick annihilation of what shouldn&#39;t be done, followed by a skilled, interdisciplinary attack on what should be done, and then, when the right opportunity comes - and only when the right opportunity comes - decisive action.&quot; He likes to regard his life as an educational experiment. &quot;A person who has mastered his major well will test the feasibility and effectiveness of this basic academic spirit and method in a very broad academic field.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Munger&#39;s view, gaining wisdom is not just to make an individual&#39;s life better, but also a moral responsibility. He made this point in his 2007 commencement address at the USC Gould School of Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his speech, he also reminded the young graduates to &quot;avoid extremely strong ideologies&quot;, &quot;especially those expressed in a very violent way&quot; because &quot;it only &quot;Instilling some concepts in people instead of convincing people to accept some truths&quot;, &quot;This is tantamount to locking the brain in a very unfortunate mode&quot;, &quot;In this way, your mind will be broken, and sometimes it will be bad.&quot; It breaks at an alarming rate.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to help himself stay clear when he is inclined to support a strong ideology, Munger set an &quot;iron rule&quot; - &quot;Only if you can be better than your opponent I am qualified to have an opinion only when it refutes my own position.&quot; Of course, this &quot;iron rule&quot; is not limited to avoiding the whirlpool of strong ideologies. Munger believes that this way of thinking deserves continuous training. Only by constantly falsifying and questioning yourself can you reduce your ignorance. In his opinion, perhaps more suitable as an ideology is the spirit of &quot;accuracy, diligence and objectivity&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, catastrophic thought states include &quot;jealousy, resentment, hatred, and self-pity.&quot; Munger has experienced the greatest pain in the world. In 1953, shortly after divorcing his wife, his eldest son Teddy suffered from fatal leukemia. Bone marrow transplant surgery had not yet been available at that time, and Teddy soon died of the terminal illness. In the memories of friends, after visiting his son in the hospital at that time, the 29-year-old Munger would often walk on the street crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, Munger warned young people, &quot;Excessive self-pity can make people almost paranoid. Paranoia is one of the hardest things to reverse. Whenever you find yourself feeling self-pity, whether it is No matter what the reason, even if your child is about to die from cancer, you have to think that self-pity will not help.&quot; However, different life stages will always encounter very difficult problems. His advice is: Don’t have high expectations; have a sense of humor; surround yourself with the love of friends and family. &quot;The most important thing is to adapt to changes in life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a wealthy and long-lived wise man, Munger is most often asked &quot;How to become happy and wealthy?&quot; In his opinion Come on, there&#39;s more to life than just being smart about accumulating wealth. Most success in life and business comes from things that should be avoided, like premature death and bad marriages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260225&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2010, Munger (left), Buffett (middle) and Bill Gates attended an event in Beijing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has another answer - &quot;When you get up every day, strive to become a little smarter than you were before. Complete your tasks seriously and well. Slowly, you will make progress, but not necessarily quickly. But it will lay the foundation for rapid progress...slowly moving forward a little bit every day. In the end - if you live long enough - you will get better. Most people will get what they deserve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 82, Munger&#39;s friends gave him a copy of &quot;Cicero on the Good Life&quot; published by Benjamin Franklin, which included a A translation of Cicero&#39;s &quot;On Old Age&quot;. Inspired by this article, Munger wrote the article &quot;In Praise of the Elders: Munger on Old Age.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article, Munger excerpted a summary of this wise man who was born in 106 BC: &quot;The best protective armor in old age is a life that has been carefully spent before it, and a life that has been used for... A life of useful knowledge, honorable deeds, and noble conduct; the man who leads it devotes himself from youth to his own improvement, and will reap in old age the happiest fruits that they produce; and not only because Beneficial knowledge, glorious achievements and noble deeds will accompany him throughout his life, even to the last moment of his life, and will bring supreme blessings to the soul because of the conscience that has witnessed an upright life and the memory of the good achievements in the past. Comfort.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger&#39;s life is one of the best illustrations of this. Like Benjamin Franklin, whom he loved to emulate, he always had a strong thirst for knowledge and a wide range of interests. He was always creating, giving, and then being remembered. He has spent a full 99 years carefully, just as his mantra at Berkshire&#39;s annual meeting: &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;( Reference materials: &quot;Poor Charlie&#39;s Almanac&quot; and &quot;Munger&#39;s Way&quot;.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[糖分摄入过多有危害，上海试水含糖饮料健康提示]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261576]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“3元羽绒服”上热搜：不是买不起还是感冒药更有性价比]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261501]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, discussions about down jackets have become heated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When will down jackets sell for five figures?&quot; &quot;Domestic down jackets sell for 7,000 yuan&quot;... Thousands of thousands of down jackets are frequently on the hot search list, slowly becoming a &quot;luxury product&quot; in winter &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the &quot;3 yuan down jacket&quot; attracted the attention and discussion of netizens, showing that low-priced down jackets costing 3 yuan but actually selling for only 35 yuan were given to ordinary people in the cold winter. The warmest gift, for them, is more than enough for them compared to big-name luxury goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the light snow season has arrived and major cities have entered winter, many people have dug out the down jacket that has been at the bottom of their boxes for a year. Statistics show that more than half of netizens buy down jackets when needed. , during the Double 11 period, down jackets became a hot-selling product on major e-commerce platforms. Many domestic down jackets appeared on Tmall’s best-selling list and received a lot of praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the rise of domestic down jackets is inseparable from the improvement of the comprehensive production strength of the manufacturers behind them, and the Yangtze River Delta is the main force in down production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong, the number of down-related companies exceeds 10,000, and many domestic down jacket brands are gradually starting to transform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the wide variety of down jacket brands and types, many netizens said that they are in urgent need of a scientific selection guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it depends on the filling of the down jacket: goose down is more expensive than duck down due to factors such as large and full velvet, good fluffiness, strong warmth retention, and long use time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is the down that really plays a role in keeping warm, and the down content more intuitively reflects the quality of the down jacket. It is worth noting that thicker and warmer is not the case.

But in more than ten years of study experience, he found that his ideal is still to &quot;engage in academics and do research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from the Journalism Department of Fudan University in 1968, the child soldiers were assigned to participate in labor training in Horqin, Inner Mongolia. In 1970, the &quot;Jintie News&quot; accidentally discovered their writing skills to become a journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tide of the times is carrying budding journalism students drifting in unknown directions. In 1977, news came that the country had resumed the college entrance examination. The child soldiers who were far away from the border regained their fighting spirit to study, and the following year they were admitted to the postgraduate degree in the Chinese Department of Peking University. This year, a full ten years have passed since the child soldier graduated from college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His mentor during his master&#39;s and doctoral studies was journalism educator Gan Xifen. Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Tong Bing devoted himself to the research of Marxist journalism concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Opening up a new research direction requires a lot of basic reading support. Within one year, Tong Bing read through more than 4,000 papers with the word &quot;horse&quot; in them, and also read through all 50 volumes of the complete works of Marx and Engels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The complete works of Marx and Engels were published in batches. After the first 39 volumes were read, the last 11 volumes were not published until 1985.&quot; Tong Bing said that at that time, the most complete new books could only be seen at the former Central Compilation and Translation Bureau. The child soldier who was still a &quot;poor student&quot; often brought two steamed buns and a cup of boiling water to read in the Translation and Compilation Bureau, sitting there all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating with his doctorate in 1988, Tong Bing stayed at Renmin University of China to take up a teaching position. In more than 40 years of research and teaching career, he has published more than 700 academic papers, published and edited more than 50 books, textbooks, dictionaries, etc., and successively published the &quot;History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot; and &quot;The History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot;. Academic monographs such as &quot;Classic Course of Marxist Journalism&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Theoretical Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Journalism Theory&quot;, &quot;Comparative Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Subject and Mouthpiece - An Examination of the Trajectory of News Communication in the Republic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This is how I have been through these years. It can be said that there is no time to breathe and no chance to sleep peacefully. I am constantly breaking through new tasks. Although it was tiring at the time, looking back now, I think it was worth it,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the first doctorate in journalism independently trained in China, Tong Bing has experienced the process of graduate education in journalism from scratch and witnessed the development of Renmin University of China, The development of journalism at Fudan University, one of the two famous universities in the north and the other in the south. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do knowledge simply and plainly, but don&#39;t do simple learning&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t dare to waste a day in life&quot; are the creeds he mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Already octogenarian, Tong Bing is currently a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University, still standing on the three-foot podium teaching journalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Truth&quot; is a key word for Tong Bing&#39;s academic studies. He once used the four &quot;truths&quot; of &quot;true learning, true understanding, true belief, and true application&quot; The words summarized his lifelong academic insights. His pursuit of truth in learning also allowed him to repeatedly speak out about the shortcomings of the journalism community and the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Journalism research has entered a new era. He directly stated the shortcomings of the development of the discipline, &quot;Among various disciplines, the discipline construction of journalism has developed slowly.&quot; In his It seems that in order to solve the development problems of journalism, &quot;it is necessary to calmly spread out the problems and conduct in-depth analysis. This may be good.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;My ideal is not here.

At that time, I was a student cadre and the president of the student union. I was no stranger to news. . Student cadres who want to take the liberal arts major usually choose the Department of Politics, the Department of International Politics, and the Department of Journalism. At that time, the universities with the best journalism departments in my country were Renmin University in the north and Fudan University in the south. My parents didn’t want me to leave Shanghai, so I took the Fudan exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ span>;It took ten years between graduating from undergraduate degree and applying for graduate school. Can you talk about this experience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; When I graduated from my undergraduate degree, it was at the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and I was assigned to participate in labor training in the Northeast. I started out as a road maintenance worker building railroads. At that time, all major railway bureaus in our country had enterprise newspapers, and Jinzhou Railway had an enterprise newspaper called &quot;Jintie News&quot;. More than half a year later, they found out about me and transferred me to the newspaper as an editor and reporter. The newspaper office often holds correspondent training classes. Since I major in journalism, I often give lectures and have a relatively harmonious relationship with everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After staying there for a while, our country resumed the college entrance examination. At first, the railway didn’t want to let me go because I had already graduated from my undergraduate degree. But later, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau heard that both Renmin University and Fudan University were recruiting master&#39;s degree students (there were no graduate students in the journalism major before) and agreed that I would try to take the exam. I passed the exam right away and was the first batch of master&#39;s students recruited in our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Reform and opening up on your personal destiny What is the impact? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; The changes in my personal destiny are closely linked to reform and opening up. Sometimes I often say in meetings or classes that I am very grateful to Deng Xiaoping. If the college entrance examination and university admissions are not resumed, I may still be a reporter at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau tabloid for the rest of my life. If I do well, I may be promoted to deputy editor-in-chief or editor-in-chief. However, my ideal is not in this place. I still want to engage in academics and theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; During graduate school, Professor Gan was How did that guide you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; Mr. Gan Xifen is also recruiting graduate students for the first time, and his requirements for me are relatively strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There were pilot projects before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, but they could not be carried out after a while, so there was no master&#39;s degree in journalism before 1978. The lifelong wish of these old gentlemen is to push forward journalism research. The National People&#39;s Congress and Fudan University were the first to do relevant work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Gan Xifen emphasized two points when guiding me. The first point is to read the original works. He believes that graduate students in journalism should learn more classic works; the second point is to practice. I always insisted on these two points while studying at Renmin University, and I persisted relatively well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;How do you insist on these two points? required? What are the specific methods? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I had classes during the day, read in the afternoon, and went to the journalism department office around 4 o&#39;clock to read the day&#39;s newspapers. , we poor students could not afford to subscribe to newspapers at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I come back from the classroom and library at 9pm, I review the day&#39;s newspapers in the dormitory, including the day&#39;s &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; and &quot;China Youth Daily&quot;. The review is conducted 5 nights a week, each person is responsible for one week, and several people take turns. The students responsible for reviewing the newspaper should take notes and write a report every week, which should be sent to the newspaper. The newspaper also attaches great importance to our opinions and will reply to us every once in a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This arrangement is very helpful to our study. After a 3-year master&#39;s degree, I stuck to this method for almost 3 years. We also have many contacts with news organizations and have a relatively close relationship. I did the same thing until I stayed in school to become a teacher after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Continuously opening new courses and recruiting new students&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;In 1983, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council agreed to establish a doctorate in journalism. Under the background of that time, if you graduate with a master&#39;s degree and work as a university teacher, your academic qualifications are enough. Why do you continue to study for a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;One is because of the need for theoretical study , studying for a doctoral degree will give you the opportunity to audit courses in many other majors at Renmin University. For example, I have listened to history, scientific socialism, and international politics. When I went to attend classes, none of the teachers refused. They saw that I was not too young and still eager to learn, so they generally allowed me to enter their classrooms, and I often asked questions in class. In this regard, they really treated me. Very considerate: When I go to ask questions after class, other teachers or classmates will stop and let me (ask questions first). In the process of my study, it can be said that many teachers from relevant majors at Renmin University have helped me a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, my supervisor and other teachers in the journalism department hope that I can take the lead in helping the school establish a doctoral program in journalism. Later, the State Education Commission agreed that journalism would have a doctoral degree. At that time, China began to have doctoral programs (in journalism), and two schools were approved, one was the Journalism Department of Fudan University, and the other was the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;After graduating from the Ph.D., you stayed He taught at the National People&#39;s Congress and returned to his alma mater, Fudan University, in 2001. What did you think at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>;After completing my master&#39;s degree at Renmin University, I stayed in school because of the needs of school work. At that time, our journalism industry was in great need of talents, and young people wanted to join it and go out into the society. But the instructor said something to me, which moved me very much. The Cultural Revolution delayed it for ten years, and they really wanted to restore our major as soon as possible, so they hoped that I could stay and teach in this school with peace of mind. Only by staying in this profession and being a good teacher can this profession continue to have new talents and new developments. I quickly accepted the arrangements in the school and worked hard. I have done a lot of pioneering work over the past few decades. It is very worthwhile when I think about it now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moving from the National People&#39;s Congress to teaching at Fudan is also an adjustment arrangement for the school. At that time, Fudan was in great need of people. Compared with Renmin University, Fudan&#39;s development is more international. Many outstanding students have gone abroad after graduation. The teachers are getting older and their health is getting worse every year. We teachers and students know each other very well, and we see this situation with our eyes and are anxious in our hearts. Therefore, the school raised this expectation and hoped that we can come back to shoulder the heavy burden. I came back without saying anything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the beginning, there was a lot of pressure and a heavy burden. Journalism was delayed for many years by the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and is in urgent need of development. The desire for talents is everywhere. So whether I stayed at the National People&#39;s Congress or was later called by Fudan University, I just taught with peace of mind, constantly opening new courses and recruiting new students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This has been the case for these years. It can be said that when there is no time to breathe, there is no chance to sleep peacefully. Although we were very tired at the time, we soon overcame these difficulties and continued to make new progress in our work. Looking back now, I still think it was worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Understand your mission”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;In your opinion, what is the overall shift in current journalism research and what are its deficiencies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>;Differences in theoretical viewpoints are inevitable, natural, and reasonable. (The development of journalism research) I think it ultimately depends on the progress of journalism practice. You are right to insist on your point of view. As a result, newspapers and radio and television have been successfully run. This shows that theory guides practice. On the other hand, if your theory is sound and sound, but no one reads your newspaper or listens to your broadcast, it shows that your theory has no power. Isn&#39;t this a problem? This is where we theorists feel ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is still a strong culture of self-appreciation in the academic world, which should not be the case. The academic community should review this and analyze the reasons behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism has always faced the &quot;news What do you think of the questioning and debate about &quot;no learning&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tongbing:&lt;/strong>; The &quot;no-learning theory&quot; has long-term influence on the development of journalism, mainly due to several circumstances. Journalism started relatively late, and there are not many independent scholarships and works. The aspect of journalism that has a deeper impact on China is practice. Running newspapers, radio stations, and television stations are all based on practical work. There are not many people who actually engage in theoretical research. Not big either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These understandings affect the status and image of journalism in various liberal arts majors. After we got PhDs, China&#39;s journalism research gradually got on the right track and started to have something decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;How do you understand journalists Mission? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>; Journalists must understand their mission. The simplest and simplest requirement is to report the truth to the people. , real news, that’s the most important thing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism Freshman Can you give some life advice to college students who have just entered school? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; This is a very broad proposition. I think the life development of college students is the same as the operation characteristics of our entire country. , one wave after another, one tide after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As teachers, we hope that the new students can inherit the good traditions of the school and develop them stronger, so that the university will become better and better, and the college students themselves will also become better and better. We can continue to make progress. Only in this way will our country become better and better and our career become more and more brilliant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So after college students enter university, the first thing is to understand their mission. Everyone should have their own arrangements and expectations. This is not just lip service, it is actually something that must be done. We all came slowly from undergraduate to master&#39;s and doctoral degrees. New students especially need to have a sense of mission and have expectations, prospects, and arrangements for the future. I think this is the most important thing. Time flies so fast. Even if you look at the four years of undergraduate studies, half of it has passed in the blink of an eye. However, the task is actually endless. We still need to continue to work hard, strive for, and develop in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;College students should not be afraid of being tired. Only by constantly exploring their own prospects can individuals have new goals, new directions, and continuous progress. Learn more every day, overcome your shortcomings, and show new expectations. This is my common expectation for our college students, whether they are undergraduates, masters, or doctoral students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“机场判官”再曝住宿骗局：虚假定位误导消费者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261538]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 5, 2020, Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport.

With the update of this series of videos, the Xi&#39;an transfer strategy that Liu Yi originally wanted to do has gradually evolved into a &quot;spy war drama&quot;. Netizens not only liked and followed it, but also continued to provide clues to Liu Yi. In Liu Yi&#39;s account (the account name is &quot;This is not too much&quot;), videos related to Xi&#39;an Airport have become &quot;top-rated&quot; content, and many of them have more than three million views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of November 20, Liu Yi once again released a video saying that hotels and B&amp;Bs around Xi&#39;an Airport posted false positioning on the OTA platform (online travel hotel platform) For hotel information, he searched these platforms for a B&amp;B several hundred meters away from the airport, and actually had to take a car there. Previously, the person in charge of Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport promised in a media interview that a more powerful comprehensive management mechanism would be established to address the problems existing at Xi&#39;an Airport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of November 23, staff of the Airport New District Management Committee of Xixian New City, Xi&#39;an told Southern Weekend reporters that the Market Supervision Branch, Comprehensive Law Enforcement Detachment, and Public Security Bureau that day Staff from the Guangde Road Police Station and the Beidu Street Office have formed a joint law enforcement team to inspect the B&amp;Bs in Bianfang Village and Dashoudou Village and urge them to make rectifications. “Regarding Xi’an’s city image, we are still very Attention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Falsely positioned B&amp;B&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As early as Liu Yi released the 10th video related to Xi&#39;an Airport, security personnel can be seen almost everywhere at Xi&#39;an Airport To maintain order, the &quot;liars&quot; who were previously exposed to solicit customers in violation of regulations are hard to find. In the video released on November 20, Liu Yi deliberately took the high-speed train from Beijing to Xi&#39;an in order to avoid leaking his itinerary, and then took a bus to Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport to &quot;patrol&quot;, which confirmed that the positioning of B&amp;Bs around the airport on the OTA platform was fraudulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this video, Liu Yi searched for the hotel with the closest straight line distance on a platform, and the first-ranked &quot;Jiaxuan Boutique B&amp;B&quot; was marked &quot;from Xianyang The international airport is 340 meters straight.&quot; In fact, the passenger arrived at the online car-hailing parking lot, which is the hotel pick-up location. Then he searched on another platform, and multiple Huangzhixiang Hotel branches appeared on the page, one of which was &quot;119 meters &quot;Straight-line distance from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport&quot;, but when I called, the other party told me that the hotel is behind the terminal and that I need to wait for the car to pick me up; finally, the Shitouji Inn, which was &quot;less than 100 meters away from you in a straight line&quot; on the third platform, was also falsely positioned. .

The hotel is actually more than 8 kilometers away from the airport. It is said to be an inn, but it is actually a room owned by farmers near the airport, and the sanitary rooms are extremely poor.&quot; Some netizens said that there are already tourists on the online platform Comments mentioned issues such as long distances and fake room pictures, but this type of B&amp;B still ranks high on the platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi discovered that the above-mentioned B&amp;Bs were falsely positioned at the online car-hailing parking lot, T3 terminal, and T2 terminal of Xi&#39;an Airport. According to the information he collected, these B&amp;Bs are basically run by villagers from Bianfang Village and Shitou Village near the airport. Because they are close to the airport, these villages have developed a transit accommodation industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters searched on Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and other platforms, and only &quot;near Xi&#39;an Xianyang International&quot; was displayed in the hotel list.

On another OTA platform, a store that was marked on the 20th as &quot;less than 100 meters away from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport in a straight line, about a 1-minute walk&quot; was modified on the 22nd to &quot;4.5 kilometers from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport by car, about 9 minutes.&quot; When a reporter from Southern Weekend asked why it was only a one-minute walk away, the store owner did not reply directly, but emphasized that &quot;I am outside the airport, and there is no way it is as cheap as ours inside the airport.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters contacted four OTA platforms, Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and Meituan, but received no reply. An industry insider on the OTA platform who did not want to be named analyzed that the platform needs to verify the address of the hotel before it goes online, and also conducts daily verification and inspections after going online. The current listings with false addresses should be due to the operators providing fake business operations. For example, the address on the license or lease contract is the same as the online address, so it is difficult for the platform to identify it. At the same time, various online travel and hotel platforms still have some agent listings, and some listings are closed on one platform and re-listed on other platforms. &quot;If the platform does not effectively intercept, it will be difficult to investigate and deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City told Southern Weekend reporters that the local market supervision department has interviewed three OTA platforms in the past two days and ordered them to strengthen the management of homestays around the airport.

At that time, he chose a platform to introduce a hotel only 200 meters away from the airport. The picture looked clean and spacious. The result The man who picked her up drove her for more than ten minutes and took her to a self-built building, saying that this was a hotel. Zhang Ning reasoned with the hotel receptionist about why the hotel location and photos were different from those on the platform. The other party said, &quot;That&#39;s an old hotel and it&#39;s closed.&quot; He didn&#39;t provide a specific address and asked her to get there and take a taxi. It was already late at night, so Zhang Ning could only stay after repeated considerations, and asked the airport pick-up staff to take her back to the airport the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Originally I wanted to give a negative review, but because he has my personal information, I didn&#39;t dare to give it.&quot; Zhang Ning said that she was worried about being retaliated against, and she didn&#39;t want to give it to herself. create unnecessary trouble during the journey. A few months after the incident, Zhang Ning recorded the incident in Liu Yi&#39;s video comment area, &quot;I hope more people will see these issues and support him in safeguarding his rights.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video recorded by Liu Yi, his process of exposing the accommodation scam was also quite tortuous.

For disorderly conduct, 148 people have been punished since September and 3 people were detained administratively. But soon, when Liu Yi arrived at Xi&#39;an Airport again, the scammer only moved from Gate 324 to Gate 322 of the airport, and the security guards did not effectively intercept him.

According to screenshots provided by netizens, Liu Yi checked in at Shenzhen to fly to Xi&#39;an on October 24. At 18:42, a message appeared in the black car group at Xi&#39;an Airport that Liu Yi was about to go to Xi&#39;an, reminding everyone to be careful. For this reason, Liu Yi had to call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the following video, he said that he would buy 15 air tickets, fly from Shenzhen to Xi&#39;an once a week, and inspect the airport for improvements.

The police found the security guard who spread the information, but were unable to find out who leaked it. He also understands this.

Going out of the palace means going home. At this moment, it is lying quietly in the Xu Wei Art Museum in Shaoxing. This is the first time it has been unfolded so completely. Prior to this, due to the limitations of the exhibition space, this long scroll had never been completely opened. Visitors to the exhibition could only see part of it. Even in the album, it could only be broken down piece by piece. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flowers in the four seasons have never been in full bloom at the same time. Peonies and peonies in spring, grapes and bananas in midsummer, osmanthus and pines in autumn, bamboo branches and old plums with snow in winter, all splashing together to create a wonderful achievement. The &quot;Rise of Smoke and Clouds&quot; by Xu Wei, the founder of Chinese freehand brushwork and a giant of the generation. The self-revealed poem at the end of the volume is even more sophisticated: &quot;I am dripping with ink while playing games. Flowers and plants will be mixed all the time. No wonder there are two strokes missing in the painting. The way of heaven has been very bad recently.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening time of Xu Wei Art Museum is different. It was only officially put into use in 2021, which was still during the COVID-19 epidemic. Since the opening of the museum, there have been only three large-scale exhibitions, but each of them was &quot;flawless&quot;. The opening exhibition was the exhibition of the &quot;freak Ivy&quot; Xu Wei himself, followed by Chen Laolian. By 2023, It is a special performance by Ren Bonian, and each performance is worth a special trip. The 13-meter &quot;Flowers of the Four Seasons&quot; came from Ren Bonian&#39;s exhibition. Although Xu Wei and his fellow countryman Ren Bonian are more than 300 years apart in time, the intersection in space and the transmission of culture can be called the inheritance of pen and ink in a broad sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/HPXewWe9C11GQigdCrEXNX4QPRGcowIm1pwsasyB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/HPXewWe9C11GQigdCrEXNX4QPRGcowIm1pwsasyB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259263&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhong Kui in the works of Ren Bonian&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ren Bonian, a painter in the late Qing Dynasty, was a leader among the &quot;Shanghai School&quot; and the &quot;Four Rens&quot;, especially the figures. Good at painting. When Ren Bonian was young, his family ran a rice shop, but his father was good at painting and taught him in his spare time. It is said that Ren Bonian was able to draw lifelike figures very early. It is said that one time someone came to see his father, but his father was not there. When he came back and heard about it, he asked Ren Bonian who the visitor was. Bonian was only ten years old at the time and could not answer the guest&#39;s name, so he had to take a piece of paper and draw the person&#39;s name. His appearance was obvious to his father at a glance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ren Bonian was 22 years old, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom invaded Shaoxing and his father was killed. Ren Bonian was also involved in the war and held the flag for the Taiping Army. He later lived in Ningbo and Shanghai and made a living selling paintings. Ren Xiong and Ren Xun among the &quot;Four Rens on the Sea&quot; are Ren Bonian&#39;s clan uncles, and they both taught him painting, but he soon became better than his master. In this exhibition of Ren Bonian&#39;s paintings titled &quot;Impermanent Brushwork, Elegance and Richness&quot;, his paintings are displayed together with the other &quot;Three Rens&quot;, making a judgment, although he learned from Ren Xun The complicated &quot;nail head and rat tail&quot; brushwork, but the same painting of people, Ren Bonian&#39;s stylist Fa Chen Laolian immediately got rid of Ren Xun&#39;s vulgarity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Wu shepherding sheep, Xizhi loves geese, Zhong Kui...these are common themes in Ren Bonian&#39;s works, and they are characters he repeatedly painted. The Zhong Kui he painted is especially chic, with a high attitude and a swaggering look. The knights, often in these works with new and surprising shapes, you can get a glimpse of the painter&#39;s true temperament and sense of humor. The same goes for his paintings of flowers and birds. The fat bird with its big white eyes comes from Bada Shanren, but the extraordinary rise of Bada turned into joy in Ren Bonian&#39;s place. The chicks that have just emerged from their eggshells under the crape myrtle flowers are fluffy and childish. His gait and expression are like those of a gangster, he is still young and arrogant, which makes people smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Egpnr7tr8haTxsmnwxwnPmwCUl88sESebNpNhPcg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;461&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Egpnr7tr8haTxsmnwxwnPmwCUl88sESebNpNhPcg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259264&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aunt Gongsun is considered to be the best master of sword dancing in the prosperous Tang Dynasty&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most interesting one is &quot;A Picture of Aunt Gongsun Dancing with Swords&quot;. It is said that Aunt Gongsun was the number one dancer in the prosperous age of Kaiyuan, and was promoted to be the best dancer in the prosperous Tang Dynasty for her sword dancing. Zhang Xu, the grass sage, understood the essence of cursive script from her sword skills, and Wu Daozi, the painting sage, also learned about Gongsun Auntie’s dance by watching her dance. Use the sword to learn how to use the pen. What the actual situation is cannot be determined now, but look at Ren Bonian&#39;s painting of sword dancing. Gongsun danced the two white blades as if they were practiced softly. The artist did not hesitate to draw hundreds of circles to record the imaginary and the real. All the traces of the sword flying across the air, the leaves on the big tree branches behind Aunt Gongsun trembled, as if they felt the sword energy, but Aunt Gongsun herself remained unmoved, her expression was quite calm, she was the one who stood firm among the thousands of changes. The core of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Beihong once said: Ren Bonian is &quot;the first Chinese painter after Qiu Shizhou (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qiu Ying&lt;/span>;) &quot;I don&#39;t care whether this statement is fair or not, but at least it reflects Xu Beihong&#39;s preference for Ren Bonian. This preference may be related to Ren Bonian&#39;s position. He lives in Shanghai all year round and makes a living selling paintings. Therefore, his paintings combine literati paintings and fireworks. Indeed, we can see many traces of connecting the past and the future, connecting China and the world. It is a rich and flexible tradition of calligraphy and painting, which is at the confluence and turning point of the tide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都新力量]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261516]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;The power of a city to move forward largely comes from the new strength of the new youth.

Image source: Pinduoduo Weibo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 28, 2023, Beijing time, Pinduoduo’s intraday trading repeatedly hit new highs, rising by more than 18%. Within fifteen minutes, the market value increased by $100 million. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the opening to the closing, Pinduoduo’s total market value soared from US$156.4 billion to US$184.7 billion, a surge of nearly 30 billion. As of the close, Pinduoduo was only tens of billions away from Alibaba, which has a market capitalization of US$195.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If compared according to the price limit rules of China&#39;s A-share market, Pinduoduo is only one &quot;price limit&quot; away from Alibaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s rapid rise has triggered heated discussions among investors. Some people lamented that the throne of e-commerce is about to change hands and that &quot;an era of great things is coming&quot;, while others joked that &quot;the higher the stock price rises, the poorer everyone becomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fierce reaction of the capital market stems from Pinduoduo’s outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 28, Pinduoduo (PDD.Nasdaq) released its financial report for the third quarter of 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;financial report&quot;), with revenue of 68.84 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 94%, not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP), net profit attributable to Pinduoduo’s ordinary shareholders was 17.027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can clearly feel the continued recovery of the economy, as well as the potential and resilience of the consumer market. At the same time, we also see from user behavior that consumption upgrades are both about quality and price. The optimization of price-performance ratio is consumers&#39; ultimate pursuit of good products at good prices.&quot; said Chen Lei, Chairman and Co-CEO of Pinduoduo Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Pinduoduo’s past financial reports, it achieved (Non-GAAP) quarterly profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 89%. Since then, although revenue has doubled on average every quarter, it was not until the second quarter of 2021 that Pinduoduo achieved double growth in revenue and net profit in a single quarter for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, Pinduoduo has drawn a significant upward curve of revenue growth and net profit doubling for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Buy a lot of groceries, a hidden revenue tool&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei attributed the revenue growth to the improvement of the consumer environment and the implementation of the company&#39;s &quot;high-quality development&quot; strategy. Judging from the financial report, Pinduoduo’s 94% revenue growth was due to the double increase in revenue from its two main businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online marketing services and other services increased by 39% year-on-year, and transaction service revenue increased by as much as 315% year-on-year. The two account for about half of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What supports the growth of transaction service revenue is generally an increase in the number of active merchants on the platform and an increase in the average transaction service revenue of each active merchant (i.e. commission). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from a Pinduoduo merchant that the transaction commission is charged based on the sales price of the completed order, and the commission will not be refunded if the consumer returns the product. Pinduoduo did not release GMV (gross merchandise transaction) data in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Lichong, President of Huisheng International Capital, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that transaction service fees actually include the income of Duoduo Maicai. This quarter’s unexpected growth is due to the rapid expansion of Duoduo Maicai. Huang Lichong once served as executive director and managing director of the investment banking department of China International Finance Securities (Hong Kong). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduomaicai was launched in August 2020. Since then, Pinduoduo’s transaction service fee income has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei commented at the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call that Duoduo’s grocery shopping business is “a platform that consumers use very frequently.” Entering the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s number of active buyers surpassed Alibaba for the first time, reaching 788 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, Duoduomaicai has gone through many rounds of fierce battles between platforms and has survived the dark moment of community group buying. According to reports from many media including Qilu Evening News, nine provinces have been shut down in order to target the prosperity of the sinking market. Jingxi Pinpin is only left in Langfang, Hebei and Beijing. Other community group buying has also been shut down one after another. Currently, Pinduoduo and Meituan Each controls half of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the US asset management company HAYDEN CAPITAL estimated that by 2025, Duoduo Maicai will contribute at least about 14 billion yuan in EBIT to Pinduoduo, which may start in 2023 Achieve overall profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial performance meeting, Chen Lei introduced that Pinduoduo started out in agricultural products and retained a number of users through agricultural products services. However, the current online rate of this category is low, and there is huge potential in the future. potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Duoduo’s grocery shopping, the market generally speculates that Duoduo’s cross-border services may create a new revenue growth curve for Pinduoduo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, Pinduoduo launched the cross-border e-commerce project Temu, which Chen Lei regarded as his &quot;third venture.&quot; At that time, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance, Liu Jun, said that cross-border business was in its early stages and would have little impact on financial reports. Temu’s revenue data was not announced in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduo’s cross-border project is led by Gu Pingping, the former head of Duoduo’s grocery shopping, and inherits Pinduoduo’s domestic supply, talent, and marketing advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial report meeting, Liu Jun said, &quot;Pinduoduo&#39;s global business is still in a very early stage, and the team is still increasing its understanding of consumer needs in different markets around the world.&quot; Currently, Temu has launched a In 2016, it has expanded to 40 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Getting out of the quagmire of losses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 28, in contrast to the upward trend in Pinduoduo’s stock price, the stock price of Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) dropped all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumption downgrading is an increasingly clear trend. Consumers are moving from platforms with high unit prices to low-price platforms. Low price is still the key for Pinduoduo to occupy the sinking market in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at Pinduoduo’s growth history, the “10 billion subsidy” strategy has not only opened up the market for it, but is also the main reason for dragging down its financial performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo has faced significant losses since its listing. From 2018 to the first quarter of 2020, losses continued to expand. In June 2019, after the &quot;Ten Billion Subsidy&quot; was launched, it achieved GMV growth and increased user activity. The price was that its sales and marketing expenses exceeded profits, which was equivalent to all the revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the second quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s losses have narrowed. Ma Jing, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance at the time, said at the earnings conference call, “Profitability will not be considered this year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the third quarter of 2020 that Pinduoduo achieved profitability for the first time, which was also when CEO Chen Lei took office. The first report card after. This year, Pinduoduo launched Duoduo’s grocery shopping business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo really &quot;taken off&quot; in the second quarter of 2021, with both revenue and profit increasing, and getting out of the mire of losses. Since then, it has almost maintained a double-digit profit growth. In particular, three quarters in 2022 will achieve multiple growth, with profits in the second quarter nearly tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jing responded at the second quarter 2021 conference call that revenue growth stems from the increase in the number of users and the increase in user psychological share, and the second quarter is the off-season for marketing, so marketing expenditures are small and there are seasonal factors. Special reasons for sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pinduoduo executives also made no secret of the fact that the increase in profits comes from cost reduction and efficiency increase during the 2021 financial results conference call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Lichong said that over the years, Pinduoduo has optimized its operating costs, reduced some unnecessary expenses, increased profit margins by increasing product prices and reducing after-sales service costs, while investing in technology, logistics, agriculture and other fields. , improve its own competitiveness and business efficiency. These strategies have effectively helped it get out of losses and achieve profits beyond expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s executive director and co-CEO Zhao Jiazhen revealed in a recent earnings conference call that during the just past “Double Eleven” promotion, the number of users of Pinduoduo’s “10 billion subsidy” has exceeded 620 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the financial report was released, employees on Alibaba’s intranet discussed Pinduoduo’s performance in the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba partner Jack Ma rarely replied, &quot;All great companies are born in winter. The era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is both an opportunity and a challenge for everyone. I would like to congratulate Pinduoduo for the past few years. Decision-making, execution and efforts. No one is better, but those who can reform for the sake of tomorrow and the organization that are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
