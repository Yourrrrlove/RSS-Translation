The caller can report the netizen&#39;s name, phone number, ID number, flight information, etc. Netizens believe that their personal information has been leaked and used for telecommunications fraud, and hope that relevant departments will investigate strictly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, the Civil Aviation Administration of China responded that it is preparing relevant documents to further strengthen the protection of important data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flight cancellation compensation&quot; has recently become a popular means of telecommunications fraud, with some passengers losing even more than 2 million yuan. Fraudsters can accurately report the passenger&#39;s name, ID number, and flight information, which undoubtedly means that the information related to the ticket purchased has been leaked. However, the ticket booking process is cumbersome and involves many parties. Online travel platforms, airlines, ticket agents, as well as intermediaries and terminal systems such as TravelSky and operators, there is a risk of data leakage in any link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of fraud has become a popular electronic fraud method recently, and passengers can receive fraudulent calls soon after booking a ticket, which shows that the leakage of passenger flight information has become large-scale. Leaking passenger flight information is not only an illegal and criminal act in itself, but also provides a target for electronic fraud crimes. It is the upstream of the black industry chain of telecommunications fraud. Timely crackdown on flight information leakage is of great significance to cutting off the upstream of the industry chain and reducing telecommunications fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people think of telecom fraud, the first thing that often comes to mind is fraud crimes such as &quot;pig killing&quot;, &quot;online gambling&quot;, and &quot;rebate fraud&quot;, as well as popular news such as the proliferation of telecom fraud parks in northern Myanmar. Especially after thousands of people involved in fraud in northern Myanmar were recently handed over to the Chinese police, many people thought that the electronic fraudsters had been caught in one fell swoop, and that electronic fraud would be greatly reduced in the future. But this is a misunderstanding, or just a good wish. Telecom fraud has become a huge industry, not only overseas, but also within China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The telecommunications frauds people see are actually just one part of this huge criminal industry chain, and upstream and downstream there are also illegal crimes such as theft of personal information and money laundering. Fraud groups also have data processing departments. After collecting huge amounts of personal information, they analyze and process it to find &quot;high-value&quot; targets. They use different fraud scripts for different fraud targets, and finally execute the script to make you fall for the scam. . The source of all this is personal information. The more detailed and specific the information, the easier it is to apply personalized scripts to conduct &quot;precise fraud.&quot; The script for flight cancellation compensation is this kind of precise fraud, which takes advantage of passengers&#39; anxiety about flight cancellations and blocked itineraries, and the fraud has a higher success rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, the possibility of information leakage is almost everywhere. The flight information leak mentioned above is just one of them. Large-ticket consumption areas such as buying houses and cars are also the hardest hit areas for information leakage. After many people buy a house, they will receive sales calls for decoration, furniture and appliances, etc. After buying a car, they will receive sales calls for insurance, car products, etc. It&#39;s just for sales, so it&#39;s not bad, but since this personal information can be sold to people who sell furniture, home appliances, and insurance, of course it can also be sold to telecom fraudsters, and this information containing real estate and vehicle-related content can easily be used. Carry out &quot;precision fraud&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, a more serious information leak may be a large-scale data leak of some websites. The popularization of Internet applications, while bringing great convenience, has also sharply increased the risk of personal information leakage. Whether it&#39;s sending express delivery, ordering takeout, taking online ride-hailing, or registering as a member, each platform has a massive amount of users&#39; personal information. Once these platforms fail to provide adequate security protection and are breached by hackers, a large amount of user information may be leaked. Previously, a user data leak occurred on a certain short video platform, with the total amount of information reaching 2 billion. After this information is leaked, it will exist permanently on the dark web, cannot be eliminated, and is constantly being sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Personal Information Protection Law has very specific provisions on preventing the leakage of personal information. Major websites should strictly abide by the &quot;minimum enough&quot; principle and only collect and store necessary user personal information to reduce the damage caused to users by possible information leakage. After all, no matter how you protect it, it is difficult to guarantee that it will be foolproof and never leak. Even if safety is technically guaranteed, there may still be situations where it is difficult to prevent house thieves. The police have uncovered more than one case in which telecom company employees provided user phone numbers and other information to fraud groups, and even provided phone lines to fraud groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The criminal law clearly stipulates that selling or providing citizens’ personal information to others, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes a crime. According to relevant judicial interpretations, selling or providing whereabouts information is used by others to commit crimes, or knowing that others are using citizens&#39; personal information to commit crimes and still selling or providing personal information to them are considered &quot;serious circumstances.&quot; Therefore, if passenger flight information is leaked, no matter where it occurs, it is suspected of a crime, and the police should open a case for investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public should also increase their awareness of personal information protection and try not to provide personal information on the Internet. In particular, they should not be greedy for petty gains and provide personal information to unknown websites, and should not scan unknown QR codes casually. Secondly, we must improve our awareness and ability to prevent e-mail fraud. It is necessary to learn more about telecommunications fraud routines, be more vigilant against common fraud scripts such as online gambling and bill fraud, and verify information such as flight delays and refunds through official websites, social accounts, customer service telephone numbers, etc. Telecommunications fraud is difficult to guard against, and the routines are updated very quickly. Even if you encounter a scam script that is enough to disturb your mind, such as &quot;family members are in hospital&quot;, you must increase your concentration, don&#39;t be gullible, and try to contact your family members first. Many people&#39;s personal information may have been circulated on the dark web. It may be difficult to avoid telecom fraud in the future. To prevent fraud, you may have to rely more on yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[针对深圳欢乐谷过山车碰撞事故，三部门联合约谈华侨城集团]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259696]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 20:46:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 31, in response to the roller coaster vehicle collision accident of Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Happy Valley Tourism Company, the State Administration for Market Regulation, in conjunction with the State Council Security Council, The committee office and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council jointly held an interview with OCT Group Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview pointed out that the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to safety production work, requiring that the concept of safety development be firmly established, the implementation of corporate main responsibilities be strengthened, the bottom line of safety production be firmly maintained, and the safety of people&#39;s lives and property be effectively safeguarded. The large-scale amusement facility safety accident that occurred at the Happy Valley Tourism Company in Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town caused many injuries and exposed problems such as insufficient implementation of safety subject responsibilities, poor safety management, ineffective risk prevention and control, and inaccurate reporting of accident information, resulting in adverse social impacts. The lesson is extremely profound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview requested that OCT Group Co., Ltd. urge Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company to do its best to treat the injured, cooperate with the accident investigation, learn lessons from the accident, and fully implement the company&#39;s main responsibility for safety. It is necessary to draw inferences from one example and carry out comprehensive hidden danger inspections and rectifications in subordinate amusement parks, effectively strengthen the safety management of special equipment such as large-scale amusement facilities, resolutely prevent major accidents, keep the bottom line of special equipment safety, and ensure the safety of people&#39;s lives and property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant personnel from Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipal Market Supervision Bureau attended the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[他们眼中的吴尊友：“疫”线三载，抗“艾”一生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259691]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/31/7438acad8d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 31/7438acad8d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256289&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Wu Zunyou’s work did not decrease significantly. Just because of chemotherapy and surgery, the office location was changed from the new site of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Changping, Beijing, to the old office building near the Temple of Heaven. Jia Tianyong/China News Service/Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For most people, they know Wu Zunyou from his repeated appearances at the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic press conference started. Some netizens even put together a group picture of his photogenic scenes - from 2020 to 2022, he gradually lost weight, &quot;like green silk in the morning and snow in the evening.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people have much whiter hair than me. I just feel my work experience through media publicity.&quot; At the beginning of 2023, on CCTV News In the interview, he responded, &quot;Many people have paid more than me. They are working on the front line, and some have paid with their lives, so my investment is really nothing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He did pay the price with his life. At 12:56 on October 27, 2023, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and former director of the Center for STD and AIDS Prevention and Control, who had long worked on the front line of public health, died of illness in Beijing at the age of 60. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is less known is that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago. &quot;When we learned that Teacher Wu was ill, the first thing he said was that he was too tired.&quot; In Guo Wei&#39;s impression, Wu Zunyou rested for less than four hours a day. &quot;We sent him an email at two o&#39;clock in the morning, and at four o&#39;clock I received a reply.&quot; Guo Wei was a student of Wu Zunyou. He later worked at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and became colleagues with Wu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;People who know Wu Zunyou well recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that although Wu was not tall, he was very energetic and always had a slight smile on his lips when he spoke. He usually likes sports, and a pair of running shoes is a frequent item in his luggage. When he travels on business, he always gets up early for a morning run. He also loves badminton. Wu Chang jokes that his right arm is stronger than his left arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the National Two Sessions in 2023, he also prepared a proposal on strengthening the training of public health talents as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference: &quot;We must train more Experts in the field of public health...should have successors in the field of infectious disease prevention and control, so cultivating talents and having a strong team is very important for the future of China&#39;s public health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Requirements for makeup &quot;Block the haggard face&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Wei discovered that the teacher had changed. In December 2021, Wu Zunyou was awarded the &quot;Most Beautiful Technology Worker&quot; &quot;——Wu Zunyou on TV is much thinner than before. &quot;I asked him how much you weigh now, and he said it&#39;s only eighty pounds.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the operation, Wu Zunyou recovered well at first. His weight gradually increased from 80 kilograms to 90 kilograms, and his physical strength slowly recovered. However, a review a few months later found that Cancer lesions also appeared in other organs. Pancreatic cancer is known as the &quot;king of cancers&quot;, with a five-year survival rate of less than one-tenth. Wu Zunyou, a medical student, knows very well what kind of disease pancreatic cancer is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, Guo Wei went to Wu Zunyou’s home to pick him up to record a video for World AIDS Day on December 1, and found that his “hair was all white, and his clothes were He&#39;s going to be a whole lot bigger.&quot; When putting on makeup, he specifically asked to &quot;block the haggard face.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His voice is completely different from before. It has no power at all. During the filming of the video, it took a lot of effort to speak out. He told Guo Wei that he did not dare to take off his clothes casually because he was too weak and he might catch a cold quickly if he took off his clothes. He had to hide away from air conditioners and fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, his work did not decrease significantly. He only changed his office location from the new site of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Changping, Beijing, due to chemotherapy and surgery. An old office building near the Temple of Heaven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The website of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that on February 27, 2023, Wu Zunyou also attended a high-level expert seminar on the prevention and treatment of AIDS and hepatitis C. His last Weibo Stay at 21:22 on April 2, 2023, and advocate &quot;scientific wearing of masks&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Wei recalled that on May 28, 2023, Wu Zunyou and some relevant leaders and experts met at the Oriental Hotel in Beijing to discuss the methadone maintenance treatment plan. Later Guo Wei realized When I arrived, the Oriental Hotel was near the Friendship Hospital where Wu Zunyou was hospitalized and the old CDC office, making it convenient for him to rush from the hospital to meetings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Fighting AIDS under pressure&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If the epidemic made the public aware of Wu Zunyou, the public health system knew about Wu Zunyou from AIDS prevention and treatment began. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 1994, the plasma of a 41-year-old woman in Anhui was tested positive for HIV. However, she lived in a remote rural area with little contact with the outside world and denied it. There is a history of drug abuse, extramarital sexual relations, etc., which almost cuts off all channels of transmission. When he was at a loss, the Anhui Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention called Wu Zunyou, who was studying for a PhD in epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wu Zunyou&#39;s research, a new route of AIDS transmission has surfaced - this woman often sells plasma, and 40% of samples from the local plasma bank are HIV positive , and the equipment is not disinfected, leaving a lot of opportunities for infection. His discovery prevented many people from contracting AIDS through apheresis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Zunyou’s research direction as a mentor at UCLA is the prevention and treatment of AIDS. After returning to China after graduating with a Ph.D. in 1995, he joined the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;now the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span>;) and became the then academic director of the Academy of Preventive Medicine. He is a postdoctoral fellow of Zeng Yi, the president and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on behavioral intervention for HIV/AIDS. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;As for the epidemiology of AIDS, many people in China are already doing it, and they are doing it very well. And the prevention of the spread of AIDS for high-risk groups is Almost no one cares about behavioral intervention work.&quot; Wu Zunyou later explained his choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, most of the people at high risk of AIDS were hidden special groups, such as blood sellers, sex workers, drug addicts, etc. Intervention services were provided for special groups. , reducing their risky behaviors was beyond the acceptance of the general public at the time. &quot;I also faced a certain amount of pressure to deal with this difficult bone.&quot; Wu Zunyou once said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On a trip to Yunnan to investigate the spread of AIDS among female sex workers, Wu Zunyou hoped that the local epidemic prevention stationmaster would take them to the &quot;red light district.&quot; Wu Zunyou and his party visited hair salons one by one. &quot;A &#39;lady&#39; from the hair salon slammed the door and left after learning our true purpose.&quot; Later, they found another one and talked for 45 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At a seminar held on the beach in Beihai, Guangxi, Wu Zunyou and the organizers of the meeting gave each of the AIDS prevention and control personnel in each province 50 yuan to spend money Talk to the sex worker on the beach. &quot;They found it incredible that the conference organizers actually wanted to push them into the arms of sex workers. China has never had such training.&quot; Wu Zunyou later recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, these surveys have become the basis for distributing free condoms, promoting the correct use of condoms, providing clinic consultation services, and formulating AIDS intervention methods that are consistent with national conditions. They have also been It has been incorporated into the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations and the Five-Year Action Plan for AIDS Control as a national strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another contribution of Wu Zunyou is the promotion of methadone maintenance therapy among drug addicts to control the AIDS epidemic. &quot;During this period, the health department had to deal with a lot of work with the public security and judicial departments, including national plans, drug collection, policy revision, on-site pilots and experimental work, all carried out by him and a small number of people.&quot; Guo Wei recalled. As of the end of 2015, there were 785 methadone clinics operating across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This approach has been recognized by the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, which has promoted it globally as a model for AIDS prevention and treatment. In 2022, the World Health Organization awarded Wu Zunyou the Mandela Health Promotion Award. The award citation stated: &quot;He is a pioneer in designing, piloting and expanding service promotion programs among sex workers. He established China&#39;s first needle exchange project and the first large-scale opioid substitution treatment program.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10 /31/45bc2dbd3e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/45bc2dbd3e.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;256290&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 1, 2021, an AIDS prevention and treatment propaganda was posted at a bus station in Fengtai District, Beijing advertise. Today is the 34th &quot;World AIDS Day&quot;. Yi Haifei/China News Service/Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Respond to asking for help and face doubts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Those who have dealt with Wu Zunyou In my impression, he not only promotes AIDS prevention and treatment with an open and scientific attitude, but is also &quot;friendly and personally present&quot; and is very willing to listen to the opinions of community workers and patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2012, Wu Zunyou posted his first Weibo post. He often interacts with netizens and responds to requests for help and questions. On June 4, 2014, he said, &quot;Yesterday, a netizen in Fuzhou reported that the first month of AIDS treatment in Fuzhou requires self-pay. Today I arranged for colleagues to contact the local area.&quot; Faced with a netizen&#39;s criticism of AIDS prevention propaganda, he responded modestly: &quot;Your criticism is true. AIDS propaganda and education need to be strengthened and more targeted. Many people will say this, but almost no one knows how to do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He and I met at a meeting, and he knew all about Beijing&#39;s AIDS organizations in advance.&quot; Kong Lingkun still remembers the scene when they met more than ten years ago. . Kong Lingkun is the chairman of the Beijing Charity Without Borders Charity Foundation and has been committed to eliminating discrimination and supporting AIDS patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Kong Lingkun’s recollection, in 2015, the Beijing Charity Without Borders Charity Foundation settled in the Fifth Medical Center of the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital and set up a charity clinic. Wu Zunyou even made a special trip to the center Visit social workers and patients, and pay attention to the testing work of key groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For disease control personnel, the better you do your job, the less you can see your results. In clinical terms, the more patients you treat, the less likely they are to see your results. The more we do, the greater the sense of accomplishment. But if you look at us (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;CDC staff&lt;/span>;), when we do a better job, the patients The fewer there are; the fewer patients you have, the less you will be seen by society and invisible (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;invisible&lt;/span>;).&quot; 2022 In 2016, Wu Zunyou said this in an interview with &quot;Chinese Philanthropist&quot; magazine&#39;s Person of the Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s hard to say what his greatest contribution is. As long as it talks about all aspects and every field of AIDS in China, he has left a mark.&quot; Now at the United Nations Guo Wei, a strategic information consultant at the UNAIDS Representative Office in China, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the COVID-19 epidemic, Wu Zunyou posted on Weibo more frequently and with more words. Southern Weekend reporters found that since 2022, he has posted 23 original Weibo posts, covering the new crown, monkeypox, influenza epidemics, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The increase in exposure has also led to more controversy. In January 2022, Omicron virus first appeared in China and spread locally. Wu Zunyou said that Omicron virus is &quot;taking all&quot; and the vaccine has a very limited effect in preventing Omicron virus. People can be infected regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. . His remarks brought him controversy. On January 30, he apologized on Weibo for &quot;not fully telling the truth&quot;, emphasizing that &quot;although there have been a certain number of breakthrough cases among vaccine recipients, many people have been prevented from getting infected.&quot; Eleven months later, on December 7, he revised his view on Weibo: &quot;The new crown vaccine has a certain effect in preventing infection, and its effect is more significant in reducing the incidence of severe illness and reducing deaths.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Faced with doubts, in an interview with CCTV News in March 2023, he said, &quot;As a professional, sometimes you have to have the courage or courage to make such a decision. , such research and judgment can inform the people of the correct information in a timely manner.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/31/5c6b301bff.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/5c6b301bff. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In July 2012, Wu Zunyou posted his first Weibo post. Web page screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Rigorous enough to even change the reference format&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Being a student of Wu Zunyou, tiredness is a common feeling. Guo Wei recalled that during his Ph.D. study, he needed to “negate and then deny” all the time - Wu Zunyou asked his students that papers can only be accepted if the conclusion cannot be denied. “Everyone who works with him can feel that he is right.” The job is very demanding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is related to Wu&#39;s study when he was young. While studying for a doctoral degree in epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), his thesis strived to simplify the complex and find the most effective data in the complex data. He used the simplest method to draw clear conclusions. A conclusion that can withstand scrutiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the eyes of students, Wu is sometimes rigorous to the point of harshness. &quot;Every punctuation point in the documents we sent to Teacher Wu must be considered, and he would never allow flaws to appear.&quot; Guo Wei recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In her acknowledgments for her thesis, Wu Peili, a master&#39;s student at Anhui Medical University, described Wu Zunyou this way: &quot;He always keeps the students&#39; affairs in mind, and never fails to study. He will personally guide you through topic selection, topic development, on-site investigation, data analysis, and article revision, and he will even go as far as to help you change the format of your references.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;This rigor also extends to epidemic prevention and control. Starting in 2020, Wu Zunyou rushed to many places to conduct epidemic investigations. According to statistics from the State Council website, Southern Weekend reporters have attended 25 press conferences since 2020, the last one on February 9, 2023. Wu Zunyou is responsible for the joint prevention and control data team. After 12 o&#39;clock every night, the data from each province are reported and compiled into a report, which is then submitted to Wu Zunyou for review and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2020, during the epidemic in Xinfadi, Beijing, Wu Zunyou led multiple teams to conduct on-site investigations, and Guo Wei also participated. &quot;Which batch of goods and where they are placed, he always finds clues through these particularly small contents. This is the accumulation of long-term epidemiology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, although Wu Zunyou&#39;s spirit was as good as before, the signs of the disease had begun to appear.

The narrative method of the story is novel, unique and groundbreaking, and the author had high hopes for it. The winner of the National Book Award in the United States was also invited to give lectures all over the world. However, due to the epidemic, all these conferences were cancelled, and the book did not become as popular as expected. The rights to adapt this book were bought by the great director Spielberg, but there has been no movement so far. I wonder if these directors buying the adaptation rights are like real estate developers buying land, hoping to increase the value of the film. Sometimes when the market is not going well, I will be choked to death by covering myself up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this time the renewed war between Palestine and Israel has drawn attention to this book again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of McCain&#39;s novels combine fiction and non-fiction, and the combination of fiction and reality is effective. Sometimes he uses a real historical time and person as the main line, and the beads on it are fictitious. Sometimes the beads are real and the main line is fictitious; sometimes the main line and the beads are real and the color of the beads is fictitious. He is sometimes real and sometimes weak, and he is just playing with a heartbeat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the novel &quot;The Promise&quot;, the Israeli girl Smadar is killed by a Palestinian terrorist suicide bomb. Abel, a Palestinian girl, was hit in the back of the head by a rubber bullet fired by an 18-year-old Israeli soldier. These two events were ten years apart and both are true. Abir&#39;s father, Bassam, was a Fatah fighter who spent many years in an Israeli prison for attacking Israel with grenades. Smadar&#39;s father, Rami, is an Israeli graphic designer. The two fathers, who had lost their daughters in different ways, eventually came together through the Circle of Lost Parents to tell stories, preach peace and dialogue, and use stories as a means of healing. The magical thing is that before and after the novel was published, the father of the two girls also did some online activities with the author. There are not many novels in which the characters step out of the picture and join hands with the author to preach. This style is a bit sci-fi when I think about it, a bit like &quot;The Painter of Time and Space&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/YcGiCfgg7wiF4Zpm2eMIjFzG4uFP1zv9blUnWyiD.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1035&quot; height= &quot;578&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/YcGiCfgg7wiF4Zpm2eMIjFzG4uFP1zv9blUnWyiD.png&quot; data-key=&quot;256196&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A critical article written by Naftali Moshe on the blog of The Times of Israel after the publication of The Promise. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, both protagonists said that they were deeply shocked. The development of the situation is obviously contrary to their vision of pursuing peace. In the novel, McCain seems to be more sympathetic to Palestine and opposes Israel&#39;s bullying of Palestine. Naftali Moses, author of The Times of Israel, wrote that McCain ostensibly wrote about an Arab and an Israeli, but subtly expressed his dislike of Israel. The author labeled McCain an &quot;anti-Semite.&quot; He quickly attributed this anti-Semitic accusation to the &quot;Jewish original sin theory&quot;, that is, the Jews were the murderers of Jesus - this was Hitler&#39;s accusation against the Jews back then. But World War II has been over for many years. Except for the notorious Ku Klux Klan, few people dare to openly express their dissatisfaction with Israel and the United States’ Israeli policies. Otherwise, the anti-Semitic label will be firmly slapped on your head. This trend of public opinion is obviously very scary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Hamas launched brutal attacks and kidnappings, most of the world&#39;s public opinion condemned Hamas. However, gradually, when Israel shifted from &quot;legitimate defense&quot; to &quot;excessive defense&quot;, millions of Palestinians were When there was no way out, causing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster, public opinion quietly reversed. Protests broke out across the United States in response to Israel&#39;s counterattack against Palestine. Not to mention places like Northeastern Schools and California Berkeley where student activities are active, the atmosphere at the University of Texas, which has always been very hands-off and close to my home, is very tense: students sympathetic to Palestine are handing out leaflets to promote the &quot;genocide&quot; facing Gaza. &quot; and &quot;blockade&quot;, there was a fierce argument with other students, and later the situation became tense and the police were dispatched. Several student groups at Harvard University expressed dissatisfaction with Israel&#39;s actions and were doxxed by multiple employers with Jewish backgrounds, saying they were permanently banned from hiring. The &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; label is so scary, why does McCain still write about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Of course, writers have feelings. If you don’t have feelings, what kind of writer can you be? Naturally, they hope to turn swords into plowshares and solve problems with pen and ink instead of swords and guns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lami in the book once participated in the Middle East war, but later became a pacifist, especially after the death of his daughter. His wife was Netanyahu’s classmate. After his daughter died, Netanyahu wanted to visit, but she flatly refused. When reporters came for an interview, she said: &quot;The killings were not the bomb&#39;s fault. The bomb was also a victim. Israel is guilty. It has blood on its hands. She is not immune to this. Everyone is complicit. Oppression. Tyranny. . Arrogant.&quot; The Israeli Ministry of Defense sent a glass bowl to the couple, with the name of their dead daughter engraved on it. The couple did not give Netanyahu any face, and felt that this was not a &quot;sorrow&quot; but a &quot;honor&quot;. Hammered the bowl to pieces, &quot;wrote a note and sent it to Netanyahu: Dear Bibi (Editor&#39;s note: Netanyahu&#39;s nickname), something is broken.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And in Bassam, who was on the other side of the conversation, also got out of his past thinking. He tried his best to study in England and studied the history of the Jewish Holocaust. After that, he also became a pacifist. It is not easy to take this step. His daughter could have been saved after being hit in the head by a rubber bullet. Unfortunately, due to the queues and long wait at the sentry post on the way to the hospital, Abir missed the opportunity for rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/ZJxXmoLBeGvgQGleVy40XRCPVY1NvB4P4SuvZH5p.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;914&quot; height= &quot;514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/ZJxXmoLBeGvgQGleVy40XRCPVY1NvB4P4SuvZH5p.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256195&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the American TV series &quot;Billions&quot;, the actor and financial tycoon Bobby Axelrod is shown eating a banquet dinner. It is customary to cover your head with a towel. Some people say that this can ensure that the aroma does not escape. Others say that it is because the scene of spitting out bones is indecent, so it is necessary to cover up. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has accumulated thousands of years of retribution and is an endless cycle of oppression, resistance, and counterattack. . McCain cannot be said to be partial to Palestine. He was also wondering what was going on in this place. He has an overall reflection on human cruelty, which is not only cruel to each other, but also to the natural world. The book writes about the feast of buntings that Mitterrand ate before his death: &quot;The little birds will be fed for two weeks until they are about to burst. Then the chef picks up their feet and immerses them in a large vat of pure water. Boiled with Armagnac, soaked from scratch and left to drown. Next, the chef dehairs them, sprinkles them with salt and pepper and cooks them in their own fat for seven minutes before tossing them in just In the heated white stew pot.&quot; Finally, Mitterrand covered his head with a scarf and chewed the bird until the bones made a crisp sound. After reading this description, do you still have such high regard for &quot;French cuisine&quot;? Why write about Mitterrand eating birds? Later in the book, he writes: &quot;During François Mitterrand&#39;s tenure, France sold thousands of Milan missiles to Syria. They then entered the black market and were bought by Hezbollah guerrillas. .&quot; This kind of cruelty to birds is easily transferred to humans. After all, there is a terrible darkness in human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Birds are constantly written about in the book. &quot;Hoopoe, thrush, flycatcher, warbler, cuckoo, myna, warbler, shrike, sandpiper, boreal, plover, sunbird, swift, sparrow, nightjar, owl, gull, hawk, eagle , kite, crane, vulture, sandpiper, pelican, flamingo, stork, white-spotted blackbird, Eurasian vulture, blue-breasted Buddha, &lt;span>;Arabian thrush&lt;/span>;, bee-eater, turtle dove, white-throated, Yellow Wagtail, Black-capped Warbler, Red-throated Pipit, Lesser Reed Pipit.&quot; Why? Birds can migrate and are free.而以色列和巴勒斯坦，则相互交织，出入困难。 “A区由多个巴勒斯坦安全部队巡逻，但以色列军队任何时候都可长驱直入。B区属巴勒斯坦民事管辖，以色列在巴勒斯坦安全当局的警察配合下，控制其安全。巴勒斯坦安全部队只能在以色列的允许下行动。……此外，西岸希伯伦市的H1和H2区，80％由巴勒斯坦权力机构管理，20％由以色列控制，包括仅向以色列人和持有国际护照的区域开放的所谓无菌街道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从地图上看，这种片区错综复杂，看上去像是使用不当、过于碎片化的硬盘。大大小小的岗哨和高墙，使得加沙地带成了露天监狱。又像是常年被封控，路口总有荷枪实弹的士兵阻挡，难以出去寻找谋生的机会。这种你中有我，我中有你，就是平时婆媳兄弟在一起，都对付不了，何况双方新仇旧恨不断？以色列人还在铲平他们的住房，开枪打他们的水箱，打断扔石头的小孩的骨头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在的社会舆论是非黑即白的，很多亲朋好友因为挺以还是挺巴而发生冲突，其实有无考虑过其实这些分区，使得双方纠缠在一起了。分成那么多片区，设置岗哨，采取不同管理方式，看上去很智能，但是人类的大脑处理不了这样的复杂。过去印度，也是两个教派争得不可开交，印巴分治后反而好了一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我挺佩服麦凯恩的道德勇气，敢去写这么复杂的题材，敢去直面人类最棘手的冲突。仓颉造字，鬼神夜哭。文字闯祸的事可真不少：拉什迪被伊朗判死刑，最近被刺瞎了一只眼睛。写巴以冲突吧，又容易被扣上反犹的帽子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对巴以冲突这么复杂的问题，从政治、宗教、地缘等宏观角度的论述，现在多如牛毛。可是别忘了，作为当事人的以色列人和巴勒斯坦人，这都不只是国事，而是家事，是身边事。冲突是具体的而非抽象的，是一个人的孩子被炸死，一个人的孩子被卫兵打死。这种个体的事，家庭的事，纠缠在一起，又涉及历史、文化、战争的其他背景，用一条线两条线写很难。麦凯恩于是写出了1001个长短章，如同《一千零一夜》，又如同日记和拼图，使得不同主题和多头叙事相互呼应与衬托。看上去是炫技，实际上是对这种复杂局面进行文学处理的不得已而为之。这么写，也让我们读者从多个维度，去深刻了解巴以问题的复杂性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可是小说往往是描述问题，答案在哪里？麦凯恩屡次提起“极端同理心”这个说法，希望冲突双方去理解对方的想法和故事。他认为对话才能解决问题。在小说一开始，以色列人拉米骑的摩托车左前方有个贴纸，上书：“如果我们不开始对话，这一切不会结束。”所以这两个苦难的父亲携手去各地苦口婆心地宣讲和平。那么麦凯恩倡导的这种对话，能否真的解决问题，还是这只是文学家的痴心妄想，妇人之仁？我不知道答案在哪里。您说呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[随国，从编钟出发]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Big Tomb&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Soft light spreads over, falling in men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man&#39;s face was slightly raised, and under his thick black eyebrows, his small eyes were deep and lively. The bridge of the nose is straight, the lips are pressed tightly, with a faint smile. The man&#39;s expression was three parts confident, three parts complacent, and four parts complacent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man stands in a corner of the Suizhou Museum, a bronze statue. The text under the statue states that it was reconstructed based on the skull of the tomb owner by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Ancient Anthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In other words, it is highly similar to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The remains of the tomb owner have been sleeping on a small hill only a few hundred meters away from the Suizhou Museum since they were buried in the loess more than 2,000 years ago. I walked out of the museum and walked for 5 minutes along a quiet road behind the museum. I turned a corner in front of a unit called Ouyang Xiu Kindergarten, crossed a stone bridge, and entered the Leigudun Archaeological Site Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The green forest directly in front of the park is the lush city that men have dreamed of for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man’s name is Ji Yi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Ji Yi&#39;s name is not well known, then his other title is famous: Zeng Hou Yi. Zeng Hou is the king of Zeng State. Yi is his name. As for why it was asserted that his surname was Ji, there was a tortuous process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/Z6uN2lbCzmre7fP9VjTeOY6HJKemMDswziE55oxF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;619&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/Z6uN2lbCzmre7fP9VjTeOY6HJKemMDswziE55oxF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256120&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Statue of Zeng Houyi in Suizhou Museum&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, beating drums A huge park has been built at the Dun site. According to the scenic spot information, its &quot;protection scope and construction control zone reaches 12 square kilometers.&quot; Around the park and outside the Suizhou Museum, there are also some residential buildings scattered here and there. However, judging from old photos, more than 40 years ago in the 1970s, there were still lush rice fields here. In the middle of the crop fields, there stood two isolated houses, which belonged to a radar repair station of the Air Force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, archaeological discoveries are like a saying: When a mouse pulls a shovel, the big head is behind. For example, the Terracotta Warriors and Horses of Qin Shihuang and the Leigudun ruins were discovered due to the expansion of the radar repair shop&#39;s workshop. During the construction process, the workers discovered that there was some white plaster mud and a piece of artificially paved stone slab under the loess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said with certainty that although archaeologists have confirmed that there is a large ancient tomb under the wilderness, they were still deeply shocked when the details of the ancient tomb were revealed. I found an aerial panorama taken during the excavation. In the black and white photo, a large pit was dug out of the gray earth, showing that the tomb entrance was composed of three rectangles. Comparing the crowds around the pit as dense as ants, you can see how big and deep the entrance to the tomb is. Tan Weisi, the head of the archaeological team at that time, recalled, &quot;The entrance to the tomb is in the shape of an irregular polygon, with the widest point from east to west being 21 meters, and the widest point from north to south being 16.5 square meters, with a total area of ​​more than 200 square meters.&quot; As for the coffin that gradually revealed the true face of Lushan Mountain in the pit, It is 6 times larger than the Mawangdui Tomb and 8 times larger than the Wangshan No. 1 Chu Tomb where the sword of Yue King Goujian was unearthed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a conspicuous place in the exhibition hall of Hubei Provincial Museum, on the thick red carpet, two copper-wood structure brackets, one long and one short, are arranged in an L shape. One of them is more than 7 meters long, and the other is 3 meters long. Many, the height is more than 2.5 meters. On the top of the bracket, there are 64 chimes hanging in 8 groups on 3 levels. The total weight of the bronze chimes weighs 5,000 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This set of chimes, which can be called the treasure of the town hall, comes from Leigudun. Its owner is none other than Zeng Houyi. According to custom, it is named Zenghou Yi Chime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the shape, chime bells are divided into button bells, Yong bells and tungsten bells. The bell is the largest, placed on the lower floor, and its sound is rich and distant; the Yong bell is the second, placed on the middle floor, and its sound is mellow and beautiful; the button bell is the smallest, placed on the upper floor, and its sound is clear and melodious. What is amazing is that each bell can strike two different tones, which is called a double-tone bell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its reappearance in 1978, the bell of Zeng Houyi has rung three times in the past few decades. One time was when the bell was rang for the first time in the local garrison auditorium when it was unearthed. Contemporary ears were fortunate enough to listen to the pre-Qin music that traveled two thousand years. One time was the National Day in 1979, when the bells were transported to Beijing for performance. The first time was in 1997, when the bells rang in Hubei Province to welcome the return of Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/MND1ZV7ty87AJFnQDS3S5uumhlpMKKangDVsfoZQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/MND1ZV7ty87AJFnQDS3S5uumhlpMKKangDVsfoZQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256125&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The treasure of the Hubei Provincial Museum - Zenghou Yi Chime&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Compared with its own artistic value and cultural relic value, the inscriptions on the chimes may be more precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tombs in the pre-Qin period did not have tombstones and epitaphs like those in later generations. To determine who the owner of the tomb is, we can only rely on the inscriptions on the burial objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many cultural relics unearthed from the Leigudun site, including weapons such as Ge and Shu, as well as daily utensils such as bronze plates and beans, all have the word &quot;Zeng Hou Yi&quot; appearing. One of the bells has a 31-character inscription on it, which not only proves that the owner of the tomb is Zeng Hou Yi, but also provides coordinates for the general era of Zeng Hou Yi&#39;s life. These 31 characters are: The fifty and six sacrifices of the king of Kun returned from Xiyang. Xiong Zhang, the king of Chu, became the Yi Zonghou of Zenghou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general idea is that in the fifty-sixth year of King Xiong Zhang of Chu, when he learned that Zeng Houyi had passed away, he specially made this set of Zongyi and sent it to Xiyang to commemorate him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiong Zhang is King Hui of Chu. He is the only monarch of Chu who has reigned for more than 56 years. In the 56th year of King Hui of Chu, that is, 433 BC. According to the determination of the bones in the coffin, the tomb owner was approximately 42 to 45 years old when he died. Based on this, Zeng Hou Yi was born between 475 and 478 BC. If he was born in 475 BC, that year was the beginning of the Warring States Period. The life of Zeng Houyi roughly spans nearly half a century in the early Warring States period - at that time, although the wars among the princes continued, they were not as violent as the mergers and acquisitions in the middle and late Warring States periods, where they &quot;led the land and ate human flesh&quot;. As the king of a small country, he lived a stable and happy life on earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When archaeologists opened the heavy main coffin, they saw scattered skeletons and many exquisite burial objects. Yes, more than two thousand years later, Zeng Houyi&#39;s body had rotted away, and only the burial objects remained. Most of these funerary objects are jade. The ancients believed that if jade objects were inserted into the ears, nose, mouth and anus of the deceased, the deceased would become immortal. As the saying goes, &quot;If gold and jade are in the nine orifices, the deceased will be immortal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, all attempts and efforts for eternity are destined to be in vain. Not only will the corpses rot, but the names and deeds will also be forgotten. The traces of the vast majority of people’s existence on this blue planet will be wiped away by the waters of the River of Forgetfulness, as if they had never been there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/gNZDmcannHVo1VFFjEPalgPWQHvMAiBi5j4GuD7o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/gNZDmcannHVo1VFFjEPalgPWQHvMAiBi5j4GuD7o.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A corner of Leigudun ruins&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nie Zuoping/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Bronze&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The discovery of the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi has once again brought to the surface a long-standing question: According to the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi and previous archaeological discoveries, in today’s Suizhou area, there were once There once existed a country called Zeng. Strangely, there is not a single word about Zeng Guo in the historical documents. What is particularly strange is that historical data show that during the same time period, there was a country called &quot;Sui&quot; in the region, but cultural relics related to &quot;Sui&quot; have never been found before. So, what is the relationship between Zeng and Sui? Some people think that Zeng Tunsui; some people think that Zeng Sui was the successor; some people think that Chu destroyed Sui and established Zeng Sui anywhere; still others think that Zeng Sui was the same country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, 35 years after the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi was excavated, another tomb group from the Spring and Autumn Period was discovered in Wenfeng Pagoda, only four or five kilometers away from the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi. There are more than 50 tombs in the tomb group, and thousands of cultural relics were unearthed, more than half of which are bronzes, and most of them have inscriptions. The words Zeng, Zeng Zi, Zeng Gongzi, Zeng Sun, Zeng Da Sima, etc. in the inscription indicate that it is a cemetery for high-level nobles of Zeng State. In addition to a batch of bronzes with the inscription &quot;Zeng&quot; unearthed from the tomb numbered M21, what is even more eye-catching is a bronze dagger. The inscription on the bronze dagger is: Follow Da Sima Xianyou on his journey of fighting. This is the first Suiguo cultural relic unearthed in many years. Moreover, the cultural relics of Sui State appeared in the tombs of nobles of Zeng State, providing important evidence that Zeng Sui was one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most direct, or the most conclusive evidence comes from the tomb numbered M1 in the Wenfeng Pagoda Tomb Group. A chime was unearthed from the tomb. The inscription on the chime records the Battle of Wu and Chu in 506 BC. After the defeat of Chu State, he recovered the country with the help of Zeng State. The inscription names the three parties involved as Wu, Chu and Zeng. When &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; recorded this incident, the three parties involved were called Wu, Chu, and Sui. It can be seen that Zeng and Sui are different names for the same country. ——It was not uncommon in the pre-Qin period for a country to have two names. For example, Wei was also called Liang because its capital was in Daliang, Han was also called Zheng because its capital was in Xinzheng, and Zhou was also called Chunyu because its capital was Chunyu. To be specific, it may also be called Sui because it is all about Sui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the origin of Zeng State, or Sui State, the answer was also obtained in the Wenfeng Pagoda Tombs - two chimes unearthed in Cemetery No. It is said, &quot;After Yu Ji&quot;, Ji is Hou Ji, the ancestor of the Zhou people. This shows that the king of Zeng State was derived from the surname Ji and was a descendant of the Zhou royal family. Therefore, Zeng Hou Yi was named Ji Yi. Another record is more detailed, and an expert interprets it as: &quot;On the auspicious day of the first month of the first lunar month, Marquis Zeng said to him: Bo Shi was superior to Yong, and he assisted the civil and military forces. He fulfilled the orders of Yin and pacified the world. The king ordered Nan Gong. Camping in Ruitu, the king is better than Huaiyi, and Jiangxia is close to him.&quot; The general idea is that Bo Shi superiorly assisted King Wen and King Wu of Zhou to overthrow the Yin Shang Dynasty and pacify the world. Later, King Wu of Zhou sent him to the south to build a city and establish a country. He was responsible for monitoring Huaiyi and defending Jiangxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is Bo Shi Shangyong? Bo Shi, also known as Bo Kuo, is Nangong Kuo. Yongtongrong, Shangyong means Shangrong, is the name of Nangong, and Bo Shi is his character. Historical records record that after Nangong Shi followed King Wu to conquer Zhou, King Wu ordered him to demolish King Zhou&#39;s deer platform and open a warehouse to store grain to help the people. According to the inscription, during the Great Enfeoffment in the early Zhou Dynasty, as a meritorious official, Nangong Shi was transferred to the south, which is today&#39;s Suizao area, to establish the Zeng Kingdom. Zeng Guo&#39;s duty was to defend against Huaiyi in the southeast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called Huaiyi are originally a branch of Dongyi. During the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, they lived in the Jianghuai area and established a number of countries, such as Liao, Liu, Shu, Shuyong and Shujiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to their roots, Huaiyi and merchants have a close blood relationship, and the Zhou people were the end of the Shang Dynasty. Therefore, in order to guard against Huaiyi and manage the south, Emperor Zhou enfeoffed many princes in today&#39;s Henan, Hubei and Anhui areas. These princes were generally located north of the Han River and were called Hanyang Zhuji, including Tang, Ying, and Xi. , E, Deng, Chiang, Cai, Shen, Sui and other countries. In the middle, there is the leading big country. It is said that &quot;the princes from the east of Han Dynasty are all big.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/SlSta4V8DgSE6wHmaQ4pe6eNraYMf1lg34RJxea5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/SlSta4V8DgSE6wHmaQ4pe6eNraYMf1lg34RJxea5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256123&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hubei Provincial Museum Zeng Hou Yi Bronze Drum Base&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;After the Huaiyi rebellion was gradually eliminated, the tasks of the concubines of Hanyang turned to guarding against the rising Chu State while maintaining the smooth flow of an important transportation line. This transportation line is the copper-tin road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Pre-Qin Dynasty was the Bronze Age. Bronze was not only the raw material for casting weapons, but also the raw material for casting ritual vessels. In the context of &quot;the major affairs of the country lie in sacrifice and military service&quot;, bronze can be said to be the foundation of a country. However, the area directly under the jurisdiction of Emperor Zhou of Guanzhong, the capital of Guanzhong, does not produce copper. The large amount of copper required can only be transported thousands of miles from the south - Daye, Hubei, and Ruichang, Jiangxi, which is only more than 100 kilometers away. A huge copper mine with extremely rich reserves. Their mining began more than 2,000 years ago and continues to the present day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copper from the south has to be transported to Guanzhong, a distance of more than 1,000 kilometers. Long transportation lines mean more risks and more uncertainties. The concubines of Hanyang, headed by Sui Guo, have the important task of ensuring the smooth flow of the copper and tin roads and ensuring that the metals mined from the south reach Haojing smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the National Museum of China, there is a bronze vessel named Zeng Boyun. The 簠 is a utensil used to serve rice during sacrifices or banquets. It is also called the 簋, the square one is called 簠 and the round one is called 簋. Zeng Boyun was used by the king of Zeng State. The inscription on it has the following sentences: &quot;... Ke Di Huai Yi, suppress Xie Fan Tang, gold road and tin travel, tools are ready for use.&quot; It means: &lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Uncle Zeng)&lt;/span>; Punished Huaiyi, stabilized the transportation hub Fantang, and restored the copper and tin channels to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first to come to the moon near the water tower is not only the boss of the Hanyang concubines, but also controls the most important Suizao Corridor on the road of copper and tin. It is easier for Sui to obtain a large amount of copper than other princes. In a sense, this small country - although it is the largest among the concubines of Hanyang, it is still a small country compared with the real big country - is the real Bronze Kingdom. A total of 6,239 pieces of various bronze vessels were unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Houyi, and together they weighed a total of 10,498.6 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/LNiEDBxEMDwAkGBduZHlMHEcVKecAt4EeE4WezfR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/LNiEDBxEMDwAkGBduZHlMHEcVKecAt4EeE4WezfR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the bronze plate of Marquis Zeng Yi of Hubei Provincial Museum&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In the Zhou Dynasty, under the background of Zhou Gong making rituals and music, bronzes not only had practical functions, but also had spiritual value, and were integrated with the rituals and music system. It is a musical instrument for formal music, a ritual vessel for hiding rituals, and a magical instrument for communication between humans and gods. Duke Zhou&#39;s thoughts of respecting virtue and protecting the people were passed down from generation to generation through materialized bronze vessels. The developed bronze culture should have had a profound impact on Sui State - unfortunately, due to the lack of historical data, we cannot learn more details. Judging from the few records about Sui Guo, a clan named Ji Liang is a representative example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 706 BC, King Wu of Chu attacked Sui and deliberately showed weakness. Sui&#39;s young division fell into the trap and asked Sui to fight with all his strength. Ji Liang reminded Sui Hou that the powerful Chu State suddenly became weak. This was &quot;tempting me, why are you so anxious?&quot; He further gave advice to Sui Hou, and the content of the advice fully reflected Ji Liang&#39;s people-oriented thinking. He said that if a small country wants to confront a big country, it depends on having the Tao; &quot;The so-called Tao means being loyal to the people and trusting in God. Loyalty means to think above the people and benefit the people; trust can also be used to wish the history a correct speech.&quot; - To have the Tao means that those in power must Be loyal to the people and gain trust from the gods. The monarch always thinks about how to benefit the people, which is loyalty; the historian who represents the monarch in sacrifice is truthful, which is faith. Sui Hou was dissatisfied. He said that when he offered sacrifices to the gods, he always chose fat and unvaried sacrifices. The millet and millet used as sacrifices were also abundant and complete, so he had enough faith in the gods. Ji Liang told him, &quot;The people are the masters of the gods. Therefore, the sage kings first became the people and then devoted themselves to the gods.&quot; The people are the foundation of the gods. Therefore, the sage kings of all ages first united the people and then devoted themselves to worshiping the gods. . Ji Liang asserted that Sui Hou thought that the sacrifices he offered to the gods were fat and unmotivated, and the millet and millet were abundant and complete. In fact, they were useless and would not receive the blessings of the gods. Only &quot;serve the three seasons, cultivate the five religions, and be close to the nine tribes&quot; - serve the three seasons, which means to let the people concentrate on farming in spring, summer, and autumn; cultivate the five religions, which means advocating father&#39;s righteousness, mother&#39;s kindness, brotherhood, and brotherhood. The social customs of friends, brothers being respectful, and sons being filial; kissing one&#39;s nine clans refers to harmonizing the relationship between relatives and making them harmonious - using these behaviors to sacrifice to the gods, the gods will bless you, the society will be harmonious, and the country will be strong. Therefore, Ji Liang unceremoniously asked his followers: &quot;If you cultivate political affairs and are close to the country of brothers, you may be able to survive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ji Liang&#39;s words made Suihou frightened and he had to accept the suggestion. After the Chu State heard about it, they had to temporarily give up the invasion plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Suihou followed Ji Liang&#39;s advice, his most favored one was actually the unnamed young master. When Ji Liang gradually fell out of favor with Sui Hou, Chu State saw hope again. King Wu of Chu personally led an army to the Chu Sui border for the second time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chu was strong and weak, so Ji Liang suggested negotiating peace with Chu. He said that if Chu is unwilling to negotiate peace, it will anger our soldiers and make the enemy&#39;s army slack. The young master was unwilling to negotiate peace. He believed that a quick attack was necessary to demonstrate Sui Guo&#39;s strength. Before the war, Ji Liang reminded the princes that the Chu people&#39;s custom is to respect the left, and the left army must be the elite of the King of Chu. When fighting, we attack the weak right army of Chu first. Once the right army is defeated, the Chu army will collapse. The young master objected that not fighting the King of Chu head-on would mean that we dare not confront him head-on, which would damage the dignity of the country. So, Sui Hou ordered to attack the Chu army&#39;s left army. As a result, Sui&#39;s army was defeated, Suihou fled, and Suihou&#39;s chariot was also captured by the Chu army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/ZPHmYjSkKJEzurgoS5Z1pmscMF07q5xTap5K3uEg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/ZPHmYjSkKJEzurgoS5Z1pmscMF07q5xTap5K3uEg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256121&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Statue of Ji Liang in Suizhou Cultural Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; Attached&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A batch of 240 bamboo slips were unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi, with nearly 7,000 characters on them. According to expert interpretation, the bamboo slips are a list of the chariots, horses, and armor that were buried with Zeng Hou Yi. The list shows that after Zeng Houyi&#39;s death, the king of Chu, the prince of Chu, Ling Yin of Chu, and several princes of Chu, such as Duke Yang of Lu, Duke Yangcheng, and Lord Pingye, presented chariots and horses to him. In short, almost all the important figures in the Chu State expressed condolences for the death of Zeng Hou Yi and presented him with carriages, horses or other gifts. The names given to the King of Chu by the people of Sui in this list confirm that Sui at this time had become a vassal of Chu - only because of this, the kings and ministers of Chu were so close to Zeng Houyi and treated him with courtesy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the rise of Chu State, it has been trying to develop eastward. There are three goals in developing eastward. The first goal is to occupy the Jianghan Plain, which is suitable for farming; the second goal is to capture the copper mines in Daye; the third goal is to control the Suizao Corridor and the Nanxiang Pass, and then go north to compete for hegemony. . Of course, the three goals are step-by-step. Only by achieving the first goal can the second and third goals be achieved. No matter which goal it wants to achieve, what Chu must do is defeat its eastern neighbor Sui. Sui Guo was not only tasked by Emperor Zhou to monitor and defend Chu State, but also had a very important geographical location. &quot;It is bordered by Lian&#39;e to the north, Hanmiang to the east, and between Xiang, Ying, Shen, and An. It is actually an important place. The keys to Yiyang and Nanyang are actually used.&quot; It can be said that from the day the Chu State rose, the life-and-death war between Chu State and Sui State was destined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 800-year history of Chu State, King Xiong Tong of Chu Wu was a strong-armed figure. He stepped on the corpse of his nephew in a pool of blood and ascended to the throne by regicide. For more than half a century, King Wu of Chu focused on developing eastward and northward. Sui Guo, the eldest among the concubines in Hanyang, was the number one enemy that King Wu of Chu wanted to destroy quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In more than ten years, King Wu of Chu attacked his followers three times. In 706 BC, the Suihou listened to Ji Liang&#39;s advice, and the Chu army returned without success; in 704 BC, the Suihou listened to the advice of the young master, and the Sui army was defeated; in 690 BC, King Wu of Chu, who was over seventy years old, died of illness while attacking the Sui. journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although King Wu of Chu failed to annex Sui State as he wished, he greatly weakened Sui State&#39;s power and successively destroyed Quan State, Zhou State, Liao State, Lu State and Yan State, almost all of which occupied the fertile land. Jianghan Plain, and control the Tonglushan Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50 years later, King Chu Cheng, the grandson of King Wu of Chu, successively annexed more than a dozen small countries such as Er, Gu, Huang, Ying, Jiang, and Fang, thus realizing his grandfather&#39;s dream for many years - to control Sui. The country became a vassal of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 640 BC, Sui Guo united with a group of small countries east of the Han River to raise troops to fight against Chu. The Chu State&#39;s order Yin Dougu Yu Tu led his army to attack, and his country and allied forces were severely defeated. He was forced to enter into a city-wide alliance with the Chu State and became a vassal of the Chu State. At this time, it was already the twenty-fifth year of King Hui of Zhou Dynasty. The originally powerful Western Zhou Dynasty had to move its capital to Luoyang more than 100 years ago. The strength of Emperor Zhou was greatly reduced, and he was at most equal to a medium-sized prince. Ji, Emperor Zhou already has too much time to take care of himself. From then on, Sui Guo &quot;subjected himself to Chu and had no access to China.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After vassaling the Chu State, Sui State, although its territory was reduced, the wars with Chu State were almost extinct. Sui State survived the wave of annexation that caused a large number of princes to perish and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/uFxHxiBjqtNLcxgtCb5LCVA9YjrAYrvYBz4iwOQ3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;615&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/uFxHxiBjqtNLcxgtCb5LCVA9YjrAYrvYBz4iwOQ3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256126&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Suizhou is located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The drama of history lies in the fact that, both for Chu and Sui, the monarchs and subjects of the two countries What no one expected was that one day, Sui Guo, as a vassal, would be the final savior of the suzerain state Chu. Without Sui Guo, Chu State would probably have perished in the late Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 506 BC, the Great War between Wu and Chu broke out. King Helu of Wu personally led an army up the Huaihe River, and landed in the Huangchuan area of ​​present-day Henan Province. After being led by the troops of Cai and Tang, the Wu army moved south from the north of Chu to the Han River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu State was originally located in the eastern part of Chu State, and Chu State’s defensive focus has been in Yuzhang, which is now the Nanchang area of ​​Jiangxi Province. Unexpectedly, the Wu army avoided its main force and attacked its weak points, catching the Chu army by surprise. The two armies of Wu and Chu fought at Baiju &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Macheng, Hubei, also known as Hanchuan, Hubei)&lt;/span>;. The Wu army won five battles and five victories, and the Chu army was defeated. Ten days later, the Wu army captured Ying, the capital of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the entire Spring and Autumn Period, Wu Jun&#39;s victory over Ying was the first and only battle to capture the capital of a major country. When the news came out, the princes were shocked and couldn&#39;t help but look at Wu State, which was originally regarded as a barbarian, with admiration. The main credit for the Wu State&#39;s creation of such a miracle should be attributed to Wu Zixu and Sun Wu. Just as the &quot;Book of Han&quot; said: Helu appointed Wu Zixu and Sun Wu as generals, defeated and captured them, and became famous among the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the capital of Chu was captured by the Wu army, King Zhao of Chu fled to Sui. At this time, this small country, which was almost the only remaining one among the concubines of Hanyang, became the last hope for the survival of Chu State. Wu State sent envoys to Sui State, hoping that Suihou would hand over King Zhao of Chu, and reminded Suihou, &quot;If the descendants of Zhou are in Hanchuan, Chu will be completely destroyed.&quot; - You Hanyang concubines are all about to be annexed by Chu State. . Now, God wants to punish Chu State, why did you hide the King of Chu? If he is handed over, the land of Hanyang will belong to Sui Guo. Suihou refused. He said that Sui Guo and Chu State had an alliance for generations, and he could not hand over the King of Chu. The army of Wu State penetrated deeply and its rear was unstable. It did not want to fight with Sui State anymore, so it had to retreat. Later, there was a story about Shen Baoxu crying to the Qin court and begging for the master of Qin, so that King Zhao of Chu could be revived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of Sui&#39;s protection of King Chu Zhao, after King Chu Zhao returned to the country, the relationship between Chu and Sui began an unprecedented honeymoon period. Originally, after becoming a vassal of the Chu State, even though the Sui State was a prince originally enfeoffed by the Emperor of Zhou, it was already &quot;a private vassal of Chu, not connected with the princes, and conquered the alliance, and was disdained by others.&quot; Out of gratitude to the vassals, &quot;the people of Chu felt his virtue and made the vassals follow him.&quot; In other words, although Sui Guo was still a vassal of Chu State, Chu State allowed it to participate in international activities like a prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two pieces of sacrificial vessels from the Spring and Autumn Period collected in the Xiangyang Museum are witnesses of the friendship between Chu and Sui. In the pre-Qin period, when princes and nobles married their daughters, they usually made bronze vessels as dowries, which were called nunnery vessels. The two pieces of nurturing vessels in the Xiangyang Museum are called Zeng Hou Zuo Ji Tang Mi Ding, and the other is called Zeng Meng Mi Jian copper basin. The inscriptions on the two nunnery vessels indicate that a woman named Mi Tang and a woman named Mi Jian from Chu State were married to Sui State one after another. The surname Mi is the surname of the king of Chu State, and is the ancestor of the eighteen surnames of Jingchu. It was once widely known through the TV series &quot;Mi Yue Biography&quot;. Therefore, in the history of the relationship between Chu and Sui, there was a period of mutual intermarriage between Qin and Jin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;63 years after King Zhao of Chu came to Sui, the king of Sui, Zeng Houyi, passed away. At this time, the king of Chu was King Chu Hui, the son of King Zhao of Chu. Also out of gratitude for Sui Guo&#39;s righteous deeds, King Hui of Chu specially made ritual vessels to commemorate. In addition to King Hui of Chu, there were also a large group of Chu kings, princes, and ministers who commemorated Zeng Hou Yi. The originally unknown king of a small country unexpectedly gained honor because of his ancestor&#39;s political stance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/D58Kf2X0gt938eSSt2wEeryVCtZ4tdS5SO6aAcuY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/D58Kf2X0gt938eSSt2wEeryVCtZ4tdS5SO6aAcuY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256127&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The chimes under the night sky, the eternity left by the king of a small country unintentionally by chance. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time is the enemy of emotion. If feelings are like wine, then time is the water that keeps seeping into the wine. The longer the time goes by, the more water penetrates into the wine, and the taste of the wine becomes lighter, so that in the end it is only the taste of water without the sweetness of wine. The feelings between people are like this, and the feelings between countries are like this. Especially in the face of interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Zeng Houyi and King Hui of Chu Jiuquan knew better, they would definitely regret the choice of their descendants: Sui Guo, who was kind to the Chu State, was eventually annexed by the Chu State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no historical record of when the Chu State was destroyed and it can only be inferred indirectly through unearthed cultural relics. Several hundred meters south of the tomb of Zeng Houyi, archaeologists excavated more than 30 tombs in 1983. These tombs were named Suizhou Leigudun Tomb No. 2. Archaeologists concluded that the artifacts unearthed from the tomb &quot;not only have strong Zeng cultural characteristics, but also have typical Chu cultural elements.&quot; Therefore, it is inferred that &quot;the tombs of Zeng people after the Zeng State was about to perish or was destroyed by the Chu State.&quot; The age of these tombs is roughly late in the early Warring States Period to early in the middle Warring States Period. Therefore, the demise of Sui State should be in The middle period of the Warring States Period. Support for this can also be found in the literature. For example, when Chun Shenjun advised Qin not to attack Chu in 272 BC, he mentioned that &quot;the soil on the right side of the river&quot; was the territory of Chu. Suishui is Guangshui, and the soil on the right side of Suishui is to the west of Guangshui, which is the area under the jurisdiction of Sui State at that time. That is to say, by 272 BC at the latest, Sui State had been merged into Chu State. At this time, a century and a half had passed since the honeymoon period between Zeng Hou Yi and King Hui of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/TIe7DGLaYio4GfVpDTfq4zKoVn9Jexr648fKGk1g.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/TIe7DGLaYio4GfVpDTfq4zKoVn9Jexr648fKGk1g.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Suizhou Guangshui hilly landform&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The long history of Suizhou In history, except for a few people such as Ji Liang, most princes, nobles and even monarchs have vague faces. Even Zeng Hou Yi, who is famous for his chimes, is unknown to future generations about his life. When I inspected the tomb of Marquis Zeng Yi in Leigudun, what moved me the most was neither the chimes nor the jades, but the 21 young women whose names I will never know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides the main coffin where Zeng Houyi rests, there are 8 auxiliary coffins. Inside the coffins, there is a human skeleton, each of which is a woman between 19 and 26 years old. They may be concubines or attendants of Zeng Houyi. In the west room near the main room, there are another 13 slave coffins. Inside the coffins, there is also a human skeleton, which is a woman between 13 and 24 years old. They are both burial objects, but have different identities and titles. The former is called human sacrifice. Most of the human sacrifices are the wives, concubines and attendants of the deceased, who have a higher status, while the human sacrifices are prisoners of war or slaves. People are buried in the tomb of the deceased, with their bodies intact and with fine burial tools, so that they can continue to serve the deceased in the other world. Human sacrifices were buried in special sacrificial pits, with mostly incomplete bodies and rough burial tools, in order to sacrifice them to the gods of heaven and earth and ancestors. Of course, some people were forced to die, but there were also those who volunteered to be buried with them. As for human sacrifices, it can almost be concluded that none of them were voluntary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A king of a small country who has become a vassal still has to be buried with 21 young and fresh lives after his death. Apart from the splendid splendor of chimes and jades, I vaguely saw that long-gone era. Bloody, ignorant and barbaric. In this context, Ji Liang&#39;s statement that &quot;the husband and the people are the lords of the gods&quot;, although it is difficult for the monarchs to truly put it into practice, is still like a firefly flickering in the distance in the dark night, weak but precious. Because of this firefly, the cold history has a little bit of human warmth. &lt;p>; &quot;Yi Tomb&quot; &quot;Exploring the Origin of Suizhou Culture&quot; &quot;Research on the History of Zeng Guo and Sui Guo&quot; &quot;An Examination of the Destruction of the Chu State&quot;]&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[微信抖音等多家平台将引导“自媒体”账号对外实名丨滚动]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259677]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 18:39:31&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;October 2023 18:00 on the 31st&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;WeChat’s announcement on the display of real-name information by “self-media” accounts in the header&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to maintain good network communication order, promote the construction of a healthy and orderly cyberspace, enhance the credibility of top &quot;self-media&quot; accounts, and facilitate public supervision for the public interest.

&lt;p>;据华商报报道，实名认证为河南方城县文联的微信公众号“裕州心声”（裕州是方城县旧称）10月26日发布一篇题为《“清风方城”文学艺术作品有奖征文获奖名单揭晓》的文章，称由方城县纪监委、方城县文联联合主办的“清风方城”有奖征文活动圆满成功，25篇作品分获一二三等奖及鼓励奖（原文如此，但公布的获奖作品名单实际只有23篇）。令人大跌眼镜的是，在名单所示的23篇获奖作品中，有12篇的作者是同一个人“乔君笠”，其中一等奖1篇、二等奖1篇、三等奖4篇、鼓励奖6篇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一人独揽几乎近半奖项，如此实力，如此天纵英才，乔君笠何许人也？文章最后所附的《裕州心声》编委会名单显示，乔君笠正是这一刊物的主编。而方城县检察院官方社媒账号此前发布的文章显示，乔君笠还是方城县文联副主席。而方城县文联正是这次征文活动的主办方之一，《裕州心声》则是活动的承办方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再细看获奖名单，23篇获奖作品中，至少有18篇的作者是《裕州心声》编辑部成员，除了乔君笠的12篇之外，还有总编郭某栓（方城县文联主席）1篇作品获二等奖；副总编熊某祥2篇作品分别获二等奖、三等奖；副主编李某雁、编委会成员梁某锋、策划武某华也各有1篇文章获奖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自己主办有奖征文活动，自己人获奖，还不止一人，还有人十多篇文章同时获奖，实在令人叹为观止。 “清风方城”，清风何在？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;众所周知，各种正规的公开比赛、评选等活动，为了保障公平公正，评委必须保持中立，不应与任何参赛者有利益关联，而且通常会规定一人只能获得一个奖项。就连不少商业企业主办的抽奖促销活动也规定，员工和家属不能参与，否则即使中奖了也要作废。更不用说文联作为一个社会团体，在中国是受公共财政支持的，属于公共机构。作为活动主办和承办方，方城县文联和下属刊物理应保持客观中立的立场，以保证奖项评选的公正性。结果，文联的领导和刊物编辑部成员亲自下场比赛，还获得了大多数奖项。既做裁判员，又做运动员，谈何比赛的公平公正？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2000年《读书》举办的首届长江读书奖，《读书》主编汪晖和作为评委的钱理群均有作品获奖，就曾经引起巨大争议。自评自奖当然是不符合公平原则的，不客气地说，某种意义上就是“分赃”。如果作者认为自己的作品足够优秀，有资格获奖，那也应该避嫌，不仅不应作为评委，甚至有必要辞去主办方的相关职务，否则就不应该参与评奖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而方城县的这个征文比赛，还可能涉及私分公共资金的问题。单从奖金金额上看，这似乎不是一件大事。比赛一等奖奖金每篇也不过500元，二等奖每篇400元，三等奖每篇300元，鼓励奖每篇200元。乔主编12篇作品获奖，总奖金也不过才3300元。但是，方城县曾经是贫困县，2019年才摘帽。根据方城县2022年政府工作报告，2021年全县GDP293亿元，以该县2020年第七次人口普查时的87万余人计算，人均GDP3.3万元左右，城镇居民人均可支配收入33574元，农村居民人均可支配收入16315元。也就是说，乔主编在这次有奖活动中所得的奖金，相当于该县城镇年人均可支配收入的1/10，农民年人均可支配收入的1/5。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纪检委和文联联合主办的这一有奖征文比赛，奖金来源恐怕很大可能是财政资金。这样一场征文比赛，获奖者几乎都是自己人，而且一人独得近半奖项，让人不得不怀疑，这是巧立名目用公款为自己发钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，也有一种可能是征文比赛无人问津，文联的领导们才不得不亲自出马。根据上文所说，这一征文比赛自2022年11月20日开始，6月30日截稿。尽管“社会各界文学爱好者积极响应，广泛发动，潜心创作”，但半年多的时间里，也只征集到49部作品。可见，方城县的“文学爱好者”并不是很多，或者大家对这样的比赛不感兴趣，所以没什么人投稿，而且投稿的质量也欠佳。为了避免出现无人得奖的尴尬局面，乔主编才不得不把自己的作品拿来充数。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，如果是这种情况，文联的责任也不容推卸。作为当地的文学艺术工作者的组织，文联难道不应该了解自己县里有多少文学工作者、爱好者吗？征文能有多少响应，也是应该可以估计到的。对于明知可能无人问津的比赛，还要去策划去组织，最后自己人出面撑门面拿奖，那更坐实了“巧立名目为自己发钱”的嫌疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，类似的现象不仅仅存在于方城县这一件事上，其他更严重的也很多。比如云南某国企的一把手，就曾经以各种名目为自己发放了几千万元的“奖励”，终以贪污等罪名被处罚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一征文活动的主办方之一是县纪监委，却出现这样的丑闻，实在是讽刺。舆论关注之下，方城县文联已经删掉了获奖名单，并声称之前是“初评结果”，未经主办方同意就发布了，下一步将组织市里的专家重新评审。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方城县也为此成立了专门的调查组，在10月31日凌晨发布情况说明，初步调查认定评选环节存在问题，评选结果无效，至于后续调查处理情况，将“适时”发布。公众期待调查组的最终处理结果。或许，最合适的处理方案是取消这一征文活动，追回资金。 &lt;/p>;
