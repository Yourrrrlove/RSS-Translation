Recently, some new energy vehicle owners have reported that charging fees at public charging piles have increased since the second half of the year. Does this situation exist? With this question in mind, reporters conducted investigations in many places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Drivers of operating vehicles are more sensitive to changes in charging fees for new energy vehicles. Master Wei is an online ride-hailing driver in Zhengzhou, Henan, because he goes to public charging stations to charge once or twice a day. His mobile phone clearly records the cost of each charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259659&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Zhengzhou Net Ride-hailing driver Wei Zhenhua: My charging fee has obviously increased. It used to be 1,200 yuan a month, but now it is as high as 1,500 yuan. It has indeed increased a lot. Especially after August, it rose by about 20 to 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charging fee at public charging piles consists of two parts: electricity price and service fee. Electricity prices have been mainly formed by the market, with &quot;level in and level out&quot; and charging pile operators are not allowed to increase prices. Prices vary in different seasons and during peak, wave, and flat periods every day. The service fee is determined by each charging pile operating company based on market conditions. During the interview, the reporter found that charging fees at public piles have increased not only in Zhengzhou but also in many cities in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new energy Co., Ltd. Henan regional director Yu Haitao: We charging companies have raised the service fee for primary charging. It has been raised by about 1 jiao to 1 jiao and 2 cents compared to the beginning of the year. So overall, everyone feels the increase in charging prices. The amplitude is relatively large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surveys show that the service fees of some charging companies have even increased by about 50%. So, why do they want to adjust the price? Some charging pile operating companies told reporters that the high cost of early investment in charging pile construction and the long-term strategy of &quot;grabbing the market&quot; for low-price operations have put them under greater operating pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An electronics company in Henan Wei Hongyu, Operations Director of Technology Co., Ltd.: The main reason for this increase is that as our operations deepen, we find that there is even a risk of inversion in the service fee income of charging stations compared to our station construction costs and our operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial reports of some charging operation companies show that although the company&#39;s operating income is rising every year, it is negative profits every year. At the same time, in order to attract more users, operators tend to build high-power charging piles. However, the basic cost of high-power charging piles is relatively high. Some also need to build additional corresponding distribution boxes, and maintenance costs will naturally increase. . Therefore, raising service fees has become the current solution to recover costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The cost of using new energy vehicles still has a greater advantage than that of gasoline vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Through interviews and surveys, the reporter found that in some cities, the cost of charging electric vehicles has indeed increased. So this situation Does it happen in all cities across the country? Are the cost advantages of buying an electric car still there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During interviews and surveys in many places, reporters found that the rise in charging costs for new energy vehicles only occurred in some cities, and charging costs in most cities across the country fell into a stable range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing New Energy Car owner: There is not much increase.

The overall cost is not particularly high and it is quite affordable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance show that from January to October this year, the number of public charging piles in my country was 728,000, and the number in October was 63,000, a year-on-year increase of 50.3%. The increase in the number of charging piles not only meets the rapid development of new energy vehicles, but also makes competition among charging pile operating companies more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A smart phone in Beijing Chen Dong, the person in charge of Technology Co., Ltd.: The overall charging price is still relatively low now, because the competition in the industry is fierce. We have more than 40 charging stations in Beijing. Winter is the peak charging season, and the overall cost has not been adjusted upwards. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that fluctuations in charging fees in most cities are the result of market supply and demand adjustments, and the quality of increases or decreases cannot be judged absolutely. Most cities have now abolished the maximum price limit on service fees, and each operator can determine the level of charging service fees based on market competition. At the same time, in the face of the issue raised by some netizens that the cost of using new energy vehicles is almost equal to that of gasoline vehicles, experts also gave reporters a calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the federation: For example, for every 100 kilometers of our oil truck, the industry requires about 10 liters of oil. We estimate that it will be calculated at about 8 yuan, which is 80 yuan. Let&#39;s look at the tram again. On average, it requires about 15 kilowatt hours of electricity per 100 kilometers. The overall consumption of each kilowatt hour of electricity plus service fees is about 1.5 yuan. So the entire 15 kilowatt hours of electricity is about 22.5 yuan. Even if it is 25 yuan, we Comparing 25 yuan with 80 yuan, it should be said that there is still a huge gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Various regions have launched new measures to shape the healthy development of new energy vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In order to ensure a good charging experience for new energy vehicle owners, various regions have successively introduced new policies such as time-of-use electricity prices for charging facilities. The implementation of relevant measures will not only guide car owners to use electricity rationally, but will also be more conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September this year, Shandong began to implement a new time-of-use electricity price policy for residents&#39; charging, which subdivided the peak and valley periods and added deep valley and peak periods. During the deep valley period, the electricity price was 0.222 yuan per kilowatt hour, which is the same as The price difference during peak hours is 0.666 yuan per kilowatt hour. By widening the price difference, users are guided to avoid charging during peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259663&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jimo District, Qingdao New energy vehicle owners: Now the electricity price in Shengu for charging at noon is only more than 2 cents per degree. If you go home and have a meal, the electricity will be fully charged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Shandong, but also Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi and other places have successively introduced time-of-use electricity price policies for residents’ electric vehicle charging facilities. During peak and peak hours, charging car owners need to bear more costs, and During off-peak periods, car owners can enjoy lower prices than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen New Energy Car owner: It is the peak period for charging now. The current price is 1.49 degrees. We usually choose to charge at noon or at night, and the price will be more favorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the continued efforts of government policies, some charging operating companies are also actively exploring new trends in future development. On the one hand, it is necessary to add new momentum to corporate operations, and on the other hand, the charging experience of car owners must also be considered. In order to &quot;stand out&quot; in the market competition, they choose to provide more comprehensive services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new person in Shenzhen Chen Huanyu, operations director of the energy company: Our service fee is only about a little more than a triangle, which is 5% higher than the service fee of surrounding operators. Our advantage is that the supporting facilities are relatively complete, which solves the driver&#39;s dining problem. To solve the problem of rest, we also have a comprehensive service area with quick car repairs, quick washes, and a comprehensive online car-hailing service platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, charging operation companies have also strengthened the level of interconnection and interoperability. In Hainan, the reporter saw that the supervision and operation service platform linked different operators together. There are 165 charging and swapping operators, 63 public battery swapping stations, and 3,358 charging stations connected here. The access rate of the province&#39;s public charging pile platform reaches 100%. The construction of the platform not only unifies the payment methods, making it more convenient for car owners to &quot;find charging stations&quot;, but also facilitates the monitoring of charging fee fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/d3189767590c844c999708027249926b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/d3189767590c844c999708027249926b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259664&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hainan Province Charge Wang Jin, Operations Director of Battery Exchange Network Service Co., Ltd.: Realize the interconnection of pile networks and power grids, promptly report charging stations with irregular charging pricing to pile companies for rectification, and report to the local government management department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that both the time-of-use electricity price policy and the active attempts and interconnection measures of charging companies are releasing positive signals and exploring new opportunities for the development of the entire new energy vehicle charging industry. path of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/be2c6bc8f9950f6ebf24436e7242ca9d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/be2c6bc8f9950f6ebf24436e7242ca9d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the Federation: Our country is unswervingly committed to developing new energy vehicles.

Waking up early and staying late has become the norm. Getting up at 4 a.m. to go to the airport and returning home at 1:30 a.m. after finishing the day&#39;s activities is not an exception. Not staying out overnight is partly to take care of my young daughter’s emotions, but also to satisfy her pursuit of efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She rarely used it to catch up on sleep when flying, but still raced against time to read and think. Since 2013, she has continued to travel to campuses of all ages, TV studios, events, lectures, forums, and dining tables used for live broadcasts and writing, sharing her deep dives in the Western Pacific with the &quot;Jiaolong&quot; Scientific expedition and the experience of participating in the 34th Antarctic Scientific Expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, she only gave lectures as a scientist as a researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Over the past ten years, she has gradually been dubbed a science popularization expert because of her tireless science popularization and vivid and humorous narration. title. In the past two years, she has won important honors such as Top Ten Science Communication Figures in China, Chief Science Communication Expert, and Female Science Popularization Expert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, she spared a few hours, ate a sandwich at noon, and rushed home to prepare for the live broadcast at 4 p.m. Not long ago, she went to attend classes at universities and party schools. The topic she taught was the core of leadership from the perspective of biological evolution, from natural science to humanities and then to philosophy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;This is her usual style&lt;/span>;), recalling her hearty smile and said, &quot;There was no urine in the whole process&quot;; then she was also invited to participate in a TED speech, the theme was &quot;If your major is a transfer, you What will happen next in life?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experienced the transition from engineering to science (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Undergraduate survey technology and engineering, postgraduate geological engineering, doctoral geology&lt;/p>; span>;), Tang Limei decided to switch his research field to marine geology after listening to a lecture by chance while studying for his PhD. He realized early on that life has no limits and is full of unexpected and unplanned nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With ten years of accumulation in science popularization, she will bring a new book &quot;Exploring the Deep Sea with the &quot;Dragon&quot;&quot; at the end of 2023 to show people a new face of a science popularization writer. The book will introduce the basic knowledge of the ocean (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what is the sea, what is the ocean, how to form&lt;/span>;), the five major oceans of the world (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Newly included in the Southern Ocean in 2021&lt;/span>;)&#39;s cutting-edge knowledge, personal experience in deep-sea exploration, and the development history of the country&#39;s manned deep submersibles, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took less than half a year to write the book. She was busier than before. She didn&#39;t even have time to wash her face after getting up every morning. She said that her days now consist of only three things: work, exercise, and reading and thinking. She has been able to maintain her body shape for nearly 20 years after getting up early for a run. During the interview, she was wearing the team uniform she wore during the Antarctic scientific expedition in 2017, and it still fit her perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, there are very few pastimes, and I hardly watch movies. Everything I do must &quot;generate value and meaning.&quot; She would refuse without hesitation if asked to travel to the beach. Only when it became a matter of spending time with her children and family would she be willing to do so. &quot;I can&#39;t go out to play by myself, but I&#39;m willing to do it with others. It&#39;s valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled more than ten years ago when life was not so full. , I still have plenty of time to watch &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot;, and during the period when I went to the Pacific to &quot;isolate&quot;, I watched it intermittently nearly 20 times in total. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be so busy then. I would definitely choose to read a book now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until 2022 that she turned the content of the TV series into a class, and then she finally let go of the time wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ocean Open Class&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture content revolves around &quot;Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;Scientific trivia in the Biography&quot;, &quot;For example, there is an episode where the emperor went to An Lingrong&#39;s place to celebrate her birthday. He was very tired of eating, so he happened to get him some light pastries. Why do we eat dessert after a meal? It&#39;s because we The perception of sweetness is at the tip of the tongue, and the perception of bitterness is at the back of the tongue, and then there are other areas in the middle, such as spicy food. Therefore, we can still eat something sweet after a meal because we can feel sweetness at the tip of the tongue at the earliest. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is also braised pork, which is the Maillard reaction. Isn&#39;t the Maillard color popular this year? Maillard is actually caramel color, which is what it turns into after the sugar is burned. Color, what happens between it and braised pork is the Maillard reaction. Why do we need to add sugar? When you make braised pork, you can educate your children about science. These knowledge points are closely related to life; and why do we have oleander powder? Poisonous? I explained its formula, and then what is the most poisonous part of it? Tree trunks, leaves and flowers are all poisonous. Finally, why are these women fighting in the play? These are the backward ideas of feudal society. Let’s talk about it finally. The awakening of women in our new era includes humanistic methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that subject segmentation is actually unscientific because &quot;all knowledge is interlinked&quot; and is often lacking in the dissemination of knowledge. Not even one. She likes the title of &quot;Science Communication Figure&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s quite appropriate. Just like preaching, science is also a cognitive system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looks at everything around her with a comprehensive view of the universe and cherishes it. With curiosity, &quot;Actually, everything is learning. You may have thought it was entertainment before, but with a learning mentality, if you really understand the background, culture or meaning of TV series, movies and other cultural works, it is actually learning.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In her spare time during the Antarctic scientific expedition, Tang Limei also watched a few sporadic movies, including the literary film &quot;Sunset Trilogy&quot; series, which she also watched repeatedly. What attracts her is not the romantic encounter between the male and female protagonists, but the social topics that the two communicate and discuss from sunset to sunrise. &quot;In fact, the most attractive thing about it is its topic. It is not that two people are in love, they discuss They are all the destruction of society by developed countries, the infringement of weak countries, the garbage we produce now, the underlying logic of society, etc.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has also watched some of &quot;Celebrating More Than Years&quot; and she likes it. With time-travel elements, I am also planning to write some science fiction novels next, &quot;For example, two fishes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;because we humans evolved from fish (&lt;/span>;), a story of pure love that has gone through five mass extinctions, nine evolutions, and then traveled through several lives. In this long evolution, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is set in the universe. It may be based on the hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that she is in the conceptual stage, she is already very excited. &quot;It should be particularly enjoyable if I write it later. In fact, this is a process of creation. The meaning of life lies in creation. Only when you create something you love, will you feel happy and in a flow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, she participated in a training session at the Youth League School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a member of the Youth Lecturers Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since then, she has frequently given lectures in colleges and universities. She noticed that the new generation of young people are increasingly concerned about spiritual values. &quot;Public welfare must be the trend in the future. There will definitely be more and more people engaged in charity and volunteer services among the post-2000 generation, because it may be difficult for them to make a rapid economic leap from their work, so they will look for other ways. To realize your own value, engage more in charity and manual work, that is, to help others and feel happiness from the process of serving others.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will be more and more of these industries, like my daughter, What can you say to make her feel happy? It’s not that her mother went to her school and gave a speech. Everyone regarded me as an idol and worshiped me. This was a pressure for her; her happiness was similar to that once I took her to a friend&#39;s birthday party, and after she gave the butterfly she made with a twist stick to someone else, she felt sincerely happy because of the other person&#39;s gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first book has not yet been released, and it is non-stop. Tang Limei has already begun to imagine her future &quot;writing ambitions&quot;. &quot;If I publish one book every year, I can probably write 20 more in my life. I hope one or two of them will be popular science classics for teenagers.&quot; Through these words again and again. and written words. What she is committed to disseminating is not only scientific knowledge, but also &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; She hopes that her slightly tortuous but persevering experience can inspire young people and make those young faces in the audience understand, &quot;Everyone should have their own way out and live well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[吴慷仁，给自己拍拍手吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP6xETrXHQmgA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP 6xETrXHQmgA. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259646 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Wu Kounen (Visual China) &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt; /span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Newcomer Wu Kuangren &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Wu Kuangren is standing in the center of a hotel in a hotel in Xiamen, dancing and talking to others.

When he heard that there were trophy in the selection of the venue, he was so happy. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He cherishes every affirmation he gets, whether the award is good, or the predecessors. : Return to human feelings. He guest in the TV series &quot;She and her&quot; has been a pervert that harass the female subordinates, just because of this abominable character who can&#39;t find the actor. Because of the fact that the producer of the show used to take care of herself, Wu Kangren took over After playing this role. The original actor in &quot;Mimimic Survey&quot; lost his contract due to the schedule, and the crew was stagnant. He urgently needed a person who could be accepted by the capital Nai Fei to replace it. It was Wu Kangren. In order not to affect the subsequent film contract, he continued to work for 16 days. I only sleep two or three hours a day. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He thanked Chen Huiyi, the director of &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot;. I am still at the restaurant, but in fact, I am serious in my heart. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In 2009, Wu Kangren starred in Hua Tuoyou in the idol drama&quot; Next Stop, Happiness &quot;, a male No. 2 who silently guarded the heroine for many years, and finally let go. He created a paragraph in the history of Taiwanese idol drama Classic: Tears in the eyes, suppressing the sadness of rushing out of the chest, and said to the heroine with a smile: &quot;Why, obviously I know you first, but you still choose to hold him six years ago and six years later. hand. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ufgy4qfh5W7K2VHJG4QA5CTSC3ZCVRCMN3H6.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;wid Th = &quot;680&quot; height = &quot;1024&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ufgy4qfh5w7k2vhjg4qctsc3ksz3ZCVRCMN3H6.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;259648&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Next stop, Happiness (2009) &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He felt very surprised by him, how could someone cry so moving. I asked Director Chen Huiyi, the director said that he was acting because he was using his life. &quot;The screenwriter Lu Yiyuan said. Wu Kangren later became her work&quot; Outbound Office &quot;and&quot; The distance between us to evil &quot;. Both dramas brought the nomination of the best actor of the Golden Bell Award to Wu Kangren. P>; &lt;p>; That&#39;s it. Wu Kuangren, who just resigned from the work of the bartender, made his debut with &quot;Hua Tuyou&quot;. At the age of 27, he met his favorite job: acting. &quot;After the acting reached a certain stage, it was no longer me. Use the means to make money and eat. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; However,&quot; Next Stop, Happiness &quot;is the last peak of Taiwan idol dramas. Since then, the ten -year Taiwanese drama in Asia has declined. Korean dramas have gradually occupied Taiwan TV, and Taiwanese dramas that have lost the audience also lost the funds of the TV station. At that time, the backbone of the Taiwanese drama, the stars of the future, such as Ruan Jingtian, Zhao Youting, Chen Bailin, Lin Yichen, Chen Qiaoen and others all turned to the Mainland to the Mainland Development. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Newcomer Wu Kangren stayed in Taiwan and desperately acting in his own way. &lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Like a foreign worker &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is Wu Kuangren&#39;s fight for. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He sees the story outline of the investment period. After reading it, he likes it and met Wang Lilin. The atmosphere of the meeting is harmonious, but since then Contact. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Eight months after this, Wu Kuangren killed two plays and rest at home. One day he stared at his cat, and suddenly felt that filming in Taiwan was a comfort circle, and he wanted to change places. He remembered &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, and called the director and asked you if you still did not plan to find me. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;The director also honestly told me: they do have other candidates. . But I think I am very sincere, I can go to Malaysia a month earlier, and (pay) can be cheaper. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; For Wu Kangren,&quot; Fudu Youth &quot;is a rare opportunity. Now in Taiwan, he has shaped etiquette, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. He has also tried many unconventional characters, For example, mothers mulberry, stealing women&#39;s underwear, etc. This is how he train himself. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 23/ 11/25/OFJVO5NR54pp2W1SCDW66JDOKYGZZTEBKAO528w.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/medias/i Mage/23/11/25/OFJVO5NNR54pp2W1SCDW66JDOKYGZZTEBKAO528W. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259639 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is different. The people in the film have no professional dilemma, seemingly unconventional, but they really exist in Malaysia. It tells a pair of foreign workers without identity Brother, who stole the old community in the old community of the Foreign Labor. Brother Abon (Wu Kangren) was born with dumb, and he resentful and resentful. His brother Adi (Chen Zeyao) did not want to bow his head to fate. Leaving this disgust. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Wang Lilin is the producer of the movie &quot;Drotten Life&quot; and &quot;Lost Anid&quot;. When he is viewing &quot;Damn Life&quot;, he observes that there are many Fudu communities in Kuala Lumpur Three years later, three years later, he decided to take Fudu&#39;s Pasar (market) as the background, with some people without identity as the protagonist to shoot his first movie. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot; Starting from &quot;Dancing Life&quot;, I really want to approach these people, and I feel very strong about them. &quot;Wang Lilin said. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This movie, from the director to the starring star,&quot; True listening, real, real feelings &quot;. Wu Kuangren and Chen Zeyao worked in Pasar and learned sign language for about a month before the movie was in Fudu officially started shooting. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Fugu is all flavored. Patar in the Paragal in the work has fishy, ​​chicken sao, and sweet fruit fragrance. Urine. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; There is a close -up of the washing hands in the film, and Wu Kangren rubbed each nail seam carefully. &quot;This is indeed the action of receiving the union every day because the taste on my hand is too rich. Wu Kangren said, &quot;When I smoke, I smell the taste of her fingertips, and I feel, hey, let&#39;s wash it again. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The script gives branches, and the movie of the movie grows by the actors themselves. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Abang lives with killing chickens and moving goods, so Wu Kou killed 20 days of chickens — — Although the director did not plan to shoot the shots of chickens at first. The buttocks of the chicken could find the eggs, and the foreign workers often swallowed the eggs. They thought of it a few times to Wu Kanren to eat, and Wu Kuangren said, &quot;Control, thank you.&quot; &lt; /P>; &lt;p>; Although the raw eggs did not eat, Wu Kuangren brought this detail into the movie: Abang, who was home to home, carried a bag of eggs and shared it with the mother and daughter of the neighbors. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He wanted to give up I am really like a Fugu foreign worker, not only can I work, but I also have to become dark and thin. &quot;I was like it when I first went. It was still in vain. appearance. He recalled, &quot;But when you really step into that market, you will find that everyone&#39;s eyes are very different, and you are incompatible. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He imitates the state of foreign workers, does not repair the border, and has sweat and animal blood on his body. Looking at people&#39;s eyes is the tiredness after repeating the chicken in two hundred times a day. The goods have no effort to have more intersections with people. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; While killing chickens, he is close to Fugu. He smokes, eats, and chats with foreign workers. He talked about his girlfriend or quarreled with his wife. He observed the mouse and said that he had never seen mice who had been trained like training. Gathering again. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; When he felt that he never looked around again, he knew he could play Abang. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; From May to August 2022, Wu Kuangren continued to shoot continuously. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and the Hong Kong movie &quot;I Wish Permanent&quot;, hungry for four months, 1 meter 78 people lost to 53 kilograms. He didn&#39;t want to say how much he lost, after all, &quot;If the show was not filmed well well well, , Everyone thinks that you are just thin, what&#39;s not a big deal. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/hr6yc0q5ty8zpqtmsFemejmyfhtcgmvbb XT .jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/hr6yc0q55ty8zpqtmsfemejmyf Htcgmvbxt.jpg &quot;data-key = &quot;259640&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; I hope that people will last long (2023) &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the film enters the end, Abang does not eat or drink in prison, and begged to die. Wu Kangren also fasts to make himself slumped. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He said it was easy to fast, just to say that the skin was broken, white and smooth. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In the past few years, Wu Kangren&#39;s weight change curve of the weight and thinness of the show is a series of &quot;W&quot;, in 30 kg When the gap between the gap. When the original &quot;termites&quot; (2016) were lowered, he was a bit optimistic. Thinking of the physical change first, he could observe the change of psychology. The unexpected effect. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Before being an actor, he bleed and sweat on the construction site and got paid, so he firmly believed that he would return to the cup on the back kitchen. The same is clean, and then it even turned into his belief: I, Wu Kangren, I saw it for you on the face, as in private. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is also the same. No one knows what this acting can be obtained, but he wants to know; he tried, so he knew the power of appearance changes. &quot;I am quite glad to do this and have a lot of help to me.&quot; He said, &quot;This is irreplaceable, it is self -practice.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; dumb &lt;/strong>; &lt;/ H4>; &lt;p>; When &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; killed the youth, the crew sent Wu Kangren a cake, and he started crying when he saw the cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I can finally eat!&quot; He said that he was crying with tears, &quot;I went to eat chicken the next day!&quot; Once again, Wu Kuangren couldn&#39;t easily solve it with a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Before Abang&#39;s death penalty, the prison arranged him to meet with the mage to make a final talk. In this play, the director completely played &quot;True Listening and True True&quot;: there are only the word &quot;complaints&quot; in Wu Kuangren&#39;s script, without lines; the mage is a real monk, who has opened a photo of the Mage for more than 30 years for the death prisoner. There is no script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wu Kangren and the director have dedicated more than thirty times to try to clarify why Abang has such a strong reaction to release himself in such a situation. &quot;We can imagine that he finally has a forceful display, but I didn&#39;t understand where this power base was before.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ Image/23/11/25/pnousbga6pnrlpqfuxmeoj692wqpfd4yaarsu6is.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/ Medias/Image/23/11/ 25/PNOUSBGA6PNRLPQFUXMEOJ692WQPFD4YAARSU6IS.JPG &quot;Data-key =&quot; 259641 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span s s Tyle = &quot;color: # AAA; &quot;>; &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Due to the long preparation cycle and shooting in the order of time, the actor has enough time to integrate into the role, so when Wu Kuangren heard Master Kaishi said&quot; live well &quot; Suddenly, Abon was sorrowful. &quot;It&#39;s the hardest for him to live well. We seemingly simple things are extravagant for them. So we must start from this sentence.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Abang and Adi cannot rent The house often wakes up from the dream late at night and evades the inspection; you cannot open an account in the bank, and work money in a rusty biscuit box; you can&#39;t buy a motorcycle if you can&#39;t get a driver&#39;s license, you can only take a bus or walk everywhere. Without their identities, they can only do workers in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Abang once touched love, but that was fleeting; he thought that he could be overturned by fate with his brother in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But they also have a happy moment. Abon, Adi and the transgender sister Money depended on each other -in Malaysia, the transgender people are another sense without identity -they eat together and dance together. The three people knocked on their heads on the dining table, and they were so painful and laughing. This is Wu Kangren&#39;s favorite play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得最珍贵的就是生活中的笑容。整个戏，他们笑容很少，那些生活的理所当然对他们来说太过严苛。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终， In the face of Kai Shi Master, Abang complained: I am always thinking, why I was born, I had no home, and I didn&#39;t even have a parent. I could only look at it from a distance. I am jealous of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I want to be the same. But I can&#39;t! Why do this? I want to speak, I want to be loved, but I have nothing. You call me not to give up, continue to live. I can&#39;t. I must always be careful, alert, hide, and escape. This is unfair, what I did wrong. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>;&quot; My life is terrible, I want to change my life, but Impossible. I have no future. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; These complaints are completed in sign language and expression. Those echoes that were carefully observed around, the echo of the wrist iron chain on the table, and the tears that had been turned in the eye socket for a long time, all of them made this silent complaint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Don&#39;t preach to me, I have no identity.&quot; Abang pointed to the code on his prison uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Master Kaishi suddenly held Abang&#39;s hand. Abang calmed down, tears fell, and he sobbing a difficult syllable: &quot;I want to die, I want to die, I think ...&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He looked around and found that no one could understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Abang is dumb, which is a coupling of fate. &quot;A group of people without identity, like dumb, will not change even if they speak.&quot; Wu Kangren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Zeyao, who played his brother, later saw this silent complaint on the screen, and was shocked and hurt. &quot;It turned out that Abang thought so, it turned out that he had always felt like a shadow. I couldn&#39;t help you with you Say too much inner feelings, because my heart is really painful. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Brother&#39;s farewell to that scene, Chen Zeyao instinctively expressed his emotions to his brother in sign language. &quot;I&#39;m crying, and forgot to mystery. Later, I found that everyone can feel it without talking about the lines.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Abang, next time, I said next time, I would like to protect you.&quot; Adi said. Twenty years ago, the stray Abon and Adi met on the street and became brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Wang Lilin, the &quot;Fugu Youth&quot; presenting today has achieved his expectations. &quot;I want to talk about people&#39;s emotions in the context of Fudu foreign workers. In such a cruel and oppressed society, the precious warmth and goodwill between people.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; What are the expectations of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;? &quot;We asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Don&#39;t lose money, they are so hard to shoot a film.&quot; He answered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next day, Wu Kangren sent a social media: &quot;We did a great thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/ CMS/MEDIAS/Image/23/11/25/1MJ220voe9o4Tyiqivik3kr0r0ye1alckh7wtsqflg.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 686 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/25/1mj220voe9o4tyqivik3kr0ye1alckh7wtsqflg.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259642 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Wu Kuangren&#39;s personal social media account/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Clap &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2016, Wu Kuangren relied on&quot; A Blue &quot; The corner of &quot;Guo Yan&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Actor. This is one of his most successful characters. He is mixed with the cynical sense of youth and vicissitudes of the life and death of war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; His award -winning speech seems to be pleading: pleading for actors more resources, and begging for TV stations to develop more different types of dramas. &quot;They (actors) are waiting, as before, waiting for me to choose me like Cao Ruiyuan&#39;s eyes, we need a little more resources to help us. Maybe we are not the most talented, but we can always be the most. The one who works hard. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdqyotwzk1gvljxjl3igl84qzobu9i37.jpg &quot;border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;673&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdqyotwzsx1gvljxjl3igl84QZOBU9I37.JPG&quot; Data-key = &quot;259645&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt; p style = &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; A young (2015) &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;p>; Relying on government subsidies and government subsidies and Later, the capitalization of the streaming media platform, Taiwanese dramas have been new in the past few years. &quot;A Blue&quot; and the type drama &quot;Outbound Office&quot; and &quot;Anesthesia Storm&quot; around 2015 were regarded as the first new trend. After 2019, the episodes represented by &quot;The distance between us to evil&quot; and concerned about social issues marked that the Taiwanese drama basically spent the low valley period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the above -mentioned Taiwanese dramas, Wu Kuangren all picked up the beam. From idol dramas to realism, his acting career has overlap with the ups and downs and changes in the 15 years of platform dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In terms of honesty, I would become famous because Taiwan was very lacking (filming) at that time. Taiwanese actors were not much at my age.&quot; He said in an interview with &quot;Taiwan Scales&quot; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When entering the industry, he believes that he is not good in appearance and qualifications, but &quot;effort is more important than talent.&quot; When he was doing wine insurance, he would not speak English. After finishing work in the early morning, he went to the Eslite Bookstore, which was opened overnight. Many years later, the media went to interview the owner of the bar, and the other party used &quot;life to hang life&quot; to describe Wu Kangren: to work hard for one thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has experienced a negative stage. He knew what he was doing, he paid 200 %, and he was strict with himself, and asked the people around him to work as hard as him. &quot;I used to be quite aggressive at work, so there will be rumors that Wu Kangren is difficult to engage. I only slowly realized in the past two years. This is a team work.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; But because Wu Kuangren always emphasizes efforts, It is often said that they are not talented, and few people talk about his talent as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has beautiful eyes, and his eyebrows are affectionate, so he is good at performing the explosive moment of complex emotions; he is long than observation, and he describes many details of the old districts of Fudu. Although he is daily and serious, standing on the stage and in front of the camera, he has a lot of words and humor, and his expression and physical movements are rich. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He is confident that he can persist in acting, yearn for a good actor like Li Xuejian, but not optimistic about the actor&#39;s career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t think I have always had a play, I want to contact a lot of possibilities earlier and faster. It may not be possible to perform a film in the future, and strive to strive for fate.&quot; He thought for a while, &quot;You won&#39;t see&quot; Fugu Youth &quot;in five years. I have entered the industry for 15 years, and I saw&quot; Fudu Youth &quot;.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This is then It was why he tried a variety of unconventional characters after 2015. He wanted to know how much possibilities he had, and how to improve the performance. He went to the training class to practice vocal skills; he filmed 5 plays in 2022, and he was very solid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Perhaps because there is no agent, the film resources that Wu Kangren can come into contact with is limited. He has expressed his love for mainland art films several times, and admits that he has respected to the mainland to act in the mainland. &quot;Before you go, you have to prepare for it, not to make money.&quot; Without the agent, Wu Kangren&#39;s work decision was made by himself. After gone through a panic, he is now used to this way of working: he knows what is important, and he only needs to play a good show. He can take care of himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He yearn for Hong Kong actors in the golden age of Hong Kong films, such as Liang Jiahui, Liang Chaowei, and Andy Lau. &quot;Each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas and leaves his own position.&quot; >; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1fpdk7zj6bsxs9jb3qbmfyu7ayjgorhx.jpg&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960 &quot;Height =&quot; 1440 &quot;data-SRC = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1fpdk7zj6bsxs9jb3qbmfyu7ayjgorhx.jpg =&quot; 259647 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; Co &quot;Co Lor: #999; Text- Align: center; &quot;>; The year of life (2023) &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The title of&quot; Life &quot;is Gao Jiayue&#39;s life summary.

The first part was to welded the box naked eyes. After the work, it was white, thinking that he was going to be blind. Since then, he has worked more than 50 workers, shuttled between the 20 -story scaffolding without a helmet and a safe net, and washed dishes in a variety of restaurants to entertain guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Twenty years later, Wu Kangren was asked what he wanted to say to himself, and he replied: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;15 -year -old Wu Kuangren, what you were afraid of at that time, Nothing happened, because you didn&#39;t learn bad, and now you take good care of your mother. Your decision at that time is right.

He heard that he could take the postgraduate entrance examination. He thought of the Chinese national history of Yunnan University. But compared to the exam, the more difficult is to let the middle school be released. &quot;I went to the then county party secretary Yan Xiangkan. He was the Brown ethnic group.

As a manager, he faced the question of where the liberal arts micro -historical department went from. At that time, in the context of difficult enrollment, distribution, and creation, many teachers called the history department &quot;shit pits&quot; and shouted to jump out of &quot;shit shit. pit&quot;. In terms of office, Lin Chaomin organized the application of historical base classes, and set up a major of anthropology, social work, etc., and established the first Asian Institute of Film and Television Anthropology to allow this university located in the southwest side to seize the opportunity in the disciplinary system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Lin Chaomin after retirement can also spend time on research.

In 1942, the Japanese occupied Tengchong. My parents fled to Dali. I was born there. After the Chinese Expeditionary Force recovered Tengchong in September 1944, we came back from Dali again. At that time, due to the Anti -Japanese War, Teng Chong had a rubble in the city, and there was almost no standing house in the city. The central elementary school we read is the temple. Previously, the Japanese used it as the headquarters. Because of the strong architecture, it was stored. There were still many bullet holes on the wall pillars inside. I studied in the sixth grade school to repair the sports field, and I also dug a lot of bullet shells and bayonets for three -eighth rifle. I didn&#39;t leave Tengchong until I graduated from the third year of high school in 1962. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When I don&#39;t know what to do, I just know to read a good book. At that time, my mother subscribed to different magazines for our brothers and sisters every age. For example, when I was very young, I watched &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;Red Scarf&quot;, &quot;Middle School Students&quot; and &quot;Juvenile Literature&quot;. There is a library. At that time, I read Lin Hansda&#39;s &quot;New Zhou Story of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty&quot;, &quot;New Editor of the Han Story&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;The Tai Shi who is not afraid of death&quot;, etc., and has a strong interest in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; History of Yunnan University? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; My father is a technician engaged in water conservancy projects, participating in the construction Road, ditch, and reservoirs often tell me that New China has been established. The motherland needs to be industrialized. You have to go to the study of engineering and work for modernization. My mother is a middle school teacher. In 1957, many liberal arts teachers were wronged by Tengchong No. 1 Middle School. My mother said that she could not learn arts and it was easy to make mistakes. Therefore, I always wanted to study science and engineering. Later, my mother also advocated that I was studying medicine because it was useful at any time. In high school, we were good in all subjects, but it was more prominent in liberal arts. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1962, I was in high school. After graduating from the last semester, the school divided us into three groups according to our subjects. The other group is medical and agricultural department, and the other is liberal arts. My family decided to choose a science and engineering department, but in the specific division, I was assigned to the liberal arts group under the arrangement of the class teacher, Chinese teacher, and historical teacher. At that time, I went to Baoshan, Yunnan to take the college entrance examination, and issued a volunteer book before the exam. Everyone can fill in five volunteers, and I have filled the historical departments of Peking University, Renmin University of China, Nanjing University, Fudan and Yunda, and was later accepted to Yunda. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我们那一届历史系只有历史学一个专业，招了32个人。只有前一届的二分之一，再前一届的三分之一。课程安排是一、二、三年级上基础课，比如古文、政治、外语、中外通史等，四年级分“专门化（组）”。我读书时，有中国民族史、中国古代经济史、中国近代经济史3个专门组。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当时读大学都没有好好念书。 1958年以来，大学里劳动教育比较多。中央制定了高教六十条，强调以教学为主。当时教育部规定，学生一个学年要上劳动课，为五个星期，暗含不能超过五个星期。但实际上每学年的劳动都超过五周。那时云南大学有三个农场，种水稻、苞谷、小麦、蔬菜，还有苹果园、养猪场。除此之外还有很多公益劳动，比如上山植树，农忙时去支援春耕秋收，后来昆明修火车站，也喊我们去帮忙。到了1961年，高等教育部调研后觉得学生既要搞劳动，又要上学，在4年内学不到多少东西，就决定把重点大学办成5年制，云大也就改成了5年制. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你读研时师从方国瑜先生，是因为上过方先生的课吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我读大学的时候，方先生承担国家任务中国历史地图西南部分的编绘。他只带研究生，民族史是高年级专业课，四年级才上，由他的助手尤中先生、木芹先生讲授。 1963年4月20日，方先生在学校做“论中国历史发展的整体性”演讲，我第一次见到他，但因为他是丽江人，纳西族，口音很重，没听懂多少。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但我看了文章后留下深刻印象。 1966年9月，我读大四，因为“文化大革命”又停课了，学校开始搞大批判，要批判反动学术权威。当时云大成立了一个大批判小组，下面有一个中文组和一个历史组，历史组主要批判历史系的“三座大山”，第一座就是“代表”封建主义的方国瑜，第二座是“代表”官僚资本主义的江应樑（曾在车里任县长，今景洪），第三座是“代表”帝国主义的杨堃（留学法国里昂中法大学）。我在的历史组里有五六个同学，小组成员不用在系上念书，由两位青年教师组织我们去找这些老先生的书，从书里找问题，一般的大学生只有6个借书卡，我们批判组的有20个借书卡，而且可以进书库查书翻书。也是这个时候，我把方先生所有论著找出来看了一遍，他的《滇西边区考察记》讲他到临沧边地阿佤山等做田野考察，我读了很有兴趣，感觉写得非常好，没找到什么问题。我就没写批判方先生的文章。而是学到边疆社会历史、少数民族风土人情，觉得他的《论中国历史发展的整体性》等是维护国家统一的好文章。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我的学长很多都去高校当老师，比较热门的就是近现代史组的，每个学校都有党史课程，就业需求量很大，之前还有一届近现代史专业的学生全部分配到解放军总政治部。除此之外，去中国科学院哲学社会科学部（现中国社科院）的也很多。当时云大的民族史专业在全国是第一，哲学社会科学部的民族所里研究傣族史、彝族史、白族史、纳西族史的，都是云大毕业的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按理来说应该是1967年7月毕业，但一直到1968年10月，我们这一批大学生除农学、医学少数专业外，全部被安排到农场接受再教育、劳动锻炼。到1970年4月才开始分配工作。那时规定大学生要做到“四个面向”，面向基层、面向农村、面向工矿、面向边疆。分配时，没人愿意去西双版纳，我读过方先生的《滇西边区考察记》、江应樑先生的《摆夷的经济生活》《摆夷的生活文化》等，对边境民族很有兴趣，就主动报名去西双版纳。 1970年5月，到了西双版纳勐海县，我被分到了勐海茶厂当工人，不时抽调到厂里写工作总结、宣传报道等。 1972年，勐海一中创办高中，需要高中教师，但厂里不放，直到1973年才把我调过去当历史、语文老师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;听说你在勐海茶厂时，还得到了北大任继愈教授的赏识？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;在茶厂里每天工作8小时，其他时间都是自己的。大学时我对中国思想史很有兴趣，读过侯外庐的《中国思想通史》、赵纪彬的《论语新探》、郭沫若的《十批判书》等，做了笔记。我去勐海的时候带了一部《四书》。业余时间写了一篇关于孔子思想的文章，寄给系里的李埏教授请他赐教，他把文章交给中国古代思想史的专家张德光教授，张先生推荐给任继愈。任先生给我回了一封信，说在西双版纳这么边远的地方，我能坚持学习孔子，还写出这样的文章来，很不容易，但他也提出我的文章对孔子的批判还不够。任先生还寄了一本他主编的《中国哲学史简编》给我。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1972年，任先生写信给我，告诉我北大准备招10名中国哲学史的研究生，希望我能准备好，考上他的研究生。于是我又每天学习外语，系统学习中国哲学史，还经常写信向他请教。但后来出了张铁生交白卷事件，任先生写信告诉我，研究生招生工作停止，以后招研究生也要实行工农兵推荐的方式。我就没有机会了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;直到1978年恢复研究生招生时，你才终于可以考研究生，但为什么没有再联系任继愈教授？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我也想过写信给任先生，跟他去做哲学史研究，但当时在西双版纳的我，思想发生很大变化，我生活在傣族、拉祜族、布朗族、哈尼族之中，发现自己对他们的历史毫不了解，后来当了中学老师，一些学生问我少数民族的问题，我也答不上来，这时候我又想起了方国瑜先生、江应樑先生对少数民族的研究，我觉得在全国做哲学史的比较多，做民族史的还太少，是个冷门，就选择考方先生的研究生。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;上研究生的第一节课，方先生就把我带到了图书馆的古典书库，让我读书，一个星期后汇报，那时候我也不懂，等到汇报时他问我你看了多少，我说我才看了几本，他就说你这样看书不行，不是一本一本看，而是一书架一书架地翻看。他让我先从目录学入手，看《四库全是总目提要》、余嘉锡的《四库提要辨证》、张之洞的《书目答问》等书。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;方先生从来没有直接批评过我，我读硕士时在《云南日报》写一些小文章，方先生也只是说，你现在书还没有读够，在《云南日报》上发的属于雕虫小技，搭积木。你的任务是盖高楼大厦，要把基础打好，多读书、读好书，将来做出创造性的成果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对于博士培养，方先生有没有要求你发表论文？对看书和毕业论字数方面有何要求？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;方先生没有设定这些目标，他不主张急于发表文章，认为先要读好书。 He said that any article cannot be fried in cold rice. Don&#39;t write articles without new ideas.他讲现在有的人不认真读书，忙于写文章急于发表文章，急功近利。很多文章就是炒回锅肉。这样是不行的！博士生不是利用人家养好的猪来做粉蒸肉、千张肉、红烧肉，而是要自己去培育新猪种，有所创造，有所发明。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来我把读博士归纳为五“独”俱全。 It is independent personality, independent thoughts, unique insights, unique paths, and uniqueness. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1963年，方先生发表《论中国历史发展的整体性》，开始讲中国历史发展的整体性。文章针对国内外一些学者将中国历史当作单一的汉族历史，将非汉族的中国少数民族的历史排除在中国历史之外的荒谬言论，指出中国历史发展始终是一个整体，历史和现实、中原和边疆、汉族和少数民族、中华民族等都是一个整体。中国历史，指的是生活在这块土地上各族人民的历史，就应该包括他们的全部历史，不能“变更伸缩”。中国历史是有其整体性的，在整体之内，不管出现几个政权，不管政治如何不统一，并没有破裂了整体，应当以中国整体为历史的范围，不能以历代王朝疆域为历史的范围. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来我协助方先生讲授云南地方史，他在《云南地方史讲义》的导论里重申这个观点。到了1983年云南大学70周年校庆的时候，他又指导我写了一篇文章，叫《大理三十七部盟誓碑有关的几个问题》，也通过这块碑，讲中国历史的统一问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从国际上看，一些历史学者或许对大一统的历史观还持有一些其他观点，该怎么理解边疆问题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;边疆问题比较复杂。中国以前没有边疆问题，只有华夏和四夷之间的关系，就是华夏与四夷“五方共和”“天下一统，华夷无间”，从中央到地方都是一个整体。即便是分裂期，无论汉族还是少数民族，都追求“天下统一”，都把自己建立的王朝视为中华正统；其所建立的王朝制度，也均以继承秦汉制度为基础，并未改变整体的经济、政治、文化结构。因为各民族长期共同生活，早已形成互补又合一的生产生活方式，孕育极具包容性和吸纳性的中华文明，使得中华民族形成以“共同性”为基础的强大内聚力。即便是在分裂时期，这种生产生活方式没有变，政治制度没有变，整体意识也没有变，文化一直在延续。这在国家观和民族观上就表现为“大一统”的国家观和中华民族整体意识。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;近代边疆研究开始兴起是因为西方殖民主义的东来。首先是政治上的“边疆”。历史上很多地方分分合合，是一个发展的过程，比如云南在唐朝是南诏，贞元十年（794）建立云南安抚司，由剑南节度使担任云南安抚使统领。是一个自治的地方政权。大理国也是自治的地方政权，1253年蒙古平定大理，1274年元朝在云南建立行省。元朝还建立过缅甸行省，后来又划归云南行省管理。是云南行省统属的土司地。新中国成立后，1961年，中缅边界正式划定。中国在腾冲的边界上竖立中华人民共和国第一号界碑。表示我们正式尊重国际法上的边界划定，也就是国际法上的边疆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;还有文化的边疆，比如说中国的佤族和缅北佤邦的文化有很多相近的地方，这时虽然有政治上的边界，但其实大家文化同脉，历史同根，是命运共同体。所以说从国内来讲是中华民族的整体性，从国外来讲应该视作共同体。在国内我们维护中国的整体性、维护国家统一。在国际上我们构建人类命运共同体。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;林超民的博士论文题为《安西北庭都护府与唐代西部边疆》，摄于1985年。（受访者/图)&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;林超民：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那时文理科的基础学科普遍存在招生难、分配难、经费难等问题，历史学也不例外，当时各个系要创收，像经济系、外语系的老师可以去讲课、辅导，挣外快，虽然工资一样，但他们的外快是我们的好几倍，那时就有历史专业的老师说，要跳出“屎pit&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;学生思想也不太稳定，于是我提出了一个观点，历史看似无用，但是无用之用就是大用。我跟学生说，教室的桌椅、板凳、门窗、电灯都是有用的，但是看不见、没有用的是这个空间，但是如果没有这个空间，桌椅、板凳、电灯都无处安放。历史就是人类的时间和空间。看不到，摸不着，但时时刻刻离不开，随时随地有大用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来教育部提出要在文、史、哲三大门类各建设10个“基地”，文件下达学校的时候，距离申报截止日期不到5天，我夜以继日填写申报表，在评审会上陈述，云南大学是一个边疆大学，很多方面比不上北大、复旦等，但是云大研究边疆问题、民族问题是全国独一无二的，关系到国家统一、民族团结，是其他学校不可替代的。云大历史系的特点就是边疆、民族，任何一个学校都无法替代。就这样，1987年，云大成为了10个基地之一。基地班给云大带来了新的机遇，国家每年给基地班投入30万建设经费，并且有一半以上的学生可以保送读研，毕业后的就业也不再是问题。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1988年人类学专业办成后，我就开始筹划申报社会学专业。 1939年7月吴文藻就在云大创办社会学系，到1954年，社会学系被撤销了，当时的系主任是杨堃先生。 1984年、1986年，我两次到中国社科院拜访杨先生，杨先生反复对我说，撤销社会学系是不对的，应该尽快恢复重建。我把他的意见带回学校，向领导汇报，虽然被置之不理，但他的话我时时记在心里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1990年10月，我到美国访学，知道社会工作专业是社会十分需要的专业，社会发展会带来许多问题，需要专门的社会工作者来应对解决。无论穷人富人都有社会问题。回国时经过香港，我到一些大学了解社会工作专业，他们社会工作的一个特色是帮助弱势群体，帮助穷人、失业者、残障人士等，回来后我就跟学校说，社会学专业不能办我们就办社会工作专业。当时学校教务处的大多数人不知道什么是社会工作，我就一遍遍解释，学校同意后报到省教委、国家教委，很快就被批准了，我们是继南开大学、中国青年政治学院后的第三家。 &lt;/p>;

Four years ago, she once shouted &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a variety show. Four years later, at the age of 16, she fulfilled her promise with practical actions and became the youngest person in China to climb Mount Everest from the south slope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Influenced by her father, Xu Zhuoyuan started climbing when she was very young. When she was 4 years old, her parents took her to climb Mount Siguniang and unexpectedly found that she adapted well to altitude sickness. When she was 12 years old, she traveled to Tibet with her father Xu Jianglei. At that time, she regretted not being able to see the sunrise on Mount Everest due to weather conditions. On the way back, she climbed the peak of Mount Siguniang with her father. “It was my first time to climb a snow-capped mountain in a real sense.” From then on, she buried her desire to climb Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mountain climbing is an extreme sport that relies on luck. Since she got into climbing, her mood has become more stable. &quot;People often die during climbing. Now for me, life and death are no big deal.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;This climb six months ago was Xu Zhuoyuan’s first challenge on Mount Everest. Before setting off, she packed her father Xu Jianglei&#39;s gloves when he climbed Mount Everest into his backpack, hoping to keep them as &quot;a kind of inheritance.&quot; In 2007, Xu Jianglei climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, becoming the first person in Hunan Province to summit Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Zhuoyuan remembered that when she was approaching the summit, the Sherpa guide beside her reminded her that she was almost at the top and it was still dark. &quot;The only thought in my mind was that I must see the top of Mount Everest.&quot; At sunrise on the mountain, my father’s summit photo has always impressed me. In the photo, he is high-spirited and smiling brightly facing the sun. I can feel his love for the snow-capped mountains. That photo is still displayed in my home. .&quot; Fortunately, the sun came out almost at the moment she reached the top. Now, next to a picture of her father, there is a picture of her reaching the summit, with the rising sun behind her. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;When you were 12 years old, you said &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a show. What did you think at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Ever since I was a child, Mount Everest has always had a different meaning to me. The summer after I graduated from primary school when I was 12 years old, my father took me to Tibet, but I didn’t see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain due to the weather. Later, my father and I went to climb the peak of Siguniang Mountain together. This was my first time to truly climb a snow-capped mountain. It snowed on the mountain at that time. As a southerner, I found it very novel. From then on, I very much hoped to have the opportunity to climb Mount Everest to watch the sunrise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After setting that goal at the age of 12, my father How to say? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He was quite shocked at the time. He didn’t expect that I would have this idea, and he probably thought that I wouldn’t really take action. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you set a deadline for yourself at that time? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What I wanted at that time was to complete it as soon as possible.

My current high school coursework is very heavy, and my mountaineering training is also very heavy, so I will fill up all my free time and study ahead of schedule. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Climbing to the top is not success, returning home is&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you feel when you climbed to the top of Mount Everest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I thought I would be very excited. Climbing to the top would be regarded as fulfilling my dream of the past four years, but I didn’t know it was because the weather was too bad at that time. Cold and high altitude can compress some of people&#39;s emotions, but I&#39;m actually quite calm. I remember taking out the flags in my bag one by one, taking pictures, and then calling my mother to report that everything was safe. Because the weather was so bad and there was a heavy snowstorm, the Sherpa guide urged me to retreat quickly, so I thought about retreating quickly. At that time, my parents suggested that I stay at Camp 2 for one more day and take a helicopter back to Everest Base Camp the next day. But I stayed on the mountain for 8 days. I didn’t take a shower or have an Internet connection for 8 days. This actually reached the limit for me. I threw my sleeping bag and moisture-proof mat directly to Camp 4 and decided to return to the base camp that day. , so it took me 22 hours to withdraw that day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to not being able to take a shower, as a girl, you What difficulties did you encounter during the climb? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, women have more inconveniences when climbing than men, such as washing and going to the toilet.

We adapted to Camp 2 for 3 days, and then we were waiting for news from Camp 3 to see the road construction team. Can it be cultivated to the top? We were very lucky. If the road construction team had not repaired it at that time, we might have to withdraw to the Everest base camp and wait for the next cycle. The rest of the time, I would chat with my teammates on the mountaineering team, play cards, and fight against altitude sickness. I vomited violently the night I first arrived at Everest Base Camp. I don’t know if it was because I was not used to the climate in Nepal, so I rested for about two days before recovering. Later, I was training alone with my teammates at the base camp. My mother called me and advised me to withdraw.

Feeling humiliated and excited at the same time, he opened the first page of the computer document and read &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; in enlarged font size. Below it were two lines of small characters, original work: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wants to adapt this novella published in 1988. The perpetrators of the three murders all pointed to madmen, but they could not build a complete chain of evidence to bring him to justice, which made both the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe uneasy. Writer Yu Hua&#39;s parody of detective novels in the avant-garde literature period used violent absurdity as the surface and subversion of tradition as the core. I have sold the copyright several times but have never changed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficult thing is to find a word that points to the philosophy behind all suspenseful stories. In 2021, Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei entered the second year of their adaptation. After overturning the general direction twice, they were determined to find the word. They searched for two days and two nights, wandering around the house until they got something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Bug.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new development. &quot;It is a word born from the progress of information technology. It is a vulnerability problem based on code and the best rational logic. We think it is too accurate. , isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this one is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was August 2021, and Wei Shujun was preparing to shoot a new film in Northeast China &quot;White Crane Spreads Wings&quot;. After work, the crew plays badminton together. However, indoor venues have been closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they are planning to play basketball outdoors instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month ago, his second feature film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; was selected for the Directors&#39; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival; a year ago, his first feature film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was nominated for the Cannes Newcomer Award. As a feature film director, his graduate work &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; won the Cannes Short Film Special Mention Award. He received critical acclaim when he first appeared on the scene. Industry seniors and critics praised his talents and talents, and were curious about the possibilities he brought to the table. sex. Wei Shujun received attention as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the adaptation of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. Bugs do not exist alone. To describe rational loopholes and loss of control, the premise is to explain what rationality is. The argument about rationality is a wide-ranging, academic discussion that is energy-consuming and unnecessary. &quot;We looked in the wrong direction again,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By chance, while scouting locations in Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;The causes of their deaths are not completely connected on a rational level and cannot serve to solve the case. But in the dream, they interlock with each other, as if they are all established, revealing a certain inevitability in a series of accidents, giving people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, dreams became the core sequence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seems to be his consistent creative approach, which values ​​the true feelings of the creative subject and expresses them effectively in the film. Photography director Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We basically create based on our feelings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met for the first time in Shanghai three years ago, and they chatted quite well. . They have many consensuses on the nature and creative concepts of movies, two of which are simple but very important: movies were created to create &quot;realistic illusions&quot; at the beginning, and they should still be so today, and movies may not be the best way to tell stories. It is a medium, but it is a channel for storing and transmitting the creator’s feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, regarding &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot;, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it was restrained, quiet, and elegant, and that many things happened on a humid and rainy day. This was how he felt when reading the novel. Accordingly, Cheng Ma felt that the images should be consistent with the 1990s, when the characters were wandering and out of place, and geographical features such as counties or towns were far away, not close. Cheng Ma suggested shooting on 16mm film, and they hit it off immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, with 45 days left before filming, the crew arrived in Nanfeng, Jiangxi Province, where the filming took place, to make preparations. The actors were busy with their own work. Tong Linkai had to practice splits and back fists. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket to visit the local police and gained 30 pounds to achieve an overworked figure. Zeng Meihuizi was also making herself gain weight in order to look like a pregnant woman. The crew cooked together, watched movies, and played badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think the best state of creation is when all the main creators are relaxed. I don’t like that kind of tense, night-and-night (state) like a repair project, which is very tiring. That is to say, although it is You are working, but you still have your own life order, and you still retain your pursuit of beauty and passion for life.&quot; Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often carries a film camera with him - the crew has a total of more than 20 film cameras, and even a darkroom for developing black and white photos - to capture the daily life of the crew. There are more saved in his mobile phone photo album. When he opens it and looks through it, he sees friends meeting, travel scenes, rivers, trees, and the sea. “It seems to have some kind of ability to preserve time, making you think of it as a pleasant time.” In the afternoon, a happy state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relaxation is rare. What is also rare is that, in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun places a particularly high importance on creation. &quot;As a director of his age, he can actually withstand a lot of pressure. We have to shoot smoothly, but many people ask us what to do with the scenes and what to do with the actors&#39; time. For example, a certain role has many scenes, but the actors can only come for 10 days in total. , the usual approach of the crew is to focus on filming all his scenes in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that smooth filming is of great value to his creation, so he will give up scenes that cannot be matched by actors or at inappropriate times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has an almost intuitive ability to control the scene. I always told him, you shine on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his character&#39;s name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s subordinate is Xiao Li, a young man who takes the initiative to report case analysis from time to time. So of course Tong Linkai’s name is Xiao Li. After a few days of filming, Wei Shujun suddenly said, thank you so much &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Thanks&quot; means shit)&lt;/span>;, don&#39;t call me Xiao Li. Just call me Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and revised his lines. The printed police officer ID card of Xiao Li was re-attached. Tong Linkai&#39;s role became Xiao Xie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to be honest, the feeling at the scene was not that wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;Imagine that when you were in school, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 a.m. every morning to study early. On the way from home after breakfast, you felt that you were still waking up. When you got to class, you thought about writing yesterday&#39;s homework. No, I didn’t write it, so I wrote it quickly. After I wrote it, I felt very at ease. I started to think about going to the canteen to buy something to eat during recess, and then I went to the actual class to listen to the teacher. It was the same on the set, everyone was here, Shui After brewing it, we started drinking water. We walked around the scene and the actors were almost done. Then we discussed the scene and confirmed our schedule with the photographer. Everyone prepared individually and then started to prepare for shooting. If something didn’t feel right in the first two days, Adjust it, and it feels good. If you take a few more shots, it will be time for lunch. It really feels like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a slope every day, and you have to climb up a slope. You have to crawl over to get to that position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; was completed accurately and efficiently, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the Cannes Film Festival. Five months later, it won two honors: Best Film and Cinephile Choice at the Pingyao International Film Festival. After another four days, it was released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, there was often chatter in the theater. Wei Shujun used a long dream to allow Ma Zhe to reveal himself in order to resolve his own uneasiness and chaos. The dream was clear, coherent but illogical. After witnessing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on an old cinema seat and saw the director on the big screen holding a ping pong ball with the number 3 printed on it, shouting at him. ——Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this shot where conjecture and prophecy overlap, thousands of ping pong balls roll down from the bottom of the screen and swarm towards Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone was very excited during the shooting. After taking one shot, everyone picked up the thousands of ping pong balls while shouting &quot;One more, another one&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the show, the audience was full of doubts and endless interpretations and comments about the film, forming multiple dreams outside the screen, a kind of &quot;rationality and irrationality, the combination of the viewer and the viewer.&quot; effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s initial uneasiness when reading the novel, his exploration of the creator&#39;s intentions, and his several elusive moments during the adaptation were all conveyed to the audience. We think we have the answer, but in fact we have the illusion of an answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not too obsessed with pursuing the truth in life, because I feel that it is difficult to find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun that the truth is difficult to find, &quot;the so-called The fate of your life is a random existence. You can only see its existence and don’t know the truth behind it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slight existentialist tendency of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is just that Back to &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, or in other words, &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;. Just reiterate one point, &quot;I believe that I &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(creator)&lt;/span>; has determined the sole right of interpretation, and the audience must accept this interpretation Right, this is the biggest paradox.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the movie was released, Wei Shujun sent a message to Yu Hua, saying that it seems that we did not use a movie to write annotations for the novel, but used the movie to write an annotation for the novel.读后感。 For a while, the two of them were keen to share with each other the audience&#39;s various interpretations of the movie, including a test paper on &quot;Who understands the movie &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; better, Yu Hua or me?&quot; After Yu Hua finished, he showed Wei Shujun his score, which totaled 40 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Zhang Yuxin for your help.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[不恋爱，搞事业，迪士尼又来了新公主]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261316]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1923, young Walt ·Disney came to Los Angeles and joined his brother Roy Disney.

As a tribute to the centenary, &quot;Star Wish&quot; certainly closely follows this theme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of the movie is set in a kingdom of wishes called Rosas. People come from all directions to offer their dreams to the magical King Manifico, and the king will choose the right person from them. Help them achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine Yasha’s biggest wish is that her grandfather’s dream comes true. However, when she came into contact with King Manifico, she realized that &lt;span>; the king was not as kind and generous as he appeared on the surface. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259601 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Manifico is an extreme conservative. He will only select dreams that he considers harmless to realize, while shelving creative dreams. He regarded such dreams as a scourge that would shake Rosas&#39;s foundations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course Asha disagrees with the king&#39;s point of view, so she joins forces with the wishing star and Valentino the goat to try to get her grandfather&#39;s dream back.

And &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;No matter what the situation, Asha was always loyal to her heart, &lt;/span>; and won more allies, and finally overthrew Manifico&#39;s rule. The dystopian nature of the movie is very un-Disney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your point of view, but I will defend to the death your right to speak.&quot; Putting it here is an excellent comment. Everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, and the king cannot deny it easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being good at creating dreams, Disney is also good at creating princesses. Since the release of Snow White (Disney&#39;s first animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) in 1937, Disney has followed the development of the times for more than 80 years and successively launched more than a dozen characters.

Later princesses have improved their initiative and self-awareness. For example, Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) sacrifices singing to walk on land in order to meet the man she loves; Ariel in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) Belle and the ugly beast have been in love for a long time; Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; refuses the king&#39;s offer Referring to marriage, falling in love with Aladdin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The princesses of this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; will take the initiative to fight for what they want, but&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Their goal in life is still to find true love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259603 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such &quot;progress&quot; was obviously not enough.

Starting from this&lt;/span>;movie, Disney princesses completely got rid of the male gaze. They took off their costumes and became their own heroes. Like the &lt;span>; princesses in &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) and &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; (2021), they all gave up on romance. One lived her life how she wanted, and the other led her people to protect their home and country. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259607 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;And this &quot;Star Wish&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is also of the same origin&lt;/span>;. Asha dares to question and is not afraid of power. In order to protect all the residents of Rosas He did not hesitate to stand on the opposite side of King Manifico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But compared with the previous princesses, Asha&#39;s combat effectiveness is obviously weakened. She no longer has the ability to go to heaven and earth. She is more like an ordinary person, a civilian hero who resists the aloof king. Just like the theme song of the movie sings, &quot;Maybe you are afraid but you still reach out your hand, and you will not run away because of a weak tremor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This may also be the century-old road that Disney has walked for itself.

Everyone has a story, attracting attention and extraordinary. But Yi Mengling&#39;s story obviously does not belong to this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How to define Yi Mengling, it seems to be a issue that the public is more interested in now. She is a model, a blogger, an Internet celebrity, and a newcomer to the film and television industry. And Yi Mengling is still making a lot of attempts and challenges, maybe the label and identity will be added in front of her name in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is widely known, which stems from Yi Mengling&#39;s unique styles and short videos. In a good aesthetic, makeup and dressing, coupled with the sun, smile, and eternal state, Yi Mengling won tens of millions of fans on social platforms. She did not actively define anything, but all kinds of labels followed, &quot;atmosphere&quot;, &quot;pure desire&quot; ... these labels or envy, or love, or unhappy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the day of the interview, the thin girl with too many eyes took the shooting scene on the second floor and greeted all the people who came all the way. During the shooting gap, she communicated with the photographer with technical issues, &quot;You have to believe me.&quot; When discussing some kind of lighting skills, she gave her suggestions sincerely, attracting the photographer Haha Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da laugh. When Yi Mengling has not eaten at noon, when the staff hurriedly handed in the take -out in the rest, she said, &quot;It&#39;s okay to put two cushions&quot; and &quot;Ready to call me at any time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This may be what Yi Mengling looks more real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For a long time, some people imitated her, some disdain her, and more and more discussions about her, but Yi Mengling almost did not fight with netizens. fragment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She also occasionally respond to some controversial discussions. For example, &quot;big mouth&quot;, it brings iconic smiles, and also brings ridicule. Yi Mengling&#39;s response is more self -accepting and thanking this for making itself characteristic in the model field. For example, the first experience of recording acting variety shows, netizens have compared her with female stars because of acting skills and looks, and more about the &quot;Internet celebrity should not enter the entertainment industry&quot;. But in Yi Mengling&#39;s view, she regards the world as a big playground and is an experienced player. Trying different things and challenging different things requires courage, but the process of challenging is cool, and she chooses to challenge her. &quot;No matter what the result is, it is experience. I think it is worth it.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Everyone likes Yi Mengling. In addition to her beauty, she also likes her character that she is not surprised. Many times, she is trying to alleviate some anxiety and output some positive energy. For example, Su Yan appeared in the photo, shared the tips behind her to take pictures, and sent a small belly photo with meat after meals, making everyone feel that the beauty is not a statue, but a living person. Similarly, such behaviors will still cause dissatisfaction. Some people think that this is deliberate, or in the &quot;concave ground.&quot; Regardless of the remarks, Yi Mengling collected the order in the order. In her opinion, she has no taboos. As a public figure, it is essential to face comments. Many of them are very exaggerated, and they just over after watching. Yi Mengling said: &quot;Try not to fall into the strange circle of self -evidence. After all, the explanation is never endless.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; She is an amateur and possesses a place with her own advantages on the Internet.

At the press conference of the State Medical Insurance Bureau on November 24, 2023, Fu Chaoqi, deputy director of the Office of the State Medical Insurance Bureau, provided the above data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Chaoqi pointed out that from the activation of the provinces of the medical insurance code, Zhejiang and Qinghai provinces have taken the lead in achieving coverage of insured in the province, and the activation rate of more than half of the provinces of more than half of the provinces exceeds 75%. Data from Tencent Health Calculation shows that for an ordinary insured person, he can make an appointment through the WeChat public account before seeing a doctor, and use the medical insurance code to complete online medical insurance payment during settlement, saving an average of 43 minutes for each patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Breaking the barriers, use the entire process of medical purchase of medicines &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Purchase medicines at hospitals and pharmacies, and the mobile phone &quot;bright code&quot; can be traced back to four years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 24, 2019, the first medical insurance code (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Medical Insurance Electronic Volume &lt;/span>;) Provincial Jinan City activation. At that time, the National Medical Insurance Administration hoped that the medical insurance code would not only be simply electronic, but also realize the vision of &quot;seeing a doctor without a card, only using the medical insurance code&quot;. The standards would be unified across the country, mutually recognized across regions, and all procedures could be done with an electronic voucher. All medical insurance business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Four years later, these visions not only gradually landed, but also made new attempts. Take Zhejiang Province as an example. In the past, there were 54 medical insurance systems in Zhejiang, which were separated from each other and not shared with each other. Until March 2022, Zhejiang Province’s “Smart Medical Insurance” system will be fully connected to the national medical insurance platform, realizing the unified medical insurance settlement in Zhejiang Province. system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Cao Cen, deputy director of the Zhejiang Medical Insurance Bureau, introduced that all designated medical institutions in Zhejiang have transformed the HIS (hospital information management system) to support the use of medical insurance code throughout the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, in Zhejiang Provincial Hospital, from registered, medical, payment, inspection tests, printing reports, to obtaining drugs, hospitalization and medical insurance settlement, it can be completed as long as the code scan the code; , Medical Insurance Code support prescription circulation, purchase of drugs and medicine, medical insurance settlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The medical insurance code also opened up the barriers outside the hospital. Zhejiang Jinhua City Central Hospital mentioned in a paper that the electronic prescription circulation through the application of medical insurance codes can choose &quot;dual channels&quot; by themselves (through the two channels of fixed -point medical institutions and fixed retail pharmacies, to meet the conditions for synchronization of conditions and include medical insurance payment ) Purchase prescription drugs for fixed -point retail pharmacies to enjoy the same reimbursement treatment as the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The service scenario changes from the&quot; single point &#39;to&#39;. &quot;Xie Zhangyi, deputy director of the State Medical Insurance Bureau&#39;s Financial Regulations Department, said that the entire process of medical insurance codes is the key work of the medical insurance department in 2023 One is to promote the use of medical insurance codes from the entire process of reservation registration, sign -in, diagnosis and treatment, report inquiry, pharmacies and drugs in reservation registration, sign -in, diagnosis and treatment examination, report inquiry, and pharmacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Family favors, so that the elderly and children are convenient. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; The hospital is mostly the elderly. It is particularly important how fashionable technology takes into account the needs of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A paper from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital mentioned that the average age of medical insurance patients in Hangzhou in 2021 is 55 years, of which about 40%of them are 60 and over. &quot;On the one hand, elderly patients are intelligent. The use of mobile phones is low; on the other hand, compared with young people, the proficiency and fluency of elderly patients using smartphones are poor. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In terms of aginging transformation, the WeChat medical insurance code has been launched on the barrier -free version, supporting the visually impaired people to use the medical code through voice, and at the same time launch a family account service in many provinces, apply face recognition and other technologies to support relatives to support relatives Agent business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qiu Yunqing told the southern weekend reporter that most of the elderly have family members to accompany them. Through the function of medical insurance family account function, the family members who accompany the companion can bind the medical insurance code of the elderly to their accounts to facilitate the appointment and payment for the elderly for the elderly cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, according to the medical insurance policy in Zhejiang and other places, the personal account of insurance participants has passed the &quot;family support filing&quot; in the years, which can be used to directly pay the spouse of the same medical insurance to participate in the basic medical insurance. The medical insurance cost of children and parents. For example, young people&#39;s personal accounts cannot be used, they can be used for parents, &quot;(&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti; &quot;>; Parent &lt;/span>; The medical insurance sent a text message. What medicine and how much money was prescribed, it was also very convenient after binding. You can pay with your own account money. &quot;Qiu Yunqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We also pay attention to the needs of medical insurance services that are more difficult to use in intelligent technologies such as the elderly, minors, etc., effectively integrate traditional services with intelligent methods, and launch family accounts, medical treatment on different places, etc. Function, and adding offline activities of the medical insurance code in the medical insurance agency, helping special groups to obtain and enjoying the medical insurance services, and improving the accessibility of medical insurance convenience services. &quot;Xie Zhangyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Be wary of the use of medical insurance codes to ensure the safety of medical insurance funds &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; However, while the medical insurance code is convenient, how to ensure the safety of the medical insurance fund also brings challenges to all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Guangzhou Medical Insurance Service Center pointed out in a paper that there is no related photo information for medical insurance electronic vouchers. Regulatory work brings difficulty and challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September 2023, the Putian police detected a case that used medical insurance codes. After the villagers died, their relatives used medical insurance codes to seek medical reimbursement and cheated 1232.73 yuan for medical insurance funds. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Junjie, general manager of Alipay Medical and Health Division, said that the system will analyze multi -factor security technical analysis of information such as the use habits of the insured, account change and other information. Once abnormalities are found, immediately report the medical insurance bureau and start the risk control system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2023, the State Medical Insurance Bureau issued the &quot;Two -Combination of Three Supplements&quot; Work Plan &quot;of the National Medical Insurance Bureau, requiring medical insurance data to be connected vertically and horizontally to achieve comprehensive supervision of the medical insurance fund. The National Medical Insurance Administration also requires that all coordinating regions will launch an intelligent supervision subsystem by the end of 2023. By the end of 2025, an intelligent audit and electronic monitoring system will be basically established, and the &quot;medical insurance code&quot; will be used to allow users, medical institutions, insurance handling units, and pharmaceutical and device companies to The data are closely connected to form a normalized supervision system that handles daily audits and on-site inspections, big data analysis, full-scenario intelligent monitoring and other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the medical insurance code users broke 1 billion, the National Medical Insurance Bureau was also promoting the service function of the medical insurance code from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;easy to use&quot;. &quot;Currently, the public&#39;s demand for medical insurance services is multi-layered, diversified, and personalized. Based on the actual needs of the people, the medical insurance department has launched a number of &#39;Internet + medical insurance services&#39; that are easy to use and popular with the public, such as online inquiries Medical consultation, one-click prescription refill, follow-up prescription dispensing, online settlement, home delivery of medicine, etc., to better meet the people&#39;s needs for medical treatment and medicine purchase.&quot; said Xie Zhangshu, deputy director of the Department of Regulation, Finance and Law of the National Medical Insurance Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Xi Lijie also contributed) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
