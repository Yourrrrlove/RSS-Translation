(Chengdu Business Daily/Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 5-day 81st World Science Fiction Convention was held in a city that has not changed its name for more than 2,000 years - —Chengdu&lt;span>;——&lt;/span>; has come to an end. This is the first time that China has held such a science fiction event. In October 2023, more than 20,000 science fiction fans and more than 1,200 guests from 35 countries and regions around the world gathered in Chengdu to talk about the future in this modern city with a long history. Imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the conference, 27-year-old science fiction writer Bai Ben stayed in a hotel in Pidu District. On the 19th floor of the hotel, through the window, he saw a shopping mall not far away, which happened to be the one he participated in the design and construction of when he was a real estate company at his former employer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bai Bi could not describe his feelings for a moment: it was a sense of time and space intertwined in Chengdu, where the past and present, ideals and reality merged. He just came to Chengdu in 2021 and worked as a designer in a real estate company. After 9 months, he was too busy to &lt;span>;home&lt;/span>;; but it was also in Chengdu that he got closer and closer to his science fiction dream, and he successively won several projects in China The Science Fiction Galaxy Award for Best Newcomer and the Chinese Science Fiction Nebula Award for Best Short Story Silver Award. Now, he also has his own book signings at science fiction conventions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As one of the millions of young people &quot;floating in Chengdu&quot;, Bai Bi from Jiangsu has a reason to stay in Chengdu. At present, he is mainly engaged in the Internet industry and works part-time in science fiction writing. There are few cities that can simultaneously host good Internet companies, embrace the vision of building a science fiction industry, and also create a comfortable, livable and smoky urban atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu attracts Bai Ben, and young people like Bai Ben also attract Chengdu. For years, this rapidly rising megacity in the Midwest has struggled to recruit and retain young talents. I don’t know who was the first to say the words, “After Chengdu, there will be no more wandering.” This has become the essence of Chengdu’s talent work branding and the pursuit of the city’s builders. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Beside Xinglong Lake, look up and meet the doctor&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After five years, I faced the computer screen with a picture of Aba, Sichuan Province in 2018 Huang Ying is still quite moved by the high-altitude aerial view of Aerzhai, Wenchuan County, Prefecture. That year, a landslide suddenly hit Aerzhai. Half of the village collapsed &lt;span>; and half of it was buried. Fortunately, no one died. The geological disaster monitoring and early warning platform developed by Sichuan Zhongke Chuanxin Technology Co., Ltd. played a role. Villagers moved in advance and escaped this natural disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying is now the deputy general manager of this company. However, going back to 6 years ago, Huang Ying was still confused on the eve of changing careers. At that time, the 24-year-old was working in a survey and design institute in a province in Central and South China. The industry was gradually declining. A colleague asked: &quot;Should we transform into high technology?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Huang Ying is somewhat tempted, but where to settle is a problem. He thought of Chengdu, where he spent four years in college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, major cities across the country have increased their efforts to attract young talents. Chengdu also needs more young people to participate in urban development and construction. Li Rong, a talent worker in Chengdu, told Southern Weekend reporters that Chengdu has launched version 1.0 of its new talent policy around the idea of ​​“gathering people to prosper the city”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Settlement first and then employment&quot; is a policy initiative that has led to a nationwide trend of settling down and attracting talents. &quot;Those under 45 years old and with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above can directly settle in Chengdu with their graduation certificate.&quot; Li Rong said that in the past six years, Chengdu has attracted more than 710,000 college students to settle down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying took a fancy to the convenience of settling down and joined the trend of &quot;Peacock Flying Southwest&quot;. He and his partners founded a company in Chengdu High-tech Zone, focusing on geological disasters and Environmental disaster prevention and reduction platform construction and product research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Everything is difficult at the beginning. Huang Ying&#39;s new company encountered obstacles in financing, human resources, sales and other aspects. Initially, he traveled to almost every county in western and southern Sichuan to introduce himself to the local land and resources departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu gave him a hand. Huang Ying remembers that when the company first settled in Chengdu High-tech Zone, the government provided policy support of halving office rents. At the end of 2017, the company sold the first batch of prototypes to a county in western Sichuan. Half a year later, the machine successfully warned of landslides twice, and since then it has gradually opened up the market in southwest China. However, government assistance has not stopped. Three years after the epidemic, the company has also received financial subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying said that currently, the company has applied its equipment and platforms to water conservancy dams, mine safety, foundation pit support, transportation, etc., and has Go nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying’s career is developing, and Chengdu’s talent policy is also iterating. In 2020, Chengdu launched the New Talent Policy Version 2.0 around the construction of the Western Science City, focused on technological innovation, launched and implemented Tianfu Laboratory&#39;s global high-end talent recruitment plan, created Chengdu&#39;s characteristic professional group, and supported high-level platforms to open to the society. In 2022, The Chengdu Innovation Index ranks 29th in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years have passed, and there are many scientific research institutions in the Chengdu Science City located in Tianfu New District, Sichuan. Liu Hongyan, a 34-year-old assistant researcher at the Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, joked, “If you walk around Xinglong Lake, you might just look up and meet a doctor.” In 2019, she came to the institute as a postdoctoral fellow to work on functional Food development and other work, becoming a member of Xinglong Lakeside&#39;s army of doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shi Jian, the 36-year-old assistant director of the DC Research Institute of Tsinghua Sichuan Energy Internet Research Institute, is also a Ph.D. from Xinglong Lakeside. Looking back on his two years in Chengdu, he felt that he had achieved what he had hoped for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shi Jian is pursuing the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. He once worked for 7 years in a research institute affiliated to a state-owned enterprise in a southeastern province, focusing on research on ultra-high voltage DC engineering and new energy power generation. He has always been troubled by the fact that the cycle of transferring scientific research to application is too long. After arriving in Tianfu New District, Sichuan, he was able to flex his muscles. Right now, the Shijian team is developing the most critical projects in the power industry such as series of power equipment and power chips for DC projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 22, 2023, Peking University Qiu Deba Gymnasium, the scene of the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; Peking University special event.

(Talent Office of Chengdu Municipal Party Committee/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why did the six million &quot;Rong Piao&quot; come&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of October 2023, a group of students from Tsinghua University At a job fair, a doctor of medicine expressed mutual interest in a state-owned enterprise in Wenjiang District, Chengdu. State-owned enterprises do not &quot;go round and round to make appointments&quot;. Instead, the person in charge directly reads the resume, interviews, and talks about job content, remuneration and benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a scene from the Beijing special event of the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; series of events. Li Rong introduced that as the most important series of talent recruitment activities in Chengdu in recent years, the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; has held more than 1,000 talent recruitment activities in key cities at home and abroad, and signed more than 200,000 contracts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, Chengdu has focused on leading the city’s talent work with branding strategies. &amp;nbsp;The slogan &quot;Rongpiao&quot; has been shouted out, but there has been some controversy in society as to whether the talent brand should continue to use this name. After all, like Beipiao and Shanghai Piao, there is still the word &quot;piao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Chengdu has been a typical immigrant city since ancient times, with cultural characteristics of openness, tolerance, generosity and friendliness. According to talent workers in Chengdu, the genetic inheritance and cultural core of &quot;Rongpiao&quot; have long been rooted in the urban development trajectory, and have become Chengdu&#39;s endless driving force, changing the original meaning of &quot;piao&quot; and enriching the meaning of &quot;piao&quot;. &quot;Connotation. Chengdu respects every individual&#39;s dream, cherishes every upward force, and uses the greatest sincerity to help &quot;Rongpiao&quot; realize their personal value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has fully launched the practice of talent work branding strategy, creating a deeply rooted &quot;Rongpiao&quot; brand, and is also the first country in the country to apply for trademark registration The city&#39;s talent work brand has created a series of flagship products and a series of derivatives, such as the &quot;Rongpiao Plan&quot; to attract talents, the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; to recruit talents, the &quot;Rongpiao Cup&quot; to gather talents, and the &quot;Rongpiao Cup&quot; to educate talents. Talent Development Institute”, Jingcai’s “Rongpiao Talent Day”, Licai’s “Rongcheng Talent Green Card”, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has been exploring ways to solve practical difficulties for young college students who have just entered society. &quot;Thinking about it from a talent perspective, what does a newly graduated college student lack when going to a city to find a job? It must be a place to live.&quot; Li Rong said that based on this idea, Chengdu has created 26 &quot;Rongpiao&quot; cities in recent years. &quot;Youth Talent Station&quot; provides short-term free accommodation for fresh graduates who come to Chengdu to find jobs, as well as a series of value-added services such as employment guidance and urban integration. &quot;As long as they hold the interview notice and pass the online application, young college students can stay in the apartment for free for up to one month.&quot; So far, more than 80,000 young college students have been accommodated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that in the past, when enterprises and institutions in Chengdu went to first-tier cities and well-known universities to recruit, the results were not good because they worked alone and lacked visibility. not good. Later, they changed their approach and maximized the effectiveness of talent introduction by building a collaborative talent introduction model of &quot;government guidance, employer leadership, and broad social participation&quot; to unify publicity themes, unified promotion processes, and unified logos and slogans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking this year&#39;s &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; Tsinghua University and Peking University as an example, Chengdu mobilized 26 public institutions and 16 municipal state-owned enterprises to come up with For high-quality positions, university research institutes and Fortune 500 companies are invited to participate in recruitment. According to statistics, this event released 782 recruitment positions and attracted more than 1,800 young college students to participate. The activity includes city promotion, opportunity list release, job promotion, doctoral and postdoctoral policy promotion, etc. Each recruitment unit &quot;can add their own creativity&quot; and set up stalls to recruit talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruiting young talents is only the first step. In order to retain talents, Chengdu also spent real money. From the city level to the district (city) and county level, there are a series of talent project applications and talent level assessments. Liu Hongyan recalled that after she achieved certain scientific research results, she was evaluated as a senior talent category C in the &quot;Tianfu Talent Plan&quot; of Sichuan Tianfu New District in 2022. The new district will provide a subsidy of 500,000 yuan within five years. The following year, she applied for scientific research funds from the Chengdu Agricultural Science and Technology Talent Cultivation Program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Right now, a laboratory in the institute is filled with freeze-dried fruit and vegetable solid drinks developed by Liu Hongyan’s team, and a whitening and moisturizing set containing phloretin. and other technological transformation achievements. This Inner Mongolian native has bought a house and settled in Chengdu. &quot;Currently, Chengdu is the city that best coordinates my work and life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Chengdu Youth Development Report (2022)&quot; released by the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Chengdu New Economic Development Research Institute shows that the population of &quot;Rongpiao&quot; reaches 6.8349 million. Among them, the proportion of young people from outside Sichuan Province is 21.85%, and the proportion of young people from &quot;Rongpiao&quot; who come from outside the province is 32.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rongpiao Youth Talent Station, Jinjiang District, Chengdu.

He is just an ordinary person who loves life. In Chengdu, he felt another attraction of this city for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;30-year-old Hu Peng is from Leshan, Sichuan. He works as a tour guide in Chengdu, taking tourists to appreciate the different flavors of the city, including city gates, city walls, streets, and museums. , listen to historical stories and observe the lifestyle of local residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He developed two niche routes, one from Shaocheng in the west of the city to Fuqin, and the other from Xiner Village in the north of the city to Caojia Lane. In Fuqin, he had seen a cup of tea costing 3 yuan, and a bowl of noodles costing 89 yuan. The old man went out to eat noodles and drink tea in the morning, and sat there all day, feeling relaxed and happy. In Xiner Village, &quot;the size of the community is the size of the market.&quot; The market men and women lingered in the market in the morning, and he felt a vibrant beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Young people can always find the livable side of Chengdu. Science fiction writer Huo Zhongwu came to Chengdu in 2005 to study at university and settled here after graduation. He enjoys the pleasant cost of living here. Similarly, renting an apartment near the city center is about a quarter of that in Shanghai. A &quot;Rongpiao&quot; young man admitted to Southern Weekend reporters that one of the important reasons why he came to Chengdu to work three years ago was that Chengdu&#39;s housing prices are extremely cost-effective among provincial capital cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Have fun&quot; is a business card of Chengdu. Huo Zhongwu’s observation is that life in Chengdu is much slower than in first-tier cities, and there are always people in the teahouses and cafes on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bai Ben was deeply impressed by a salon at the World Science Fiction Convention. A writer mentioned that he had seen a netizen post asking: It will be rare to have sunny weather in Chengdu tomorrow. Does anyone want to go to a high-rise building to watch the snow-capped mountains together? The writer went to the roof before dawn the next day, and there were already many people rubbing their hands and waiting. “This kind of thing is hard to imagine in other cities,” Bai Ben said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has also captured the needs of talents for urban environment and quality of life. In 2022, Chengdu will launch the &quot;Talent New Deal 3.0&quot; version with excellent platforms and ecological management, attracting more young talents to take the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When the water accumulates, fish gather&lt;span>;, and when trees grow thicker, birds gather.&quot; The relevant person in charge of the Talent Office of Chengdu Municipal Party Committee introduced that Chengdu has been We strive to protect the value attribution of talents with the highest quality services and create a value ecosystem where everyone is seen, respected and cared for. What can be proved is that Chengdu has been ranked first in &quot;China&#39;s happiest city&quot; for 14 consecutive years, ranked first in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#39;s &quot;Attractive Cities for College Students and Young Job Seekers&quot;, and won &quot;China&#39;s Best Talent Attracting City&quot; for 4 consecutive years. &quot;prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Talent work is ultimately inseparable from improving the quality of the city.&quot; For example, in order to cater to young people&#39;s fun-loving and quality-of-life mentality, Chengdu continues to optimize its environment , a 100-kilometer first-level greenway of the Ring Ecological Park has been built inside and outside the city ring expressway, with billowing green wheat fields, lush grassland, and swaying woods; while building a park city, Chengdu has opened up a large number of wetlands and green spaces As a camping site, &quot;everyone goes camping and basking in the sun on weekends&quot;, creating a new picture of urban life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 3, 2023, a unique &quot;underwater bookstore&quot; next to Xinglong Lake, a famous internet celebrity check-in place in Chengdu.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Resonance among young people&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu’s life scene that attracts young people also includes abundant public spaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The streets and alleys here hide &lt;span>;three&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;thousand&lt;/span>; more than one bookstore, far more than any other city in the country. It is difficult to count the number of public activities that are closely connected to it - reading clubs, movie viewing parties, script screenings, and sharing by scholars and experts. Some active spaces can host hundreds of events a year. The event was small in scale, with only twenty or thirty people at most, but it provided an opportunity for connection and resonance for countless young people eager to express, share, and see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Around 2015, Wang Miaomiao worked as an account manager for a brand company in Chengdu. At that time, she fell into depression for a time due to family reasons. She began to participate in a large number of offline public activities and spent three or four nights a week in various sharing sessions. Although most of the time, she couldn&#39;t understand what the sharer was saying, she liked the friendly and warm atmosphere, which allowed her to temporarily escape the pain in her life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Product manager Di Hao came to Chengdu to work in 2016. At the beginning, he couldn&#39;t find anyone he could play with, whether at work or in life. A year later, he saw the activities of the Toastmasters Club in the same city on Douban and tried to participate. Since then, he has been hooked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He has vivid memories of many activities. During the reading party, they read Tolstoy to understand human greed; after the movie viewing party, someone explained Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave. Once, scholar Wang Di came to a tavern in the suburbs of Chengdu to share. More than a hundred people came and &lt;span>;Wang Di&lt;/span>; talked until midnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Di Hao felt that the young friends who participated in the event gave him a sense of belonging. These activities also opened up a new world for Di Hao. In the past, when facing big figures, he had a sense of order based on distinction between superiority and inferiority. The egalitarian atmosphere of public activities gradually made him accustomed to dealing with others as an equal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After 2018, Hu Peng also often went to Chengdu to participate in public events. In his early years, he met a Polish man and a British man at a sharing meeting. They worked for a few months a year, teaching English and doing project planning, and the rest of the time was spent traveling around. This way of life surprised him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hu Peng prides himself on being a young man from a small town, having graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree. Many people in his hometown have nothing to do in their spare time except playing cards. These activities made him realize that there was another possibility in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Also in 2018, Wang Miaomiao, who has participated in numerous public activities, became the director of Xunlu Library. This is a community library, but it aspires to become a &quot;humanistic beacon&quot;. Wang Miaomiao discovered that people lacked general education, so he invited professors from Sichuan University to come to the library to teach general education courses about Du Fu and visual culture. She listened to lawyer Zhang Ying&#39;s &quot;Bright Dialogue&quot; series of public debates and thought it was good, and invited Zhang Ying to the library for a discussion on psychology. Some participants said that these discussions responded to the rising enthusiasm for psychology since the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Miaomiao feels that these public lives have reshaped her life. She likes to study people and society, and is curious about where strong vitality is born, and the sharers &lt;span>;also&lt;/span>; responded to her questions in their own ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, she will become busier. Offline activities in Chengdu are very prosperous. In addition to creating more in-depth public activity content, she also needs to run a &quot;reclamation community&quot; that unites participants with reading as the core. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this corner of the southwest, public space is so prosperous, and Hu Peng connects it with the characteristics of the city. Chengdu has a tradition of chatting in teahouses and cafes. In addition, perhaps many busy young people are heading to first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The young people who come to Chengdu are more pursuing spiritual enrichment and yearning for a better life.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ji Ying will appear at the Jinsha Heritage Museum every Thursday morning. She is a volunteer guide here. Usually, after gathering seven or eight tourists, the team sets off. Along the way, there will be more and more listeners behind the red volunteer uniforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This 51-year-old Chengdu native was originally a manager of a foreign company. He traveled around the southwest and was busy and exhausted from work. After a serious illness, the doctor warned &quot;not to be too tired from now on&quot;, so the museum at home became a new choice. The company organized groups to come and listen to it several times. They were surprised by the colleague in front of them who talked about the ancient Shu civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 3.6 million people like her with dual identities in Chengdu. Zhang Zimeng, a student at Sichuan Conservatory of Music, is a volunteer in the &quot;Song is the Sweetest Medicine&quot; project. She goes to the hospital every week to serve as a vocal teacher for fifty or sixty &quot;Teletubbies&quot; suffering from severe spinal deformity; 37-year-old Express Member Tang Jian is the captain of the &quot;Maverick Pioneer Drivers&quot; volunteer service team. His team is a &quot;mobile probe&quot; that walks through the streets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are volunteer service stories that happen every day in every corner of Chengdu. Wei Na, the relevant person in charge of the Volunteer Service Department of the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee, told Southern Weekend reporters that they have built a volunteer service platform &quot;Civilized Xingrong&quot; to use information technology to record all volunteer service information. Since the entire platform is in operation, there are nearly 40,000 registered volunteer teams in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chengdu is becoming a model city of &quot;City of Volunteers&quot;. Wei Na feels that this is a &quot;process of gathering glimmers of light&quot;: &quot;Looking at them separately, they are all small and microscopic, but together they are dedicated to the governance of the city and its happiness.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;“It’s so troublesome to be a volunteer”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is Ji Ying’s sixth year as a volunteer at the Jinsha Heritage Museum. “Without a strong belief, there is no way to persevere.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 60 volunteers in the museum, and the recruitment assessment of Ji Ying’s explanation team is recognized as strict. This &quot;novice on historical knowledge&quot; stumbled all the way. He passed the group interview, completed the first round of the relics museum&#39;s interpretation test, passed the written test, and passed the entire museum&#39;s interpretation interview, becoming a trainee volunteer. The entire assessment process lasted nearly seven months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first lesson of the volunteer training is to visit the museum, and the second lesson is to learn the team rules and regulations. The service hours are required to reach 120 hours per year, and in principle, they must come once a week. Ma Nong, a volunteer in the service group, was not used to it when he first arrived: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect that being a volunteer would be so troublesome, but it is so strict.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id =&quot;73774&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70565&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/0bf8bd712f.jpg&quot; img-title =&quot;ffa8c2a263ca7831b29090f0159f916.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteers in red uniforms are explaining to tourists at the Jinsha Heritage Museum.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who manages this volunteer team is Lu Lu, a staff member of the museum’s Department of Public Service and Social Education. &quot;We often call her King Lu or Little Leather Whip.&quot; Manong joked, &quot;King Lu&quot; is very strict. If you don&#39;t bring a work permit, you won&#39;t be allowed in, and the service time will not be counted. As time went by, she discovered that this strict compliance with the rules was equivalent to blocking out &quot;those who were not determined&quot;, leaving only those who really wanted to be volunteers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Lu told Southern Weekend reporters that she &quot;stated the rules and regulations upfront&quot; in the hope of conducting a double selection with volunteers. &quot;Without management, there is no cohesion. If you can accept it, we will happily work together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cohesion of the team is not only reflected in the system. Lu Lu will try her best to remember each volunteer’s birthday and lead everyone in the group to send blessings. At the end-of-year commendation meeting, she will contact the departments the volunteers have worked with and request them to issue certificates of honor to express respect and gratitude to the volunteers. &quot;Volunteer partners are not here for material things, so I hope to satisfy them in other ways that they are respected and needed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For museums with limited manpower, volunteers are important supplementary strength. Lu Lu mentioned that the museum has more than 30 docents, and during winter and summer vacations and popular holidays, the supply far exceeds demand, and volunteers can fill the seats. They announced the designated time for volunteers to give lectures, three in the morning and one in the afternoon, &quot;which can alleviate the demand to a great extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The English translation volunteers in the translation team have a &quot;full schedule&quot; of work. The museum had tried a translation company, but it involved archaeological terminology and was more difficult. Instead, the museum&#39;s volunteer translation team was more competent - they had all passed CET-8 in English, and their academic qualifications were basically at least a master&#39;s degree. &quot;We have a lot of professional training, including the curator who will explain to us the excavation and historical origin of cultural relics, and we all understand them very clearly,&quot; said Lei Lei, the head of the translation team. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Overall scheduling from city to district&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the aforementioned &quot;Civilized Rong&quot; platform, there are an average of more than 500 various activities like this every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first intelligent platform in the country to fully support the practice of civilization and the development of volunteer service activities in the new era. It is understood that this smart platform can realize the complete record of volunteer service information. At the same time, it is also an important reference for award evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of the Chengdu Volunteer Network, who is responsible for managing the platform, said that volunteer service activities in all districts and counties in Chengdu can be seen on the platform. “Its biggest function is to facilitate citizens to find activities and sign up to participate. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, there have been particularly many ecological and environmental protection activities on the platform. Liu Yi told Southern Weekend reporters that during the National Day holiday, the Chengdu Municipal Civilization Office linked 14 volunteer service stations on the greenway around the city to carry out cycling check-in activities. Chengdu’s city-ring greenway is a holy place for cycling enthusiasts, with a total length of 100 kilometers. &quot;The needs of citizens prompted us to extend civilized practices and volunteer services to the greenway scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 14 stations cooperate with each other and each has its own actions. Zhang Ying, chief of the Creation and Volunteer Service Section of the Propaganda Department of the Wenjiang District Party Committee, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at that time, she was most worried about not attracting citizens to stop. The organizer put together the civilized blind box of the station into a map of China. Cyclists passing by would always stop and ask questions, which was very eye-catching. “Every day, our check-in points are crowded with people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the projects in the Jinsha Site Museum, this is a network of volunteer activities woven by government departments at all levels in Chengdu. An event lasting several days requires the cooperation of multiple departments. In the greenway station activities, civilized units at all levels play the main role, guiding and coordinating social organizations to participate in the assistance, and civilized units at the provincial, municipal, and district levels pair up to jointly build greenways. In the Wenjiang section of the Ring Greenway alone, the participating departments include the Wenjiang District Health Bureau, the District Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, and the District Education Bureau, with a total of more than 100 people from at least 12 units and enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The specific activities of the greenway station every day are also carried out by the responsible unit. Zhang Ying gave an example. The district health bureau is responsible for free TCM clinics, which provide health consultation services to citizens, teach first aid knowledge, and deal with sudden accidents such as cycling injuries and hiking sprains. The Wenjiang District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital also dispatched medical team volunteers. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Zhang Ying, it is not difficult to connect various departments to participate in volunteer activities. The entire event is coordinated by the New Era Civilization Practice Center, and the district party secretary serves as the director of the center to implement the work. Before the start of a large-scale event, the Civilized Practice Center will hold a scheduling meeting, and all departments that need to cooperate with the event must attend the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to her, Wenjiang District is among the first batch of new era civilized practice center pilot projects in the province and the second batch in the country. A district-level center, nine towns and sub-districts, and 95 villages and communities have jointly built a three-level position where the Civilized Practice Center is located. It also has 8 professional volunteer service standing teams and multiple special volunteer service teams. “When we need it When the time comes, we can coordinate.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our volunteer service model in Chengdu is well coordinated from top to bottom. The civilized practice centers in each district and county have standardized systems, activities and organizational structures, which can promote this kind of service very well. Civilized practices and volunteer service activities are carried out on a regular basis.&quot; Zhang Ying concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73771&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70562&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/69306910a6.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;839b8378c9c405b613355b1a9cb0de4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wenjiang District carries out activities at the Greenway Station during the National Day in 2023.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Volunteer service in &quot;Taobao Mall&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Establishing a points feedback incentive mechanism is an important part of building a city of volunteers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Volunteer time exchange for points and services, and related selection and recognition are common options for each project, and it is a top-down design. The &quot;Chengdu Volunteer Service Incentive Measures (Trial)&quot; launched by Chengdu City in 2019 is the country&#39;s first systematic volunteer service incentive system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the framers wanted to link education, employment, settlement, etc. with volunteer services. Wei Na admitted that there are difficulties at the practical level, such as extra points for employment interviews or public examinations. Due to the lack of upper-level system support, it is difficult to clearly correlate volunteer service experience with the degree of extra points, and the basis is also difficult to quantify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are some areas where quantitative bonus points can be gained. For example, in the residence permit point statistics, volunteer service is worth 10 points. &quot;The previous policy was to add 100 points to get a household registration, and to participate in volunteer services, you can add 10 points. The points are still very impressive.&quot; She added that the Municipal Civilization Office has a dedicated person responsible for the points recognition of volunteer services, which has been changed to Normal operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, volunteer service is closely related to the comprehensive quality evaluation of primary and secondary school students in Chengdu. If you participate in the &quot;Civilized Rong&quot; volunteer project, the platform will automatically generate an official certificate, which will be used as a reference for school evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the &quot;Civilized Xingrong&quot; platform, volunteers can exchange points for corresponding rights and interests. Liu Yi nicknamed it the &quot;Taobao&quot; of volunteer service. The online points mall can be redeemed for items, training and services. Some communities will also upload incentive items, such as a pack of washing powder, a bag of rice, or a haircut card at the doorstep. &quot;We are actually using the concept of crowdfunding to provide courtesy and help for volunteer services.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Niushikou Street, which gave birth to the &quot;Maverick Pioneer Drivers&quot; volunteer service team, has created its own points incentive system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jie, a staff member of the Party and Mass Affairs Office of Niushikou Street, said that one point is equal to one yuan, which can be exchanged for mobile phone holders, ponchos, power banks and other items in the points mall, or you can choose coupons donated by caring companies. . The most popular redemption items are Hongqi supermarket chain cash coupons, which can be used directly for consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For volunteers at the Sands Site Museum, the biggest feedback incentive is invisible. The suggestions they make always get the support of the museum: invite sanitation workers to enter the museum, accompany nearly a hundred visually impaired friends to visit, and walk into the community with the story of &quot;Sun God Bird&quot; ... It has become the representative project of the museum volunteer event, which makes volunteers quite proud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 导 导 导 导 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;is also born under such autonomy. In the show, the &quot;Golden Sands&quot; will use Chengdu to explain the ancient Shu civilization and Tianfu culture in the 31st World University Student Games. &quot;We hope to let more people understand Chengdu deeper through this program.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The seeds buried in 2008 &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Weina found that the soil was already thick, and volunteer activities gradually became a lifestyle for Chengdu people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the National Day holiday in 2023, a staff member of the Volunteer Services Department took his son to Ride Ringhuang Road to ride. When they arrived at Jiaozi Baiye Road in Wuhou District, they saw that volunteers were busy. The 16 -year -old son stopped, registered on the spot, and made two hours of volunteers at the station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Her parents have also spontaneously joined the community elderly volunteer association. Various volunteer services are often released in the association group. Father will participate in chorus programs to celebrate the festival for residents; the mother will participate in the river tour every week to take a walk with friends of the same unit to see if there is a problem of fishing for fishing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ten years ago, the two elderly people came to this strange city to help bring their children. By participating in the community volunteer service activities, they met the elderly around the surrounding people and had their own social circle. At present, the house of his hometown has been sold and chose to settle in Chengdu. She said, &quot;Because they love the city very much, they are also very active in community activities after settlement. They are really super backbones.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In Weina&#39;s view, the bones of Chengdu have a strong one in the bones of the people of Chengdu. Feelings of public welfare: &quot;In 2008, the earthquake could actually be called the first year of Chengdu volunteer service. At that time, we were where the disaster occurred, there were NGOs from the world, and many volunteers to help us.&quot; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; For the public welfare Xu Zhen, the seed of the volunteer was buried in 2008. At that time, many rescue teams and volunteers all over the world poured into Sichuan, and those aid hand left a deep impression on her. Four or five years later, when she was in college, she wanted to join the school volunteer association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Today, as the person in charge of Yungong&#39;s &quot;song is the sweetest medicine&quot; project, she has been with the volunteer to serve the &quot;antenna baby&quot; for nearly seven years. When I first saw these severe spine deformities, their heads and waist were covered with a steel ring, which was fixed by 4 support rods above the head. This physical condition gave Xu Zhen a very strong intuitive intuition. impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Usually, volunteers will take the patient to do vocal practice, breathe and beat the rhythm, and make a &quot;hiss&quot; sound on the mouth to exercise the breath. This is a part of the treatment process, which is customized by the hospital&#39;s orthopedic director. From admission to discharge, the average &quot;Babies of the antenna&quot; will grow 20 centimeters high, and we will usher in a new life. When someone in the group was reminiscent to &quot;discharged&quot;, Xu Zhen was particularly relieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; More volunteer seeds are continuously buried in the &quot;Monday Hive&quot; project carried out by Volunteer Network of Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xie Hong, the leader of the &quot;Hive Hive&quot; project team, introduced that they advocate citizens to participate in at least 1 hour of volunteer services per week. During the 4 years of the project, there were more than 170 online and offline activities, more than 80,000 participating volunteers, and more than 5 million services. During the Chengdu Grand Games, the moment the citizens were encouraged to upload civilized viewing, after the Grand Games ended, they also launched a micro -story solicitation to children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For her, &quot;every Monday&quot; is used to develop tasks, so try to reduce the threshold for participation in volunteer services and increase the number of participants and coverage. The &quot;free shot&quot; activity that is being promoted can participate in any place in the city. As long as you take a civilized behavior, you can get electronic certificates, volunteer service duration and points for five times. &quot;The ultimate goal is to stimulate our citizens&#39; identification of volunteer services, recognize the friendly atmosphere of the city, and be willing to make a force for the civilization and friendliness of the city.&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The micro -governance of &quot;By -way Going&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In this volunteer city, volunteers serve others, and they are also served. This &quot;two -way go&quot; is a micro -urban public governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the new road of Jinjiang District, a conspicuous courtyard is hung with the sign &quot;Mavericks Brother · You&quot;. Here is a 24 -hour love station, which is a rest for new employment groups such as express delivery, takeaway, and online car drivers. Gao Linya, the person in charge of the &quot;Mavericks&quot; project, said that there are 35 sites in Quanjinjiang District like this. From hydration, charging, to psychological counseling, labor safety protection, employment guidance services, vocational skills training, and a friendship clinic, etc., are all options for posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the early stage of demand survey, the &quot;Mavericks&quot; team found that the most needed for courier and takeaway is the charging service. Therefore, a company is specifically coordinated. Set up charging cabinet. &quot;&#39;Mavericks&#39; Brother&#39; was not only a good service from the beginning, but also to guide them to participate in social services and form a closed logic of a two -way service.&quot; Gao Linya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73773&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70564&quot; src = &quot;http: //images.infzmmm .com/CMS/Medias/Image/23/11/28/0E329F974D.JPG &quot;IMG-Title =&quot; 79C93e56795144985B1569ca6447dd5.jpg &quot;alt =&quot; &quot;Mavericks Brother · Shie&quot; station. border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;729&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/0e32974d.jpg&quot; data- key = &quot;259912&quot; &quot;stylele = &quot;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; &quot;Mavericks Brother · Sho&quot; station. Photo by reporter Gao Yichen, a southern weekend &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is also inspiring citizens to participate in the initiative of urban governance. He combined with colleges and communities, and college students independently launched refined volunteer services, communities listing needs, and corresponding majors to provide professional services. &quot;Let students see the value of their own disciplines during the development of voluntary services, and facilitate subsequent life planning.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Since then, the scope of inspiration has gradually expanded. Zhang Haibo has set up a youth volunteer service innovation laboratory to organize service projects with problems. Zhang Haibo was very impressed that left -behind children&#39;s anti -mobile phones in the summer vacation in 2023 were obsessed with &quot;craingling operations&quot;. College student volunteers also invited the players of the Chengdu AG e -sports team to play a game with children. Let&#39;s talk about it. &quot;He laughed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This micro -governance occurs in every corner of the city. Takeaway riders walk through the streets and lanes, and they are actively uploading social governance clues during the delivery. Gao Linya introduced that the governance clues are divided into eight categories such as accident emergency and public facilities damage. There are special persons in the streets responsible for reviewing and disposing of clues, feedback the problem to the department corresponding to the grassroots, and cannot be resolved to continue to be reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For some things they can, volunteers are encouraged to &quot;find themselves to solve themselves&quot; and actively participate in grass -roots governance services. It is equivalent to getting the points of the shared bicycles to make the problem, which is equivalent to obtaining two clues. For more than two years of the project operation, there are more than 500 people in the background, and more than 3,000 social governance clues collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our group of people may feel embarrassed to do (volunteer). With encouragement and promotion, there are additional rewards after finishing, and the enthusiasm will get up.

The interviewees confessed &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting in September 2023, Yang Yingqi and her team made a bold attempt in Chenghua District, Chengdu: 23 of the 83 communities were selected for gradual participation planning. The only criterion for screening is attitude, &quot;the community secretary must be changed from the inside.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is one of the series of the fourth series of &quot;Chengshi · Cheng Painting&quot; Chenghua District Community Planning and Design Festival. Yang Yingqi explained to the secretary of the community party committee who participated in the competition that the gradual participation plan was to continue to try and correct errors to make a community gradually move towards a better direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a community creator, this is the fifth year of &quot;post -95&quot; Yang Yingqi. Cheng Cheng, who is active in the public governance atmosphere in the community, is not a small number of &quot;professional players&quot; like her. They are responsible for formulating community action plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Yang Yingqi&#39;s view, community builders are more like the companion and deep cultivators of the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Yingqi accompanied the participating team to complete the entire process. From the training ability of the preliminary secretary, to the discussion of round tables with the backbone of the secretary, and then to the backbone call for residents to do participation and voting, and select community issues. Then perform two -way blind selection to match the volunteer designer team. &quot;All are controlled by small physical quantities, 100,000 yuan, but we have to solve a problem or contradiction in the community, or let the community have a point to glow.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; For Yang Yingqi The results of the game are not the most important. More importantly, in the process of participation, people&#39;s awareness of the community and inspiring the enthusiasm for public governance of community residents, &quot;grassroots governance should be seen most.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One of the contestants, Zhu Xiangling, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Shuanglin Community, is particularly impressed. At the discussion stage of the round table that week, there were almost 100 people who participated in almost every day. Most of them were residents, as well as community builders, planners, grid members, community and street office staff. &quot;Before we didn&#39;t know how to leverage various resources, it seemed that everyone felt that this was a cross -border thing. It was actually not. Everyone had a common goal to make this environment better.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p >; Following the possibility of solving the problem, the &quot;wall competition&quot; is at this time into the attention of the participants. Master Jiang, who was repairing the car for a long time, occupied a public space in the community. Zhu Xiangling said that like Master Jiang, the entire community is also distributed a lot. They provide personalized services and survive in public contradictions. However, residents have denied this method of banning. &quot;People have been here for two or three decades here, and the craftsmanship is good, and it provides good services. Why do people ban people?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; They started thinking, can the two be symbiotic? As a result of the &quot;shared wall and surface&quot;, it gradually became full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Yingqi appreciates the temperature and flexible treatment of the Shuanglin community. In order to solve a community contradiction, there is no new contradiction. The car repair master who works hard can still maintain a living, and can also provide services to the community residents. Sharing ladders, hammers, pliers and other tools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhu Xiangling was also impressed by Yang Yingqi&#39;s team. In the contact at the beginning of the event, Zhu Xiangling observed that the team ran through the entire Chenghua District to visit the investigation. She recalled that the little girl also brought the secretary and the &quot;special forces&quot; visited the friendly community of the people created by the team before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is an important project that Yang Yingqi took the team to take root in Chengdu, and it was her &quot;reason for Chengdu&#39;s entire confidence.&quot; Three years ago, the project landed on the Bilei community. She met the community in charge for the first time and talked to 11 o&#39;clock at night, and decided to cooperate immediately. Yang Yingqi felt that the managers of this community were tolerant and appealing, and they were also willing to continue to introduce youth forces. &quot;I think this is the most needed energy for community secretaries. I call it endogenous power.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She likes Beilei communities. She is a shop when she is on the street. The residents are living on the street. The shop provides the service of the entire community. The price is cheap, the life is comfortable, there is no large viaduct, and there are no wide highways. It is more suitable The dominance scale of urban residents. She is willing to return to such a place and inject new vitality into the old town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the Beilei community, in response to the contradiction between people and dogs who are more concentrated, Yang Yingqi team helped formulate a friendly convention and complete the construction of the community&#39;s pet community. The spontaneous operation of the community has no longer needed coordination and guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Two months ago, she was building a basketball court for a village, and her funds were insufficient. A wonderful thing happened: friends in the friendly community of people learned about this and took their children to raise funds on the street. The merchants in the community also deliberately contributed their own products as a gift for fundraising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She sighed: &quot;If in the grass -roots governance, when we make people and people have value recognition, when condensed into some strength, they can help people in other places. This good will continue to expand And glowing. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Time clockwise allocated for another five years. The new Chengdu native of Chengdu who moved with his family since his childhood, with the sense of weakness of the public welfare industry, chose this profession. She wants to find a link between people in the urban community. In her understanding, the &quot;community&quot; is not an administrative division or a community concept. It means the community. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So in the early days of each project, Yang Yingqi was looking for such links, looking for the community of this place, and exploring the real needs of the community. In the south, there were projects for villagers&#39; courtyard renovation with 700,000 yuan. Before the Yang team took over, five sets of courtyards had been transformed. The designer entered the venue directly, did not negotiate and respect, and the effect was counterproductive. The owner was very dissatisfied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After Yang Yingqi took over, she told the villagers that she could not obtain the decoration fund for free and need to pay 2,000 yuan, which is the fee paid to the young designer. She asked each household to participate in the entire construction process, and the designer and the owner lived together for 15 days. She also asked each family to reduce the height of the garden wall and try to be transparent. &quot;The entire village does not have high walls, and it is not the appearance of small households. It will form the concept of a large family in the entire community.&quot; This common creation model was promulgated by the Asia -Pacific Office of the United Nations Agency in 2021. &quot;2021 Asian Metropolis Landscape Award&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This creation concept has been running through. In this gradual participation planning action in Chenghua District, the core theme is community motivation, which is inseparable from &quot;community cultivation&quot; and &quot;community growth power&quot;. Yang Yingqi&#39;s &quot;community cultivation&quot; is to combine &quot;from bottom to bottom&quot; with &quot;top -down&quot;. When the community ability is still insufficient, it is appropriately incorporated into external forces. A degree of intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Out of interest, Zhu Xiangling also participated in the training course of the community creator. In her understanding, the key step of &quot;building&quot; is to dig out the owner&#39;s consciousness of the community residents: &quot;I think community construction should be the participation of diversified subjects, reaching a consensus on a public problem, and more resources to solve the corresponding problems. After the solution, it is also necessary to empower it. In the end, the two -way change of people and the environment. It is not only a change in hardware, but also changes in everyone. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[共享菜园主理人：带领都市中产感受农田]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261505]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 10:57:58 src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6b8675029d.jpeg&quot; IMG-tital = &quot;Yang Chuangshi in Shu Yue Park. jpeg &quot;alt =&quot; Yang Chuangshi is in the shared vegetable garden.

The interviewees confessed &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In Pengzhen, Shuangliu District, Chengdu, this is a manor that is easily missed. On the side of the highway, a section of sand and stone roads leading to the door of a few thin wooden stakes, with a sign hanging under the wooden stakes, &quot;Shu Yue Farming and Reading Garden&quot;. In the garden, the white hut is covered with straw, the fence is divided into small pieces of vegetable fields, and the side of the vegetable field is also stood up with a simple shed made of wood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At 3 pm on October 10th, the weather was gloomy, and the founder of the farming and reading garden was squatting in the field and grabbing bugs in the vegetable field. He said that now the vegetables in his garden do not take pesticides, and sometimes they have to catch insects and strikes accurately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; 2023 is the fifth year of Yang Chuangshi&#39;s march to agriculture. This year, he opened a 30 -acre small manor on the land rented by Shuangliu District and named it Shu Yue Garden. After people pay as members, they can claim small pieces of land in the park. They can grow vegetables and rice from planting or entrusted the park to harvest crops and participate in the construction of the manor. Yang Chuangshi called him a shared vegetable garden. In Chengdu, where the culture was prosperous, he was naturally a shared vegetable garden manager. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The first side of the 28-year-old Yang Chuangshi, it is difficult to associate him with agriculture. His face was right, wearing glasses, clean clothes, and seeing Sven, there was no old farm&#39;s soy sauce skin and deep gully on his face. However, as long as he said a few words to him, it is easy to detect his enthusiasm for the field. When it comes to extinguishing insects and weeding, he has the head of the head, and there are many local farmers who only understand the earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He is after seeing the farm gate. In his hometown in Mangshi, Yunnan, his parents have planted sugarcane for 20 years since he was two years old. After growing up, Yang Chuangshi walked out of the border town and wandered around. In 2014, when he drifted to Shanghai for a year, he consciously bought a house and settled in hope. Suddenly he remembered that his father had worked as a soldier in Chengdu and searched the introduction of &quot;the Kingdom of Tianfu&quot; and &quot;Panda Culture&quot; on the Internet, so he bought a train ticket for Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When he came to Chengdu, Yang Chuangshi studied undergraduate and did business while doing business. Beginning in 2015, he has developed human resources company and APP development. Later, the app was acquired, and he made a fortune and was in Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Life suddenly leisure. Yang Chuchi spent more than half a year think about it, what to do next. After inspections across the country, in May 2018, he made up his mind -the state advocates rural rejuvenation, and agriculture is worth trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Many friends advised him to do the risk of agriculture. Yang Chuangshi also knew that he could not prepare all his net worth without preparing. By the team of APP in the past, he first worked for the development of software for large farms, agricultural companies and agricultural travel projects. More than thirty projects followed, and he touched the whole process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 2020, Yang Chuangshi decided to do his own farm. He chose the location in Pengzhou City under the jurisdiction of Chengdu, rented dozens of acres of land, and &quot;order agriculture&quot;, which specializes in vegetables. After the customer pays 10,000 yuan a year as a member, he can receive 400 pounds of organic vegetable blind boxes every year. The category depends on the season. Onions, garlic, and vegetables are diverse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Relying on the media to do publicity and promotion, Yang Chuangshi quickly recruited the first batch of about 20 customers. This experimental version 1.0 manor operated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The difficulty of organic agriculture is beyond imagination. Vegetables such as corn and lotus white are easy to grow worms and need to grasp manpower; vegetables cannot be used, and they must be artificially plucking. Live &lt;nS CITE = &quot;Mailto: Hu&quot; Datetime = &quot;2023-11-28t07: 18&quot;>; Child &lt;/ins>; A person is endless, and the employee is 200 yuan a day. Almost half of his expenses were spent on manpower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The number of customers that can be supported by dozens of acres of land is limited. Once excessive, they must open up the fields and hire extra people. The cost is too high. Two years later, Yang Chuangshi rented another 130 acres of land in Wenjiang District. This time, he started a shared vegetable garden -per person paid for dozens of square meters of fields, or herself, or hosted, and maintained the pastoral experience without guaranteeing output. This greatly reduces the cost of manpower and has also attracted more customers who truly love rural life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The number of customers has slowly risen, and Yang Chuangshi encountered the common problems of entrepreneurs-the cooperation with the partner has obstacles. He shifted his position again, but still did not leave Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This is because Shu land is not only suitable for climate, but also convenient logistics and transportation. He told the southern weekend that the land rent of his hometown was much cheaper, but the transportation was inconvenient and the transportation was consuming. In Pengzhen, even in the highest temperature in the summer, the harvested vegetables and ice cubes were put into the foam box. It can be sent to Chengdu area in a few hours. There are several large logistics centers near the manor. He is quite convenient to buy large items to transport items. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In June 2023, the farming and reading garden officially started. The factory was set up on the original site. In two or three months, Yang Chuangshi and the other three partners repaired the land suitable for farming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The wasteland ends, and 300 people have claimed the land one after another. Yang Chuangshi said that most of the claimers are the middle class of Chengdu. If you pay 999 yuan a year, you can replace the smallest land -15 square meters. Seeds, agricultural tools, and hydropower are provided by the manor. They cultivate themselves on it. The reasons for people to claim are different. Yang Chuangshi remembers that pregnant women prefer organic foods. Eat eggs only eat soil eggs. The manor does not need pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Considers can grow naturally cooked tomatoes, slightly sour, and can also harvest farm fatal development and non -ripe lettuce. Only one -third of the market is thick. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There are also parents who are tired of the education of the &quot;grain without distinction&quot;, and also want to escape the rest day around the mahjong and hold the mobile phone tablet. They will choose weekends or holidays to take their children to the manor to do a few hours of farm work. Spring eggplant, planting pumpkin after the clear and clear, peas in the Mid -Autumn Festival, garlic in October, rotation of four seasons. The claimers are not here on weekdays. Yang Chuangshi and the employment union helped to catch insects. The rest were given to the sky. Tiangong sometimes does not make beauty. In the fall of 2023, the sky was raining, and the vegetable garden was soaked in one -third of the rice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; More important is a state of mind. Yang Chuangshi felt that he had developed software in the past, and he did not say the whole words. He did not wash his face and was extremely depressed. He also had high cholesterol and low hemoglobin. Later, when he was drinking tea in the manor, his depressed heart was released, and the indicators of medical examinations returned to normal. He also remembers that a client used to suffer insomnia in the past. After claiming the vegetable land, even if there were mosquito bites, he often went to the manor to work in the afternoon, and his insomnia left him soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There are more and more customers, which also gives Yang Chuangshi&#39;s feeling of returning to the countryside. Not only do you help with each other, sometimes you will bring some special -products of sausages and bacon to share, and sometimes you also invite a picnic, &quot;very harmonious&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On the basis of &quot;farming&quot;, the manor gradually adds the element of &quot;reading&quot;. Yang Chuangshi invited the academy specializing in Chinese education to try to integrate traditional cultural courses into agriculture. If you have children to grow rice, you can start a class at the field to tell the poems depicting rice in the Book of Songs; they have also done traditional tie -dyeing, wrap the leaves of the plant with flowers, knock on the hammer, slowly slowly, slowly slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly knock on the hammer. The color is left on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Now, Yang Chuangshi has begun to imagine to copy his shared vegetable garden model to the whole country. However, before that, he had a trivial matter to do. Not far away, there is a small piece of white fence surrounded by a small cluster of rose. Yang Chuangshi said that it was a piece of land that built a scum, which could only be transformed with rose. After the rose withered this season, he planned to plant peas. By next year, he is convinced that the vegetables on the ground will grow well. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[酒体设计师：与酒共舞的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261507]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 10:58:02 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73695&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/ab106ca461.jpeg&quot; img-tital = &quot;Jane is doing wine design. alt = &quot;Jane is doing wine design. The interviewee confess&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;1080&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/11/28/ab106ca461.jpeg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259907 &quot;style =&quot; &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Design work. The interviewee confessed &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the 11th year of the job, Jian He found the cup of old brews in Chengdu in Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 11 years ago, Jian He&#39;s occupation had no official name, and the industry was called a hookr. Simply put, he needs a glass of white wine one by one, and 40 glasses of wine is his lowest cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is also one of the secrets of Jianhe to grasp the destiny of the liquor industry, so that it can maintain the perception of liquor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 23, 2023, a wooden table on the Chengdu Office of the Chengdu Office of the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Breeding Research Institute was placed with three rows of glass bottle with white wine. Label. &quot;Fragile incense ... Chen Xiang, Cellar, Qu incense, Honey Fragrance, Baked Fragrance, Grass Scent ... Sweet and delicate, mellow and plump&quot;, the label of one bottle is so written. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the teaching aids when Jane is still becoming an apprentice. He must turn himself into a liquor database, the aroma and style type of thousands of white wine stored in his head, and learn to evaluate the quality of the Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In most drinks, it can be prepared with &quot;technology and hard work&quot;. Behind liquor is still a complex aroma world that cannot be completely penetrated by equipment and data analysis. The taste is far satisfactory according to the material components and white wines prepared by the equipment. The &quot;design&quot; of liquor, relying on the light of Jian He and his peers, tongue, tongue and incense memory in the brain, determine the ratio between the original wine and the seasoning wine, and &quot;flash rotation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2021, the fourth batch of new professional directory released by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security gave Jian He&#39;s occupation with an official name -wine body designer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jane He is quite deep with this career. More than thirty years ago, his father served as a technical person in charge of a winery in Sichuan, and he grew up next to the factory&#39;s cellar pool. Although his first occupation was in the automotive industry, he still couldn&#39;t give up his love for liquor. In 2012, he entered the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Brewery with the idea of ​​learning white wine in all directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Institute of the Institute in Guanghan, Sichuan, there is an area of ​​20 acres of scientific research bases. Jian He&#39;s first errand is the warehouse of the management base. The small liquor samples prepared by the Technology R &amp; D Center will produce dozens of hundreds of tons in the warehouse, and make the final fine -tuning before the installation. This is called &quot;magnifying the sample&quot;. Even the apprentices are not simple, just taste the adjusted samples in the warehouse, and then push the designer’s matching scheme and design concept. Taste. If you don&#39;t understand, I will go to the technology research and development center to communicate with them. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2014, Jian He passed the assessment and entered the R &amp; D center. In this master&#39;s obvious tradition, a group of young people who just came in worshiped under the door of the deputy director of the supervisor technology and began to learn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a process of assembling a liquor database in the brain. At first, the masters would only tell the characteristics of all kinds of original wines to mix a sample, and finally rely on the apprentices to go to the sample and appreciate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jane He said that now the equipment analysis has been able to detect almost all the flavors in liquor. It is known that the dance of alcohol, ester, acid, aldehyde, phenol and other substances produced during the brewing process dedicated the complexity of liquor, but the type, content and proportional relationship of the substance cannot Sensory indicators correspond to. Most of the time, apprentices need to call more, with five senses and brains. A glass of white wine, after smelling and tasteing, you need to remember its aroma, taste and style. The best way is to find approximation in your familiar taste and name it. The flavor is near banana, which is recorded as a banana aroma, like pineapple, which is pineapple aroma. First remember the single aroma, and then slowly remember the composite aroma of liquor after the preparation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After passing the assessment, Jian He became a wine designer. In the next 7 years, most of his jobs provided various technical services for winery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of the small and medium manufacturers need to be designed by wine. Jian He said that before accepting the delegation of the wine body, the designers need to do a survey. If the customer is an unfamiliar winery, he will buy some customers&#39; products from the low to high order, and conduct the evaluation within the institute. Familiar wineries can directly post the other party to post wine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the survey is over, everything is inspired by the designer. They will retrieve the aroma memory of the liquor in the brain, supplemented by the means of physical and chemical analysis, and determine the ideal fragrance, aroma, taste, and style. While taste and blend samples, adjust the proportion of raw wine and seasoning, and gradually approach the taste of expected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is like being crossed in the dark, the other side is very close and far away. Jian He remembers that he has designed a five -grain incense wine for a big winery in 2021. At that time, his thinking was to highlight the fragrance of grain, Chen Xiang and mellow. But in the first 8 days, he never achieved the effect. No matter how you tune or combine all kinds of liquor, the aroma is either or the taste is not good. The more you tune, the more you feel in your heart. &quot;I think it may be too tired, the sensitivity of the nose and tongue has decreased&quot;, and then people become irritable. The ideal aroma has been vaguely in my mind, it is almost a little bit, but it is never enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Until the 12th day, Jian He touched his head with a few designers, and some people talked about the aroma that he had brought up when bartender. He flashed his spirit, joined the aroma, and finally achieved his achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The wine designer cannot stop in the design of the wine body, but also knows the entire industry chain of liquor production. Jian He said that although they do not directly participate in processes such as raw materials screening and brewing, they have a profound impact on them. When the designer found that the wine made of wine had a odor, he found that there was a problem with the raw material, or the temperature, acidity, and starch content in the period of a certain period of time. After they checked the records and determine the reasons, the manufacturer can optimize the technology of grain selection and brewing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Sichuan Guan News, in 2021, there are already 100,000 alcohol design practitioners in Sichuan alone. It was also that year, Jian He was transferred back to Chengdu, who had been gone for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chengdu is obviously the city of his opportunity. Jian He has participated in two studies as the main researcher. One is the research and development and application of the fragrant white wine loss of yellow water. As a result in Chengdu, they passed the review of the provincial scientific and technological transformation results. At the same time, after the epidemic passed, Chengdu also held a series of high -standard wine design competitions. Jian He found that this specifications are the first time in the industry, and he has also won in some competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because of the technical experience that has accumulated throughout the chain for many years, Jian He has also been demanded more to develop a new market. Some customers want them to recommend high -quality original wines in Sichuan, and people who have made steel want to bring capital into the liquor industry and find research institutes to seek plans. Jian He and colleagues have to circle everything. It is best to choose a factory in the five major production areas of Sichuan liquor; it is best to determine where the water sources and microorganisms are determined by the production area; if you make a strong white wine, you must stare at the cultivation of the cellar mud and microorganisms; make sauce wine, and The layout is very important. The high -temperature accumulation process requires enough venues to pile up steamed grain and ingredients ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; to do such a job, Chengdu is undoubtedly the best place. On the one hand, customers from other provinces come to Sichuan, Chengdu is the most convenient point. In addition, the customer needs him to take into account the five major production areas, and the distance between Chengdu and the five major production areas has the most broad radiation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He also has a different feeling for Chengdu. The city grew up almost with him. When I first arrived in 2007, there were still many fields around Chengdu Third Ring Road, and they were still a student. Today, Chengdu has a high -tech zone and Tianfu New District, and with the second round of the city, he has also become a senior wine designer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When in Guanghan, Jian He put his family in Chengdu, but he got together with his family. Back to Chengdu, he can pick up the child home for 10 minutes after get off work. In recent years, many friends in the buildings and sales industries have also returned to Chengdu to start a business. &quot;Chengdu is my blessing.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黄仕忠丨人生真味几悲欢：忆蔡义江老师]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261477]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 11:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ Image/23/11/28/de2c4257a0.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 709 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/ms/medias/23/11/ 28/de2c4257a0.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259874 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &lt;span style = &quot; Color: #999999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Cai Yijiang, born in 1934, Ningbo, Zhejiang.

&lt;p>;此后数年，蔡老师采纳了多方建议和意见，又作了很大的增删修改，1979年10月由北京出版社正式出版，署回个人名字“蔡义江”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《红楼梦》在当代中国有着特别的地位。在文革中，它是少数仍被允许阅读的古典名著之一。不过要读懂此书很不容易，大量的诗词曲赋，颇是令人畏难。那时有很多单位组织人马做注解，蔡老师以古典诗词的造诣来注解小说中的韵文，自是轻车熟路，这部书也从一众注本中脱颖而出，并由此确立他在红学研究界的status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1978年，他被借调北京，参与筹创《红楼梦学刊》和组建“红楼梦学会”。并连续几年在《杭大学报》上发表论文，仅1979年就连发了三篇，此外还有众多有影响的论文，散见于《社会科学战线》《文史哲》《文艺研究》等知名publication.当时“文革”刚结束，许多中青年学者尚未窥得学术门径，他已大踏步前行了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，木秀于林，风必摧之。他性本豪放，不拘小节，认定一事，便百折不回，以至一而再，再而三地置身于风口浪尖之上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6407fa6b30.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6407fa6b30.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259877&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;蔡竹屏先生（1904-1982）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其尊人蔡竹屏先生，22岁加入国民党，24岁任国民革命军总司令部准尉书记。后在26军第6师司令部任书记及政训处科长，参加过北伐。 1932年赴杭州，任中央航空学校秘书&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（名誉校长蒋介石）&lt;/span>;。 1936年赴南京，任中央航空委员会秘书&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（秘书长宋美龄）&lt;/span>;。 1938年转民政，先后任浙江温岭、黄岩、余姚等县县长，组织队伍抗日，与左派人士有所接触，与国民党则渐生嫌隙。 1945年5月，登报声明脱离国民党；6月被国民政府逮捕，羁押于丽水监狱。次年冬出狱，赴上海华生电器厂任职，兼任宁波《时事公报》名誉主笔，撰写时评，抨击国民党的腐败。 1949年初，创办《宁波晨报》，4月，时在奉化休养的蒋介石，阅其社论而震怒，亲自下令查封。新中国成立后，仍在上海工作。 1951年6月，在“镇反”运动中被捕，羁管于上海提篮桥监狱，后移余姚县看守所。尽管他早就与国民党分道扬镳，但之前与蒋政权关系密切，遂难脱嫌疑。 1952、1953年，两次内部宣布无罪释放，均因被人阻拦而未成。 1953年夏，病危，入院救治；冬，中共华东局调查人员认为应恢复其自由；年底，余姚法院的审判员说：“现在还未找到你的罪恶，先判五年；继续寻找罪恶。”之后，“因病保外执行”。 1956年，由派出所宣布服刑期满，但无判决书。 1957年夏赴杭疗养，通过次子蔡义江结识夏承焘，夏翁推荐其为浙江人民出版社编《陆放翁诗词选注》。此后颇致力于古典文学研究，但“文革”中存稿多被抄走。 1982年1月任宁波市第七届政协委员，2月去世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父辈的基因和履历，往往在冥冥之中影响着孩子未来的命运。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻气盛的蔡义江一直想不通：父亲在解放战争期间，冒着坐牢杀头的危险，办报刊、写文章，揭露国民党腐败黑暗，为何却在光明来临之际，反而身陷囹圄？因闻知父亲在看守所遇到一些不平之事，他居然写了一封告状信投寄《浙江日报》。 1954年夏天，蔡义江以年级第一的成绩留校任助教，兼任教师团支部宣教委员。不久，校方收到余姚县看守所的公函，认为“蔡义江完全丧失了一名青年团员应有的革命立场，建议给予严肃的教育处分”。于是，刚刚获得学校“优秀团员”称号的蔡义江受到了“严重警告”，其父也因“泄露看守所机密”，不许减刑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1958年，大学入学政审要求转严，蔡竹屏的情况影响到子女升学，书生意气的蔡义江再度告状，称其父“遭人报复而陷冤狱，多年不给判决”。党总支组织全系教师批判其“站在反动立场，为其父一再翻案”；团支部讨论开除其团籍。在支部处分决定的书面报告上，蔡义江不得不签了字，但他依然认为“既然未作判决，也就称不上翻案”。随后被下放萧山欢潭农村“劳动锻炼”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事让蔡义江在政治上受到歧视，他本人犹可接受，但“文革”结束，恢复高考时，却又对下一代的升学产生了“消极影响”。于是为父平反，再度成为蔡义江老师的心结。时在三中全会以后，平反“冤假错案”，“右派”大都已改正，但“镇反”时的案子，一般不作复查，除非是民主党派省委委员以上的重点统战对象，才能提出要求。为此他申请加入了“民革”，不久便增补为民革省委委员，然后与兄弟姐妹联名上书为父申冤。他也想好了：万一有什么责任要承担，就声明是自己个人的行为。幸好诸事顺遂，不久，余姚县法院对蔡竹屏&quot;镇反&quot;期间的错案作了平反。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/3243b56d2c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1376&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/3243b56d2c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259878&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;蔡义江先生在其父墓前。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蔡老师随即向组织汇报了情况，要求撤销对他的两次严重警告和开除团籍的处分。一周后，总支秘书说：“档案里找不到任何受处分的记录或材料。既然没有受过处分，现在怎么能撤销呢？”蔡老师只好笑笑说：“既然没有，那就算了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;令人啼笑皆非的是，就在蔡老师一门心思想着上书为父亲平反之时，有人同样用上书的方式给他上了一课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1981年下半年，他招收的首届研究生即将毕业，但分配过程拖得有些长。有学生为了留校，通过校领导与系领导作出“定向安排”，引起古代文学教研室的反感，遂集体决定“不留一人”。该生颇觉不平，匿名写信给报社，谤称蔡义江在1980年发表的某篇论文剽窃了某位研究生的成果，此事上了《光明日报》的“内参”。对于为人清高的蔡老师，犹如当头一棒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我完全不相信蔡老师会做这样的事情，但人言可畏。 Vaguely heard that the reporter claimed to be upset as a classmate, and sent a &quot;internal reference&quot; through the alumni of the newspaper in the newspaper, the purpose was to make Teacher Cai embarrassed.那届研究生入学时的年龄大都超过了三十岁，刚经历过“文革”，对这类操作早已驾轻就熟。当时中文系也有意借此整肃风纪，所以一时很有些风声鹤唳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我后来读到郭在贻老师在1977年11月写给其兄郭连贻的信，说到《杭大学报》编辑部原拟连发他的两篇论文，他怕招致物议，要求把另一篇推迟到次年。他写道：“中文系乃是非之地，有些人从来不写文章，也写不出文章，却害怕人家写文章，此辈又有手段，不好对罪&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（原文如此，当系“得罪”之误）&lt;/span>;的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此看来，蔡老师一年内在《杭大学报》连发三文，别人未必没有看法。我还曾听得有人议论：《红楼梦诗词曲赋评注》一书，既然“组织专人讨论”，则别人也有功劳，如今却全部归于一人，遂使某人独得大名云云。虽然蔡老师在《后记》里将编写过程与他人的劳绩说得十分清楚，但有人偏要这么想，既是“传言”，便是要让你百口莫辩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在读研期间，我明显感到蔡老师有了不同，不再像以前给本科生上课那样放得开了。他给我们研究生上了三次课，都是规规矩矩讲完，内容翔实，却再没了以往的激情。也可能是我先入为主的印象，总觉得他有意避免与研究生接触，有“惹不起躲得起”的味道，这让我心里隐隐作痛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来才知蔡老师因遭谤，曾婉拒招生，系里让他与吴熊和老师合带，暂作安抚，所招两名研究生，最初未确定导师为谁，蔡老师似乎也有意疏离学生。我们这届之后，他未再招生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1985年7月，我毕业留校。冬日，一次系教师会议传达《光明日报》“内参”，为数年前诬告蔡义江窃取学生成果一事平了反。 “内参”说：蔡义江同志投寄的稿子，在文后原有“附识”，说明由学生某某代查了资料，但刊物在登载时觉得无须多此一举，也是限于版面，就将这“附识”删去了。 ——谁知道这一删，竟然酝成一桩“师德”事件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时，为了说明情况，曾请该届研究生李梦生书面记述事件经过。 30年后，李梦生的“情况说明”和给蔡老师的两封书信，流传到了孔夫子网上&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2012年6月19日）&lt;/span>;。李梦生写到，蔡老师曾去学生寝室，谈及对此论题的想法，叹息没时间查核资料，当时有几位同学在场，后来他指导的一位研究生承担了查阅资料一事。论文写成发表了，因“识语”被编辑部删去，蔡老师觉得有些抱歉，收到稿费时，再三说要分给学生一半，也曾请李梦生转达此意，但那位门生说，给老师查点资料，是学生的本分，坚辞不受。这般谦让再三，使该届研究生皆有知闻，导致被有心人利用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可是，纵然澄清了事实，获得了“平反”，但伤疤犹在，内心的郁闷无从排解。既是“内参”，传达对象也只限于本系教师，可以想见，他无法向所有曾听闻过传言的人一一去作解释。这一谤书事件直接影响到了他的学术研究，我观察此后他的发文情况：1982年至1984年虽有发表，但多是之前投稿，或是鉴赏性短文；1985、1986两年，则几乎没再发文章。蔡老师自言从父亲去世&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1982年2月）&lt;/span>;之后，除偶有应酬外再未作诗，事实上这与他遭谤的时间也是重合的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1986年前后，中共中央组织部从各地抽调有学术声望又正当盛年的学者到各民主党派中央机关任职，蔡义江教授也在选调之列。蔡老师加入民革，本属偶然，但他的能力与影响，让他成为选调对象。蔡老师因胸中垒块未消，也有意改换环境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我那时已经到中山大学读博。听闻蔡老师奉调赴京后，出任民革中央常委、宣传部部长，主持创办团结出版社和《团结》杂志社，任社长、总编辑，此后担任过多届全国人大代表、全国政协委员.在新的环境中，蔡老师重新恢复了活力，撰写了不少论文，出版了《辛弃疾年谱》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1987，与蔡国黄合作）&lt;/span>;、《论红楼梦佚稿》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1989）&lt;/span>;等著作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1993年秋，我在北大做访问研究，曾去东皇城根南街84号拜望。蔡老师热情介绍了他最近的红学研究，说是要重新校订《红楼梦》，做法是集众本而取其长，完成一个新的评注本。 ——这部评注本不久后即出版，反响甚好；最近商务印书馆又出了修订版，题《蔡义江新评红楼梦》，系毛边典藏本，颇受读者喜爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/20fbed5431.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1128&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/20fbed5431.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259879&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;商务印书馆新版《蔡义江新评红楼梦》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我感受到他谈论学术时的兴奋，也察觉到他的一丝落寞。因为离开高校多年，这些只能算是“业余”工作。他的红学研究“独树一帜”，却也意味着连二三“素心人”也难以觅得。他对当时红学界的不良风气甚表气愤，认为“学术文章最恶&#39;三不&#39;作风”，即不顾常识、不择手段和不负责任。为纠正时弊，他连续撰文与人商榷，得罪了不少人。我倒以为大可不必，因为“学术”与“非学术”原本界线分明，但看着老师这般较真，我也不敢多言，只是想起了当时那句流行的话：毕竟是书生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后蔡老师作为红学家依然活跃，但那个才华横溢的古典诗词研究专家却从此消声了。作为一代词宗夏承焘的弟子，他在退休后也出版过《宋词三百首全解》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2007）&lt;/span>;、《宋词精选全解》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2013）&lt;/span>;、《唐宋词鉴赏课》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2020）&lt;/span>;等。另外他当年用力最多的古诗研究，只有一本《宋诗精华录译注》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1999）&lt;/span>;，是李梦生提议并合作的；另有一本《黄仲则诗选》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2011）&lt;/span>;，是当年就与研究生沈开生、李梦生作了筹划，30年后才重新拣起完成的。这些都是普及读物，有些则是同一内容的修订与扩充。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回看蔡老师的学术经历，我发现他们这一代人，几乎不曾有安定时光来打下基础，深研学术。上世纪五十年代的两次告状，让他备受打击，被发配到农场多年。六十年代初，返校不久，便遇到“四清”运动，“社教”还没结束，“文革”已卷地风来。七十年代初，在古代文学作品大都不能阅读和研究的时候，他幸运地在沙漠中觅得一小片绿洲，致力于《红楼梦》中诗词曲赋的校注，发挥了专长，从而在新时期发轫之初走在同侪的前列。谁知晓正当他豪情满怀、欲振翅翱翔的时候，却被一支暗箭射折了翅膀，无奈之中，避地疗伤。虽然公务之余继续耕耘着红学的领地，却荒芜了古典诗词的家园。离开杭大后，他再未招收研究生，更未有机会带博士生，他的衣钵也就未得传人。何况岁月无情，忽忽已臻老境！诸多想法未曾实施，满腹才华也随时光无声流逝。这不仅是他个人独有的哀伤，也是一代人共同的遭际。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;予小子不敏，窃以为蔡老师是性情中人，意气风发，踏浪趁波,但在时代的湍流之中，却不时遇到暗礁，只能在碰撞中被推涌着踉跄前行，其实不曾有真正潇洒的时光。此其命矣乎哉！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行文至此，不禁想起蔡老师的恩师瞿禅老夫子的《鹧鸪天·病中示浙大诸从游》，词云：&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;夜夜匡床听杜鹃。年年归计负江船。当花未信风怀减，临镜先惊骨相寒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;同语笑，亦前缘。人生真味几悲欢。围灯诸友都堪画，好作儿时弟妹看。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夏老慧眼，早已看透世情。为师生，亦前缘。 “人生真味几悲欢”，诚然！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/3ff799782c.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;太仓是苏州市代管县级市，2022年GDP 1653.57亿元，在江苏各区市中排第六。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“太仓发布”曾解释以旧换新的政策意图，一方面是支持改善性购房需求，另一方面是为了丰富人才公寓和保障房供给种类。 “购回的旧房改造成人才公寓或者保障房后，房源分布面将更广，可供市民选择的余地也将更多。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了太仓，2023年以来已有十余座城市推行商品房以旧换新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最初，是由扬州、济南等地开发商自主发起；之后淄博、南京等地行业协会组织开发商、中介机构“卖旧换新”；再到如今太仓等地国企参与、和保障性租赁住房筹集相结合。模式演变过程中，地方政府和城投平台的参与度越来越高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“老房子抵首付”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在太仓的以旧换新方案中，二手房出售给国企，置换的新房也由国企开发。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“太仓发布”介绍，第一批可选房源包括3个小区，均由太仓市城市发展集团有限公司（下称城发集团）开发。第二批扩展到8个小区，太仓市城市建设投资集团有限公司（下称城投集团）也参与进来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，两家公司均由太仓市政府国有资产监督管理办公室100%控股。南方周末记者以购房者名义咨询，多位参与以旧换新楼盘的置业顾问介绍了置换流程：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;城发集团或城投集团会对二手房进行价格评估，购房者按评估价抵扣新房房款，最高不超过新房总价的60%。所购新房均由这两家国企开发，置换后二手房产权也过户给它们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“相当于用老房子抵首付。”其中一位置业顾问说。假设想要置换300万元的新房，旧房最高可抵180万元，剩余120万元可向银行贷款。如果旧房价值超过180万元，国企也不会返现，但可以置换价值超过300万元的新房。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这一过程中，国企收购二手房并不需要额外资金投入，60%的抵扣比例限制保证其仍有销售新房的现金入账。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也意味着，业主所换新房一定比旧房更贵，但和卖掉旧房再买新房相比，以旧换新的时间极大缩短。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏州一位房产中介告诉南方周末记者，目前当地二手房平均销售周期八九个月。太仓一位房产中介则表示，如果想卖房，挂牌价比市场价低10万-20万元才好出手。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而参与以旧换新，按两家国企置业顾问的说法，只需两三个月就能走完所有流程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;城发集团一位置业顾问也报了名。她负责的楼盘在政策指定的置换名单里，手上的老房子不好卖，她决定试试直接置换公司的新房。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（以旧换新）适合出售困难的老小区。”她告诉南方周末记者，房龄老、位置差的二手房目前在市场上不好出售，但只要是70年产权的住宅、建筑面积在144平方米以下，都能以旧换新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据“太仓发布”报道，第一批签约“以旧换新”的居民大多住在老城区中的老小区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者致电被指定为换新房源的8个小区，获知其中6个小区均为期房，多数为新近开盘的改善型楼盘，两三年后集中交房。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;多地跟进&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;事实上，政策发布较早的太仓，以旧换新规模并不大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太仓城发集团一位置业顾问介绍，首批以旧换新仅100个名额，200人参与报名，最终只成交了三四十套。因为报名后还要摇号选房，不少业主因为房源、价格等不满意而放弃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二批名额扩充到800个，城发集团500个，城投集团300个。分布到8个小区中，每个小区只有几十套以旧换新房源，大多占比不足1/10。截至报名前5小时，名额还没报满。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位置业顾问向南方周末记者表示，想要置换的二手房必须结清贷款。置换后，如果新房还未交付，继续住旧房需要向国企缴纳租金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;继太仓之后，江苏省连云港市也推出类似政策。当地住建局2023年10月17日发布《关于进一步促进住房消费活跃房地产市场的通知》，提出探索“卖旧换新”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;具体政策是对已出让未建设、含有配建保障性住房的开发项目，允许缴纳保障性住房易地建设费，由国企平台限期收购“卖旧”的房屋作为保障性住房或人才房使用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;连云港市住建局一位工作人员向南方周末记者介绍，具体参与的国企为连云港市城建控股集团有限公司，二手房由该公司收购。 “置换的新房估计也由该公司开发。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但目前政策仍在探索阶段，置换方式、存量房改造等具体细节也没有拟定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江省海宁、丽水两市则由财政直接给予补贴，鼓励房企收购存量房。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，海宁提出对购买存量房的房企给予总购房款2%的财政补贴，丽水则给予旧房交易税费留存地方部分100%补贴，其中个人购买二手住房的，交易税费补贴与购房补贴就高享受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海宁要求，存量房购买、新建商品住宅出售的主体必须为同一家房地产企业。南方周末记者以购房者名义咨询，当地住建局一位工作人员表示，政府并未指定具体哪些房企可以置换，并不限制为国企。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;具体的开发商选择、置换价格等均由业主和企业协商。开发商收购的二手房也自行处理，目前没有作为保障性住房的通知。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;房企承担二次售卖盈亏&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;最早，以旧换新主要是以行业协会、民营企业为主体发起的市场行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月6日，淄博市房地产开发协会、市房地产经纪与评估协会联合发起以旧换新签约仪式，首批12家开发商和中介机构签署合作协议。按照《淄博日报》公布的名单，参与主体主要为民营企业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;淄博市房地产开发协会一位工作人员告诉南方周末记者，这一举措更准确的说法是“卖旧换新”。主要是通过中介机构加推、引流等方式，帮助客户卖房，旧房卖出后再置换提前交付定金、锁定房源的新房，如未顺利卖出则退还定金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“主要是缩短交易时间、节省交易成本。”这位工作人员说。除了淄博，江苏省南京市、南通市等地也纷纷采取这一模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此之前，也有民营开发商通过收购二手房的方式以旧换新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;江苏新能源置业集团有限公司（下称新能源置业）9月底启动以旧换新活动。其官微介绍，公司提供直接置换、委托置换两种模式。后者与淄博类似，由该公司委托中介机构帮助业主卖旧买新。前者则直接由新能源置业收购二手房。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者以购房者名义咨询，该公司一位工作人员表示，这一活动目前仍在进行。置换的新房必须由新能源置业开发，二手房则可以是其他开发商的产品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她介绍，公司早在2016年就曾开展以旧换新，主要是为了促进新房销售。在直接置换模式下，旧房由公司进行估价和收购，再向市场转卖，二次售卖盈亏由公司承担。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关键在于，新能源置业要求置换的新房必须是旧房价格的两倍，对旧房的房龄、位置、加装电梯等均有要求，贷款也要基本结清。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;济南绿地澜庭公馆在2023年8月也推出了类似的直接置换活动。楼盘置业顾问向南方周末记者介绍，参与置换的业主需按照绿地集团（600606.SH）的评估价将房子过户给公司，再购买公司开发的新房。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和新能源置业一样，绿地集团对所收购的旧房品质要求较高。并且，业主收到旧房回购款的同时，要向公司支付新房购房款，所购买的新房要比旧房总价高40%左右。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《齐鲁晚报》报道，该活动推出后约两个月，绿地澜庭公馆置换了三十多套房子。绿地集团还把这一模式复制到青岛、潍坊、临沂等城市的部分项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位济南房地产资深从业者向南方周末记者分析，目前的市场行情下，企业收购二手房后进行转租并不划算。以较低价格进行收购，再向市场转卖可能性更大。但本质仍是为了推动新房销售，二手房并非盈利重点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;克而瑞研究中心企业研究总监沈晓玲曾撰写以旧换新相关报告。她告诉南方周末记者，各地之所以密集推出以旧换新举措，主要由于目前二手房市场流动性不佳，限制了改善性购房需求释放，以旧换新为打破这一困局提供了路径。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据她观察，不同模式的以旧换新效果也有差异。在当前新房去化难、二手房挂牌量大的情况下，不少推行中介帮卖模式的城市效果并不明显。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直接置换的效果更为直观，但收购二手房对开发商的资金体量有一定要求，选择这一模式的房企并不多。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;有趣的事，《鲁颂》并非歌颂鲁国的始封君伟大的周公的，它赞美的对象，是今天大多数人已经很陌生的人物，鲁僖公。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，鲁僖公确实是值得仔细观察一下的：就是在大国争霸的形势下，一个中等国家的国君，应该怎样保全甚至发展自己的国家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁僖公是鲁庄公的儿子，在位33年，算是相当长的时间了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁僖公即位前，鲁国经历了严重的动乱。当时齐国国君就是春秋五霸之首的齐桓公，齐桓公帮助鲁国平定了内乱，鲁僖公也紧跟齐桓公，鲁国政治重新回到了平稳运转的轨道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐桓公去世后，中原没有霸主，楚国的势力不断向北扩张。 The Chu State is a barbaric that the Central Plains countries look down on. The representatives of the Lu State with the state of etiquette and the Central Plains countries should be looked down on Chu State, but Lu Yigong performed very openly.他要利用楚国的力量去对付齐国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这时候，春秋五霸的第二位晋文公出场了，山西的晋国开始积极介入太行山以东的事务，晋楚两大国争霸，鹿死谁手，未可预料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卫国离晋国比较近，当时卫国也已经归附楚国了，晋文公就拿卫国开刀。态势很明显，收拾完卫国很可能就要来收拾鲁国了，何况鲁僖公还派了一个贵族，帮助卫国守城，等于鲁国已经把自己放在晋国的对立面上了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁僖公又来骚操作了，把这个派到卫国去的贵族杀了，并对晋国说：这人私自带兵帮助楚国，所以我把他杀了，这是表明鲁国对晋国没有敌意。又派人对楚国说：这人作战不力，没有好好帮助楚国打仗，所以我处死了他。这样，鲁僖公及时抽身，我谁也没得罪，你们两大国赶紧打吧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;城濮之战，晋国击败楚军，鲁僖公也知道自己该站谁了，赶紧抱紧晋国大腿。晋国觉得他表现这么积极，给其他国家做出了示范，所以也给了鲁僖公丰厚的回报：原来站错队的国家，要受到惩罚，要割让一部分土地。这些土地晋国不能自己全部都要，有的就分给鲁国了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，鲁僖公是一个没什么雄才大略，但眼光敏锐，身段柔软，老谋深算或者难听点说老奸巨猾，很善于从权力斗争的夹缝里赚取利益的国君。这是《左传》提供给我们的印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有趣之处就在于，《左传》里这个鲁僖公形象，和《诗经•鲁颂》里鲁僖公形象，根本不像是一个人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《鲁颂》只有四首诗，但其中《泮水》和《閟宫》两首都很长，尤其是《閟宫》，共九章，一百二十句，是整本《诗经》中最长的一篇。两首诗都讲到一件事，就是鲁国对“淮夷”的胜利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;淮夷这个名字，字面意思就是生活在淮河流域的华夏文明圈以外的人群。春秋时代，淮夷不算很强大的势力，但也不容小觑，对中原小国足以构成不小的威胁。齐桓公要当霸主，就有维护小国安全的义务，所以多次组织国际联军，讨伐淮夷。鲁国作为中等实力的国家，鲁僖公又是紧跟齐桓公的，所以齐国的历次行动，鲁国当然都是参与了的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是《左传》的记载，而我们从《鲁颂》里看到了什么呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面，《鲁颂》是对《左传》的补充，我们知道了鲁国在这些行动里获益很大。获得了不少土地，这个鲁国占便宜的地方，他跟着齐国行动，但齐国在泰山东北，把淮夷打跑了，地方齐国也没法占领，但鲁国的疆域，和淮夷生活的土地，本来就是连成一片的，那老实不客气就归为己有了。鲁国还得着了很多财宝，所谓“元龟象齿，大赂南金”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，《鲁颂》也是对《左传》的歪曲。因为《鲁颂》里面，没有齐桓公的影子，所有这些胜利，都是在鲁僖公的英明领导下取得的。 《泮水》歌颂鲁僖公，贡献了一个后世很常用的成语，“允文允武”，真的是又能文啊又能武。 《閟宫》更了不得，它用极其铺张扬厉的文字，描绘鲁僖公如何雄才大略，武功赫赫，把天下蛮夷都打服了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓“保彼东方，鲁邦是常”，东方世界的安定，靠谁来维持？就是我们鲁国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓“戎狄是膺，荆舒是惩，则莫我敢承”，简单说就是天下所有的刺头，都被咱们僖公打了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，“莫不率从，鲁侯之功”，天下秩序的重建，就靠咱们鲁侯；“莫敢不诺，鲁侯是若”，各种邪恶势力一见到咱们鲁国，只能恭恭敬敬说一声“诺”，您说得太对了。真的就是东方红太阳升，鲁国出了个鲁僖公的感觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个鲁僖公，和《左传》里的鲁僖公比，根本是两个人。这里，今天的我们很容易看出《鲁颂》是当时的宣传文字，水分哗哗的，但当时的鲁人信以为真的很不少吧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，前面也说了，鲁僖公绝不是平庸的国君，只不过他的长项不是雄才大略而是老谋深算，但是，雄才大略的形象有一种奇理斯玛型（Charisma，超凡魅力）人格的魅力，是国君的理想人设，老谋深算的形象则更适合幕僚而不是君主。所以《鲁颂》里绝口不提他真正的长处而吹了一通他并没有的本事。人类历史上，用假的优势掩盖自己真正的优势迷惑别人，用小的污点吸引眼球让人忽视大的污点之类的情况，都非常常见，也特别值得关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
