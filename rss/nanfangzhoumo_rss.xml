According to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, domestic tourism trips nationwide are expected to reach 896 million during this year&#39;s long holiday, a year-on-year increase of 86%. During the seven-day long holiday in 2019, the country received a total of 782 million domestic tourists. There is one more day this year, which means that the average number of domestic travelers during this year’s long holiday has returned to the level of 2019. It seems that the recovery of the tourism industry is real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data shows that during the long holiday, the cultural tourism market in popular tourist cities such as Shanghai and Suzhou in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions is extremely hot. Orders for hotels, air tickets, etc. have increased at least five times compared with the same period last year. Prices have also generally risen significantly. On the eve of the long holiday, many netizens posted &quot;travel housing exchange&quot; posts on social platforms, looking for netizens with travel destinations opposite to their own to exchange housing and save money. This is in line with the original intention of tourism: traveling is nothing more than going from a place you are tired of playing to a place others are tired of playing, escaping from daily life and looking for a sense of alienation and freshness that is different from daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When exchanging houses, each party will go to the other party&#39;s city and live in the other party&#39;s house at the same time. The risk should be controllable, because each party at least knows the other party&#39;s real information such as address and contact information. &quot;Reciprocity&quot; is originally an effective means to establish a &quot;balance of power&quot; and control risks such as breach of trust. However, if the housing exchange agreement reached by both parties is that one party will first go to the other party&#39;s city during this holiday and live in the other party&#39;s house, and the other party will claim his own consideration after a period of time, there will inevitably be some risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is security risk. Even if there is an agreement, the person who comes to check in is a stranger to you, and you cannot verify his or her identity. He may use a fake name and ID card. Even if you do not reveal your true identity, your address, contact information and other information will always be with you. Really, this creates asymmetry and asymmetry. If the other party has a serious disease, it will harm the health of the family; if the other party has bad hygiene habits, the living environment will be very poor, which will inevitably cause headaches. If the other party intentionally or unintentionally damages the facilities in the house, it will also be troublesome. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there is the risk of breach of trust. As long as it is not a transaction or agreement where the money is paid and the goods are delivered, there is such a risk. After you have fulfilled the agreement and entertained them with good intentions, but when you go to the city where they are located, they directly break the contract and breach of trust. There is nothing you can do. To protect your own rights and interests, or if the living conditions provided by the other party are far from what they claim, and they take advantage of you, you will most likely have to hold your nose and endure it. Physical exchanges are not delivered at the same time, and it is common for the goods to be incorrect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are complaints about &quot;specialty exchange&quot; everywhere on the platform: being taken advantage of and deceived by the other party. In the final analysis, there is still an underestimation of human nature. The ancients had a saying of &quot;Be cautious of independence&quot;, which is very reasonable as a criterion for judging whether a person is truly moral. Many people&#39;s morals are flexible: they speak morally in front of acquaintances, because failure to speak up will have consequences and will affect their reputation; they don&#39;t speak morally in front of strangers, and even do evil on the spur of the moment, because they feel that no one knows them. It is difficult to be held accountable even if someone is willful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, in order to avoid the above two risks, you insist on verifying the other party&#39;s identity, such as finding a trusted third party to guarantee, or collecting the other party&#39;s accommodation fee in advance? In this case, what&#39;s the difference between doing a B&amp;B? If you want to stay in a B&amp;B, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to list the available rooms for sale on the OTA platform? After being screened by the platform, the security risks are controllable and there is no risk of breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you insist on doing it yourself, you are actually following the old path of Airbnb’s evolution: At first, everyone just wanted to save money than staying in a hotel and build a platform to build a bridge. But after a period of brutal growth and After the chaos, it was discovered that the grass-roots team was not good enough, and it still needed specialization and standardization, so that professional people could do professional things. It was difficult to use amorphous &quot;non-standard&quot; services for a long time. In the end, Airbnb had not returned to the hotel model. The so-called B&amp;Bs that are aggregated are just numerous small-scale hotels run by private individuals. In large-scale talent shows, the final winners are often those who major in music or dance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having said that, exchanging housing is actually &quot;sofa living&quot; with a different name, and it also has its own ecological niche. People with families can&#39;t help but frown when they think of the above risks. When going out, they would rather spend money to stay in a hotel than get into trouble just to save money. This is indeed good. But for young people who have just started working, they rent a house that they can just live in. There are no valuables or facilities in it, they have no long-term possessions, and in short, they have no money. Because they are relatively young and fresh when they first enter the society, they have no understanding of human nature. With optimism and kindness towards strangers, the above-mentioned risks are not a problem. Isn’t it appropriate to let netizens from other places come and stay for a few nights, and do the same when I go to other places? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both are young people, both are poor, both understand the need to save money, and have a common topic. A stranger may be able to bring him a world that he has never been exposed to or even imagined before, fully exposing himself to Through randomness, you can interact with more people and discover a larger and broader world. If you go out on your own, you can &quot;travel thousands of miles&quot;, and when others walk in, you can &quot;travel thousands of miles to you.&quot; Movement is relative, and changing the frame of reference is the same thing. Your own experience and the experience of others can increase your knowledge. See. Although you may meet some bad people and weirdos, you will also get to know some good friends who can become lifelong friends. The risks are controllable, so why not? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of openness and sharing spirit among young people is commendable. To a certain extent, if all you think about when encountering problems are risks, and then you are hesitant and hesitant to do anything, it is actually a sign that your heart is getting older. Therefore, we can warn young people of risks in good faith, but there is no need to intimidate young people with various risks. We should be happy to see young people make full use of this youthful time. This beautiful and wanton time is short. Our body will age, but our mentality should try to stay young, energetic and courageous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[布克奖得主弗兰纳根：活下去，比时代活得更久]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257969]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/1VGcttsOmOq3e7DgDoZVaHIbBgiTj3sGId82ZeAd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/1VGcttsOmOq3e7DgDoZVaHIbBgiTj3 sGId82ZeAd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252416&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Joel Saget/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The world is becoming more and more uncertain and disorderly. Since no one knows what will happen tomorrow, this story may remind them that in an uncertain world In this world, we still have each other&#39;s love, which is probably the only thing we can be sure of in this life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the Australian writer Richard Flanagan (Richard Flanagan) wrote the novel The novel &quot;The Way North&quot; won the Booker Prize. The novel is based on his father&#39;s experience of being captured by the Japanese during World War II and building the &quot;Death Railway&quot; in Thailand and Burma. It tells the life of Australian military doctor Dorigo Evans in two lines: he tried his best to save lives in a prisoner of war camp and was on the verge of death. companion, when he is lonely and hopeless, he will continue to recall the only unforgettable love in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Flanagan&#39;s writing, &quot;Dorigo Evans will live a long time and witness all the changes&quot; - he feels that something is withering, but he will live on and be better than himself Live longer...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is a masterpiece about love and war,&quot; the Booker Prize citation stated. &quot;Flanagan&#39;s elegant narrative tells a story of the coexistence of sin and heroism.&quot; The story connects the East and the West, the past and the present.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flanagan was born in Tasmania, southeastern Australia, in 1961. For generations, people have lived in this &quot;end of the world&quot; &quot;The logging life on a desert island. Both his grandparents were illiterate, and his father was the only one in the family who received a basic education. &quot;My father had a strong feeling for the beauty and magic of words. He lamented until his death that people can use these 26 letters to glimpse the universe. Reading can enjoy freedom and transcendent power. The magic carpet of literature has lifted me from this world. Take a small island far away.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, Flanagan published his debut novel &quot;The Death of the River Guide&quot;. He tells the story of the river guide Aliyah in a language that is freehand, dreamy, and full of original tension. Even through his experience of capsizing a boat and drowning in Tasmania&#39;s Franklin River, through the torrent-like confessions of the dead, Flanagan closely tied his personal experience to the mythical history of Tasmania&#39;s ancestors. &quot;I could write about the mud, the smell, the heat and the blood, but it was the readers who brought the emotion, the sympathy, the sorrow and the pity. The book didn&#39;t get many reviews at the time, but it gained readers, which is enough to give a book life .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late summer and early autumn of 2023, the new translation of Flanagan&#39;s &quot;The Road to the North&quot; and the Chinese translation of his new work &quot;The Surging Sea in Dreams&quot; were published in China. Hobart, the capital of Nigeria, accepted an online interview with Southern People Weekly. “Literature opened my eyes to the depth and breadth of each person, and the possibilities that are within each of us, both evil and good. When you realize that people can be everything, they can be murderers and When you are a saint, you can learn to look at the world with humility and understand that anything that happens has nothing to do with you, but is a way of our existence as human beings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The lower world is more real, The universe of literature points directly to human nature&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I heard that before becoming a professional writer, you worked as a construction worker and gardener, and you also considered going to northern Australia for mining. How have your past work experiences inspired you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Indeed, I have done a lot of work, and these experiences have made me realize that most people&#39;s lives are so difficult. In order to have food to eat and a house to live in, people struggle to survive. They don&#39;t like their bosses, and their jobs are very menial and extremely hard. This is actually the daily life situation of most people in the world. I always tell myself that if I’m lucky enough to be a full-time writer, I’ll never forget those hard times and I’ll never complain about the difficulties of writing, because you’ve been given the extraordinary privilege of having the opportunity to do what you love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various experiences in the past have also made me discover that when you are close to those powerful and famous people, their world is not real, but when you are at the bottom, people are often very honest, and they are Tell the truth to each other, so you&#39;ll find plenty of truth. My grandparents were both illiterate, and I was lucky enough to become a writer. When I was with them and their friends, I could see a real world, but when I was with people who had achieved great things, I found that understanding The truth is much more difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your debut novel &quot;The Death of the River Guide&quot;, the protagonist Aliash fell in love with a girl of Chinese descent, Kota He. You also wrote about the history of the He family. What original material was there? You also visited China in 2018, can you share your impressions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, I have some Chinese cousins. In the 19th century, many Chinese came to Australia and they intermarried with the locals, so many Australians Everyone has Chinese relatives. I wrote about China in my novel because I grew up in such an environment and I am no stranger to the Chinese. There was a period in Australia&#39;s history when racism was high and many Chinese were forced to leave, but thankfully that has changed again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I visited China last time, I talked with the Chinese writer Yu Hua. His experience was very different from mine, but we shared our thoughts on reading and writing. His literature The hero is also William Faulkner like me, and I find that our creative philosophies are also very similar. When you become a writer, you may enter forbidden areas, but you also belong to a literary universe, and that universe speaks directly to human nature. I was deeply moved by the fact that you meet a friend from far away, who writes a book from another far away country, but you share similar sources of inspiration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned your hero Faulkner. Faulkner believed that experience, observation and imagination are three necessary conditions for a writer. Which one is the most important in your writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think Faulkner is not completely telling the truth here, because his experience is not rich, and mine is not. not much. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Laugh)&lt;/span>; I visited Faulkner&#39;s former home in Oxford, Mississippi, and he created that world out of his imagination, a kind of To a certain extent, this is also his observation of that world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing is a craft that requires long-term polishing, just like making furniture. Many times it is just the continuous improvement of ordinary labor, which is what Maupassant said: writing black words on white paper. But there is also a mysterious part to writing. The great jazz musician Duke Ellington once talked about his composition. People said that the piano music was so great. He said, no, it was a dream. I completely agree that all great creations are like a dream. When you dream, you will find that, for example, you are in Shanghai and I am in Tasmania, but we are connected, talking about the absent Yu Hua and the late Faulkner. You find that you are not just one person and one person. You are connected to everyone, even beyond time, space and life and death. All of this is you and not you. It is important to find this in imagination. This points to the highest realm of creation. When we reach there, we know that we are not you. No longer alone. Writing reminds me to share with others, and just as people can relate to a work of art, I think creators must bravely break into that place. Observation and description alone are not enough. We need to rely on imagination. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;We are constantly corrupting as we move forward, and we are lost in the theater of emotions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Why is there always light at the beginning of all things?&quot; &quot;The Path to the North&quot; opens with this philosophical question. How did this beginning come about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Parts of this novel touch on the dark side of the world. I think that if your creation involves darkness, it must be balanced with light. If all readers see is the dark side, they will not believe it, and they have reason to choose not to believe it, because it is not in line with our knowledge and understanding of ourselves as human beings. . If there is only darkness in the end, then it does not truly tell the whole story of human nature. The core of the human spirit lies in having hope. Without hope, we are just zombies. So, I chose to balance the whole story with light and hope. Therefore, this work is about war, but it also depicts love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, my first memory of light is actually in that church, my grandmother and mother hugged me, and I saw a beam of light coming over me, and it was the woman who loved me. running in their arms. As we age, we lose our sight, our hair... but I think the saddest thing is that we lose that sense of wonder. As a child, you retained this extraordinary and wonderful feeling that as long as you could see the light, you were content. I wanted to commemorate this flash of memory by placing it at the beginning of the novel, because it tells a truth that we have long forgotten. As we grow up, we lose this sense of wonder, awe and joy, but this was once It’s a great truth that we learn as children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/evGuPm3gQAw3depowqukV3cC38KbhoPhgnsoHleY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;697&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/evGuPm3gQAw3depowqukV3cC38KbhoPhgnsoHleY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252419&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/wXQKHKqGQ9Jv9FhxHiozDTJvFvGsuPyia3Z9XQ81.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/wXQKHKqGQ9Jv9FhxHiozDTJvFvGsuPyia3Z9XQ81.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252422&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/XfHFyriUFmTJqw3kO2YZiU4zYpZjS0a6n2iBjsrT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/XfHFyriUFmTJqw3kO2YZiU4zYpZjS0a6n2iBjsrT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252414&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The novel opens with a description of a little boy’s fear after his finger was injured and being bullied by his peers while playing ball. Have these details about a boy’s growth also happened in your life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, these are more based on stories my father told me. Tasmania is not like other places. It is the poorest region in Australia. People here not only live in poor areas, but also live in older eras. I tried to write that feeling in the story. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the football story, once again, he ran into the light and felt the light. This moment embodies the profound feelings we had when we were young, and we can never go back to them. There&#39;s this misconception in the West that we&#39;re constantly moving forward and shedding innocence, and I don&#39;t buy that. We are constantly corrupting as we move forward. In fact, innocence is a treasure we once had, but we are too forgetful and have discarded many of the most basic things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Later, crying became a simple confirmation of emotion... Emotions have become fashionable, emotions have become theater, and as actors, people have no way of knowing who they are after getting off the stage.&quot; Can you give some interpretation to this passage in the book? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The world is undergoing tremendous changes. People now express their emotions more, but sometimes, the emotions they express are not Not sincere. It&#39;s not good to suppress emotions, but I think sometimes expressions in public spaces have gone too far. Whether people agree with it or not, this is one of the biggest changes in the past 100 years. I think a novel could reflect these kinds of changes that we talk less about. I wanted a character who understood these strange changes and documented them. For the protagonist Dorigo, this change is shocking because he has been playing a certain role his whole life. He is not a hero but has to pretend to be one because this is what the other prisoners of war demand of him. After the war, he had to continue playing this role, he had to wear this mask, and he knew it was a lie, but it had become a necessity in life for other people, so he agreed, partly because he avoided it. own emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What interests me is that when a person becomes a leader or a celebrity, we often think that they created this identity themselves, but in fact we &quot;created&quot; them, we decided to let them Becoming a celebrity or a hero, sometimes these roles are a kind of imprisonment for people. Celebrity and fame are some manifestations of misunderstanding and trouble. Behind this is loneliness. The fact is that the more famous you are, the lonelier you are. This is not a paradox. But the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Life is alive, walking on the roof of hell, gazing at flowers&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The title and the first part of the quotation of &quot;The Path Deep into the North&quot; are all quoted from haiku by Matsuo Basho.

Please tell me your considerations in choosing these haiku. ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This book was difficult for me to write. At first I didn’t think I could do it. I didn’t want to offend my father by writing something that he felt was incompatible with his experience and seemed like a betrayal. It took me 12 years to write this work, and it also took me that long to find the most suitable way of expression. Finally, I finished this writing with love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t want to judge anyone, I just want to show what humans do to each other. I wanted to organize the book in a form that I learned from Japanese literature. I could use the most beautiful things in Japanese culture to present the worst atrocities in the same society. Writing it like this might be a way for me to liberate myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The structure of this book is a bit like &quot;Rashomon&quot;, looking at crimes from multiple perspectives, presenting different perspectives on the same crime, interspersed with Japanese poetry. I long to strip away all the trappings, and in fact, the more you strip away, the more you allow readers to discover the true meaning. When I write, I try to keep taking things away, cutting and cutting, so that what is left is something that the reader can find meaning and purpose in, rather than me telling him what it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Two of the haiku of Kobayashi Icha you quoted involve &quot; &quot;The World of Dew&quot;, how do you understand &quot;The World of Dew&quot;?

Death poems are one of the traditions of Japanese literature. Before, Zhishui grabbed a brush and &quot;drawed&quot; the poem. People found that he just used the brush to draw a circle on the paper. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To me, the void, mystery, and reincarnation contained in this circle fit the theme of the story, and also fit the novel’s repetitive structure, echoing from beginning to end, “the magnificent wheel, the eternal return.” &quot;: The Opposite of a Circle and a Thin Line.&quot; At the end of the book, we don&#39;t know whether Dorigo is dead or alive. In fact, he never left the prisoner of war camp. Some ghosts trapped him in a special place forever: there is love and hell. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tasmania, we have a different concept of time: it often feels like time goes back and forth and never moves forward. I think this is a broader concept of time. We often move from this year to next year, and then to the year after that. What happened 10 years ago is in the past, but the aboriginal people here believe that what happened a thousand years ago It is happening today and it will happen again tomorrow. I think this more truly reflects our self-perception. The idea that what happened in the past is the past is actually an illusion. Nothing has ever passed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people suffer from dementia, we say they have lost consciousness, but they have only lost their memory. Once you lose your memory, you cannot control your current life because people rely on their memory to understand everything. So this Australian Aboriginal concept of time plays a role in my work, and my novels are often presented in a cyclical structure, rather than being linear in a one-dimensional space like most English novels. Narrative. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The past can be forgiven, but cannot be forgotten&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;From &quot;The Death of the River Guide&quot; to &quot;The Path Deep into the North&quot;, your writings have all explored the secrets of memory.

We usually think of memory as a kind of witness. I tell you what happened 50 years ago, just like I have a camera. But in fact, memory is more likely to be an act of creation, capable of spinning lies as well as truth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father gradually lost the memory of the violence and pain he suffered, but in the end, he left behind the idea of ​​love. Although what he experienced was not love, what he finally had Memory was something he himself discovered to be valuable. I thought a lot about this, trying to capture the way people think through memory. Memory is thought to represent some kind of statement of justice, which it may or may not be. There is a paradox here: when people experience major trauma and you and your compatriots suffer great pain, the first thing people want to do is forget. I think the reason why humans survive is the ability to forget; but with At the same time, in order to free yourself, you must retreat into your memory and face the shadows in order to understand what happened and free your soul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to war, we are fed a lot of lies about villains and heroes. When something terrible happens, it doesn&#39;t just affect the individual, a terrible war or social unrest, the trauma affects my family as well. and friends, will eventually slowly poison the surrounding community, and even the entire society. Because war is a black hole of horror, and those huge traumas are difficult to describe and spread. Those who have experienced it sometimes erase part of their memories. The responsibility falls on novelists, who try to piece together the past to better understand what happened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your father once said: &quot;You can forgive the past. , but you can’t forget.” You just mentioned releasing your soul. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I just said that people survive by forgetting, but they have to remember something, and people will hate it. You want to live because hate is a strong emotion, but ultimately, you can&#39;t move forward in your hate and you have to put it aside and find another way out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father experienced a very touching thing during his lifetime. About twenty years ago, three middle-aged Japanese women showed up at my house. They were incredibly brave and dedicated their lives to documenting Japan’s war crimes. One of them wrote a book about Unit 731, a horrific crime committed by the Japanese in your country. She suffered a lot in Japan for writing this book. She herself is actually a survivor of the Tokyo bombing, a horrific crime committed by the Allies against Japan that killed more than 100,000 innocent civilians. But she came to my house with two other ladies. They wanted to apologize to my father. They did not represent the government or the Japanese people. I was very surprised. I never thought that someone from another country would come to my house and apologize to us. It meant a lot to our family to apologize and it was such a release for all of us. The feats of these three women taught me that there is a way out, and that it is not about dividing people into opposing sides, but that we can rise above it all and live a better outcome. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Salute to the open and free world&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You often mention your father, can you tell us about your mother and siblings?

We were all very close as brothers and sisters, and everyone was surprised that I became a writer. No one expected a writer from Tasmania. They read my books and liked my novels. Being a writer and winning the Booker Prize are honors, but in any family, you are ultimately a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, and what your family means to each other is the most important thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother was a lovely woman, full of stories. Tasmania was once the golden bag of the British Empire and a huge prison. Over the centuries, the British exiled felons here. Political prisoners, slave owners and slaves... all kinds of people came here. here. My ancestors are Irish, and there are many Catholics in Ireland. They gathered, intermarried, and settled here, forming a unique culture. Ireland is rich in stories and has produced many writers. I talk about my father because of &quot;The Road to the North&quot;, but I am very close to my mother. I have listened to her telling stories passed down from generation to generation since I was a child. Many of my writings come from my mother. Like women of her time, life was restricted and unlike Women today have all kinds of opportunities, but she was an amazing woman and I loved her so much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How has Irish literature influenced you? Are there any Irish writers that you particularly admire? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I admire many Irish writers, but the ones who really influence me are Borges, Neruda, and Marquez , Cortázar and other South American writers, because their world is more like the world of Tasmania. We have people here who do comedy, trying to find their own experience, their own reality and escape the colonial influence of the British, while they were trying to escape the colonial influence of Spain in South America. The beauty of Faulkner is that he was both an American writer and not, he was from the South but was never really accepted into the United States, but he had an important influence on French and South American literature, and in my opinion he really was the 20th century The central figure who achieved breakthroughs in novel writing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Death of the River Guide&quot; Aliash was not born in Tasmania, but in Trieste. Why did he choose this small European city as his birthplace? Joyce lived in Trieste, does this have anything to do with where he wrote &quot;Ulysses&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;That’s right! As you can imagine, Death of the River Guide was my debut novel, and I wanted my first &quot;child&quot; to be born in Trieste. Trieste is different from many places in the world. It is a mixture. It is freer and more open. It is not really Italy, it is not really Slovenia, and it is not really Germany, but it is all, all kinds of ideas. and culture meet there. What interests me is that Joyce wrote his great novel not in Paris, not in Dublin, but in this dilapidated, disintegrating old port. His writing was influenced by all these peoples, and he was deeply inspired by &quot;The Consciousness of Zeno&quot;, but the author Italo Svevo only used a pseudonym. He was an Italian Jew, and his real name was Ettore Schmitz. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another reason why Aliash was born in Trieste. My wife is from Slovenia. When I wrote &quot;The Death of the River Guide&quot;, Yugoslavia had just disintegrated and Slovenia had just Birth. I am very interested in multi-ethnic countries where different ethnic groups live together and often have frictions and conflicts, but sometimes they are full of creativity. You just asked me which writers I am influenced by. I mentioned South American writers, but I am also influenced by Central European writers. Before World War II, especially before the 1940s, those great &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Central European)&lt;/span>; writers did not represent their own countries; Greater ideas at the time, but after ethnic cleansing many places became small enclaves. Australia, which was a very racist country for most of the 20th century, now opens its doors and welcomes everyone in and is a richer place because of its cultural and spiritual tolerance. Central Europe at the beginning of the 20th century allowed me to see a world full of hope. I made the protagonist in my novel live in Trieste to pay tribute to that open and free world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Hometown pain&quot;: I have never left home, but I feel vaguely separated from my hometown and feel deeply lost&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;About your new work &quot;The Surging Sea in Dreams&quot; published in 2020, you once mentioned that this work is related to &quot;Hometown Pain&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（solastalgia）&lt;/span>;The artistic conception of this new word is related. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a new word proposed by an Australian philosopher: When a person&#39;s environment is destroyed and his heart is lost, I vaguely feel that I am separated from my homeland. I have never left home, but I feel the painful feeling of being a stranger in a foreign land. The term began to be used heavily after Australia experienced its horrific bushfires. That&#39;s the feeling one gets after a hometown has gone through some hard times and realizes that the good old days are gone forever. I think the trauma of so many precious things being taken away from us in the name of development and progress, which benefits only a few and deprives everyone else, affects us in very real ways. causing a devastating blow to the body and mind. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ChimdINzerF1E9e4aSYlKuu6POdH2vTuv4HJnZsq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ChimdINzerF1E9e4aSYlKuu6POdH2vTuv4HJnZsq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252417&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 17, 2018, one-way space in Beijing, Chinese writer Yu Hua (right) talks with Australian writer Richard Flanagan&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In &quot;The Surging Sea in Dreams&quot;, facing a disaster, the heroine Anna keeps checking the news updates on her mobile phone, but her fear and anxiety only increase.

At the beginning of the novel, I quoted the English Romantic poet John Clare&#39;s &quot;Memorial&quot;: &quot;The ax of destroyers and selfish desires has cut down its prey; / I will never see the water lily path and the narrow round oak street here again / There are also large hollow trees like church pulpits: / The enclosure movement was like Napoleon, eradicating everything...&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The enclosure movement in the 19th century was a very tragic and terrible event in European history. thing, but I think there&#39;s a new enclosure movement in the world now that&#39;s taking away from us those things that anchor us spiritually. People started losing limbs, eyes, knees...no one noticed, and at the same time we were checking our phones more and more every day instead of paying attention to what was going on in the real world. With the rise of social software, many people’s souls have been occupied. Everyone has a public life and a private life and a secret life, and great literature creates characters in conflict who do one thing and think the opposite, and there is a third side that they don&#39;t understand either. Why are we so contradictory? This is what we humans are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, these technologies allow us to display our private lives publicly, interpret our lives, and turn them into benefits to please others. This is a threat to us no matter where we are, and for most people, I think, ultimately, their presence is not to help us, but to exploit us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think you are a pessimist or an optimist? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Flanagan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Neither. In &quot;The Surging Sea in Dreams&quot;, Anna&#39;s mother said before her death that the world is so beautiful, but few people see it. I think the world is beautiful when I find those lovely people, but we often choose to turn a blind eye. The more we allow ourselves to see, the greater our hope becomes. So I am not pessimistic. I try to discover the simple beauty in people every day. I believe that this little bit of joy will nourish you and keep you alive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“助农”靠假货，走红靠演技？野生MCN怎么成了“凉山制造”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258014]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访《人世间》导演李路：“任何时代都是以小人物为分母构成的”丨影视大咖谈③]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257479]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 03/03/mzmGTNwphgKGgaj8DF3clEEGx4gUPgwnkEr4HE63.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/03/03/mzmGTNwphgKGgaj8DF3clEEGx4gUPgwnkEr4HE6 3. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;185579&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the TV series &quot;Human World&quot;, the head of the Zhou family, Zhou Zhigang, returned from the junior college after his retirement. &quot;Photographic films&quot; to my hometown and the urban-rural fringe area. Even so, it is difficult for the family to reunite and make dumplings during the New Year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the crew)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TV series &quot;The World&quot; shows the &quot;silent generation&quot; and also brings to life the &quot;silent generation&quot; generation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning, it was China in 1969. In Jichun City, a provincial capital city in Northeast China, a young man named Zhou Bingkun experienced two major events: one was witnessing death row prisoners being paraded and shot, and the other was working together in a factory workshop My son&#39;s good friend was deeply shocked; secondly, his father Zhou Zhigang wanted to work as a bricklayer in the &quot;third front&quot; to support the construction of the third front. His brother Zhou Bingyi and sister Zhou Rong also responded to the call to &quot;go to the mountains and countryside&quot; and became educated youths. Zhou Bingkun and his mother depended on each other. The family&#39;s life trajectory has changed dramatically since then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story unfolds from here, spanning fifty years. The five members of the Zhou family, who are from the working class and are the permanent residents of &quot;Light Word Film&quot;, are the center of the story, from which branches and branches radiate. In addition to the Zhou family, there are as many as hundreds of characters appearing in &quot;The World&quot;, outlining the &quot;big rivers&quot; of a generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play is adapted from the novel &quot;Human World&quot; by writer Liang Xiaosheng and Mao Dun Literary Award-winning novel of the same name. When director Li Lu got the novel, &quot;Human World&quot; had not yet won the award. Li Lu was so moved after reading it that he decided to adapt it into a TV series. His two previous masterpieces were the anti-corruption drama &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; and the legal drama &quot;Itinerant Prosecution Team&quot;. Earlier, he was the deputy director of production at Nanjing Film Studio and the director of the TV Drama Production Center of Jiangsu TV Station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Lu is ambitious in making TV series. If he wants to make a film, he must make a great work. The little characters in &quot;Human World&quot; meet his inner definition of &quot;greatness&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the project was finalized, Li Lu asked Liang Xiaosheng to meet. The first thing he asked Liang Xiaosheng during the meeting was: Why do you want to write this novel? Liang Xiaosheng told him that it was just some personal feelings at first. Liang Xiaosheng&#39;s father was a construction worker in the &quot;Grand Third Front&quot;. He left home in the mid-1950s and only returned every few years. After finally returning home to visit relatives, the &quot;educated youth&quot; Liang Xiaosheng went to the countryside again. He always missed his father and saw him very rarely. One of the reasons why Liang Xiaosheng wrote &quot;Human World&quot; was to make up for the lack of emotion. Especially after the death of his father, he felt that he should use words to pay tribute to that generation of workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation of Liang Xiaosheng&#39;s family is very similar to that of the Zhou family in &quot;The Human World&quot;. During the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, his father went to the third line, and Liang Xiaosheng and his eldest brother went to the countryside. The mother, brother, sister and one child were left in the family. Little brother. The elder brother suffers from mental illness, and the younger brother bears the burden of taking care of the whole family. Zhou Bingkun in the play has the shadow of his little brother. &quot;These young people who stay in ordinary working families in the city are almost missing in our literature, drama, film and television dramas. They are rarely shown and they are a silent generation. So I will write a book for them.&quot; Liang Xiaosheng said in the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Xiaosheng also had questions about Li Lu. He asked Li Lu: Why should such a novel be made into a TV series? Li Lu replied: &quot;I have feelings for the theme of workers.&quot; Seven years ago, Li Lu spent his own money to acquire an industrial-themed novel, but could not find a screenwriter. Like Liang Xiaosheng, Li Lu is also from the Northeast. When he was growing up, he witnessed the prosperity and decline of Northeast heavy industry, and also witnessed the pain and perseverance of workers in the face of being laid off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since &quot;Human World&quot; was launched on January 28, 2022, it has become a hot topic on the Internet. The angle of discussion covers all aspects and overflows the play itself - there are discussions about success and filial piety: Part 1 Who is more successful or more filial, the elder brother and sister from Peking University, who returned from school to become the deputy governor, and the younger brother who never went to college and devoted himself to taking care of the family? Someone discussed love: The old couple of the Zhou family have not seen each other for several years. Is there any love between them? My sister Zhou Rong risked everything for love and went to a mountain ravine to accompany the poet to live a hard life and become an educated youth. Years later, she had to face her lover&#39;s cheating and betrayal. Was her efforts worth it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the broadcast of &quot;Human World&quot;, Li Lu often received WeChat messages from friends. A doctor friend sent a WeChat message and repeatedly confirmed to him, &quot;Bingkun and Bingyi, are they okay in the future?&quot; ? No problem, right?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe this type of drama has become less popular over the years, so it really touches everyone&#39;s hearts.&quot; Li Lu told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Lu remembers that when &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; was broadcast in 2017, &quot;There was feedback from all walks of life, including many provincial leaders who watched &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; during lunch and sat there with their lunch boxes. , as well as the people in the army and the grassroots of society, it is really a broken circle. This time we are also paying close attention to whether the circle is really broken in the true sense. Is it you who are shouting, or more people like it after dinner.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;It must be warmth as the background color&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Original work by Liang Xiaosheng &quot;The Human World&quot; is called &quot;the epic of the common people.&quot; When you decided to shoot &quot;The Human World&quot;, how did you understand and sort out this work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was June 2018 when I got &quot;Human World&quot;. At that time, it had not won the Mao Dun Literature Award, and it had not yet won the Mao Dun Literature Award. It’s not called a “popular epic,” just a set of novels that have just been published. After &quot;In the Name of the People&quot;, I took on some projects, but I felt that none of them surpassed &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; and &quot;Inspection Team&quot;, which made the cooperation team very difficult. They asked what kind of theme you should choose, and I said, great, just three words. Later, a literary editor told me that Liang Xiaosheng had just published a novel that you should read, but it was longer, with 1.15 million words. I read this novel and was very interested. But there is still a huge difference between text and visuals, and the reading level and viewership are completely different. Therefore, there needs to be an improvement from the novel text to the script, and there is another way to go from the script to the visualization. The 58-episode TV series now presented to the audience is an extremely compact version that we have made, because we rough cut it to 88 episodes, fine cut it to 72 episodes, submit it for review to 66 episodes, and finally compress it to 58 episodes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You hope to make a great work, &quot; &quot;Human World&quot; tells the story of a group of small people. Is there a connection between the two? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To clearly see the huge power behind the words of the novel &quot;The World&quot;, this may not be seen by many people. How can writing the youth history of such a small family, an alley, and an area reflect the tremendous changes in China over the past fifty years? How can it have huge appeal and influence? Speaking of conscience requires discernment. Some people even questioned the Internet sense, and some questioned the age level of the audience, whether anyone would watch such a story about suffering, etc. I am the overall person in charge and the actual operator of this drama. From the selection of materials to the gestation and layout of this drama, I have always been like &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; (I signed the contract with the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate Film and Television Center with my personal ID card). I know how to make this kind of play, who should be cast, and on what platform it will be broadcast. It is very clear. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the filming of &quot;The Human World&quot; was finalized, I met with teacher Liang Xiaosheng. After meeting me, I wanted to hear Teacher Liang’s original intention of creating it. Just like when I approached Zhou Meisen, Zhou Meisen impressed me with just one sentence. He told me what kind of &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; he wanted to make and how to make it. This time too, after Teacher Liang came, I think everyone has the same point of view. They have a sense of mission. They want to serve the people, want to serve the common people, and want to serve the people and things of this era, which have undergone drastic changes in Chinese history over the past 50 years. Given visual and written proof, everyone still has feelings for family and country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven years ago, I personally paid for a novel about factory industry, but I couldn’t find a screenwriter and no one would write it. I think this is also inevitable, because seven years ago we were still walking around in absolute entertainment, and no one would sit down and watch it when it was filmed. Therefore, the most important thing is that many things happen at the right time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The opening of &quot;Human World&quot; is about the years of educated youth during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; , what are your thoughts on the presentation of this special historical period? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Liang Xiaosheng’s “scar literature” is “good human literature”, which has left a deep mark on the literary world. But this time in the TV series, we did not add more words to the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and the issue of educated youth, and used only a few words to represent a community. For example, the female educated youth who plays the piano is a southern educated youth from Shanghai. When she came to Northeast China, it was so cold. In her words, my hands were reserved for playing the piano and could not do menial work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, there were many stories about educated youth like this, but we didn’t exaggerate or expand it, we just filmed the plot truthfully. She sacrificed a lot to return to the city, but even for such a small character, we didn&#39;t write her off without writing a single word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Scar literature&quot; was very popular during a historical period. Gradually faded out of public view. What do you think of scar literature, especially adapting it into film and television works that can be accepted today? What is the biggest challenge you face? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; &quot;Scar literature&quot; is a term used in a specific historical period after the reform and opening up. Nowadays, it is no longer necessary to mention &quot;scar literature&quot;. It fits. &quot;Human World&quot; is not about scars, but about the fireworks of the world. It does not mock anything with a critical eye, but every little bit of life reflects the changes of the times. If you like this work, you must agree with the values. You can only do it if you have passion. If you don’t have passion, you can’t do it, so just shoot something else. I agree with the theme and values ​​of the novel &quot;Human World&quot;. What I did was make some convergences from the visualization aspect. When I was doing the overall planning, I determined that warmth was the background, and the adaptation would be centered around this. When filming &quot;In the Name of the People&quot;, the evaluation of the TV Drama Department of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television at that time was that light holds darkness, justice holds evil, and this ratio must be used correctly. The proportions of our play use warmth as the base color. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/03/03/ssiVQVSPSZbhaj8VuyMPrrmwlwkRwr3BAfiE7VFp.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;598&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/03/03/ssiVQVSPSZbhaj8VuyMPrrmwlwkRwr3BAfiE7VFp.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;185586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Lu believes that &quot;Human World&quot; is not about scars, but about fireworks in the world, in which every little bit of life reflects the changes of the times. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the crew)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;There is a blue sky in any era, and the sun rises every day&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What changes did you make from the novel to the TV series? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We change words and scenes. There are many examples like this. Sometimes we change the line of action. The screenwriter condensed the original novel in the second creation, because you can&#39;t tell it too eloquently like the novel, after all, the episodes are here and the characters are here. Shooting is another conceptual matter. The on-site actors have some improvisations, the director has some improvisations, and there are even some desk adjustments that need to be made. Our cast of actors this time is of a relatively high standard, and they basically all have the same background in acting. In this case, the director&#39;s responsibility is to identify and identify, this is okay, that is not okay, and there is no need to ask them to act exactly as I want. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Teacher Ding Yongdai plays Zhou Bingkun’s father. When he joined the crew, he had just finished filming &quot;Across the Yalu River&quot; and played Peng Dehuai. After he came, he kept his hands in his hands every day, like a general, so I became anxious, &quot;Old Ding, Brother Ding, take your hands off. You are an old worker now. Hunch your waist a little bit, be a little bit silly.&quot; Come on, we don&#39;t have thousands of troops here!&quot; He was really a good actor. He came back after a few days and lowered his body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These require the skills of actors, but also require the crew to create a creative atmosphere. Many people who came to visit the class were shocked. We had an RV lounge. Basically, no one ran outside when we were changing lights and lenses. We all sat there chatting and watching each other&#39;s performances. It was very quiet. No one was posing or running around. They were all quietly preparing for the next scene and the next shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The protagonist in &quot;Human World&quot; is a &quot;light type film&quot; The Zhou family, as well as the various characters associated with them, total more than a hundred people. How did you arrange these characters? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I found the screenwriter Wang Hailu and invited her to come. Not long after, the new crown epidemic broke out and I returned to Beijing from other places. After reading more than a dozen episodes of the script, I watched it from night to daybreak. Tears filled my eyes. I was very excited and sent a long WeChat message to Wang Haiyu, saying that this direction was the right one and it was done. Teacher Hailu&#39;s refining and description of the topic is similar to the novel, but there are also differences. For example, the character Luo Shibin was my proposition. I said there should be such a person. He is a businessman, a generation of businessmen who came up after the reform and opening up. There is no one in the original novel, and Luo Shibin provided a color comparison board. Like Zhou Bingkun, he is a small person. He has no success in the worldly sense, but you can see the ferment on the Internet now that &quot;a stupid son will benefit his parents&quot; and &quot;the old trouble in the family is actually the warm baby of his parents.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We did not expect that the social discussion would extend to so many places, but the benevolence, justice, propriety, wisdom, trust, filial piety, and the warmth between people reflected in the light-type film are what we value more. , or in other words, there is still a corner of people’s hearts that has been missing over the years. You see the scene that often appears in Korean dramas, that of a family having a delicious meal. It is true that over the years, the population of our family has become more and more sparse, the flavor of the year has become less and less, the human touch has become less and less, the neighbors do not interact with each other, and the only child has no family community. However, although it is rare, you cannot say that everyone does not have it in their heart. They all have it, but they are not awakened. This play has an awakening function, which is to weave here the warm connection between human relationships, family, country, small and big things that the Chinese people have had for thousands of years. Following this direction, we removed some peripheral things and made warmth one of the main themes of the play, so that everyone can feel more about the great changes in China in the past fifty years, composed of officials, workers, and people from all walks of life. The product of hard work, dedication, and forbearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The appearance of Zheng Juan (Zhou Bingkun&#39;s wife) played by Yin Tao is surprising deep impression. It was obviously a shabby thatched house, a down-and-out woman without cotton pants, but the scene of her sitting on the kang skewering candied haws and making a living was eye-catching. What considerations did you take when shooting a scene like this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We spent a long time filming the scene where Yin Tao appears. If we go by the pace of a TV series, it would be very expensive. We spent a lot of time filming it. A lot of time is spent on lighting and scenery. If we follow the pace of some dramas, one episode in three days or one episode in four days, it would be impossible to shoot this scene. From our perspective, there is a blue sky in any era, the sun rises every day, and there are beautiful people in even the darkest corners, it just depends on which perspective you look at. Although Zheng Juan&#39;s home was bare with only a few broken cabinets and rotten cotton quilts, her beauty could not be blocked, otherwise Zhou Bingkun wouldn&#39;t have been so moved as soon as he saw Zheng Juan. So any age has its own unstoppable beauty, especially for our show. Disney bought the copyright a month after the filming started, and it wants to be broadcast around the world. So we have this awareness all the time, not only for ourselves. Every family, this play will travel across the ocean. You can be broken, but you can&#39;t be dirty. Your window grilles may be very poor, but they still need to be clean. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The protagonists in the play, the Zhou family and his son, especially Do you think the relationship between Bingkun and his father is a typical Chinese father-son relationship? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, Zhou Bingkun and his father are the kind of father-son relationship we are calling for or have had. Zhou&#39;s father worked as a bricklayer in the &quot;Grand Third Line&quot;. He was an eighth-level bricklayer. His income was not low at that time, equivalent to the income of a senior cadre. The lines are also mentioned. Since he got married, he has not met Li Suhua, his wife, many times. He took three years of family leave, and sometimes he saved it when he couldn&#39;t come back. One year, the Spring Festival was even eight years away. Come back, think about it, how many eight years does a person have in his life? Zhou Bingkun is undoubtedly the biggest male protagonist in this drama. The character who tells the most about the destiny of the whole drama is Bingkun. The novel uses a low-down perspective, a person who has not succeeded in the worldly sense, and the ups and downs of his life&#39;s destiny as the narrative point. I think this is the main reason why Liang Xiaosheng&#39;s novel won the Mao Dun Literature Award - little people, big heroes. Any era is composed of these people as the denominator. It is impossible for everyone to succeed and become a big shot. Life is the accumulation of countless Zhou Bingkun. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;In the Name of the People&quot; is your other It was a masterpiece that was not favored by everyone at the time. Unexpectedly, a theme film later became a hit. The same is true for &quot;In the World&quot; this time. What is your secret? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Lu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If there was a formula for making a hit, then everyone could make a hit. &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; and &quot;In the World&quot; are two completely different genres and plots. &quot;In the Name of the People&quot; has a strong plot and a sense of time against the background of the anti-corruption craze at that time. But &quot;Human World&quot; does not have these two items. It has neither a strong plot nor a strong timeliness of anti-corruption. Instead, it is narrated. (They) are completely hits with two techniques and two styles. Hot hits are the result. Without the passion and thinking in this area, it would be impossible to make this kind of thing. It must be inspired by feelings, passion, and responsibility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot;

This is for investigators from all over the world doing ethnoanthropological research. Different from the village youths, he went to Gejiu, a major town in southern Yunnan, to work for two years before he was 20 years old. He then returned to the village and worked as a team leader and veterinarian. Six years ago, he began to organize nearby left-behind children and teach them to sing and dance traditional Hani. Song and dance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Puchun, the administrative village to which Qielong Zhongzhai belongs, is the birthplace of Hani multi-part folk songs, a national intangible cultural heritage, and Che Zhixiong’s father, Che Kesan, is the provincial inheritor. . In 2018, after attending the one-week village imaging training class of &quot;Village Eyes&quot; in the county seat, Che Zhixiong excitedly set up a Canon DV distributed by a charity organization, shot and recorded the life and festivals of Qielongzhong Village, and then recorded his The edited materials are saved to the hard drive for researchers from Kunming to take away when they come over. &quot;In the past three years, two 4T hard drives have been filled up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another house opposite the residence is Che Zhixiong&#39;s new home. . Last summer, with the help of 40,000 yuan in project start-up funds donated by a caring fan of Wang Yibo, Brother Che emptied the first floor and repainted it, turning it into a &quot;local imaging and cultural transmission hall.&quot; On the wall between the load-bearing columns, two LCD TVs are hung. The station at the door was broadcasting a CCTV set of the rice-planting gate opening ceremony filmed and produced in the village. When the rice-planting girl marries the young man from the field in early spring, the villagers who plant the rice-planting are all the bridesmaids and best men. Planting the rice-planting in a good field means marrying into a good family. Che Kesan frequently appears in the camera. As the ditch leader, he has to strictly measure the proportion of each ditch dug to ensure that the water from the forest reservoir flows fairly and accurately into the field ridges of each household. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TV inside is Che Zhixiong&#39;s own &quot;Personal Film Exhibition&quot;. The sudden heavy hailstorm, the city children who came here for study tours, and the slaughter of cattle to worship the gods during the &quot;June Year&quot;, each section is an anthropological documentary with a complete narrative and clear rhythm. &quot;Most of my peers don&#39;t understand so many Hani rituals, let alone children. I only have a third-grade elementary school education, and all I can do is film and edit all the festivals here,&quot; Village Eyes &#39;People then use it to add subtitles. As for Kuaishou Douyin, it may occasionally attract attention, but it is not complete and even the surface is not captured.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;New documentary director Che Zhixiong, Talk about your creative passion. He then pointed to the &quot;One Year&#39;s Festival Ritual&quot; display board on the wall between the two LCD TVs. For example, in the first month of the lunar calendar, the Hani people hold Lazuozuo and Angmatu successively, both of which are sacrificial ceremonies for the dead. &quot;Our ancestors will turn into little gods after they die, and they may come back to harass us. After death, the little gods will turn into great gods, and only then will they bless us. We kill cows for sacrifice to ensure that they can turn into great gods. . When the great god dies, it turns into dew, which drips down at night to irrigate the terraced fields and breed new life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It happened that an old man in the village was about to leave, so the driver took me to where the villagers kept watch. room. All the middle-aged and elderly people who stayed behind gathered here. The woman was in the back room, and the man was on the terrace, drinking pot-stewing wine just scooped out of a sealed earthen vat, chewing green chili peppers dipped in chili oil, and chatting in Hani dialect. The old man who smoked hookah encouraged me to be more generous, &quot;Go inside with your phone and take pictures.&quot; The daughter of the deceased man came back and told me, &quot;She is 80 years old, there is no need to stay in the hospital and suffer, let everyone have fun It&#39;s our tradition to stay with you.&quot; Later, most people would go home and sleep, but there would always be someone staying with them to wait for the final moments. Che Zhixiong carried the old man on his back, and while watching him the documentary he shot on TV, he told me, &quot;The bema (shaman) in the village will calculate the exact day to leave, and the funeral will begin three days before.&quot; . The posthumous affairs are more grand, and one or twenty cows may have to be killed and raised in the underworld for the deceased. This is not an exaggeration.

Jiang refers to the Red River that flows to Vietnam and divides Red River Prefecture into two. Places such as Jianshui and Mengzi, which have many Han immigrants and are economically developed, are in the north and are called inside the river; while counties such as Yuanyang, Honghe and Luchun, which have developed world heritage terraced landscapes, are outside the river, which is backward. Yisa means &quot;drought and water shortage&quot; in the dialect of the Yi people who first came here to open up wasteland. During the Qianlong period, copper mines were discovered in the mountains, and immigrants followed the mining industry. These ancestors also experienced a history of prosperity and decline with the Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the copper mines dried up and the new mountain people had no land to cultivate. They had to drag horses and go deep into the mountains and forests of Southeast Asia to do trade. They gradually developed from traditional caravans to tobacco gangs. In the early years of the Republic of China, the government&#39;s vigorous crackdown on opium led to a sharp increase in black market profits. Cigarette gangs organized and strengthened private militia to safeguard their vested interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/QislqJmk9cSDUoAKbbAG0tgxBY4Qsgb2olkGz6R6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/QislqJmk9cSDUoAKbbAG0tgxBY4Qsgb2olkGz6R6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170802&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; The French designers I knew drew drawings and hired Jiangnan craftsmen to build various stone mansions with European-style exteriors and Chinese-style interiors, row upon row on the hills.

The cool guy with a ponytail stepped forward and said, &quot;I That’s Ah Wen.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I went from the village to the county cultural center to work when I was sixteen or seventeen years old. Now I am 35 years old, and I have dedicated all my youth to musical instruments.” In the restaurant next to Daguangtang in the center of the ancient town, Ah Wen Wen continued to introduce himself. &quot;I quit my job last year. I know nothing but making musical instruments. I&#39;m so hurt by music!&quot; Although he was a little sad, when he was flipping through the various beautiful instruments on his phone, Awen became excited again, &quot;I ride a motorcycle. When I visited various villages in Hani, I couldn&#39;t put it down when I saw these treasures. Every sanxian and every straw have different materials, appearance and sound quality. They can&#39;t be made in factories. They will be gone when the older generation leaves. I can only Take photos and videos, listen to the sounds, and restore them all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After dinner, we walked through the lush Xishan Park and walked to the musical instrument workshop next to the County Cultural Center. Master Wu Zhiming was lying on a bamboo chair. When he heard me say that he had just come from Qielong Zhongzhai, memories of his life came back to him, &quot;It can be said that it was them who started my career, and I played a role as a link between past and future.&quot; 1986 In May, when Wu Zhiming, who was employed by the County Culture and Sports Bureau, went to Puchun to collect folk music, he heard the eight-part chorus of rice-planting girls coming from a distance, and followed the sound to find it... Later, he changed from a county actor to a song and dance creator. and music theory researchers, and brought Hani singing and dancing to the world. Ah Wen and Che Zhixiong have traveled as far as Shandong and Beijing respectively, but their master and father have already traveled to Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and the Netherlands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/tVMULXeHWW8OLcd8NgjmsJDwCvNAXOyQAPZFErVa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/tVMULXeHWW8OLcd8NgjmsJDwCvNAXOyQAPZFErVa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170798&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Awen from Yisa Town Musical Instrument Making Workshop&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Like those young and middle-aged people in the city who are separated from their work units and pursue personal values, Awen also worries about how to monetize his hobbies. &quot;Many scholars and teachers can only provide spiritual support, but &#39;Village Eyes&#39; has raised 10,000 to 20,000 yuan for me.&quot; . But there are many others, but even a small business loan of 50,000 yuan cannot be approved.&quot; With the capital, Awen can build his own studio and improve the efficiency of working all night and three days to make two sanxian. One piece. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You still have to be realistic and start with a wind instrument that saves time and materials. Although it is not as good as the cucurbit flutes in the pedestrian streets of ancient cities, you should try to reduce the production cost first, and then put it into Go to the Samaba Visitor Center to try out the sales.&quot; Xu Tianming, an old colleague who still works at the County Cultural Center, reminded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tianming is from the Yi ethnic group. In June 2021, under the guidance of the state song and dance troupe, he and other colleagues rehearsed the first courtyard drama &quot;Caravan Women&quot; in Honghe Prefecture. The Wanxing Courtyard was staged by relying on money. As the name of the play suggests, it tells the stories of chaste women displayed in this mansion. The dancers, from the image of disgraced grooms at the beginning, jumped to become a men&#39;s team in suits returning home joyfully, and the girls who looked through the love finally became the old mothers holding a revolving door, looking forward to the return of their husbands. Although the over-an-hour play is in a very complete musical format, it is not an original performance and is reduced to a series of popular Han-style compositions. Moreover, because the fee is not enough, embarrassing copyright information often comes out of the soundtrack. . Everything is difficult at the beginning. The ticket agent told me that starting with their play, all the counties and cities in Honghe Prefecture will create their own courtyard dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Hollowed Village, a Holiday Paradise for City People&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Xu Tianming suggested that Awen go to Samaba, which sells bamboo flutes. It is located at the end of the gently undulating hillside and is the most famous place in Honghe County. The scenic area has more than 14,000 acres of the world&#39;s largest concentrated contiguous terraces with more than 4,300 levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/zSqER3Vy9QkygwFuAaj3LctdJc5PEjeLIwS8jiab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/zSqER3Vy9QkygwFuAaj3LctdJc5PEjeLIwS8jiab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170801&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Samaba Terraces&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A on the other side of the landscape terraces Although Yinxiang is the birthplace of the 600-year-old Hani Street Festival, the most beautiful historical and cultural village &quot;Zuofu&quot; failed to retain a few mushroom houses with ethnic characteristics and was replaced by reinforced concrete. house. Of course, there is nothing wrong with pursuing a once-and-for-all residence, but &quot;it is good to leave many old things in the village and tidy them up. For example, at the east gate of the county, the two mansions of Yao and Qian were used as public prosecutors and detention centers respectively before they became museums. It has always been used as a reservation.&quot; Liu Zhigang, who manages Kangteng·Honghehe Valley Tent Camp deep in Jiayin Township, as an outside operator, has a relatively objective and neutral voice on rural protection and development issues, &quot;and it is not far from Jiayin Township. There is a Tusi Mansion, and it is very grandiose. It could not have been so grand before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conten Company, which creates high-end vacation products, chose the project outside the scenic area because it had to find convenience for renovation. of hollowed out villages. &quot;Shitou Village has been empty for more than ten years. There are only one or two families who have owned houses in the new village. They use the old houses to store farm tools. It is not difficult for us to use them as campsites.&quot; Liu Zhigang is now busy developing another hollow village. , Suhong Village in the core area of ​​Samaba Rice Terraces. To this end, a tourism investment company has been established with the county government, and famous architect Zhang Yonghe has been hired as the chief planner to create timeshare real estate based on the &quot;low-involvement&quot; concept to allow urbanites to live in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the heavy rain, the county road from the camp to Suhong Village was completely cut off by mudslides, and we had to climb down the narrow village road with hundreds of turns. The landscape along the road gradually changes from the rain-watered mulberry trees and red chrysanthemums at high altitudes to the steaming dense banana forest with broad leaves covering the sky. In the past, the smoke-traveling gang probably often did this, shuttling back and forth between alpine mountains and tropical dense forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/KYbublnB4r6wgP8I0WqZ0Dbqr5qVHJX5SbkP4LJZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/12/KYbublnB4r6wgP8I0WqZ0Dbqr5qVHJX5SbkP4LJZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;170804&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A corner of Suhong Village&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Hailu/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Hani people’s hoes are But the enemy&#39;s iron gun.

After finally settling in the &quot;two mountains and three rivers&quot; area consisting of Ailao Mountain, Wuliang Mountain, Lancang River, Yuanjiang River and Honghe River, with the help of my good friend Old Buffalo, we dug out magnificent terraces with hoe after hoe. Nowadays, except for a few local people who work in the camp due to the demand for original ecological services, for more Honghe youths like Awen who stay in their hometown, city people come to experience the terraced life of transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting in autumn, and setting up tents. It&#39;s so familiar that it won&#39;t be rare. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;People chasing hometown&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The NAS system of the computer in the Kunming office of &quot;Village Eyes&quot; stores a large number of documentaries shot by Che Zhixiong. This is a public welfare organization that helps farmers and herdsmen in western rural areas record the ecological and cultural changes in their hometown through their own ethnic perspective and using cameras as tools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who introduced Che Zhixiong to me was Li Xudong, a young man from his hometown who had just graduated more than a year ago. &quot;I studied hotel management at a private university. After graduation, I worked as a housekeeper in a high-end B&amp;B in Dali for two months.

The late well-known archaeologist Su Bingqi, who proposed the &quot;starry sky&quot; theory about the origin of Chinese civilization, once said that what we want to build is a modernization with Chinese characteristics commensurate with the ancient country of five thousand years of civilization. This naturally puts forward the idea of ​​five thousand years of civilization. What is the essence, what is the national soul, and what is the spiritual pillar? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of &quot;Chinese nation&quot; was proposed by Liang Qichao a hundred years ago, but even starting from the Liangzhu Culture characterized by jade culture, the civilization creation of our ancestors on the land of China has exceeded 5000 years. The Liangzhu ancestors’ divine and animal facial patterns, head-up and head-down dragons, and tomb forms with obvious ritual connotations, all clearly show that they are an important source of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese civilization naturally has more than one origin. In addition to the Liangzhu Culture in the Taihu Lake area, there are also the Hongshan Culture in western Liaoning, the Yangshao Culture in the Central Plains, the Pengtoushan-Chengbeixi Culture in the Yangtze River Basin, the Longshan Culture that is a fusion of various cultures in China, and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The basic spirit of Chinese civilization has gradually formed in the historical development, including the invention of square characters, the &quot;work&quot; of the &quot;system&quot; of the previous kings in the actual social development form, and the &quot;narration&quot; of the previous teachers, as well as The &quot;interpretation&quot; of scholars and intellectuals of all dynasties. Whether it is the &quot;new underground materials&quot; that are advancing rapidly in the modern era or the rich ancient documents dating back to Oracle Bone Inscriptions and Bronze Inscriptions, they can all help us today understand more deeply what the &quot;Chinese national spirit&quot; is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this understanding cannot only be directed towards the past. Although Zhou is an old state, its destiny is renewed. It is facing the future and participating in the present. Here, I try to summarize what I understand about Chinese civilization from five aspects: society, politics, faith, economy, and culture and education. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Society: Family Orientation and Individuality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From a social perspective, we attach great importance to the value of a small community such as &quot;family&quot;, which leads to the spirit of benevolence and individual personality. growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benevolent people are the most important to people who are close to each other. To be close means to be filial to one&#39;s parents, to be kind to one&#39;s children, and to be friendly to one&#39;s brothers and sisters based on human blood and nature. And &quot;Old people are like the old people, young people are like the young people&quot;, and this kind of love is extended to everyone. Different from Mohism’s proposition of universal love, as the mainstream of Han culture, Confucianism admits that “there are differences in love”, but it still has a feeling of universal love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern people tend to value individualism first. Does this kind of &quot;familism&quot; conflict with respect for individual personality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a motivational point of view, parents raising their children comes from their own nature and is the best natural mechanism to help individuals grow. Family love provides relatively pure love and good emotions between parents and children. In terms of children&#39;s growth, the family structure can provide more support. From the perspective of ethnic continuity, this culture is obviously beneficial to increasing fertility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dear love does not advocate unconditional submission. If parents are at fault, the &quot;Book of Filial Piety&quot; advocates that &quot;there are faults in the family&quot;, but it only advises parents to pay attention to their attitude and methods. Mencius encouraged everyone to &quot;nurture my awe-inspiring spirit&quot; and &quot;even if there are thousands of people, I will go there&quot;. It is a kind of personalism with abundant independent consciousness and free spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although in reality there are overbearing and irresponsible parents and rebellious children, this is precisely because they have betrayed the love of their relatives and cannot be blamed on this kind of balancing of family structure and individual personality. The social structure and value form of development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Family, a small community, constitutes a social unit, and the independent individuals with community and public care bred in it have become the foundation of the country. The laws promulgated by the governor should encourage this kind of love, but not destroy it. If conditions are created to make it easier for parents to raise their children and for children to get closer to their parents, it is care that nourishes this spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political ideal: The world is for the common good&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the mainstream of our culture, individuals not only live within the family structure, but also naturally extend to the country and the world. To cultivate oneself, manage one&#39;s family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world, in &quot;The Great Learning&quot;, individuals need to constantly study things to gain knowledge, be sincere and righteous, and expand their areas of concern and efforts to the vast areas of the country and the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When someone asked Confucius why he did not engage in politics, Confucius quoted &quot;Shangshu&quot; and replied: &quot;Filial piety is only filial piety, and friendship is with brothers.&quot; Politics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a social structure and cultural spirit, &quot;keeping the family together&quot; is already a part of public affairs. Expanding this spirit to a wider social space is also &quot;for government&quot; rather than for government. You must &quot;serve as an official in the government&quot; to enter politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern families are families of three or four, but in Chinese history, unless official laws deliberately required &quot;family separation&quot; to weaken the organizational strength of small communities, our culture often praised &quot;multi-generational families&quot;. &quot;Together under the same roof&quot; encourages large families to live together and help each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of large family living together combines the principles of &quot;kinship&quot;, &quot;respect for respect&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot; to form the social autonomy of a small community. From this, the tradition of gentry autonomy was derived. This made it possible to create a &quot;small government, big society&quot; where the imperial power did not extend to the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Zhou system of feudalism and founding of the country directly used family as a link to establish the basic political order of the entire Chinese world: on the one hand, the eldest son inheritance system was implemented to ensure the institutionalization and stability of the inheritance of power; On the one hand, talented people are selected to govern. Of course, the Zhou system still embodies moral governance in the family and the world, and the degree of openness of power is still limited. In the political field, the value that best embodies the spirit of the Chinese nation is the spirit of &quot;the world is for the common good.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original text of &quot;Book of Rites&quot; is: In the journey of the great road, the world is for the common good, selecting talents and talents, adhering to trust and cultivating harmony, old friends do not only kiss their relatives, do not only give birth to their children, so that the old will die well. The strong have their uses, the young have their talents, and those who are modest, widowed, lonely, and lonely are all supported... Another example is &quot;The king and his ministers are united by righteousness.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not all about the same surname&quot;... These political thoughts, which exude eternal brilliance, have broken through the &quot;kinship&quot; principle of the family and become a concrete manifestation of the commonwealth of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since selfish desires are difficult to eliminate, it is extremely difficult to achieve the goal of serving the world for the common good. Needless to say, the Qin system, from the Han and Tang dynasties to the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, the separation of imperial power and prime ministerial power, the system of admonishing officials and historians, the feudal system throughout the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties, the education of princes, and the system of co-governance of scholar-bureaucrats, etc., are only partial and It plays a certain role in the short term. Royal power is never truly under the law. The Chinese nation’s political spirit of “the world is for the common good” is so premature and yet so immature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the famous &quot;Debate between Righteousness, Benefit and Overlord&quot; with Chen Liang, Zhu Xi lamented decisively: For fifteen hundred years, he was just sitting on this, so it was just a matter of time to make up for it. Although there may have been some moderate prosperity during this period, the Tao taught by the three kings Yao and Shun, Zhou Gong and Confucius, has not yet been practiced in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the political standard of the world for the common good continues to exist. Whether to put the interests and happiness of the people first in governance, and whether to keep the economic, social and spiritual life vigorous and prosperous? These political requirements for governors are also an important dimension of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Economy: People have permanent property&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the economy, how does &quot;the world is for the common good&quot; be reflected? For the government, it is &quot;the king, why should he call it profit&quot;. From the emperor, princes to officials, managers at all levels should not compete with the people for profit; for the common people, it is &quot;those who have permanent property have perseverance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to do this specifically? What the government wants to do is to &quot;benefit the people according to their interests&quot; and naturally carry out production, trade and consumption activities based on the needs of the people in the world. Therefore, in the choice between cannon and butter, butter obviously takes precedence. This only requires the establishment of a service-oriented government that provides &quot;benefits at no cost&quot; and cannot compete with the people for profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Benevolent government must start from the borders.” The basis for the interests of the people is to ensure that citizens have their own three-acre land, and they can use their own land according to their personal and family interests. Judgment, to produce and trade. Although Mencius&#39;s proposition mainly focused on delimiting the boundaries of mine fields, its essence pointed to the determination of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Mencius also advocated encouraging commerce and protecting travelers by providing warehouses for merchants and requisitioning them in accordance with the law to avoid stagnant goods, only registering and inspecting but not collecting taxes, only doing labor service but not collecting land rent, etc. Let it be beneficial to farmers, so that all merchants in the world will be happy and willing to hide in their markets, all travelers in the world will be happy and willing to go out on their own roads, and all farmers in the world will be happy and willing to plow their fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the current economic reform is concerned, the confirmation and long-term stability of agricultural land rights, as well as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises, protecting the investment and property rights of the private economy in various fields, tax laws, etc., all fall into this category. economic issues. This also determines whether entrepreneurs have long-term confidence in the Chinese economy and whether they dare to make large investments. In short, the essence of the economic spirit of an ideal Chinese community is to achieve economic prosperity, prosperity and prosperity for the people, and ensure the material life of the people through the property rights, production and trade system of &quot;big public ownership and private ownership&quot; and the fiscal and taxation system that is light on corvee and light on taxes. of plenty. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Belief: The unity of nature and man&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For families, why should fathers be kind and sons should be filial? For rulers, why should the world be for the common good? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do ordinary people have perseverance only if they have perseverance? For a person like Yan Hui, why can he achieve &quot;a basket of food and a ladle of drink, and he cannot bear the worries, but his joy will not change even after he returns&quot;? How can he have perseverance without permanent income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This involves the fourth dimension of Chinese civilization, faith. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businessmen believed in the personified &quot;Emperor&quot; and were biased toward the dominating heaven; Zhou people believed in &quot;the destiny of heaven is constant, only virtue is the supplementary one&quot;, and in the dominating heaven there was a profound meaning of the heaven of righteousness; although Confucius &quot;revered &quot;Keep the ghosts and gods at a distance&quot;, but still &quot;offer sacrifices to the gods as if they were present&quot;, reminding the disciples to realize the sincere spirit of life from the great popularity of &quot;Heaven can say nothing&quot;, and firmly believe that they carry &quot;Heaven will not lose the grace&quot;, which deepened the Zhou people&#39;s The concept of destiny; in the Han Dynasty, Dong Zhongshu believed that humans are copies of heaven, that heaven and humans can sense each other, and can warn the king of his misconduct and mismanagement with &quot;disasters&quot;; by the Song and Ming dynasties, heaven mainly became the heaven of justice, tending to one an inner transcendence and infinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For heaven, most of the most outstanding kings and sages of the Chinese nation had a strong and heartfelt awe, and regarded the unity of heaven and man as their ultimate pursuit, thus giving integrity to daily life and political life. sense of meaning, certainty and direction. Mencius has a very vivid description of this realm of belief that is both ordinary and holy: what is desirable is called good, what is called self-belief is called faith, what is full is called beauty, what is full and glorious is called great, what is great is called transformation. Holy, what is holy but unknowable is called God. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Father&#39;s kindness and son&#39;s filial piety originate from the &quot;nature of destiny&quot; and from &quot;the child is free from the arms of his parents for three years&quot;. If this kind of human nature is brought into full play like Shun in &quot;Yao Canon&quot;, we can A saint who acquires a set of abilities including avoiding disasters, harmonizing the family, and governing the country is a saint who unites nature and man;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Emperor&quot; regards himself as the eldest son of Heaven to gain legitimacy and even sanctity, and must serve Heaven To carry on, we must nourish all people, and the world is for the common good;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinary people don’t understand this enough, and they don’t have the time to cultivate themselves. They need a constant income to have perseverance. This is normal, but it has a family “kissing” mechanism. With nourishment, there is still benevolence and righteousness in the heart. As long as you don&#39;t cut it off, you can also see the virtuous and considerate people; The obsession with external objects returns to the state of life where meaning flows. March is not contrary to benevolence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is extremely difficult to truly practice faith. For ordinary people, if they have permanent property and perseverance, maintain a comfortable life and common sense rooted in the meaning of family, they can become qualified members of the Chinese community; for people in high positions, if they cannot &quot;devour their heart and soul to understand heaven, &quot;If you cultivate your mind and cultivate your nature to serve Heaven&quot;, you will begin to pollute a large area from the source of law, politics, culture and education, and spread evil to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While Mencius affirmed that all people have the four ideals, he also clearly realized that &quot;human beings are somewhat different from beasts.&quot; He quoted from &quot;Shang Shu·Tai Oath&quot; that &quot;Heaven sees me and the people see me, and God listens to me and the people listen&quot;, and gave a principled explanation of the relationship between heaven and the people. God’s will is unpredictable and manifests itself through public opinion. A holy king who unites nature and man is rare to find in five hundred or even a thousand years, but secular kings who are holy because of their kings are everywhere. The reverence for heaven and the people is not empty talk, so it is necessary to establish a technical system to restrict the royal power, so that public opinion can be fully reflected, and governance can fully reflect public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public opinion may be divided and antagonistic, what should we do? Will it bring about the disadvantages of &quot;welfarism&quot;? Will the &quot;public opinion&quot; of this generation harm the &quot;public opinion&quot; of future generations? These challenges have entered the field of building a modern republic and legal system. In addition to drawing on the more mature modern governance system, we also need to give full play to the spirit of &quot;Spring of the First Year, King Zhengyue&quot; in &quot;Spring and Autumn&quot;. In the era of great changes, we should constantly return to the origin of politics and beliefs, consider profits and losses, and &quot;make&quot; new systems. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Literature and education: Respecting teachers, respecting morality, and vigorous spirit&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Liangzhu, Hongshan, Yangshao to Longshan, from Xia, Shang and Zhou to Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing, the Chinese community gradually formed and split frequently And it can be continuously unified, and the culture whose roots were formed over five thousand years will never be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a unified square character that has basically not changed since ancient times. Even though &quot;the winds are different in hundreds of miles, and the customs are different in thousands of miles&quot;, a county may have several dialects, but we can still recognize and identify with each other. There is also the ideological system from Zhou Confucius, Mencius, Xun, Lao and Zhuang. They have governed themselves and made history, and they have also learned from history and classics, providing rich resources for spiritual inspiration and institutional reconstruction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no insurmountable rivers or mountains in the land of China. Whether it is divided into feudal states or prefectures and counties, the gradually formed Zhou Wen and Han systems, Tang style and Song style are diverse but capable of unification, and have strong agglomeration effect. For thousands of years, no matter what force entered China, it would be transformed by Chinese culture to a large extent. They inherited Chinese culture and therefore gained basic recognition from the scholars in this tradition. This is the attraction and centripetal force of the Chinese national spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this cultural spirit faces not only the debate between China and the West, but also the changes in ancient and modern times. How to inherit and update our cultural spirit has been a major issue that several generations of intellectuals in modern times have struggled with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the Han Dynasty to the Tang and Song Dynasties, we spent thousands of years absorbing Buddhist culture, which not only gave birth to Chinese Zen Buddhism, but also gave birth to Taoism in the Song and Ming Dynasties. Since the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, in the face of the strong Western learning and Western politics, scholars from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and three places have translated a large number of translations, digested them quickly, practiced them politically, and compared and absorbed them academically, which has initially opened up a new situation for Chinese culture. The process is far from over. To return to the roots and create new things requires a free and powerful cultural and educational system that represents the fifth dimension of the Chinese national spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher is someone who teaches, teaches and resolves doubts. China has a tradition of scholarship. The Jixia Academy, which flourished 2,400 years ago, was once an international academic center in China, even though it was officially run by the Qi State. Scholars from Taoism, Confucianism, Legalism, Ming Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Agriculture, Yin and Yang, Mencius, Xunzi, Shen Buhai, Lu Zhonglian, Shen Dao and other scholars whose names were important for a time and even influenced thousands of years are here to &quot;discuss without ruling&quot;, &quot; &quot;Discussing state affairs without holding office&quot;, the ideological power derived from this has surged forward with the source of living water, and its influence continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Confucius broke away from &quot;learning in the government&quot; and gave private lectures, to the &quot;Jingshe&quot; in the Han Dynasty, from the &quot;academy&quot; where individuals studied and lectured in the Tang Dynasty, to the Yuelu Academy in the Southern Song Dynasty, where Zhang Shi lectured , the Bailudong Academy restored by Zhu Xi... The folk academy system is well-established, with independent subject-based teaching systems, autonomous methods for students to participate in management, and relatively independent funding sources, finally forming a mature private school system. By the Ming Dynasty, academies such as Longgang, Guiyang, and Kuaiji, which were founded or presided over by Wang Yangming and promoted the purpose of Xinxue, changed to Donglin Academy, which criticized the shortcomings of Xinxue and advocated practical learning. This has never ceased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These academies have the character of pursuing the Tao rather than seeking official positions, the style of study of free debate, the aura of making friends to help others, and the worldly sentiments of &quot;the sound of wind and rain, the sound of reading, family affairs, state affairs, and world affairs.&quot; In &quot;Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot;, Huang Zongxi even put forward the view that &quot;what the emperor is right may not necessarily be right, and what the emperor is wrong may not be wrong, so the emperor will not dare to be wrong for himself and publicize his right and wrong to the school.&quot; Right and wrong and truth were elevated to a higher status than the emperor, restoring the traditional essence of discussing politics based on Tao, and inspiring people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern intellectuals need to inherit the spirit of scholars, not only to interpret and continue the great ancient Chinese civilization, but also to &quot;work&quot; according to the times and explore new philosophical, institutional and scientific principles. In short, the foundation of this cultural and educational system is the guarantee of the institutionalization and legalization of &quot;teachers&quot; and &quot;scholars&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conclusion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The final conclusion: This article believes that heaven (the belief system in which heaven and man are unified), earth (the economic system in which people have permanent property), and the country (the political system in which the world is for the common good) System), relatives (kinship is the most important, a personality development system nurtured in the family structure), and teachers (a cultural and educational system full of dynamic research, preaching and civilized dialogue), the above five constitute the main content of Chinese civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国跳水队包揽亚运会跳水项目首个比赛日的两枚金牌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258022]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 19:38:40&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 30, 2023, Chinese group Quan Hongchan (right)/Chen Yu Xi in the competition.

The imaginary group of people gradually disappeared on the other side of the misty water, but the imaginary wine and food still exuded steam, as if chasing the sound of construction and singing that had just disappeared... More than two thousand years passed by in a blink of an eye, and this road from North China The rivers flowing across the plains brought me closer to those people and things that were far away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The river is named Yishui, and it is famous in history because of that famous farewell. ——That year, they sang softly by the river:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wind rustles and the water becomes cold,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strong man will never return once he is gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/qHq4WGuD8LlEMzMFhaZ0nMRZjeTLpZxv9oW0uzru.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/qHq4WGuD8LlEMzMFhaZ0nMRZjeTLpZxv9oW0uzru.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yishuihan, Yixian County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Yandu&lt;/span>; h4>; &lt;p>;The North China Great Plain extends to Yixian County, Hebei Province, and has reached its western edge. In the county town, looking to the west from a high altitude, a line of dark mountains stretches across the end of the plain, which is the Taihang Mountains that separate the North China Plain and the Shanxi Plateau. The Yishui that gives Yixian County its name originates from the eastern foothills of Taihang Mountain. In fact, the Yishui is not one river, but divided into three: North Yishui, Zhongyishui and Nanyishui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various signs that that famous farewell should be on the shore of Zhongyi River. The man named Jing Ke, when he finished singing generously amidst the sound of Gao Jianli&#39;s construction, and everyone&#39;s eyes were splitting with anger, he had already jumped on the carriage and headed to Xianyang, the capital of Qin, two thousand miles away. In order to repay Prince Dan for his kindness, he is going to perform an almost impossible task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the traffic conditions at that time, there were two roads for him to choose. One was to go south, along the Great Plains to today&#39;s Kaifeng, Henan, and then turn west; the other was to follow the Yishui River, Passing through Puyinxing and Feihuxing among the eight hidden tunnels in the Taihang Mountains, they entered today&#39;s Shanxi, then traveled southwest, crossed the Yellow River from Pujin, and entered Guanzhong. For no reason, I think Jing Ke would probably choose the latter. Although the latter journey is more difficult, the mileage is shorter. What is particularly important is that perhaps, only when he slowly climbed from the flat plain to the majestic mountain - at that time, the wind was also blowing, blowing Jing Ke&#39;s white robe - he stood at the mountain pass, and then turned back to take one last look at the sad scene under the sunset. The windy home is more in line with Jing Ke’s character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Jing Ke appeared on the scene, the life of Yan State had entered a countdown. And Jing Ke, a native of Wei, is undoubtedly a colorful part of the historical drama of Yan. The 800-year history of the Yan Kingdom came to a desolate and tragic end with Jing Ke&#39;s stubbornness and despair in attacking Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The history of Yan State must start from three hundred miles north of Yishui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is also a river, a river that is shallower and thinner than Yi Shui: Liuli River. The Liuli River is an insignificant tributary of the Haihe River Basin. When it flows into Fangshan District, Beijing, a small town surrounded by the Liuli River is named after the Liuli River. To the east of the town, a number of Shang and Zhou cultural relics and sites have been excavated since the 1940s. Now, relying on the ruins, the Western Zhou Yandu Ruins Museum has been built. There are eight big characters on one wall of the museum: Ding Tian Ge Di, appointed to the Northern Territory. These eight characters illustrate that the purpose of establishing the Yan State was to ensure the security of the northern frontier of the Zhou Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/WyrxAP660ttx9yxBFzMnYaAIAjLh6TYFswiKhog4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1449&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/WyrxAP660ttx9yxBFzMnYaAIAjLh6TYFswiKhog4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216773&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Territory tiles with Taotie patterns from the Yan State, collected by the Yandu Museum of the Western Zhou Dynasty. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Shang Dynasty in the Zhou Dynasty, the princes were granted great titles. The first person to be ennobled in the Yan Kingdom was the eldest concubine of King Wen of Zhou, who was also the half-brother of King Wu of Zhou, Ji Shi. Since Ji Shi wanted to stay in the royal city to assist the emperor, he did not go to the fief to govern, but sent his son Ji Ke there. He himself was called Zhao Gong because of his fiefdom, so he was called Zhao Gong in history. This means that the nominal first monarch of the Yan Kingdom was Zhao Gong, but the actual first monarch was Zhao Gong&#39;s son Ji Ke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The territory of Yan State is roughly equivalent to today&#39;s northern part of Hebei plus Beijing. Among all the princes, Yan State is located in the north, and bordering it is the ethnic tribe called Rong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first capital of the Yan Kingdom - for the sake of narrative convenience, let&#39;s call it the first capital of Yan - is near the museum. Of course, the capital city of a feudal state more than two thousand years ago was just a larger market town. When the Yan Kingdom was first established, it was adjacent to another smaller country: Ji. Soon, Yan State annexed Ji State and moved its capital to Ji. The location of thistle is located in the Guang&#39;anmen area of ​​today&#39;s Beijing city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/U9CatV5KXO1N1LSRngz9uAyuINPajP8hVdy0UiOT.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/U9CatV5KXO1N1LSRngz9uAyuINPajP8hVdy0UiOT.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216774&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Outside Guang&#39;an Gate in Beijing, there is a Liao Dynasty Buddhist temple - Tianning Temple. The Tianning Temple Tower is the oldest above-ground building in Beijing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yan Kingdom lasted for more than 800 years, and it can be said that it had little sense of existence for the first 700 years. In other words, the only time it had a sense of existence was when this small country in the north encountered big trouble - Shanrong invaded and almost destroyed the country. Fortunately, the Central Plains region was in the era of Duke Huan of Qi, the leader of the Five Hegemons in the Spring and Autumn Period. Under the banner of Zun Wang and Expelling the Barbarians, Duke Huan of Qi contacted the princes to form a coalition. He personally led his troops deep into the hinterland of the Shanrong and fought several battles with the Shanrong until the Shanrong came far away. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, the Yan Kingdom was just like ordinary passers-by A and B, living and multiplying in the northern country in obscurity. By the time the princes turned their attention to it again, it was already three hundred years later. At this time, a major event occurred in the Yan Kingdom that shocked the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the important difference between the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period is that although the Spring and Autumn Period also had frequent wars, they generally only beat their opponents until they surrendered and admitted their mistakes, while the Warring States Period focused on occupying the opponent&#39;s territory or even annexing the opponent. Purpose. During the bloody Warring States Period, with wars and wars raging, ancient countries perished one after another, and the remote Yan State also felt great pressure to survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 321 BC, the first king of the Yan Kingdom, King Yan Yi, died. His son Ji Kuai ascended the throne and was known as King Kuai of Yan in history. Faced with the great powers surrounding the country and the weak state of Yan, King Kuai of Yan was worried. He wanted to work hard to make the backward Yan state invincible. He sincerely believes that as long as it can make the Yan country strong, he will not hesitate even if he and his family are not in power. Various signs show that King Yan is a simple and open-minded person. Only in this way can his dream be used with ulterior motives. The traitor took advantage of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treacherous minister was his son, who was the Prime Minister of Yan State at that time and was highly regarded by King Kuai of Yan State. Zi Zhi was indeed quite talented, so much so that King Kuai of Yan mistakenly believed that Yan must rely on him in order to revitalize the country. Zizhi fully grasped the eagerness of King Kuai of Yan to seek governance. His two confidants Su Dai and Lu Maoshou often gave advice to King Kuai of Yan, praising Zizhi&#39;s ability to govern the country, and urging King Kuai of Yan to follow the example of Yao and Shun and cede the world to the throne. Son of. In this way, Zi Zhi can not only govern the Yan Kingdom well and realize the rise of the Yan Kingdom, but at the same time, King Kuai of Yan will also become a saint like Yao and Shun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Kuai of Yan deeply believed in these deceptions, &quot;because the whole country belongs to the son, and the son is of great importance&quot; - King Kuai of Yan handed over all the important affairs of the country to the son, so the power of the son was extremely popular. ——Of course, I also want to sit on the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after, under the continued instigation of Zi Zhi and his associates, King Kuai of Yan &quot;received the seals from his son who was an official of three hundred stone&quot;, that is, he took all the seals of middle and high-level officials with more than three hundred stone in the country. Leave it to Zi, and let Zi control it. So, &quot;the son went to the south to do the king&#39;s business.&quot; The throne of the King of Yan passed from King Kuai to his son, who became the King of Yan. King Kuai instead became a minister. He no longer interfered with political affairs on the grounds of old age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucianism has always beautified the three generations and believed that the abdication of Yao, Shun and Yu was a symbol of the great unity of the world. Later, there were many abdication events, including Emperor Xian of the Han Dynasty, whose throne was Cao Pi, Emperor Gong of the Jin Dynasty, Liu Yu, Emperor Gong of the Sui Dynasty, Li Yuan, Emperor Ai of the Tang Dynasty, Zhu Wen, and Emperor Gong of the Zhou Dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin. However, the concessions between these foreign surnames were backed by force by the recipients, and the monarch had no choice but to give in. In contrast, King Kuai of Yan&#39;s true and heartfelt surrender was unprecedented, if not unprecedented, in thousands of years of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the sage-like abdication of King Yan brought a catastrophe to the Yan country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the three years of Zi Zhi’s reign, the State of Yan did not revitalize as King Kuai of Yan had hoped. Instead, it got worse. “The State of Yan was in chaos and the people complained.” Prince Kuai&#39;s son, Tai Ziping, was originally supposed to inherit the throne, but his father&#39;s abdication made him a minister. Of course, he wanted to regain the throne that belonged to him. Therefore, with Jiangjun City&#39;s support, Tai Ziping and his supporters plotted to overthrow Zi Zhi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi State, which is adjacent to Yan State, saw an excellent opportunity to get involved in Yan State. King Xuan of Qi sent an envoy to contact Tai Ziping and expressed his willingness to help Tai Ziping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With Qi&#39;s promise, Prince Ping felt that great things were about to happen, so he and the city attacked the palace. However, Qi did not send troops in time as promised. The prince Pingji was defeated and died, and the Yan country was in chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking this opportunity, King Xuan of Qi sent troops to attack Yan. The Yan soldiers were disheartened and fled one after another. King Kuai and Zizhi of Yan were both killed by the Qi army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qi army invaded Yan, and the Yan state suffered heavy losses. A large number of heavy weapons were transported away, the ancestral temples were burned, and tens of thousands of Yan people died. Direct evidence of the massacre of the Yan people by the Qi army has been revealed more than two thousand years after the incident: in 1966, fourteen skulls of Warring States people were discovered in Yanxiadu, Yixian County, Hebei Province. Archaeologists examined Tomb No. 5 among them. A rescue excavation was carried out. Under the loess, a large number of white human skulls were randomly buried together without any burial objects. The excavation report stated that &quot;almost all of these human bones are male adults&quot;; &quot;the largest number of skulls belong to young adults aged 18-35, accounting for about 80% of the observations&quot;; and, archaeologists also found that some of them Either part of the skull had been chopped off, or the arrowhead remained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State of Zhao is adjacent to the State of Yan. With the help of King Wuling of Zhao, another son of King Kuai of Yan, Gongzi Shi, was escorted back to the country to inherit the throne. This is King Yan Zhao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What King Yan Zhao inherited was a mess. Ji was looted and destroyed by the Qi army and could no longer serve as the capital. So, he built a new city further south on the banks of the Yishui River. This was the lower capital of Yan; correspondingly, Ji was the upper capital of Yan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yanchu Capital ruins are located in the suburbs of Beijing. A railway is close to the ruins. Occasionally, trains pass by, making earth-shattering sounds. A little further away is the densely populated Liulihe Town. As for the ruins of Yanshangdu, it is located in a bustling metropolis with busy traffic, with cars coming and going, noisy day and night. In sharp contrast to Yanchu Capital and Yanshangdu, Yanxiadu is the largest capital among the excavated capitals of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States princes. At its peak, Yanxiadu had an estimated population of about 300,000. ——And the population of the entire Yan State will most likely not exceed three million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/ZhSm7PMYgSDX8kFNUfE1Sf8p5oaRTFom9Ew5nWYE.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/ZhSm7PMYgSDX8kFNUfE1Sf8p5oaRTFom9Ew5nWYE.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216769&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Liuli River Ancient Bridge in Liulihe Town, Fangshan District, Beijing.

In the cornfield, there are occasional mounds of soil rising suddenly. The unique mounds of soil vaguely indicate that this is no ordinary crop field. This was one of the most important metropolises in China two thousand years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the cornfield, tall black poplar trees cover a small river, which flows toward Yi Shui. That year, white clothes were fluttering and the crown looked like snow. Prince Dan and a group of Yan people gathered around Jing Ke, got into the carriage, and drove slowly out of the capital of Yanxia to the banks of the Yishui River not far outside the city. There is a pavilion there; in the pavilion, wine and food have been laid out. They are about to raise a toast together for the last time...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/vj9FASfXSnIgbCDNOWacLiNo7rW2ju9r8w2zdQ2l.jpeg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1507&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/vj9FASfXSnIgbCDNOWacLiNo7rW2ju9r8w2zdQ2l.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216775&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yixian County Yanxiadu Ancient City Ruins&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Dead Time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Yan State when the capital of Yanxia was being built was undoubtedly the weakest among the seven heroes. How to rectify this mess and how to magically revitalize the sluggish Yan State were the urgent issues faced by King Yan Zhao when he came to the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Yan Zhao realized the importance of talents. Only by absorbing the best talents to serve the State of Yan, could the State of Yan become rich and powerful in a short period of time. The news that King Yan Zhao was thirsty for talents quickly spread throughout the world, and many scholars with weapons in their possession went to the Kingdom of Yan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before visiting the ruins of Yanxiadu, I first went to Luoyang, Henan. In a field on one side of the road outside Luoyang, there is an extraordinary tomb. Next to the tomb is a key cultural relic protection monument in Henan Province: Su Qin&#39;s tomb. On the square at the head of the tomb, there are several tall stone tablets, one of which is inscribed with the inscription &quot;The Tombstone of Su Qin, a Co-conspirator of the Warring States Period&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the scholars who defected to the Yan Kingdom, the most famous and influential was Su Qin, a native of Luoyi who was directly under the Emperor of Zhou. Su Qin&#39;s deeds are mainly recorded in &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Warring States Policy&quot;, but there are many contradictions in the two books. This is because both Sima Qian and Liu Xiang suffered from the lack of authentic and reliable first-hand information. It was not until the end of 1973 that a batch of silk books were unearthed from Han Tomb No. 3 in Mawangdui, Changsha, and Su Qin&#39;s true identity gradually became clear. This batch of silk books was compiled by experts into &quot;Books from the Warring States Strategists and Family&quot;. Among the twenty-seven chapters, sixteen are long-lost books that Sima Qian and Liu Xiangwei have never seen. The content of the lost book happens to be related to Su Qin - so, more than two thousand years later, through these words, we can finally restore a lurker who paid the price with his life: the spy Su Qin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before defecting to King Yan Zhao, Su Qin traveled around the country, looking for opportunities. However, he was arrogant and spent all his money, but no monarch took him seriously. When he returned home, his family ignored him. Therefore, when King Yan Zhao respected him, treated him politely, and regarded him as a national scholar, Su Qin decided that the scholar would die for his confidant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Qin believed that Yan was the weakest among the seven kingdoms. Qin and Qi are powerful countries, and Zhao is a sub-powerful country. The State of Yan could not compete with any of them. If you want to defeat Qi and take revenge, you must weaken Qi. The best way to weaken Qi is to encourage and support Qi to annex Song. In this way, Qi will inevitably become the target of public criticism. In order to make Qi State implement the wrong line and achieve the purpose of weakening it, Su Qin was willing to go to Qi State for internal response. He made an agreement with King Zhao of Yan: &quot;If you don&#39;t fight against internal invaders, you can&#39;t keep away from external enemies. The king governs the outside world, and the ministers report to the inside. This is the trend of destruction.&quot; - If internal strife does not arise, the outside world cannot act easily. The king is planning to deal with Qi State while he is away, while I invade Qi State and create chaos. In this way, the situation of destroying Qi was created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Qin came to Qi State as an envoy from Yan State. Later, with his outstanding talent and eloquence, he won the trust of King Qi Min and was appointed as the Prime Minister-his status even exceeded In the state of Yan. As Su Qin was favored by King Qi Min, people around King Yan Zhao began to suspect that Su Qin might not keep his promise, and King Yan Zhao was shaken for a time. For this reason, Su Qin wrote a letter to King Yan Zhao, swearing that he would be &quot;as trustworthy as Wei Sheng, as honest as Boyi, and as filial as Zeng Shen&quot; - these top-secret communications at the time were passed down through the transmission of silk books in the early Han Dynasty, more than two thousand years later. See the light of day again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than ten years in Qi State, despite the changing international situation, Su Qin consistently implemented his agreement with King Yan Zhao, that is, when formulating foreign policies for Qi State, he always tried every means to weaken Qi State. During this period, he not only dissuaded the King of Qin from asking the King of Qi to jointly proclaim the emperor, but also successfully alienated the relationship between Qin and Qi, formed a five-nation coalition to attack Qin, and made Zhao, Chu and other countries have tense relations with Qi. Especially important, he prompted the King of Qi to invade and finally annex the Song Dynasty three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to paralyze the monarchs and ministers of Qi State, King Yan Zhao, who hated Qi State deeply, only followed King Qi&#39;s lead. When Qi State attacked Song Dynasty, Yan State sent troops to help. Even King Qi Min executed a general of the Yan army for a trivial matter. Although King Yan Zhao shed tears of grief and anger, he sent an envoy to admit his mistake to King Qi Min...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 286 BC, Qi destroyed the Song Dynasty. The Song Kingdom, located in the fertile land of the Central Plains, was established by enfeoffing the survivors of the Yin and Shang Dynasties in the early Zhou Dynasty. It had a very high level: Duke. This noble and wealthy country was annexed by Qi, which aroused strong dissatisfaction among other princes. At this time, under the painstaking management of King Yan Zhao, the Yan State had become strong and strong. The state of Qi has long been strong on the outside but weak on the inside. So, more than a year later, King Zhao of Yan poured out all his troops, led by general Le Yi, across the border of Qi and Yan like a tide, and entered Qi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Yan army attacked Qi State, Su Qin was named the Prime Minister of Qi State, but his identity as a spy of Yan State was exposed. He was tortured by the furious King Min of Qi and was tortured by breaking a car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fury of King Qi could not withstand the revengeful Yan army. The Yan army attacked Linzi, the capital of Qi. King Qi Min fled and was later killed by the Chu army general Nao Chi - his death was very tragic: &quot;Shoot the king&#39;s stock, pull out the king&#39;s tendon, hang it on the temple beam, and die in the past.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yan army captured more than 70 cities in Qi, and only Jimo and Ju were still trapped and fighting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, during the siege of Jimo, King Yan Zhao died. The current situation suddenly took a turn for the worse: King Hui of Yan had a rift with Le Yi when he was crown prince. Under the instigation of the State of Qi, he dismissed Le Yi, and Le Yi had to defect to the State of Zhao - the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period. , this kind of voting with feet is not uncommon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qi State, which was originally in an absolutely weak position, came back to life under the strategizing of the famous general Tian Dan - the Yan army was driven out of the country, and the lost cities of the Qi State were recovered one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short-lived prosperity of the Yan Kingdom ends here. It is like a meteor streaking across the sky. While people are still looking up at it and surprised by its brilliance, it has extinguished and fallen. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Later&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is interesting is that the two most exciting historical events of the Yan Kingdom, which has been in the country for more than 800 years, namely Su Qin’s relationship with Qi and Jing Ke’s assassination of Qin, both had protagonists. He is a foreigner; whether he is a spy or an assassin, trying to defeat a country or save a country by such extraordinary means is full of wild imagination and thrilling legend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of seniority, Prince Dan is the sixth grandson of King Yan Zhao, and there is more than fifty years between them. In the half century from the death of King Yan Zhao to the reign of Crown Prince Dan&#39;s father, King Yan Xi, the national fortunes of the Yan country deteriorated from bad to worse. Four generations of Yan kings made mistakes one after another. They fought nine foreign wars and only won one small victory. Among them, when King Xi of Yan was on the throne, the State of Zhao suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Changping. As a neighbor of the State of Zhao, the State of Yan not only did not suffer a loss, but instead took advantage of the situation and robbed it. However, it was severely attacked by the State of Zhao after the defeat, so that the capital of Yan was trapped. He had to pay a lot of money for peace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The snipe and the clam fight, and the fisherman gains. The Qin State, which fought for the unification war after the sixth generation, was the ultimate beneficiary of the war between the princes. After Qin destroyed Han and then Zhao, Qin&#39;s forces entered Nanyishui. Previously, Yan State had built the Great Wall along the Nanyi River. However, Prince Dan knew that the simple Great Wall could not withstand Qin&#39;s tiger and wolf troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He hopes there is a way to quickly and once and for all remove the threat from the Qin State and save the precarious Yan State. Thus, there is the well-known Jing Ke&#39;s assassination of Qin; there is the windy farewell banquet by the Yishui River more than two thousand years ago...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/J2zZt3V7ZcZwjVHayueRKgRLKKn6oXdk4WNJIC8L.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1850&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/22/11/25/J2zZt3V7ZcZwjVHayueRKgRLKKn6oXdk4WNJIC8L.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216771&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jing Ke farewell&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend information/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people were gone back then, but the water is still cold today. The Yi River at the turn of summer and autumn is windy but not cold. The water flow is gentle in most sections of the river. There are many aquatic plants growing on the sandbars and birds flying lightly, making it look more like a wetland. A few kilometers away from the Yanxiadu ruins on the river bank, a mound of earth rises on the plain. On the mound stands a tower. It was built in the Liao Dynasty and was named Jingke Tower. It is said that there is a tomb of Jing Ke near the mound. The man dressed like snow threw down the wine bottle in his hand and walked away towards the setting sun without looking back. From then on, there was no coming back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Viewed from a distance, the Jingke Tower looks like a short sword, piercing the hollow blue sky. It reminds me of the dagger Jing Ke hid in the map. The picture shows the dagger. If the poisonous dagger stabbed Ying Zheng to death; or if King Yan Zhao&#39;s life span had been extended for another ten years; history must not be what we saw later. However, there are apples, mangoes and pistachios in the world, but there is no if. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/OeWlz0cgwTsfzJQ2BWrovDOIpEAWW1gcEapnM3C4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1445&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/25/OeWlz0cgwTsfzJQ2BWrovDOIpEAWW1gcEapnM3C4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;216770&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jingke Pagoda in Yixian County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vast capital of Yanxia Most of the ruins are crop fields, a small part are forests, and an even smaller part are villages.

There are many sad winds in the tall trees, and the Xiaoxiao is worried about killing people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the sun sets in the west, the bloody sun slants on the raised mounds.

As he grows older and his coach slowly guides him, Chen Guanfeng&#39;s training gradually gets on the right track. In Gu Yanqiang&#39;s plan, he will spend two years laying the foundation, training explosive power, coordination, balance, and sensitivity, and gradually improving strength and frequency. At the end of 2017, Chen Guanfeng joined the Guangdong Provincial Team. In 2018, he became a regular from the provincial team and was selected for the Chinese national track and field team.

I often led in the first 60 to 70 meters, but overtook me in the last 20 to 30 meters.&quot; Chen Guanfeng analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing his performance on the 100-meter track at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chen Guanfeng said that his performance in the first half of the race was normal, but after adjusting his technique, the old problem of serious slowdown in the second half still existed. He admitted that his legs were slightly uncomfortable during the second half of the final, so he chose a relatively conservative finishing strategy. After all, there were relay tasks ahead. &quot;I am still in the process of adapting and running in with new technologies, but I have achieved my goal of advancing to the finals. With my current hard power, I am not particularly outstanding in Asia, so the finals are a process of learning and enjoying.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Watching his senior Xie Zhenye break the 10-second mark in Hangzhou, Chen Guanfeng excitedly said that this is a historic moment for Chinese sprinting.

You must train hard and maintain your best condition every day in order to not fall behind in the arena.&quot; Chen Jianfeng said, &quot;This is my first time.
