Visual China | Pictures&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/b6156a5182.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/24/b6156a5182.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fish balls. Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Songjiang River in Shanghai was called &quot;Yunjian&quot; in ancient times. When I first moved to Songjiang, it felt a bit like &quot;between the clouds&quot; - empty and silent, misty and deserted. There are no acquaintances. Naturally, there were no familiar delicacies. I thought I would start a lonely life and start everything from scratch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, I was suddenly called by my name on the quiet road that day. I couldn&#39;t help but be startled. I took a closer look at a fat lady, but I didn&#39;t recognize her, but she smiled and said, I often watch on TV. I see you here, why are you here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turned out to be Jin Mei, my childhood neighbor. Hearing that her mother was still alive, she couldn&#39;t help but be surprised: New sister-in-law, is she still there? ! It&#39;s about ninety, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ninety-seven!&quot; Jin Mei replied. I immediately asked to see her. Because when she was a child, she was a popular idol in the alley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;New Sister-in-law&quot; is probably called famous by a group of old people. The reason must be that she was a bride in the alley back then. It is said that many people want to see a new wife who can&#39;t cook and make a fool of herself, but the new sister-in-law&#39;s skills make many older people feel inferior to her. What makes many women obey the most is that she actually raised eight boys and one girl in one go. Her youngest daughter Jinmei is my classmate. Behind her back, the old ladies call her &quot;Laikehang&quot; (a kind of foreign chicken that is very good at laying eggs). ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although her ancestral home is Shaoxing, she is more proficient than ordinary people when it comes to &quot;being a good person&quot;. When people in Shanghai say that people &quot;can be a good person&quot;, they are praising a kind of &quot;intelligent frugality&quot;, which is left-brained and right-brained. Living a life by discussing things is not just living a stingy life. For example, using mature loofah tendons to wash dishes is far better than sponges, but the price is negligibly cheap; cutting discarded sweatshirts into strips of cloth to tie into mops is much better absorbent than yarn; buying meat at a &quot;small market&quot; You can be precise enough to buy only 2 taels, which is enough to fry shredded pork for a meal. This is in contrast to the honest and honest people in the north who often buy half a fan, forming a &quot;precision&quot;. When you go to a restaurant to eat, most of the leftovers have to be packed up and re-cooked at home, called &quot;zaluo soup&quot;. The most typical one is the invention of the &quot;fake leader&quot; in Shanghai, which uses the least amount of fabric to maintain the greatest dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these &quot;life skills&quot; are just &quot;mere&quot; in the eyes of the new sister-in-law. She has her own unique skills, and they are beyond everyone&#39;s imagination, which makes the whole alley admire her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin’s sister-in-law’s hometown has a lot of bamboo shoots, and every year a lot of bamboo shoots are brought there by people. In order to preserve them, Xin’s sister-in-law always boils the bamboo shoots in a large pot of salted water, cuts the cooked bamboo shoots into pieces, and air-dries them. The old soup used to cook the bamboo shoots is not changed, and is cooked batch by batch. Finally, the old soup is slightly thick, and the large bottle and large wine bottle are poured in sequentially. The whole process does not touch the water, and the wine bottle is sealed with oil paper. This is the &quot;soy sauce&quot; for cooking in her family. &quot;. They call it &quot;bamboo shoot oil&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, good red soy sauce cost 27 cents per catty, white soy sauce (fresh soy sauce) cost 21 cents per catty, and MSG was even more expensive. But with the bamboo shoot oil, her family never buys soy sauce and MSG. My grandmother often orders me to go to her house and buy a bottle. The freshness is better than the soy sauce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new sister-in-law also pickles bacon every year, adds coarse salt and pepper, and pours some sorghum wine. The strange thing is that she is reluctant to throw away the reddish marinated meat water. She &quot;makes meat with meat&quot; and uses the marinated meat water to cook braised pork. Just add a little red soy sauce to make the meat very red and fragrant. Neighboring, the kind of fragrance between &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;wax&quot; is almost indescribable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what we miss the most is her &quot;Yanqiu&quot; - the new sister-in-law Yanqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Specially difficult period&quot;, considering that her family is a &quot;super-large family&quot; of 11 people, eight boys, and eight &quot;tiger&quot;, it is natural that there is a serious shortage of meat resources. Anyone who wants to touch big meat Their thoughts were not only &quot;immoral&quot;, but directly &quot;cheating&quot;, but the new sister-in-law&#39;s &quot;Shaoxing-style wisdom&quot; actually solved them as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time she stopped at the market, a storm would rush through her eyes - in the fish stall, there were dead white fish (silver carp), as cheap as mud, the most undesirable, and the new sister-in-law would kill them with a move. &quot;Here are two, big ones!&quot; The stall owner was so flattered that he offered them at the lowest price. In the meat stall, people walked around the milk fat pork, the loosest fat on the pork belly, and the stall owner often felt worried about it. At this time, the new sister-in-law waved her pink arm and said, &quot;Two pounds here!&quot; The stall owner was like Feng Lunyin. Not only did he cut the meat wide, but he also charged the floor price, and often even refused to charge for the meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Mei and I love watching our new sister-in-law make swallow balls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw her quickly removing the scales, gills and internal organs of the fish, and then rinsed it clean. Then cut it in half from head to tail, remove the bones and large spines, cut off the head and belly of the fish (reserve for fish soup), leaving two large pieces of fish meat, skin side down, place on the chopping board and nail them For the fish tail, hold the sharp knife upright and scrape the fish meat from the outside inward. When the skin and red meat under the skin are left, the new sister-in-law said proudly, many people don’t understand and are greedy for this piece of red meat! In fact, you must not ask for red meat. The fishy smell comes from the red meat! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My new sister-in-law chopped the scraped fish meat repeatedly and finely, saying that all the fish bones were gone. Then I put it in a container, stirred it clockwise for a few minutes with two pairs of chopsticks, added salt, and stirred it until it bubbles. , then picked up the milk and fat meat. Chop the cooked milk fat pork and lard residue together, add starch and chopped green onion and ginger, then mix in the fish paste and mix well until thickened, and shape into fish balls. Because of the abundant raw materials, she made the fish balls larger. It is as big as a ping pong ball or even a tennis ball. It is cooked in a pot of boiling water for a while. It is as white and crystal clear as snow. It is as tender and smooth as tofu in the mouth. It is not fishy and delicious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why we treat it as a swallow ball every time is because every time we can taste one first and squeal with joy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night was a carnival where the eight boys and her husband had a &quot;meat feast&quot; - when the big pot of swallow balls was served, the new sister-in-law had to use the spoon solemnly with a straight face. They were strictly allocated one by one. If it were left to them, it might be a dinner table accident with blood splattering three feet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the story is not over yet. The &quot;Eight Tigers&quot; had eaten all the swallow balls, and there must be a by-product of the swallow balls, &quot;fish soup&quot;, waiting for them the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After my new sister-in-law cooked the tripe that was chopped off yesterday, she removed the fish, removed the spines, chopped the fat meat into pieces, mixed it with the fish and added it to the soup. Add vinegar and salt. Sprinkle in a lot of celery leaves or minced garlic, the aroma is fragrant, fresh and slightly sour, and the big pot of brown rice is gone in an instant. It can be described as more than just &quot;dinner&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While being jealous, a group of old women headed by my grandma often commented quietly: This dish actually comes from Hangzhou cuisine. The most outstanding thing is that it uses the most unwanted &quot;trash&quot;. And make it delicious. Who wants this dead white fish? If it cannot be sold, it will rot; who will buy this fat meat? If it can&#39;t be sold, it can only be boiled in oil residue. But with her help, the New Year&#39;s Eve dinner can be served. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, everyone put down their arrogance and asked the new sister-in-law for advice; gradually, the fish stalls and meat stalls in the vegetable market, those &quot;abandoned items&quot; that no one usually touched, were noticed... &lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, it became the most popular, affordable and nourishing home-cooked dish in our alley. The official name given to it by the neighbors was &quot;Xinsao Yanqiu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many years have passed, the time has almost changed, and the alleys have disappeared, but how many generations, especially the &quot;eight tigers&quot; have grown up eating the cheapest and most delicious &quot;big meat&quot; , joining a job, getting married - and even getting older, my new sister-in-law is actually still alive! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I stood in front of her bed. To be honest, at ninety-seven, she was too old to remember me, but when she talked about her swallow balls, her eyeballs flashed a few times. He pursed his lips and said nonchalantly: &quot;...It&#39;s a pity that there was no oil at that time. In fact, it tastes better if it is deep-fried!...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10月全国查处违反中央八项规定精神问题9567起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261314]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 23:09:54&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the 23rd, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission released monthly data on the investigation and punishment of mental problems that violate the eight central regulations.

Originally, children can jump more than 190 times per minute, but this kind of skipping rope can only jump 160 times. If it were not required by the school, I would definitely I won’t buy it.” Mr. Huang, a citizen of Hangzhou, said that his son will take the high school entrance examination next year, and the sports test will be skipping rope. Since the brand of skipping rope chosen for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination was &quot;Hengyou&quot;, in order to familiarize the children with the rope used for the exam in advance, he had no choice but to buy this skipping rope after being designated by the school teacher. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“I checked the same type of rope online. One rope only costs more than ten yuan, and this one costs 78 yuan.” Similar to Mr. Huang, a primary school student in Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City Ms. Lu, the parent of a second-grade student, said that almost all of the 39 students in her child&#39;s class bought &quot;Hengyou&quot; brand skipping ropes at the teacher&#39;s request. Some parents even bought two, one for practicing at home and one for practicing at school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In August 2020, five departments including the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening and Standardizing the Management of Education Fees&quot;, which clarified that &quot;students and parents shall not be forced or implied to purchase designated fees.&quot; Teaching aid software or materials”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why do some schools recommend buying this rope even though it is explicitly prohibited? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou said frankly that rope skipping is a must-test sports event for grades one to six in primary schools; in middle schools, it is also one of the items in the high school entrance examination. Since the rope used in Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination is &quot;Hengyou&quot;, some primary schools also use &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping ropes to compete with middle schools. &quot;It is better to use it early than to use it late. We will recommend parents to buy the &#39;Hengyou&#39; rope to strengthen training, but teachers are not forced to buy it. The school will also provide corresponding skipping ropes to try to meet the needs of students.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A junior high school student in Hangzhou told reporters that because the &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope is relatively expensive, she usually uses rubber ropes that cost a few yuan a piece when practicing at home; Practice with the school&#39;s &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope. &quot;Some students in the class who are from well-off families also bought a &#39;Hengyou&#39; rope with a Bluetooth counting function, which costs more than 140 yuan.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter investigated and learned that, Some head teachers or physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou asked parents to purchase ropes of this brand by verbal notification or by sending links to parents in groups. The customer service of the Hengyou Sports Taobao flagship store said that the Hangzhou high school entrance examination skipping rope provides &quot;Hengyou&quot;, and many schools in Hangzhou Shangcheng, Gongshu, and Xiaoshan recommend buying this rope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Coach Huang from a &quot;rope skipping class&quot; in Hangzhou told reporters that more than 20 primary and secondary school students who came to his training also felt that the rope used for the high school entrance examination had heavy handles and thick ropes. Other ropes are easy to jump on. &quot;In order to prepare for the exam, the children can only sign up for training classes.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Why did the &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope become a special rope for Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Is there a standard for the rope used in the high school entrance examination? Shen Hao, deputy director of the Hangzhou Municipal Education Examination Institute, who is responsible for purchasing sports equipment for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination, said that neither the country nor the province has standards for ropes used in the high school entrance examination. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that the national skipping rope standard stipulates the length and diameter of the rope and the diameter and weight of the handle, but this standard is a recommended standard. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“In fact, the length of the rope and the thickness of the handle of the &#39;Hengyou&#39; skipping rope are designed according to adult standards, which is not suitable for primary school students - primary school students are small and weak. The &#39;Hengyou&#39; skipping rope is heavy, not easy to jump, and easy to break,&quot; said some primary and secondary school physical education teachers in Hangzhou. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that the manufacturer of &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope is Shenzhen Hengkang Jiaye Technology Co., Ltd. Tianyancha shows that the company was founded in 2006 and is an enterprise mainly engaged in the manufacturing of cultural, educational, industrial and aesthetic, sports and entertainment products; Hangzhou Feiniao Sports Goods Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Xingti Education Technology Co., Ltd. have both represented the company in Zhejiang. Jump rope products. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The relevant person in charge of Hangzhou Feiniao Sports Goods Co., Ltd. admitted that since entering the Zhejiang market in 2011, the &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope has been the test rope used for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination Sports; the current market It has covered all major urban areas in Hangzhou, and more than 100,000 tubes are sold in Zhejiang a year, of which more than 70% of users are primary and secondary school students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, how did the &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope become a special rope for Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Since about 2011, the Hangzhou Education Department has been leasing and using high school entrance examination sports equipment produced by Shenzhen Hengkang Jiaye Technology Company. After 2017, we have Using an open bidding method, the annual rental fee for leasing sporting goods produced by this manufacturer is 8.9 million yuan,&quot; Shen Hao said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some skipping rope manufacturers said that they also tried to enter the range of sports ropes for Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination, but found it difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter was in a &quot;Single Source Announcement on the Hangzhou Education Examination Institute&#39;s High School Entrance Exam Physical Examination Equipment Leasing Project&quot; (January 2019) published by the Zhejiang Provincial Government Procurement Network It has been seen that the Hangzhou Municipal Education Examination Authority plans to use the &quot;single source&quot; procurement method (leasing) to purchase high school entrance examination physical examination equipment from Hangzhou Xingti Education Technology Co., Ltd. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reason for the application given by the Hangzhou Education Examination Authority is: &quot;For many years, the physical education examination of Hangzhou urban high school entrance examination has been using the products produced and produced by Shenzhen Hengkang Jiaye Technology Co., Ltd. The original equipment rental service provider for the physical education high school entrance examination equipment and examination system developed is Hangzhou Xingti Education Technology Co., Ltd. The equipment system operates stably, the service response is fast, and the high school entrance examination physical examination tasks are successfully completed every year. From the continuity of use, the examination system Considering the integrity and specificity of the software management platform, it meets the condition of &#39;can only purchase from the only supplier&#39; in single-source procurement.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Shen Hao said, ten For many years, Hangzhou Sports High School Entrance Examination has been leasing equipment from the manufacturer &quot;Hengyou&quot;, including skipping ropes, skipping rope testers, etc., so the result is that the rope used in the high school entrance examination today is &quot;Hengyou&quot;. In addition, this company is one of the earliest manufacturers to develop intelligent counting rope skipping. Compared with the past, invigilators used to count the number of rope skipping by candidates with their eyes, this kind of intelligent counting is fairer and more efficient. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“It is actually not profitable to lease physical examination equipment to the Hangzhou Education Examination Authority. Our market is more of the market for primary and secondary school students, which is under the physical examination mechanism of primary and secondary schools. Policy market.&quot; The person in charge of Hangzhou Feiniao Sports Goods Co., Ltd. said frankly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Break the hidden brand monopoly and give parents and schools more choices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Some skipping rope manufacturers said that countable skipping ropes are not high-tech products and can be produced by any manufacturer. &quot;We hope that by improving the bidding methods and establishing standards for ropes for primary and secondary school physical education examinations, parents and schools will have more choices.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Now there is no The cost of a high school entrance examination rope with a counting function does not exceed 8 yuan per rope; the cost of a high school entrance examination rope with a counting function does not exceed 20 yuan. The prices of &#39;Hengyou&#39; non-counting and counting skipping ropes are respectively sold at 78 The price is 148 yuan, and the profit margin is huge.&quot; revealed a brand merchant in Zhejiang that produces skipping ropes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Anti-Monopoly Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition. &quot;If the education and examination department uses a certain brand of skipping rope for a long time without justifiable reasons, especially if it simply purchases a certain product through the &#39;single source&#39; procurement method without extensive investigation and understanding of market products, it is obviously against fair competition in the market. Principle.&quot; said a staff member of the Zhejiang Provincial Market Supervision Department. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The relevant person in charge of the Hangzhou Municipal Education Bureau said: &quot;We are also reflecting now on whether we can improve the current high school entrance examination sports skipping evaluation method by referring to other places that have done well. Including whether students can be allowed to bring their own ropes to take exams, whether more brands of rope skipping equipment can be used, etc., to avoid unnecessary trouble and burden on students and parents.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打着“国家补贴”的幌子欺诈乡下老人，何以屡屡得逞？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, I turned on my phone camera as usual to see what my parents were doing, but found that the door to my home was locked. , it wasn’t until the phone call at night that my father found out that there was a place selling goods in neighboring villages these days, and villagers from all over the country came to join in the fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After calling several aunties in the village, I learned about the relevant situation: a week ago, a group of Mandarin-speaking outsiders chose to set up sheds in an open space beside the village road. There are people specially guarding the place, and the elderly are free to enter. There are many small benches inside, and loudspeakers are turned on. Young people are on the stage preaching the efficacy of a certain product, and then encouraging the elderly to buy it. Obviously, this is a product promotion meeting, but it has two obvious characteristics: first, the promotion location is in the village, located in a pure rural area; second, the sales target is the elderly, and they are all left-behind elderly people in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is a sales meeting or a merchant advertising, it cannot be said that there are many violations, but upon closer inspection, it is still full of &quot;routines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About daily arrangements. It is understood that this kind of sales meeting usually lasts for 6-7 days. In the first 4-5 days, someone will explain the relevant knowledge to make the elderly believe it. One of the common tricks is to exaggerate certain aspects of the elderly&#39;s problems based on the characteristics of the product to be promoted. For example, when promoting water purifiers, one would say how poor the quality of water commonly used in rural areas is and what harm it causes to the body. The purpose It makes the elderly feel that if they do not buy their products, the consequences will be very serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second trick is to frequently use some scientific and technological means during the explanation process, such as on-site testing of water quality, using special instruments, professional testing methods, and demonstrations by academicians and scientists to convince the villagers. This is scientific, advanced and developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third trick is that a group of people will jointly &quot;perform&quot; the explanation process, including outsiders, locals, and perhaps people who are quite prestigious in the local area. The business owner&#39;s assumption is that you don&#39;t have to believe it. Foreigners, but locals should believe it, right? There is a high probability that merchants bribe a small number of local people through money and other means. The goods will be sold in the next 1-2 days. That is to say, there is a process of first acting with emotion, convincing people with reason, first brainwashing, winning people&#39;s hearts, and finally harvesting (money). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About identity changes. A few days ago, merchants used various videos, speeches, performances, etc. to gain the trust of the elderly. In the process, the merchants transformed into many roles. A few days ago, they were outsiders and they were technology explanators in the countryside. Members, they are rural revitalization helpers, they are psychologists who are familiar with and understand the psychology of the elderly, they are health guardians who care about the physical and mental health of the elderly, and they are philanthropists who send warmth to the countryside; two days later, they returned to their The essential role - a profit-seeking businessman, a villain and a villain who defrauds honest village elders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About what is sold and given away. What they ultimately want to sell is a certain brand of water purifier, and the items they give away are divided into two types: a few days ago, they were paper towels, wash basins, toothpaste, toothbrushes, washing powder, and laundry detergent. Only those who came to the scene could see it. portion; the next two days are range hoods, wall breakers and heating and cooling air conditioners. Obviously, the gifts given a few days ago were mostly cheap and practical things in rural areas. As long as you go there, they will give them to you. When people go there, there are so many people, it is easy to cover the eyes of some onlookers. Yes, there are people. A herd mentality, especially for old people in the countryside. They will think, &quot;Are they all fools, right? I&#39;ll go take a look too.&quot; The gifts in the next two days are also very practical, but anyone with a discerning eye will know at a glance that they are not cheap, but the condition is that you have to spend money to buy the net. Water vessels are only given by others. In other words, the things they sell and give away are not cheap. This method of selling one large item and getting three large items for free makes many elderly people feel that this business is full of sincerity and is not a profiteer in the ordinary sense. , some old people even stood up to speak for them, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter even if they are cheated in the end. Thousands of dollars are gone, but at least four real things are in hand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About price. Take the main product for sale, water purifiers, as an example. My mother told me that the price is 2,980 yuan per unit. I simply searched on regular e-commerce platforms such as JD.com and Taobao and found that I can buy it for only 400-500 yuan. Find similar products with good quality. Faced with such a huge price difference, merchants&#39; compensation tactics include intimidation, bragging and gifts. What’s even more annoying is that my mother told me that the merchant would say that the price of 2,980 yuan was still a lowered price after enjoying the national subsidy policy for technology products going to the countryside. In other words, the original price may be 4,980 yuan per unit. Now it is the business that benefits the people. After deducting the 2,000 yuan of state subsidies, the villagers have a rare opportunity and opportunity to buy one unit for 2,980 yuan. As soon as these words came out, the old people&#39;s previous defensive mentality was easily defeated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About people entering. My mother told me that those people were very friendly. Every morning at seven o&#39;clock, the car would arrive at the entrance of the village on time, pick up the elderly in the village, and prepare breakfasts such as fried dough sticks, steamed buns, and milk for the elderly, and deliver them to the sales meeting for free. When we arrived at the scene, someone brought us tea and water, and the service was quite attentive. At twelve o&#39;clock at noon, the car took the elderly home on time to cook and eat. At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the car will appear in the village on time, waiting for the elderly; at 5:30, they will take the elderly back to their homes. A friend of mine who is about the same age as me told me that a similar activity was held in their village last weekend. He wanted to go into the shed and have a look, but did not want to be dissuaded by the person guarding the door. The meaning was obvious, only the elderly could enter, and young people could not go in. , middle-aged people, don’t give in. Obviously, businesses are afraid of the presence of young or middle-aged people because they are worried that young or middle-aged people will expose their tricks in public, and young people or middle-aged people will openly oppose them, which will seriously affect the elderly. purchasing psychology, reducing the purchasing intention of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above is the relevant situation that I heard or learned, which triggered some other thoughts in me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the basic fact is that some businesses defraud ignorant elderly people in the countryside under the guise of &quot;expanding domestic demand&quot; and &quot;enjoying national subsidies for technological products sent to the countryside.&quot; To be honest, many product manufacturing companies exist in name only. However, under market-oriented conditions, although many companies persist, their main products have long been eliminated by the market. Especially in urban markets, they are already saturated. What should we do? Of course, the company just thought about it and moved its tentacles downwards to occupy the urban and rural markets. There is no doubt that this is a move by companies to expand domestic demand. However, it is difficult to say how good the quality of this type of product is, and the price is many times higher than the price of similar products purchased online. It is undeniable that there is deception and fraud in the product sales process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the abnormal behavior of rural elderly deserves scrutiny. First, why do elderly people who have been living frugally for most of their lives not hesitate or feel distressed when faced with a large purchase of close to 3,000 yuan? I think there is a problem of transfer of family (words) rights (power) here. Nowadays, most of the things in many people’s homes are purchased online by their children outside the home. You buy it and I use it. In the past, I bought it and everyone used it. Now that I am old, I don’t need to buy it. You and your children buy it. That&#39;s good. I don&#39;t have much contribution to this family anymore, at least not as much as before. The elderly are more of just passive recipients of gifts and users of objects. They have little opportunity or need to participate in the purchase and sale of objects, especially large items. The process of selection, screening and purchasing is a deprivation of consumption. Now there is such an opportunity, I pay, I buy, I make the decision, I am happy. Even if they find out in the end that they have been fooled and deceived, they will feel distressed to some extent, but they will also accept the reality calmly, &quot;Where is the use of money other than money? I just spend money to buy something? You can easily spend hundreds of dollars on a meal in Guangzhou. Thousands, you think I don’t know? It’s too expensive for me to buy something?” My mother would use words like this to rebuke me, even in the face of my earnest attempts to dissuade her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, knowing clearly that there is a high probability that it is a trick of a liar, knowing clearly that there is no free lunch in the world, why do the elderly insist on &quot;traveling to the tiger mountain&quot; instead of believing in evil? This is mainly due to the fact that many elderly people have been in rural areas for a long time. They are kind-hearted and honest, and are prone to overflowing with sympathy. They do not understand the complexity of society enough, have limited knowledge of profiteers, have shallow knowledge, and lack basic anti-fraud awareness and skills. Businessmen They often take advantage of this fatal weakness of the elderly and succeed every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A grandfather who finally spent 800 yuan to buy ostrich milk said, &quot;You (young people) can&#39;t say that they are all liars. Hello, I have to say, I can&#39;t buy nothing, I can&#39;t be like this.&quot; Obviously, during the shopping process, the old man felt that it was not just a purely monetary transaction, but also included emotional feedback, that is, people If someone treats us well and takes good care of us, we should also &quot;treat others with courtesy&quot;. This &quot;courteous&quot; way is to buy other people&#39;s things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, why do the elderly not choose to consult their children outside for their opinions or suggestions? The author learned that during the few days of the sales meeting, many elderly people acted silently, went silently, bought silently, and returned silently. They would not take the initiative to inform their children outside of home about this situation. Of course, they were worried that their children would worry about them, or even Scold them. As old people, of course they care more about face. If they are scolded by their children, they will feel shameless. This is certainly not a situation they like to see. In fact, many elderly people are used to &quot;being independent&quot;. &quot;Don&#39;t interfere with what I do or what I buy. I&#39;m not old yet. I haven&#39;t reached the stage of Alzheimer&#39;s disease yet. I have my own judgment and ideas.&quot; , please mind your own business.&quot; This should be the true mentality of many elderly people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, another possibility is caused by the so-called &quot;disconnection&quot; phenomenon, that is, many children living outside have little contact with their parents on weekdays, and their care is relatively scarce, or even indifferent. When encountering this matter, they suddenly became &quot;doubly concerned&quot;. The old people would feel that the young people were &quot;hypocritical&quot; and &quot;too fake&quot;. Yesterday afternoon, one of my cousins ​​called his father several times at the sales venue to ask him not to buy any ostrich milk. Unexpectedly, his father got tired of hearing this and said angrily, &quot;It&#39;s not your money. I&#39;m willing to spend it. You don&#39;t have to pay for it.&quot; &quot;No matter what,&quot; then hung up the phone and turned off the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, joining in the fun is actually quite scarce in many rural areas. My mother went to the market for six days in a row. I didn&#39;t understand it, but my father said it was okay. &quot;I have nothing to do anyway. It&#39;s okay to go and have some fun. It&#39;s fine if I don&#39;t buy anything.&quot; My father&#39;s &quot;strategy&quot; was not to let my mother bring cash or mobile phones, and then not allow her to borrow money from others. Every night on the phone, my mother was cheerful, talking about who she met yesterday and who she met today, whose daughter got married, whose son bought a house, and the steamed buns she served today tasted good. Obviously, my mother&#39;s mind is not on the sales meeting or the product. What she cares about is being able to see and chat with her friends every day. Yes, in today&#39;s rural areas, young people have gone to cities, children have gone to school, and even the elderly are not far apart from one village to another, but they are not close either. For a mother who is nearly seventy years old, there is nothing special. I won&#39;t go to neighboring villages to visit. On weekdays, she just wandered around the village and spent time with her father every day. You looked at me and I looked at you. Occasionally, they would have a few words, saying that her later life was very fulfilling and not boring at all. That was a lie. Obviously, she will be lonely, she will be lonely, she will have nothing to do, social interaction is her real need, and going to the sales club every day for a walk can make her extremely happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of when I was a child. At that time, there were often acrobatic troupes performing in the village, and occasionally people would come to the village to show movies. The scene was spectacular and lively. Times have changed, and in today&#39;s rural areas, many people have their doors locked all year round. The only permanent residents in the village are the elderly. Hollow villages or hollowed-out villages abound. Obviously, the permanent population has dropped sharply, and there are no or few public recreational activities, making the elderly even more lonely, which will inevitably seriously affect their quality of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, regarding the fact that rural elderly people are (easily) deceived, I think young people might as well be more free and easy-going, encourage them to visit and go shopping, and tell them to be more vigilant. However, there is a basic fact that it is difficult for us to say now or in advance that the things they buy are fake or counterfeit. This requires a period of testing to see the effects after trial or consumption. If in the end, they find that the items they purchased are indeed inferior products, and they have really been fooled, there is no need to be angry or angry with them, because they have finally gained something, such as meeting and chatting with old friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山东莱荣高铁被举报偷工减料存在质量隐患，官方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261300]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 19:51:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On July 20, the media reported that there were some threaded piles in the construction of the first three sections of the Lairong High-speed Railway Station. The pile length did not reach the designed pile length, and the design change procedures were not completed, resulting in quality hazards and other problems. The National Railway Administration, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government attached great importance to it and immediately established a joint investigation team composed of the Shanghai Railway Supervision and Administration Bureau and the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation to conduct investigations in accordance with laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The joint investigation team dispatched more than 120 professionals from across the country to conduct on-site investigations, and organized 10 experts in railway, geology and other fields to provide technical guidance. It lasted more than two months, carried out geological exploration and drilling inspection, interviewed 14 relevant units and 83 people, reviewed more than 29,000 pieces of data in 130 categories, and formed an investigation report and more than 100,000 words of investigation supporting materials. After the investigation was completed, seven experts, including academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were invited to demonstrate the investigation and conclusions. The joint investigation team verified the issues reported by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the problem that the pile length of some threaded piles constructed by Sanjie Company did not reach the designed pile length. The joint investigation team entrusted a testing agency to carry out drilling and sampling tests on the threaded piles subcontracted by China Construction Eighth Engineering Group Co., Ltd. to Sanjie Company and other units for construction in accordance with relevant specifications, and simultaneously carried out infill geological exploration; it entrusted a professional agency to supervise the whole process and conduct inspections on the quality and safety of the roadbed foundation. Comprehensive Evaluation. Through the infill geological survey of the subgrade base constructed by Sanjie Company, it is shown that the thickness of the granite weathering layer and the fluctuation of the weathering layer interface in this section vary greatly. After on-site inspection and comprehensive analysis and evaluation, the construction pile length of the threaded piles in this subgrade section is consistent with the height and low fluctuations of the bearing layer revealed by the infill geological survey, and the &quot;unable to drive&quot; phenomenon has occurred. The construction pile lengths of some threaded piles have not reached the design pile length. , but the threaded pile pile end has entered a better bearing layer, which does not affect the quality and safety of the composite foundation. No corners-cutting was found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the issue of failure to perform design change procedures. After investigation, when the threaded pile construction did not reach the designed pile length but the pile end entered the bearing layer, the participating units only met on site to confirm and failed to perform design change procedures in accordance with regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comprehensive investigation and evaluation, the bearing capacity of the composite foundation in the subgrade section as reported by the media meets the engineering requirements, and the stability and post-construction settlement meet the requirements of relevant railway specifications. There are no composite foundation quality problems or safety hazards. It does not affect the safety of railway operations. At the same time, the settlement deformation was observed and evaluated after the completion of the composite foundation. The results showed that the measured and evaluated post-construction settlement of the entire Lai-Rong High-speed Railway met the specification requirements. The acceptance results of the joint debugging and joint testing of the Lai-Rong High-speed Railway and other acceptance results show that the Lai-Rong High-speed Railway meets the track smoothness requirements during the operation of 350km/h high-speed railway and meets the safety and stability requirements of high-speed train operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation found that during the construction period, Sanjie Company and China Construction Eighth Engineering Bureau had conflicts in terms of construction progress and project payment. They had withdrawn from the construction in June 2021, and the two parties have not reached an agreement on resolving the disputes. . The investigation also found that there were problems in construction management such as inadequate on-site management and irregular project subcontracting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the investigation conclusion, in response to existing problems in design changes, construction management, project subcontracting, etc., the Shanghai Railway Supervision and Administration Bureau imposed administrative penalties on the relevant responsible units and 7 responsible persons in accordance with the law; in accordance with relevant regulations, The construction unit China Construction Eighth Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd., the supervision unit China Railway Second Institute (Chengdu) Consulting Supervision Co., Ltd., the design unit China Railway Fourth Survey and Design Institute Group Co., Ltd. and the construction unit Shandong Lairong High-speed Railway Co., Ltd.

Some companies do not realize the strong regulatory trend formed by my country&#39;s economy in the process of high -quality development and transformation, and ignore business ethics, environment, and social responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this issue, we invited Dr. Lu Jianzhong, a deputy director of the Society of Management Science Society for Sustainable Development Management and Organization of Global Reporting and Organization, Dr. Yin Yilin, Professor and PhD instructor of the School of Management of Sun Yat -sen University, From the perspective of think tank experts, the overall characteristics and typical events of the corporate social responsibility warning incident in October were commented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What social responsibility issues do you pay attention to? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Lu Jianzhong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Every time you review the corporate social responsibility warning incident, I will pay special attention Insurance accidents and major damage to consumers&#39; rights and interests, these are at least to prevent the enterprise. Unfortunately, in the every month&#39;s warning incident, these ingredients have occurred, which is full of indignation and shameless. I can&#39;t help asking: What is the conscience of these business owners and corporate conscience of these red lines? This is no longer a question of social responsibility. This is the minimum moral issue of a person and an organization. The selection of corporate social responsibility warning incidents is of great significance. It awakens us to resolutely fight these bad behaviors. We must persistently committed to wake up conscience and maintain social fairness and justice. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Yin Yilin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; The prominent characteristic of the corporate social responsibility warning incident is that many events involve the people&#39;s food and accommodation. From toothpaste and medicines to entertainment, if you are not careful, consumers may be &quot;flickered&quot; by merchants, and even life -threatening. It is hoped that enterprises will protect their responsibilities and operating bottom lines. While creating safe and reliable products, they will establish more sustainable and higher moral standards for business culture, so as to disappoint consumers&#39; trust. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body _gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How do you think of the false publicity incident? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Yin Yilin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The effect of toothpaste deficiency is the old problem that violates marketing ethics. The national &quot;Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Cosmetics&quot; has clearly stipulated that toothpaste is managed by the provisions of ordinary cosmetics; claiming that special effects must be evaluated in accordance with national standards and industry standards. In other words, toothpaste is just an ordinary cosmetics, not a medicine. As a well -known old -fashioned pharmaceutical company entering the toothpaste market, Pianzai has a certain advantage, but it should not hold the mentality of scratching the ball. This is neither legal, but also does not match the industry status of its well -known pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, consumers also remind consumers to polish their eyes and judge whether the &quot;net red product&quot; is inconsistent. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How to affect the company Social Responsibility? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Lu Jianzhong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The incident had a bad impact on society. The first is the basic bottom line of corporate trampled integrity operations, and the other is to severely damage the seriousness and authenticity of information disclosure, and then mislead the relevant parties of the interests, and may even disrupt the normal advancement of ESG information disclosure. Enterprises must take social responsibility and ESG information as a serious work of compliant operations, maintain reputation, and establish social trust, and integrate it to the level of corporate governance. At the same time, relevant departments and media should increase supervision. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Guangxi Xingyue Materials Factory explosion incident What are the warnings? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Lu Jianzhong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The health and safety guarantee of employees in the operating venue is not only the basic bottom line of the corporate legal compliance, but also the fundamental fundamental operation of the enterprise&#39;s steady operation Bottom line. Life is valuable. Regardless of the safety and health of employees&#39; life, the pursuit of benefits and profits is a shameful act of illegal law. The circumstances are extremely bad. Enterprises must have strict, normal, systematic safety and health measures, establish monitoring, preventing and safe and healthy assessment standards, prevent hidden safety hazards, and ensure safety production. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Three environmental responsibility related events for this issue How do you evaluate? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Lu Jianzhong: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The natural ecological environment is the basis for human survival. Destroying the natural ecological environment is exhausted. Regardless of the natural ecological environment, business owners and enterprises that are urgent, shaking their wrists, and super -row must be strictly rope to the law. Relevant agencies and regulatory departments shall increase supervision and law enforcement efforts, and continue to investigate and investigate enterprises with fluke and lack of regulatory measures in environmental protection and to prevent neglect. It is also called on the society to supervise the business behavior of the enterprise and improve the smooth reporting channels. All enterprises must establish a prepared management system, monitoring system, and performance evaluation system in accordance with national, industry, and local regulations to achieve long -awaiting alarm bells. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot; What are the problems? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Yin Yilin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; Langy&#39;s brand slogan for many years is &quot;Suitable for Chinese constitution&quot;. However, behind the overwhelming advertisements, the bottom line of the quality of drug products failed. For a pharmaceutical company, product quality and safety are the bottom line of social responsibility. It is hoped that over 100 million tickets will be alert to the company and strengthen the quality control of the product production line. In the short term, it may be possible to solve the problem by recalling the product, but long -term reflection and rectification are essential. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The social responsibility warning event of the top ten corporate corporate in October &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; I. False disclosure information of Xinjiang Guannong shares was fined 2.1 million yuan &lt;/strong>; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Fields: &lt;/strong>; Responsible governance &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Incident review: &lt;/strong>; On October 9, Guannong shares issued an announcement announcement saying that the China Securities Regulatory Commission Xinjiang监管局对其发布了行政处罚决定书，原因是他们在信息披露方面存在违法违规行为。 Guannong shares violate the securities law, and there are false records, misleading statements or major omissions in the information disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;对于上市公司而言，公开信息披露的准确性，直接影响到投资者对其价值的判断和预期，是资本市场的根本原则之one.企业不能因业务压力仅考虑短期利益，更需要从合规风险管控的角度考虑企业及其股东的长期利益。 On the other hand, it is also necessary to fully consider the impact of negative news on corporate brands. It is expected that to obtain a short -term market positive feedback with false information, it is tantamount to drinking and quenching thirst. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;二、漳州片仔癀子公司因不正当竞争行为被罚款3万元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;公平运营&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月11日，赤壁市市场监督管理局对漳州片仔癀上海家化口腔护理有限公司处罚3万元，行政处罚书显示，当事人出品的“片仔癀牙火清专效深养牙膏”（炫莹药香）并未实际取得符合法定资质条件的机构出具的功效作用评价报告，却以产品包装盒为载体，对外宣称该产品具有“缓解红肿、出血、口燥、异味、口腔上火”，足以使消费者误认为该产品具有当事人宣称的功效作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;近年来，随着我国对于产品宣传的监管机制越来越完善，对于宣称具有特殊功能的日用品、保健产品等的处罚屡见不鲜。中药保健类牙膏一直是国产牙膏品类的重要组成部分，而片仔癀作为中国中药名牌产品、中华老字号，理应在国货崛起的发展过程中起到带头作用，自觉遵守相关的市场监督管理规定，为国人提供货真价实的产品，并努力提升老牌国货在消费者心目中负责任的形象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;三、广西兴越材料工厂爆炸造成2死4伤4失联&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;安全与健康&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月20日晚，广西平果市工业园区内一工业企业车间发生一起爆炸事故，事发地位于该市果化镇的广西兴越材料科技有限公司，应急、消防等部门派人前往事发地进行调查和救援工作，21日凌晨，平果市委宣传部发布通报称，目前已搜救出6人，其中2人确认无生命体征，4人轻伤，还有4人失联。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;对于制造业企业而言，安全责任重于泰山，保障生产安全既是企业的生命线，也是企业不可触碰的高压线。在依赖传统工业作为经济发展支柱的欠发达地区，相关从业人员多为当地居民，企业若未能落实生产安全及环境保护责任，则不仅威胁到员工的生命安全和当地居民的身体健康，更会在当地社区对企业造成不可挽回的名誉损失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;四、深圳欢乐谷因过山车发生碰撞闭园整改&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;安全与健康&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月27日，过山车“雪域雄鹰”发生碰撞后，深圳欢乐谷迅速启动应急机制，第一时间将8名受伤游客送医治疗，随后组织现场其余游客陆续到附近医院检查就诊。截至10月30日，共有17名游客继续留院治疗或观察，所有在院游客情况稳定，均无生命危险。为配合市区联合调查组开展调查，并全面开展游乐设施安全隐患排查整改，深圳欢乐谷将继续闭园，恢复开园时间另行公告。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;过山车是游乐园游乐设施中最重要的一个项目类别，近年来不断出现类似的新闻报道，也引起了广泛的社会关注。此次事件虽未造成游客死亡，对于游乐园经营企业来讲却是个严重的安全事故。 As a benchmark for the industry, Shenzhen Happy Valley must earnestly do a good job of daily maintenance of amusement facilities. On the other hand, as the primary topic of the amusement park, safety should be done in time to communicate the responsibility of consumers and the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;五、高价雪糕品牌钟薛高被爆欠薪欠款&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;员工责任&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月21日，有媒体爆料称知名高价雪糕品牌钟薛高深陷欠员工薪酬、欠供应商货款，甚至客户积分都无法兑现等负面新闻。钟薛高官方微信、微博也近两月未更新，员工、合作方纷纷留言“讨债”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;员工欠薪事件反映的仅仅是钟薛高经营问题的冰山一角，疫情管控放开后，国产新消费品牌雪糕集体遇冷，若企业自身的根基不牢，可以预见将有更多的社会责任缺失事件发生。 The concept of sustainable development should be integrated into the process of enterprise development products and creating a business model. Enterprises should avoid relying on capital and marketing business strategies as much as possible, and effectively create differentiated value for customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;六、海鸥住工控股子公司因超标排放污水被罚款38万元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;环境责任&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月16日，海鸥住工控股公司珠海承鸥卫浴用品有限公司因“超过水污染物排放标准排放水污染物”，依据《中华人民共和国水污染防治法》第八十三条第二项被珠海市生态环境局罚款38万元。 In addition to the above -mentioned administrative penalties, the semi -annual report of seagulls in 2023 disclosed that Zhuhai Chengjie Sanitary Ware Products Co., Ltd. was punished twice for &quot;exceeding water pollutants emitted water pollutants emission standards&quot; in the first half of the year, and one of them was fined 400,000 yuan. ，另一次被要求立即改正，并将整改情况书面报告。公司对两次处罚均采取了整改措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;涉事企业半年内因同样的环境违规问题被处罚两次，且两次处罚金额相当，说明该企业并未切实履行整改要求。 With the development of my country&#39;s ecological environmental protection, the concept of &quot;green water and green mountains is the golden mountains and silver mountains&quot; is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.的淘汰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;七、神驰机电控股子公司因产品不满足排放标准被罚款247万元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;环境责任&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月10日，神驰机电控股子公司重庆市凯米尔动力机械有限公司因“产品不满足排放标准”，依据《中华人民共和国大气污染防治法》第一百零九条第一款，被重庆市生态环境保护综合行政执法总队罚款、没收非法所得以及没收非法财物，其中罚款247.02万元，没收违法所得142.71万元，合计389.73 Ten thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;我国针对废气排放数据与当地生态环境局联网进行实时监测的实践已有成熟的经验，企业在大气污染方面的违规成本将进一步提升.在这样的背景下，生产企业需要转变环境责任作为企业外部成本的理念，尽快根据自身经营的实际情况，在全面合规的基础上，积极调整产品结构与生产工艺。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;八、湖南赛隆生物制药因未安装危险废物处理设施被罚款19.9万元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;环境责任&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月7日，赛隆药业旗下公司湖南赛隆生物制药有限公司因公司设置的危险废物贮存间有精馏残液、废有机溶剂等产生挥发性有机物废气的危险废物，贮存间未按照国家环境保护标准安装收集处理设施，废气经排风扇直排外环境，依据《中华人民共和国固体废物污染环境防治法》第一百一十二条第一款第六项被长沙市生态环境局罚款19.9万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;危化品贮存是生产企业最核心的安全问题之一，同时也是企业最容易忽视的责任之一。 Improper storage of hazardous chemicals is the health of employees within the enterprise, and it has caused potential environmental pollution risks to the outside of the enterprise.除了实施处罚，有关部门应注意引导和提高生产企业的安全意识，尤其是提高员工对自身职业安全的重视程度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;九、北京朗迪制药因药品不符合规定被停业并罚款1.3亿余元&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;合规管理&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;10月16日，北京市市场监督管理局官网公示的行政处罚信息显示，经甘肃省药品检验研究院检验，发现北京朗迪制药有限公司自行生产及委托山西振东制药股份有限公司生产的32批次碳酸钙产品含量测定项下维生素D3不符合规定。由于违反《中华人民共和国药品管理法》，朗迪制药被责令停产停业整顿30天，没收相关产品合计5.4万盒，没收违法所得合计618万元，并处罚款1.3亿余元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;药品安全问题无小事，药品行业的良性、健康发展直接关乎国计民生。尽管经第三方权威专家认证，维生素D3易因气温、运输等客观环境因素造成含量不稳定，但作为行业龙头，朗迪的供应链管理及产品质量控制仍有不少值得反思之处。此次的天价罚单，不仅是对“中国钙王”的警示，更是对各大药企在我国深化医药改革的高压态势下的警示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;十、22款APP、SDK因侵害用户权益行为被工信部通报&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;涉及领域：&lt;/strong>;合规管理&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;事件回顾：&lt;/strong>;近期，工信部组织第三方检测机构对群众关注的在线影音、网上购物等移动互联网应用程序APP及第三方软件开发工具包（SDK）进行检查，发现22款APP、SDK存在侵害用户权益行为，并于10月24日进行通报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;责任警示：&lt;/strong>;此次通报的侵权行为中，包括违规收集个人信息，APP强制、频繁、过度索取权限，强制用户使用定向推送功能，欺骗误导强迫用户等问题。经过了多年的发展，移动互联网已经充分融入到普通消费者的日常生活当中，涉事企业应当对侵害用户权益的行为有更全面的认知，主动承担维护消费者权益的责任，积极配合相关规定进行全面整改。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;评选方法和流程：“月度十大企业社会责任警示事件”评选采取专家投票法。月初，南方周末中国企业社会责任研究中心收集、整理上月发生的社会责任警示事件，并从中筛选出候选事件。之后，随机邀请9位智库专家进行“背对背”投票，按总得票数由高到低评出“月度十大企业社会责任警示事件”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
