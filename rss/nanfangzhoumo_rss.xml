Commercial banks&#39; reliance on card quantity has been replaced by quality and efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Overall Operation of the Payment System in the Fourth Quarter of 2022&quot; released by the People&#39;s Bank of China shows that as of the end of 2022, the number of credit cards and debit and credit cards in use totaled 798 million, a year-on-year decrease of 0.28%. This is the first negative growth in credit card issuance in China since records began. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as the core high-quality business segment of commercial banks, in the era of digital finance, the credit card business is facing a new competitive situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, which card issuing bank will still have outstanding scale and growth rate? Which card issuing bank has better risk management system and risk control effect? Which card issuer is better at retaining customers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center adopted a combination of quantitative and qualitative research and analysis methods to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system including 16 indicators in three major dimensions, and differentiated the indicators based on their importance. Empowerment. This enables commercial banks of different sizes and types to achieve &quot;horizontally comparable and vertical ranking&quot; in terms of their overall strength in credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this indicator system, researchers from Southern Weekend New Financial Center objectively evaluated the performance of 19 major commercial banks in their credit card business based on their 2022 annual report data and third-party evaluation data, and The &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List&quot; is released based on the evaluation score results. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Indicator system&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Three dimensions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Sixteen&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;sub-indicators&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since the birth of China&#39;s first standard credit card in 1995, the &quot;imported product&quot; of credit card has become one of the basic tools of personal credit business of various financial institutions after nearly 30 years of hard work. At the end of 2022, the credit card loan balance of 18 major commercial banks was 7.89 trillion (Ningbo Bank&#39;s credit card loan balance data was not disclosed, so it was not included in the statistics), accounting for 14.4% of the personal loan balance, becoming the second largest personal loan after housing mortgage loans. credit markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the important value of credit card business to commercial banks? First of all, the credit card business is an important support for the bank’s retail business; secondly, the credit card business helps banks improve customer loyalty and stickiness; thirdly, the credit card business provides banks with consumer-related data, and banks can better complete portraits of their customers and consumers. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the development trend characteristics of the credit card business of various commercial banks and the credit card customer satisfaction survey, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center constructed the &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency Ranking&quot; evaluation index system &lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; which It includes three major dimensions: business scale and growth, risk management, customer service and product innovation, and is refined into fifteen quantitative indicators and one qualitative indicator. The evaluation index system is now described in detail as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250761 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(1) Business scale and growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Credit cards are an important tool for banks to establish long-term relationships with customers, and are also the focus of banks’ retail business. The scale and growth of the credit card business reflect the bank&#39;s customer acquisition capabilities and market position, while the number of credit card issuances and changes in the issuance volume reflect the bank&#39;s expansion effect, and the loan balance and proportion reflect the actual contribution of the bank&#39;s credit cards, the number of active accounts and transactions The amount reflects the marketing accuracy and stickiness of bank credit cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Risk management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very necessary to examine the risk management capabilities of bank credit cards. Credit cards are &quot;unsecured revolving loans&quot; issued by banks based on their trust in cardholders. The risk management capabilities of credit card business affect the bank&#39;s operating efficiency and competitiveness. Credit cards are an important source of income for banks, and their revenue comes from interest, fees and annual fees. If indicators such as the bad debt rate, fraud rate, and theft rate of credit cards cannot be effectively controlled, the bank&#39;s costs will increase and its profits will decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the epidemic, the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks (including the non-performing ratio of credit card loans) will increase in 2022. At the same time, the measures to improve non-performing loan ratios disclosed in the annual reports of most listed banks are relatively general, and the measures taken by various banks lack comparability. In order to highlight the efforts and effects of banks in controlling the non-performing loan ratio, this evaluation system uses the credit card loan non-performing ratio indicator in 2022 and also sets a change rate indicator for the credit card loan non-performing ratio to directly reflect the achievements of the measures taken by each bank. Effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(3) Customer service and product innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition in the credit card market is becoming increasingly fierce, and banks are constantly launching new products, services, functions and activities to meet the diverse needs of customers and improve customer stickiness. This evaluation system evaluates from both the bank side and the consumer side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We use the types of credit cards issued by banks and the number of complaints about credit card business as positive and negative indicators respectively. On the consumer side, evaluations from third-party organizations are used, because third-party organizations obtain consumers’ evaluations of credit card products through a large number of objective questionnaires, which are more objective than those disclosed in bank annual reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We select China Customer Satisfaction Index (C-CSI) and China Net Promoter Score (C-NPS) as consumers’ evaluation of credit card products. index. C-CSI and C-NPS survey targets permanent residents between the ages of 15 and 60, and are randomly sampled according to gender, age, income and region, and completed through household interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We consider the card issuer’s distinctive credit card services of the year as bonus points. Each unique credit card service that is publicly disclosed and can be collected will receive 10 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Reward and punishment mechanism for information disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our research, we found that most banks have disclosed data on each of the above indicators, but a few banks have not disclosed one or more indicators. In order to reduce the impact of information asymmetry and punish banks that do not disclose sufficient information, this evaluation system will give the lowest score to any indicator item that does not disclose relevant data. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China Merchants Bank takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Hua Xia is only better than city commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;We will 19 The credit card businesses of commercial banks are ranked according to their scores, and the &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List&quot; is selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency Ranking&quot; shows that national commercial banks that started their credit card business earlier and have a large customer base rank high. But it does not mean that the larger the card issuance volume, the higher the overall score. As a joint-stock bank, although China Merchants Bank is not as large as the state-owned banks, it ranks first in the overall score of credit card business. This is due to its strategic vision of taking the lead in developing retail business and its innovation power that has been sustained for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China closely followed China Merchants Bank in second and third place respectively. Among them, the total score of China Construction Bank&#39;s credit cards is only 20 points less than that of China Merchants Bank, with a very small gap. Three banks form the leading phalanx in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, the total score of Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China is far outside the top five. Not only are they far behind China Merchants Bank, but they are also surpassed by joint-stock banks such as CITIC, Ping An and China Guangdong Development Bank. Postal Savings Bank ranked thirteenth. Among joint-stock banks, Hua Xia Bank is at the bottom, with a score difference of 248 points from China Merchants Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250763&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business and Industry The main reason why banks lose points with credit cards is that they only publish the total complaints but not the complaints of the credit card business. Therefore, when we do not consider the indicator of credit card business complaints, China Merchants Bank still leads the list, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China overtook China Construction Bank and rose to second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if the number of complaints is not taken into account, China Guangdong Development Bank and Bank of Communications leap to fourth and fifth place. This shows that the number of complaints from these two banks is relatively large. Of course, this does not rule out malicious complaints from gray products. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;State-owned banks and joint-stock banks are seriously divided&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks are catching up&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >; Regardless of state-owned banks or joint-stock banks, the credit card scores of the two echelons are seriously divided in their respective camps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, only two and three are among the top five in the two lists, namely China Construction Bank, ICBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Bank of Communications. Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China ranked low in both lists. Especially in the list excluding the number of complaints, Bank of China’s score has reached fourteenth place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among joint-stock banks, China Merchants Bank has always been far ahead. The overall performance of CITIC, Ping An and GF is remarkable. Among them, China CITIC Bank’s total credit card score is second only to China Merchants Bank among joint-stock banks. This is mainly due to the fact that the bank has received more scores than its peers in terms of consumer services and credit card business complaints. Among them, the score for credit card complaints is higher than that of other companies on the list. Bank and credit card categories also scored over 80, indicating that they cover a wide range of consumer groups. Although Guangdong Development Bank is smaller among all joint-stock banks, the overall score of Guangfa Credit Card is high among all banks. This reflects the important position of China Guangdong Development Bank&#39;s credit card business in the bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The credit card scores of the four city commercial banks are at the bottom of the list, which shows that they still have a clear gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of comprehensive credit card strength. Affected by factors such as their short time in the credit card market, small business scale and weak customer base, city commercial banks as a whole lag behind in indicators such as credit card issuance volume and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, among city commercial banks, Bank of Jiangsu and Bank of Ningbo both scored 100 points for the credit card change volume indicator, especially Bank of Ningbo, which scored as high as 90 points for the proportion of complaints in the credit card business. This reflects that leading city commercial banks are working hard to catch up in the credit card business and have made great progress in some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Assistant researcher Liang Chenghao, Zou Huan and Yang Chaoqun also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲殴打猥亵女儿者，检察机关不予起诉：义愤彰显人性，震慑奸宄之徒丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256739]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 14:09:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a case published by the &quot;Procuratorial Daily&quot; made many netizens shout &quot;Yangjian News&quot; and &quot;very mentioning&quot; gas&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 9, 2021, Li learned that his 15-year-old daughter had been molested by Xie Moumou, the deputy dean of a certain vocational and technical college, and came to the school to beat Xie Moumou. Xie&#39;s injury was assessed as minor injury level two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The procuratorial organ believed that although Li&#39;s act of injuring Xie was suspected of intentional injury, it was an act of injury carried out out of anger in the process of claiming his daughter&#39;s legitimate rights and interests from the school. Because Li was a first-time offender and an occasional offender, his behavior was justified and the circumstances were minor, and he had lenient and lenient punishment circumstances such as surrendering, so the decision was made not to prosecute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Xie Moumou, after the procuratorate initiated a public prosecution, the court sentenced him to two years and two months in prison for the crime of forced indecency, prohibiting him from engaging in sexual relations with minors from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole. Occupations with special responsibilities such as education, training, and nursing that are in close contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among netizens’ reactions, no one complained about his father Li’s beating of Xie to a minor injury, let alone treating it as “intentional injury.” Instead, there were various “beatings” &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s not an exaggeration to beat him to death&quot;. Does such a sound sound &quot;tyrannical&quot;? not at all. This is the manifestation of the &quot;simple sense of justice&quot; or &quot;emotion of law&quot; inherent in every normal person&#39;s heart. Indignation makes us human, and integrity must mean knowing what to love and what to hate. Confucius said: Only benevolent people can love others and hate others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens also had complimentary words for the local procuratorate, such as &quot;the light of justice&quot; and &quot;wanting to send a banner.&quot; If the law were applied mechanically, the father could be prosecuted and sentenced if he beat someone to a minor injury of the second degree. There are many cases like this in reality: one spouse cheats, the other catches the cheater in bed, and beats the lover wildly in anger. Then the lover goes to assess the injury. As long as the injury is minor, the other spouse will either pay for a settlement or be charged with intentional injury. Although it is legal to go to jail and let the attacker go to jail, it is against human ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to some extent, the above cases reflect the conflict between natural law and statutory/statutory law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called natural law/natural rights simply means that laws are discovered, not invented or formulated, which is often referred to as &quot;natural law&quot;. From the perspective of evolutionary game theory, natural law is the embodiment of &quot;evolutionary stable strategy&quot; (ESS). Tit for retaliation, or what Confucius said, &quot;repay kindness with kindness, repay hatred with directness&quot; is ESS. Only in this way , can promote cooperation among members of society, suppress breach of trust and aggression, and enable society and civilization to survive. The final rule derived from &quot;reciprocity&quot; is that each other respects each other&#39;s life, freedom and property rights, as the Chinese say, &quot;Kill to pay for life, debt to pay for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statutory law is made by people and will refer to natural law or customary law, but it is not always consistent with natural law or customary law, and sometimes even runs counter to it. In the fields of marriage, family and property inheritance, there are many cases Reflects the conflict between statutory law and natural law or customary law. The only daughter, Ms. Yang, wanted to inherit her parents&#39; inheritance, but found that 22 relatives of both parents also had the right to inherit (based on statutory law). Fortunately, these relatives did not think they had the right to inherit the inheritance of Ms. Yang&#39;s parents (based on natural law and common law). This is Heaven governs people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the case where his father Li beat Xie. Xie obviously knew how to use legal weapons to protect himself. After being beaten, he immediately identified the injury as &quot;minor injury level two&quot;, which showed that he He also suffered injuries, using this as a bargaining chip, or wanting to offset the disadvantages he faced in the molestation case, because minor injuries can be administratively detained, and minor injuries can be sentenced to prison. The show is &quot;I go to jail, you also go to jail, let&#39;s go together.&quot; posture. Judging from the local procuratorate&#39;s handling of both cases, it is obvious that the police also completed the investigation into the beating case of his father Li and handed it over to the prosecutor. It can be inferred that Xie reported the case to the police after being beaten. Reporting the crime + injury assessment, the direction of counterattacking Li is very obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the local procuratorate’s decision not to prosecute Li has resolved the conflict between natural law and statutory law in this incident. It is in accordance with the laws of nature and people’s hearts, and it is for the father Li to stand up for his daughter. The behavior and morality are very good, and it is also a good deterrent to those who try to extend their dirty hands to minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do individuals deal with conflicts between natural law and statutory law? My father, Li, is a good example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different statutory provisions and different judgments based on them mean different behavioral incentives for people and will change people&#39;s behavior. For example, the case of Datong, Shanxi, where she was accused of rape after getting engaged, triggered strong concerns and debates. , one of the motives discussed by everyone is &quot;how to avoid legal risks&quot;, but generally speaking, when the rights of parents and children are violated, the emotions and temperament of blood thicker than water will prevail, at least they will be very angry, and often stand Come out, instead of blindly looking forward and backward, timid, and appearing particularly &quot;rational and calm&quot;. If a person does not show blood and courage at this time, then he probably does not have these things at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every father and mother who stands up for their children is worthy of respect. When their children are hurt and most vulnerable and helpless, they stand up to confront the aggressor and expose the aggressor&#39;s evil deeds to the broad daylight. This is the best help and the best value for their children. educate. They let their children know that when they are hurt, their parents are their strongest backing and support; they must be as brave as their parents, dare to say no to infringements and infringers, and dare to advocate and defend their rights. If there are more parents like this, not only will those who are ready to make a move think twice about it, but they will also convey a strong and profound value system to the next generation and the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家卫健委：9月20日起将猴痘纳入乙类传染病进行管理]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256733]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;National Health Commission Announcement&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to the relevant provisions of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases&quot;, monkeypox will be included in the management of Class B infectious diseases from September 20, 2023.

In the past, it mainly occurred in Central and West Africa. Since May 2022, monkeypox epidemics have occurred in more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Epidemics in many countries have shown that monkeypox has been transmitted from person to person and has spread widely to countries and regions outside Africa, with a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%. In September 2022, my country reported its first imported case of monkeypox, and local monkeypox epidemics began to appear in June 2023. Currently, more than 20 provinces across the country have reported monkeypox cases, triggering new local secondary outbreaks and hidden transmission. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The National Health Commission and the State Administration for Disease Control and Prevention conscientiously implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, treat monkeypox as a new emerging infectious disease, and give full play to their multiple capabilities.

This year’s Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday runs from September 29 to October 6. According to the 15-day pre-sale period for railway tickets, return train tickets for the last day of the holiday will go on sale on September 22. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While tickets to many popular destinations are hard to come by, there are also many trains and lines that are quietly withdrawing from the public eye. With the development of high-speed rail networks, the popularity of private cars and the expansion of air routes, regular-speed lines have ceased operations in recent years. For example, at Shantou Station in eastern Guangdong Province, all regular-speed trains have been suspended. The surrounding Jieyang South Station and Chaozhou Station have already closed their passenger transportation services, which have nothing to do with passenger travel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In neighboring Japan, this phenomenon is even more obvious.

The typical image of a domestically violent man created by Feng Yuanzheng in the TV series has endured for a long time, and it has also made people regard &quot;domestic violence&quot; as a &quot;patent&quot; for men. But in addition to beating people hard, life also teaches people very patiently to grasp those seemingly unpopular facts - for example, domestic violence does not only occur between husband and wife, but also occurs between men and women, parents and children, and women against men. and children to parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statistics from the All-China Women&#39;s Federation and the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018 show that 22.9% of women and 19.9% ​​of men in China have suffered domestic violence. It shows that there is not much difference between men and women experiencing domestic violence, which is very different from a certain stereotype. As for domestic violence by children against their parents, it is relatively hidden and is generally regarded as a family scandal. Parents who suffer domestic violence would rather swallow their anger than &quot;ruin&quot; their children&#39;s future. This is pitiful for parents in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Higher People’s Court announced a typical case of domestic violence against an old man by his daughter because he was unwilling to rent out his house. In this case, Feng and Liu had a mother-daughter relationship. In early 2020, Liu forced Feng to move into his home in order to rent out Feng&#39;s house. After that, Liu went to Feng&#39;s residence many times to threaten, abuse and intimidate him, smashed items in the house with a hammer, and asked a moving company to remove Feng&#39;s appliances and furniture and change the door locks, making Feng unable to enter. residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng applied to the court for a personal safety protection order, and sued Liu to return the items and restore Feng’s possession of the house. The People&#39;s Court of Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai City believed that the evidence submitted by Feng showed that he was indeed in danger of domestic violence, so it made a ruling the day after Feng applied for a habeas corpus order, prohibiting Liu from beating or threatening Feng. For violent behavior, Liu is prohibited from harassing, following, and contacting Feng, and Liu is prohibited from entering Feng&#39;s residence. Subsequently, the court presided over the mediation between the two parties, and Liu voluntarily vacated Feng&#39;s house within a time limit, returned Feng&#39;s belongings, and did not interfere with Feng&#39;s normal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I saw the results, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh. After suffering inhuman treatment, the last thing a mother can do is the so-called &quot;reconciliation.&quot; How can the pain involved be covered by a piece of paper? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the private sector, it is not uncommon for children to force the elderly to give up their houses and intervene in the disposal of the houses in advance to lock in their &quot;deserved inheritance&quot;. In the eyes of these children, it is almost destined that their parents&#39; property will belong to them sooner or later. Therefore, once they go to war to control the possession of the property, it cannot be regarded as unfilial and rebellious. On the contrary, this is a kind of &quot;smartness&quot; that is carefully laid out for its own &quot;rights&quot;. I believe this is what this daughter thinks. If the mother had not been forced to litigate, and if the court had not supported her, the outcome of this matter would have been even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, people have been easily confused by the interdependent and unbreakable relationship between parents and children, and thus are unwilling to connect the dark things in human nature with this relationship, even if there is a strong conflict of interest between parents and children. , is also likely to be regarded as a common household chore by the world. When I was young, I witnessed other people’s sons and daughters-in-law rushing into my old mother’s house with tools, quarreling and fighting. The old mother screamed in agony, unable to do anything. The villagers who were watching only regarded this matter as &quot;a slap in the face that can&#39;t make a difference&quot;, and had no idea that this behavior was a kind of domestic violence from below to above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, domestic violence between parents and children also involves &quot;top versus bottom&quot;. It is common for parents to abuse their children for a long time, and to severely control their children&#39;s bodies and minds even when they grow up. Those who are accused often defend themselves under the guise of &quot;disciplining children.&quot; This is also confusing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why people &quot;cannot see&quot; domestic violence between parents and children, so that they turn a blind eye to it, is fundamentally because they trust too much in the ethical and moral foundation of the parent-child relationship, or they look at the parent-child relationship through filters. The contradictions in the family relationship are gradually resolved by trying to minimize the big problems and look for the best in everything. However, the unwillingness to admit the &quot;evil&quot; in the parent-child relationship and the unwillingness to expose the &quot;family scandal&quot; between parents and children has caused us to lose many opportunities to say &quot;no&quot; loudly and intervene in such domestic violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only from the perspective of rights can we better understand the confusion of such views in the past, and can we suddenly understand the harmfulness of &quot;parent-child domestic violence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, the media reported such a case: The Procuratorate of Qiubei County, Yunnan Province accused Wang of being held criminally responsible for intentional homicide. However, it also pointed out that the victim had often beaten his parents in recent years. In view of the fact that the victim had It is a serious fault, and Wang has the circumstances of surrendering. The circumstances are relatively minor. It is recommended that the court impose a prison sentence of not less than 3 years but not more than 5 years. The Houqiubei County Court sentenced Wang to 3 years in prison, suspended for 5 years, for intentional homicide. The key word in this case is of course &quot;domestic violence&quot;. The domestic violence against the parents by the &quot;rebellious son&quot; has reached the point where the victim cannot bear it, which is the root cause of the tragedy of murder. Murderers should be punished by law, and the lessons of domestic violence should be remembered by the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An unavoidable question is why some children are so cruel to their parents that they are willing to violate ethics and morals and be nailed to the pillar of shame? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many reasons. Many parents dote on their children so much that they develop domineering and extreme personalities. If they are not satisfied, they will have violent outbursts, causing &quot;backlash&quot;. But this is only a general reason, and we can find the &quot;inducers&quot; of &quot;parent-child domestic violence&quot; from the details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the case of a daughter’s domestic violence against her mother as an example. The daughter’s coveting of her mother’s property was the ideological beginning of a series of extreme behaviors. According to the daughter&#39;s principles of dealing with things, if the mother obediently obeys without any resistance, domestic violence is unlikely to occur. But this kind of calculation is not in line with the righteousness of the world, nor is it in line with legal principles. By extension, using various decisive means to make the elderly lose control of their residence is domestic violence with deprivation of property as its core feature. This is where special attention should be paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, one of the acts of domestic violence committed by children against their parents is on the physical and mental levels. It is not just forcing parents into a corner over property issues, but also forcing them into a desperate situation. Such domestic violence is of a nature Especially bad. And this kind of thing is often regarded by some people as a way to make a fortune. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, in November 2021, a case occurred in Nanjing: In order to drive their mother out of the house and monopolize the property they lived with, the couple actually staged a &quot;three knots and two divorces&quot; to transfer property. Drama, but fortunately the court ruled that the transfer of property was invalid. The judge emphasized that children have the obligation to support their parents and should ensure that their mothers have a place to live when they grow old. This is a simple truth, but it has been trampled on by some greedy children. Parents who have lost their financial security are like floating ducks in the world. You can imagine the physical and mental shock they suffered. This kind of domestic violence is even worse than physical violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comprehensively sort out the types of domestic violence, be more rational and keenly aware of the characteristics, harmfulness and deception of &quot;parent-child domestic violence&quot;, and curb this type of domestic violence in accordance with the law. This is to reshape the parent-child relationship and advocate A major premise of ethical order. We should not only show goodwill to the &quot;harbor&quot; in life, but also be vigilant about the truth about domestic violence that is obscured by routines, excuses and illusions. Only in this way can we truly create a normal atmosphere for ourselves and our family, without falling into a trap under the appearance of warm relationships and self-sacrifice, or even making ourselves a &quot;price&quot; in the calculations behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
