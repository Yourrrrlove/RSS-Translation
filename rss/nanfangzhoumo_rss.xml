It is called an ox.&quot; In ancient times, In Tibetan mythology, wild yaks are called &quot;stars&quot; in the sky, and white yaks are especially revered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Putting aside the veil of mystery, where did the white yak come from in reality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the black yak and the white yak are domesticated by humans from wild yaks. The wild yak is a first-level protected animal in China. Archaeologists have discovered bison and other ungulate fossils in the middle and late Pleistocene strata of the Quaternary about 3 million years ago. Wild yaks were once widely distributed in China. They can be seen everywhere in the Himalayas, Kunlun Mountains and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Nowadays, with human development, the distribution area of ​​wild yaks has rapidly shrunk and fragmented. They can only be found in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, mainly living in the Qiangtang National Nature Reserve in Tibet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestic yaks were domesticated from wild yaks. From the past to the present, people have used molecular genetics knowledge, sequencing technology and other biological information methods to extract information from many species by combining morphological similarities with archaeological discoveries. This aspect reveals evidence of wild yak domestication. Professor Liu Jianquan from the School of Ecology of Lanzhou University constructed a complete yak genome structure variation map by studying the genome structure of 23 individuals of domestic yaks and wild yaks. He found that domestic yaks living in the alpine pastoral areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at an altitude of 2,000-5,000 meters are descended from humans. It was domesticated 7,300 years ago from the wild yak that currently lives in the uninhabited area of ​​the northern plateau. At the same time, there are highly differentiated structural variations between domestic yaks and wild yaks, that is, structural variations that are subject to artificial selection during domestication. Domestication traits such as genes and nervous system development and behavior, as well as reproductive ability and immunity, are affected by selected structural variations. It is related to functions related to economic traits, providing a new perspective for understanding the genetic mechanism of yak domestication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latest survey results of the National Livestock and Poultry Resources Committee in 2019 show that domestic yaks include 17 local breeds and 2 cultivated breeds, distributed in Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Tibet and Sichuan, and are affected by various Affected by regional geographical conditions, these yak breeds have also formed distinctive local characteristics in the long-term evolution. The most scientifically troubling mystery about these different domestic yaks is the mystery of coat color, especially when and where the white yak was produced. Is the spotted yak the result of a cross between a white yak and a black yak, or a cross with other cattle? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Liu Jianquan’s team cooperated with researcher Yan Ping of the Lanzhou Institute of Animal Husbandry and Pharmacy of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other research groups. Through nearly 30 years of field sampling, they completed the sampling of all varieties of domestic yaks and more than 20 wild yaks. The yak was sampled and complete DNA was successfully extracted for genome analysis, thereby constructing a genome map of the Bovine species. Research has found that after domestication, domestic yaks were crossed with another type of cattle. Nearly 90% of domestic yaks have genomic structural variations from cattle, accounting for about 1%-5% of all genomic structural variations. Cattle were domesticated from bison in the Near East and the Indus River Basin, and were brought to the Tibetan Plateau by humans no more than 4,000 years ago. The relevant research results &quot;Evolutionary origin of genomic structural variations in domestic yaks&quot; were recently published in the international academic journal &quot;Nature Communications&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the genetic introgression from cattle that leads to the key genetic basis for phenotypic variation in different breeds of domestic yak. In layman&#39;s terms, within about two thousand years, the domestic yak and the flowered yak produced the flowered yak due to active or passive interspecific hybridization during the grazing process, and the flowered yak then produced the white yak through genetic mutation. This solved the mystery of the &quot;white yak&quot; that has troubled the scientific community. In addition to unraveling scientific mysteries, this study provides a new perspective on the improvement of yak breeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the closed breeding environment of yaks and the lack of communication between livestock species, as well as the impact of global climate change and the destruction of natural pastures by overgrazing, the living environment of yaks has deteriorated, and various yak breeds have developed different characteristics. degree of degradation. Therefore, hybrid improvement and breed selection of domestic yaks have become an important task. Although domestic yaks and wild yaks have varying degrees of differences in appearance, breeding methods, production performance and disease resistance, they are generally similar. The biggest difference is that wild yaks have significantly better disease resistance than domestic yaks. Respiratory diseases, parasitic diseases, pasteurellosis and other infectious diseases are common diseases in domestic yaks. Wild yaks are strong and resistant to stress. The weight and other indicators of the first generation of hybrid yaks bred using wild yaks are in line with the local conditions. Compared with domestic yaks of the same age, they were significantly enhanced. Existing research has found that the physique and meat production of domestic yaks in areas with wild yaks are significantly better than those in areas without wild yaks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yaks are an indispensable breed of cattle on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the future development of the yak industry, we should devote ourselves to the improvement and cultivation of domestic yaks, and use scientific research as technical support to deeply explore the genetic resource advantages of wild yaks. , vigorously improve the production performance of domestic yaks to bring greater economic benefits. As Professor Liu Jianquan said: &quot;In the era of gene editing and transgenics, interspecific hybridization should still be an important means of cultivating new varieties or even new species that adapt to climate change and human needs, but ideas and technologies must be innovative.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[触目惊心，这国洪灾已致1.1万多人丧生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256772]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Hurricane &quot;Daniel&quot; made landfall on the Mediterranean coast of eastern Libya on September 10 and caused floods in Derna, Bey Caused a large number of casualties in Da, Shehat and other places.

Finance is the blood of the economy, affecting the whole body. What should be special about its benchmark? In order to highlight the commonality of financial benchmarks, the research team of Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center spent more than four months to build a scientific and rigorous evaluation index system, and used the 2022 financial report as the benchmark value, following the principle of openness and fairness, to select &quot; China’s New Financial Competitiveness Ranking”.

A physical education teacher who works in a primary school in Guangzhou expressed his difficulties to me. He works diligently and conscientiously. More than 20 years have passed, but he still cannot be awarded a senior professional title because he has no grasp of thesis writing and has never published a scientific research paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of fellow students is not unique. Many primary and secondary school teachers, especially older teachers, were turned away during the professional title review process because they did not complete the basic requirements for writing scientific research papers, regardless of their teaching years. How long it has been, how rich the teaching experience is, and how many outstanding students it has trained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A journal editor friend of mine told me that her professional title evaluation was based on the editing sequence, but the evaluation indicators were basically the same as those of scientific researchers. In other words, the relevant parties&#39; performance evaluation is based on the same as that of a full-time scientific researcher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the experiences of teachers, there are doctors and people in other fields. For example, doctors also have basic requirements for scientific research papers or scientific research projects during the professional title evaluation process. They are busy treating diseases and saving people, and have no time to write papers, or are unable to complete papers. When the time comes for professional title evaluation, they are often at a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An agricultural expert may have rich practical experience in agriculture. After years of exploration and practice, he and his team have cultivated improved seeds, greatly increased grain output, and significantly increased grain productivity. He has trained many outstanding talents, but perhaps he still has an intermediate professional title simply because he is old and does not have or is not good at writing and publishing papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, writing papers and applying for projects have become prerequisites for the evaluation of professional titles for most professional and technical personnel. Without a paper of a certain weight and a project of a certain level, you cannot be promoted to a professional title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several basic problems here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, papers and projects have become the most important factors in the assessment and evaluation mechanism of practitioners in many industries. Is this reasonable? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense tells us that a teacher’s primary duty is to teach and educate people so that students can grow and thrive healthily; a doctor’s primary duty is to treat illnesses and save people, and relieve patients from their illnesses. Compared with publishing papers or applying for projects, teaching or saving people are the most important things for teachers or doctors. It is really difficult and unnecessary to ask every teacher to be good at doing scientific research and writing papers, to ask every doctor to be good at doing scientific research and writing papers, and to ask every agricultural expert to write papers and submit projects. In other words, if you put the importance of writing papers and applying for projects above teaching, saving people, and taking root in the field, you are literally putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, since papers and topics should not be the most important indicators, why are they most frequently adopted in various personnel assessment and evaluation mechanisms? This is mainly due to the advantages of quantification. Generally speaking, for the assessment of a person, quantitative indicators are generally better than qualitative indicators. The former can eliminate subjective factors such as favors or relationships to a certain extent, that is, by counting the number of published papers and the level of journals, the level of applied topics and Funding is used to determine a person&#39;s professional level. As the main basis for professional title evaluation, it is relatively fair and fair, and it is relatively simple to operate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, are published papers or successfully applied topics necessarily very good? Can it truly reflect the scientific research ability or professional level of the person concerned? Not really. Many teachers are busy with daily teaching, or are not familiar with the routine of writing papers due to their old age. Many doctors are busy with heavy work and have no time to write papers. What should I do? Some people can only temporarily hire gunmen to write their papers and buy space to publish them. There are even “paper processing factories” and “paper gunmen” emerging one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is that fake and shoddy papers are flying all over the place. Even if many papers are published, the authors themselves are too lazy to pay attention to them, and either shelve them or abandon them. Many papers are completed behind closed doors in the office, that is, mainly by purchasing data, constructing models, copying and pasting, and revising and revising. As for the relationship between the theoretical contribution of the paper and its practical value, and the relationship between the paper and one&#39;s own field of expertise, it is not important. What is important is that the article has been put into print. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same way, the funds applied for for many projects are not small, ranging from several million to tens of millions, but they are of little help in solving major issues in China&#39;s comprehensive modernization process, and they are not very helpful in promoting this discipline. There are very few major theoretical innovation contributions in the field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, what is a good paper or a good topic? Yu believes that a good topic or paper must originate from real production and life practices, must be combined with real production and life practices, and must undergo careful and rigorous exploration, investigation and research, or fill a certain research field. The blanks will either play a positive role in promoting human understanding and revealing the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course qualified teachers are encouraged to write papers, but the direct or main purpose of writing papers is to improve the quality of teaching, not to complete requirements, let alone write empty and irrelevant articles that have nothing to do with their own teaching. Boring garbage article. As a teacher, the topic or focus of the paper or topic should mainly focus on teaching, such as the discussion of teaching methods, the improvement of teaching forms, the summary of teaching experience, the design of teaching models, etc. As a doctor, the topic or focus of his paper or project should mainly originate from or be inspired by his own medical treatment process. The paper or project should be conducive to the fundamental alleviation or solution of a difficult and complicated disease and contribute to the practical improvement of medical treatment. It plays a practical role in improving patient treatment efficiency and fundamentally improving human health conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant parties need to re-examine and seriously reflect on the concrete meaning of the four words &quot;people-oriented&quot;: schools are places to cultivate talents, &quot;people-oriented&quot; should be student-oriented, and teachers&#39; primary responsibility is to make students healthy Growth and vigorous development; the hospital is a place where diseases are treated and patients are saved. &quot;Humanism&quot; is based on the patient, and the doctor&#39;s primary responsibility is to relieve the patient&#39;s pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the assessment and evaluation of relevant practitioners, the overall principle is to allow most people to return to their main business or first business, give full play to their strengths, and fundamentally change or optimize the current KPI assessment system in all walks of life. inappropriate or unreasonable elements, moderately or significantly reduce the proportion of papers or topics; implement different assessment methods and details for different types of practitioners, including paper or topic assessments and practical ability assessments, rather than the current relative The prevailing one-way street of only essays or only topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 19:25:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《横琴方案》发布两周年，数读成绩单丨一图读懂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256710]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;72646&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;69538&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/b21efb4423.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Second Anniversary of the Hengqin Plan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;8301&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/b21efb4423.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250814&quot; style=&quot; &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color :orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https ://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“被强奸”漩涡中挣扎八天后，一位44岁农妇选择自杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256716]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house hidden under the trees, Yi Yonghong&#39;s self-report of being &quot;raped&quot; The place where the incident occurred.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 23, 2023, Yi Yonghong decided to commit suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She placed the suicide note on the plastic stool at the head of the bed, and her purse and mobile phone, which she never left, were neatly placed beside the bed. The purse contained more than 3,000 yuan in cash. She locked the door and ignored the clothes in the washing machine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m leaving. I don&#39;t know what I can do to make you less hurt... I don&#39;t ask you to forgive me. I just hope that you can live a happy life and forget that I am a bad wife and mother.&quot; .&quot; She said in her suicide note. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To commit suicide, she chose a mile away. She had to pass through a large guava field. The unripe fruits wrapped in white plastic bags were hung all over the orchard. They were the fruits of her summer. The guava tree is not high, so you have to bend down when walking through it, and you have to cross a drainage ditch in three to five steps. The last section of the road is a slope about two meters high. Climb up and you will reach the embankment. A wide pond with a wide water surface slowly unfolds in front of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The embankment is covered with mimosa, lush and green. The pair of pink slippers were neatly placed on the steps by Yi Yonghong, with the toes facing the pond. A few hours later, her husband Cheng Shanzhi discovered her. She was wearing a red top and floating in a prone position in the middle of the pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight days before committing suicide, at the age of 44, she reported that she was raped by fruit vendor Huang Mouguan. The police decided not to file the case because the existing evidence could not prove that a crime had occurred. After committing suicide, the police decided to open a case for investigation on September 7 because &quot;new evidence was discovered.&quot; In order to prove that she was raped, she was preserved in an ice coffin and underwent a craniotomy and a thoracotomy for an autopsy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Misfortune in the banana fields&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Typhoon Taili is approaching. Before the violent storm arrived, Yi Yonghong had to cut down more than 20 acres of plantains at home. Nine years ago, this couple from Yongzhou, Hunan, planted fruits on a contracted land in Wenchang, Hainan. Now the contracted land covers nearly 50 acres, half of which is planted with bananas and the other half with guava. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong’s WeChat chat records show that on the evening of July 14, she and Huang Mouguan finalized the time to harvest bananas the next day. Huang Mouguan opened a fruit wholesale stall near the busiest park in Wenchang, and would go to fruit farmers&#39; homes to buy fruit. In the Wenchang area, most of the fruit growers are outsiders who have crossed the Qiongzhou Strait to make a living, and most of the fruit vendors are Hainan locals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong rarely goes out in public to sell bananas, and spends most of his time working in the banana fields. In early 2023, Yi Yonghong&#39;s husband Cheng Shanzhi started doing business with Huang Mouguan after being introduced by a fellow villager. By the time the incident occurred, he had sold bananas to him five times in total, with a transaction volume of 1,480 yuan. The first two times, Cheng Shanzhi cut down plantains and traded them with Huang Mouguan. Because her husband&#39;s left ankle was severely cut due to an accident, Yi Yonghong took over the job of cutting plantains for the next three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was these three experiences of selling bananas alone that pushed Yi Yonghong&#39;s life to a point of no return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The banana land contracted by Yi Yonghong and his wife is not close to the village where she rents, and it takes half an hour by electric bicycle. In 2014, they built a shelter house using hollow bricks next to the plantain field. There was no other house within a radius of 200 meters. When we moved out in 2022, there was only a guard dog and a few free-range chickens left there. The unused old house began to fall into dust and became desolate. There was no longer a fire in the kitchen, and no one could sleep on the bed. Except for resting when working, Yi Yonghong rarely came here. The airtight trees almost swallowed up the small house. house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house at the crime scene.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time Yi Yonghong took over for her husband who injured his foot and cut bananas alone with Huang Mouguan was on July 2. To cut bananas, vendors usually go to the fields to select the bananas, and the farmers carry them to the field, where they are finally weighed and loaded onto trucks. Yi Yonghong seems to particularly like pink. She has a short-sleeved shirt of this color, which she wears specially when working. Her right shoulder is covered with dark green glue marks from banana. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong later told her husband that that time, Huang Mouguan took the opportunity to help her carry the banana on his shoulders and touched her breasts. He also said to her: &quot;Don&#39;t do such hard work, I will give you money.&quot; Yi Yonghong refused him: &quot;Don&#39;t say this, we are doing hard work to earn hard money, I am not that Plant people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No more evidence can be obtained for what happened in the banana field. Other merchants next to Huang Mouguan&#39;s fruit shop said they had not seen him for more than a month after the incident. On the afternoon of September 2, Huang&#39;s wife was selling fruit at a stall next to the shop. She was emotional and refused to be interviewed: &quot;You don&#39;t know how much impact they have on our lives. I am under great pressure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week later, the bananas had to be picked again. Yi Yonghong and Huang Mouguan met again in the deserted banana field with wild vegetation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of meeting seems inevitable: Yoshinaga chooses to endure it, and there are only three &quot;basho bosses&quot; working with them at the same time. One is a very old man who walks a little shaky, and the other boss does not The last one who came to purchase was Huang Mouguan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his wife’s account to Cheng Shanzhi, Huang Mouguan once again committed inappropriate behavior. After the attempt, Huang Mouguan gave Yi Yonghong an additional 100 yuan in addition to the 470 yuan in banana money, “My wife just Throw it back to him without asking for it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third time was two days before the typhoon arrived. Cheng Shanzhi said that on July 15, Yi Yonghong arrived at the banana field at the agreed time and selected, cut off the backs, weighed and loaded the bananas. After paying the money, a heavy rainstorm suddenly fell from the sky in the afternoon. Yi Yonghong told Huang Mouguan, who had a canopy installed on the car, that he did not have a raincoat and would wait until the rain stopped before leaving, so he asked him to go first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Yi Yonghong entered the house and sat on the bed that she had not slept on for nearly a year to take shelter from the rain. In the subsequent report, Yi Yonghong said that she was raped at that time. Afterwards, Huang Mouguan left 150 yuan and ran away. Two days later, she told her husband that she felt a little uncomfortable after drinking the honey chrysanthemum tea handed to her by Huang Guan that day. She didn&#39;t know whether it was because of the heat stroke or the chrysanthemum tea, but she felt dizzy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Husband and daughter’s questioning&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If her husband hadn’t found out, Yi Yonghong originally planned to let these things rot in her stomach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The decision to &quot;hide it&quot; is not difficult to make. In the subsequent live recording of the two parties’ contact, Yoshinaga stated that she was worried that if she told her husband what had happened, he would definitely retaliate against him and eventually harm his two children. “I just want to protect this family.” Cheng Shanzhi added that his wife had other considerations, such as the fact that the other party was rich and powerful and she was a wandering migrant; another example was that she was &quot;raped&quot; at the age of 44, which was &quot;disgraceful.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong has been covering up the traces of being &quot;raped&quot;. Huang Mouguan forced her to go to bed for the first time. When Yi Yonghong broke away and ran away, her inner thighs were red. When her husband asked, she lied that it was scratched on her back. After the incident, Yi Yonghong fell three times while riding her bike home. After returning home, Cheng Shanzhi saw that she was unhappy, but she didn&#39;t suffer any injuries, so he didn&#39;t take it to heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the night of the incident, Yi Yonghong asked her husband to sleep in her daughter&#39;s spare room, which made Cheng Shanzhi feel something was wrong. After 23 years of marriage, they rarely sleep in separate beds. Later, Yi Yonghong explained to her husband that the reason for dividing the room was that she didn&#39;t know whether Huang Guan was sick and was afraid of infecting him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how much his wife wanted to hide it, Cheng Shanzhi, who was full of doubts, discovered the clues the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As usual, Cheng Shanzhi rides to the banana patch every morning to feed the guard dog. When he opened the door, he found that the pillows on the bed had been touched, and only a small roll of paper towels was left in a large roll that had not been used for a long time. Cheng Shanzhi &quot;immediately suspected that this might happen.&quot; He didn&#39;t buy any groceries, so he hurried to his home in Sanpaipo Village and asked his wife what happened yesterday, but the answer he got was &quot;nothing happened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi felt that the roll of paper towels was strangely lacking. He thought that he and his wife would use paper towels to wipe after sex, so he continued to press. Until late at night, after questioning still yielded no results, he called his daughter who was working in Haikou during the summer vacation, hoping that her daughter could ask him something. At first, her 22-year-old daughter Cheng Haiyan didn&#39;t believe what her father said, but she felt that he was very angry on the phone. She still called her mother and asked, &quot;Have you been bullied by others?&quot; and &quot;Have you done anything like that with others?&quot; Yi Yonghong was silent and crying on the phone for a long time. After asking the two questions several times in turn, Yi Yonghong finally relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yi Yonghong&#39;s daughter returns to her banana field.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After listening to his wife’s story, Cheng Shanzhi was very angry. He was angry about why his wife didn’t tell him. If he had told him the first or second time, there would have been no such thing. What happened next. He also couldn&#39;t understand why this kind of thing could happen to him. &quot;If you tell me, your body will not be obtained by others. This is the place that hurts my heart the most. I feel that my wife will be mine for life and cannot be shared with others.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;His wife kept it secret for many times, which made Cheng Shanzhi wonder whether she had been &quot;raped&quot; or cheated on her. That night, Cheng Shanzhi, who had never touched his wife before, slapped Yi Yonghong on the forearm. &quot;Am I still sorry to you in this life? I depend on you for everything, and you are in charge of the money. How do you want me to treat you?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I know that no one would believe that something like this happened. If you don’t understand, I can’t even defend myself,” Yi Yonghong said in her suicide note. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reconciliation and alarm&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On July 17, Typhoon Taili was getting closer and stronger, and a storm was imminent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That morning, Cheng Shanzhi called Huang Mouguan and asked him to come to his home. He wanted to confront the other party face to face and also wanted to take revenge on the other party. At almost noon, Huang Mouguan came to the door carrying a box of Wong Lo Kat. Cheng Shanzhi opened a switchblade more than ten centimeters long and hid it in his pants pocket. When Yi Yonghong found out, he hugged him and told him not to do stupid things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first time that the three of them are present at the same time, and it is also the last time. Southern Weekend reporters heard from the live recording at the time that it was not so much a confrontation between two parties, but rather that the three people had their own concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi did not forgive his wife, and said to her angrily: &quot;As long as you get along with him, it&#39;s your own business.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong sometimes shouted hoarsely, He scolded Huang Mouguan: &quot;I can&#39;t protect myself now. I thought you were a very serious person. I&#39;m asking you, why do you want to mess with me? Why don&#39;t you mess with others.&quot; Sometimes he is powerless and self-pitying: &quot;Anyway It’s all my fault, and it doesn’t matter if I die. I have nothing now, and I don’t know where to go.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, Huang Mouguan was supposed to be the target of the crime, but he was like “ &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, while urging the two to live a good life, he agreed to the settlement plan and said to Cheng Shanzhi: &quot;I will give you 10,000 yuan, and we will be settled, and nothing will happen. We are all good brothers.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi said that Huang Mouguan wrote a note on the spot: &quot;I had sexual relations with Yi Yonghong, and now I will compensate Yi Yonghong&#39;s husband for mental loss of 10,000 yuan.&quot; He signed Huang Mouguan&#39;s name. He took out 6,000 yuan in cash and transferred 4,000 yuan via WeChat. But Cheng Shanzhi did not accept the money. He followed his daughter&#39;s advice, called the police and handed the note to the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Haiyan listened to the reconciliation via phone. She did not agree with this settlement plan. In addition to the risk of the other party suing for extortion, she also wanted Huang to apologize to his mother and even wanted him to go to jail. &lt;p>; .com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/68115a27c2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/09/14/68115a27c2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250825&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 17, Huang The Wang Laoji that Guan brought with him during the reconciliation is still in Yi Yonghong&#39;s home. (Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in retrospect, Cheng Haiyan always felt that asking her father to call the police was a bit excessive. &quot;(The family) did not communicate well, so they called the police right away.&quot; In fact, the night before Huang Mouguan came to reconcile, Cheng Haiyan filed a complaint to the police, but Yi Yonghong kept crying and said that there was no evidence and the other party would not admit it. Cheng Haiyan believes that even if she fails to win in the end, she still wants Huang Mouguan to apologize to restore her mother&#39;s reputation. &quot;The other party has always wanted to use money to settle the matter. I think no matter how poor we are, we can&#39;t let you bully us like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Haiyan tried to call Huang Mouguan to &quot;collect evidence&quot;, but every time he said When it comes to key issues, the other party will say, &quot;Don&#39;t talk about this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to tell whether the public reporting to the police was more difficult for Yi Yonghong to accept than being &quot;raped&quot;. On the evening of July 17, Typhoon Taili landed in Wenchang, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Bajiao. At this time, Yi Yonghong, Cheng Shanzhi, and Huang Mouguan were being questioned at the police station. Cheng Shanzhi heard that Yi Yonghong had been crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the surprise of the couple, on the afternoon of July 18, the day after the alarm was called, Huang&#39;s wife, son, daughter, sister, and brother-in-law came to their home with the intention of reconciling. The &quot;lawyer&quot; daughter in Huang&#39;s mouth told Yi Yonghong that words of discord would be unpleasant to hear in the future, and would also have a bad impact on her daughter who is currently in school. Cheng Haiyan didn&#39;t know what else she said to her mother, which made Yi Yonghong feel that her daughter didn&#39;t understand the law. She called her daughter and asked, &quot;Do you understand the law or not?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi refused to reconcile. Later, the other party&#39;s attitude began to change. Cheng Shanzhi said that Huang&#39;s wife threatened them and humiliated Yi Yonghong, &quot;wanting to give her husband to her.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The crying collapse&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the incident to the two failed reconciliations, to calling the police and being questioned, Yi Yonghong is being pushed to the edge of the cliff little by little. Cheng Haiyan said frankly that her family did not take much care of her emotions at that time, and also ignored the understanding and companionship she needed more. But to Cheng Haiyan at that time, her mother&#39;s behavior was &quot;everything was normal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yoshiyong Hong’s collapse may have started with a hysterical cry. At around 5 a.m. on July 19, Cheng Haiyan was woken up by her mother&#39;s cry. My mother had cried before, always while lying on the bed covered with quilts and crying silently. This was the first time Cheng Haiyan had seen her crying heartbrokenly like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi stood at the door, he didn&#39;t know what to do. Cheng Haiyan stood beside her mother&#39;s bed, equally at a loss. She was scared and didn&#39;t know how to express concern or comfort her. Even, she couldn&#39;t understand her mother&#39;s pain at this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She considers herself to be an emotionally rough daughter, because in this family, they are taught that daughters can only rely on themselves, and sons rely on their parents. &quot;My grandmother&#39;s generation would regard their daughters as It&#39;s relatively light and I won&#39;t give too much emotion to my daughter.&quot; Yi Yonghong was taught that it was useless for girls to study, so she dropped out of school before finishing the second grade of junior high school. At that time, Yi Yonghong had good grades, ranked among the top three in her class, and was selected by a dance school, but her grandfather was unwilling to spend money to support her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A group photo of Yi Yonghong&#39;s family.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cheng Haiyan&#39;s generation, she is still treated in this way. When she was a child, Yi Yonghong often told her that her sister must give way to her younger brother, and her younger brother&#39;s clothes must be washed by her sister. The couple&#39;s preference for their son reached its peak in 2015 after his son was diagnosed with acute leukemia. In order not to burden her parents, Cheng Haiyan earned living expenses by herself. She worked as a waiter, dishwasher, and cashier at the front desk. &quot;It was so hard that I felt numb.&quot; In recent years, Cheng Haiyan rarely spends the Chinese New Year with her parents and works outside to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong&#39;s crying did not subside. She repeatedly said &quot;Is this sentence correct?&quot; Cheng Haiyan didn&#39;t know what &quot;this sentence&quot; was. She called her uncle, who was the most suitable person she could think of to comfort her mother. Grandma is old and can&#39;t stand the excitement; her sick brother is doing an internship in another place and is the key target of the family&#39;s concealment; and her aunt and uncle have a bad relationship with their mother and often quarrel. There are few people who can support Yoshiyong Hong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Yi Yonghong has a strong self-esteem and is unwilling to let her family know about her. &quot;We rarely ask relatives for help or call them to complain. My mother feels that people will make fun of you and not want to help you,&quot; Cheng Haiyan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My uncle who was far away in Dongguan answered Cheng Haiyan&#39;s call. &quot;He called my mother&#39;s name twice, &#39;Honghong, Honghong&#39;, and she immediately calmed down.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Haiyan didn’t know why the backbone of the family suddenly collapsed. She survived even when her brother was sick and undergoing chemotherapy. Cheng Shanzhi also couldn&#39;t understand why his wife couldn&#39;t get over this hurdle: &quot;I didn&#39;t mention divorce, and I didn&#39;t drive you away. As a husband, I still love you, so why can&#39;t I just think about it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi is very satisfied with himself. His wife is beautiful, has fair skin, never puts on makeup, and speaks softly. When she took her home for the first time, people in the village praised him, &quot;Your ancestral grave is so nice.&quot; &quot;What else can I say about this kind of wife? There is nothing to dislike at all.&quot; Cheng Shanzhi often teaches his daughter that she should learn from her mother and be nice to her husband in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong is a traditional and conservative rural woman. Even when they fell in love, they only found out Cheng Shanzhi’s zodiac sign and birthday before they got together. After marriage, in addition to doing farm work, Yi Yonghong naturally took over the housework of washing and cooking. She massaged her husband&#39;s feet every day and trimmed his nails every other time. Jiu went to help him serve the rice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the memory of her family, Yi Yonghong rarely interacted with the opposite sex or joked. She always hid when buying sanitary napkins and must put them in black plastic bags. Washed underwear is always hung among other clothes to dry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong doesn’t have many friends. Her pastimes are drinking tea, playing mahjong and scrolling through Douyin. Occasionally, she would take TikTok videos by herself, putting on a fancy template with the filter turned to the maximum, and staring at the camera with a serious expression. Sometimes she laments the hard life, and sometimes she sings the song &quot;Married girl, throw away the water, don&#39;t talk too much when you return to your parents&#39; home&quot; and &quot;Why is it so difficult in this life?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2000, I followed my husband to Hainan to work hard. They planted lemongrass and raised snakes, and finally saved money to build a house in their hometown. However, their son was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Due to long-term labor, the joints of Yi Yonghong&#39;s hands were deformed and unable to be straightened. She often told her daughter that after following your father, there was no house in her hometown, no house in Hainan, and no home anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After her mother died, Cheng Haiyan always dreamed of her, but she could never see her face. Cheng Haiyan guessed that maybe her mother &quot;didn&#39;t want to see us, and we let her down.&quot; Cheng Haiyan did not dare to read the suicide note left by Yi Yonghong a second time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Questioned resistance&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another important reason why Yi Yonghong is under tremendous pressure is that she always believes that the evidence is not enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the incident, in order to hide the incident, Yi Yonghong took a shower and washed the clothes she wore that day. She also threw the used tissues under the tree outside the house and had them removed. Heavy rain washed it away. &quot;I hate myself for not knowing how to use the law to protect myself... There is no evidence of guilt, and I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t win against him,&quot; she stated in her suicide note. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another thing that made Yi Yonghong feel even more desperate was that during the incident, she was not sure whether her behavior was considered resistance. In her suicide note, she said: &quot;If resistance involves scratching as you said, tearing clothes to pieces, there is no such thing. Because I am afraid that he will beat me and harm my family. In my confession, I only said to push him and not to do it. , is this considered resistance?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi seemed to be comforting his dead wife. He said that Huang Guan was a head taller than him, his arms were as thick as his own, and he was tall and tall. &quot;If he holds you with both hands, do you have the strength to resist? No matter whether my wife resists or not, it is you, the man, who takes the initiative to violate my wife, not my wife who violates you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Haiyan doesn&#39;t know what resistance is. In her opinion, pushing the other person away is also resistance. She rarely pays attention to news about women&#39;s rights protection. After her mother committed suicide, a friend recommended Cheng Haiyan to watch the TV series &quot;Imperfect Victim&quot;: &quot;The heroine did not know how to resist under mental oppression. I felt that I My mother is mentally rebellious. If she had not resisted, she would not have cried.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Hangyuan, the 66-year-old village team leader, has his own views on resistance. He believes that to leave a mark on the other person&#39;s body, even if a knife is placed on the woman&#39;s neck, she must resist. After Yi Yonghong committed suicide, another version of the story circulated in the teahouse where Yi Yonghong used to frequent in this small village with only 13 households: The two had an affair and committed suicide after being discovered by her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another factor that complicates the case is the 150 yuan Huang Mouguan left behind when he left. In a confrontation between the two parties after Yi Yonghong committed suicide, Huang&#39;s wife believed that by giving 150 yuan, the nature of the matter changed and became a &quot;business.&quot; After Yi Yonghong committed suicide, the two dirty, black banknotes were crumpled and stacked in Yi Yonghong&#39;s pocket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Shanzhi felt that his wife was insulted by their money, &quot;He (Huang Mouguan) lost the money and ran away. My wife will definitely pick it up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 21, the sixth day after the incident, Cheng Shanzhi and Yi Yonghong were called again to take statements. This was also the second time they took statements after the incident. It was after recording this confession that Yoshinaga wrote the suicide note. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Haiyan remembered that after her mother came home after taking the confession, she called her mother and asked: &quot;Are you willing to file a lawsuit? If you are willing to file a lawsuit, I can only try my best to help you. If If she doesn&#39;t want to sue, she won&#39;t sue.&quot; Cheng Haiyan realized later, &quot;(Before) we wanted her to sue, not that she wanted to sue herself. Taking the initiative and being pushed are not the same thing.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Yi Yonghong chose to sue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Yi Yonghong’s experience was reported by the media, on August 26, the Wenchang Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that it had deployed elite police forces to set up a joint investigation team to conduct a comprehensive review. According to Cheng Haiyan’s statistics, after Yi Yonghong’s suicide, the police re-collected the following evidence: 20 bottles of honey chrysanthemum tea (2 bottles unopened, 18 empty boxes), Yi Yonghong’s mobile phone, 150 yuan banknotes, Yi Yonghong’s gynecology department Check the medical records, the underwear worn by Yi Yonghong the next day after the incident, sheets, quilt covers, mats, pillows, bras, trousers, coats, tissues washed away by the rain, as well as the blood, liver and spleen obtained by Yi Yonghong&#39;s autopsy . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As to whether Huang Mouguan has been detained and what new evidence is available for filing the case, a staff member of the Political Affairs Office of the Wenchang Municipal Public Security Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;The case is under investigation and it is not convenient to disclose it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The bedroom of the house where Yi Yonghong lived before his death, the suicide note was placed on the red stool.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cheng Shanzhi’s view, even on the day Yi Yonghong secretly wrote the suicide note, he did not notice anything unusual about his wife. On July 22, after working for a day, the couple decided to have dinner in a restaurant. Cheng Shanzhi bought four cans of Red Bull for his wife. Yi Yonghong loved to drink Red Bull and drank one can almost every day before the incident. Cheng Shanzhi lay on the recliner waiting for her. After taking a shower, Yi Yonghong hugged her husband and kissed him. For dinner, they ordered a piece of white-chopped chicken and a plate of sweet potato leaves. Yi Yonghong still had no appetite. She didn&#39;t even drink her favorite Red Bull and only ate some sweet potato leaves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 23 was the day when Cheng Haiyan returned to Wenchang from Haikou to record her confession. Early in the morning, Cheng Shanzhi called her: &quot;Hong, let&#39;s go with our daughter to record a statement. The two of us have a companion.&quot; After calling her three times in a row, Yi Yonghong refused. &quot;She said, go ahead, I&#39;ll wait for you to come back at home. I&#39;m very tired and want to take a rest at home.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a normal day, Cheng Shanzhi would go pick her up and the couple would always be inseparable when traveling. But that day, &quot;I forgot to give her a hand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[汕尾如何“握手”高铁经济时代：拥抱文旅融合发展]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256658]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Guangzhou-Shantou High-speed Railway will be officially opened in late September.

The evaluation index system is now described in detail as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/rB3LjY143PkCBOLBGAvB6nIqPDnWobGzOmO0ep0Z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250761 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(1) Business scale and growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Credit cards are an important tool for banks to establish long-term relationships with customers, and are also the focus of banks’ retail business. The scale and growth of the credit card business reflect the bank&#39;s customer acquisition capabilities and market position, while the number of credit card issuances and changes in the issuance volume reflect the bank&#39;s expansion effect, and the loan balance and proportion reflect the actual contribution of the bank&#39;s credit cards, the number of active accounts and transactions The amount reflects the marketing accuracy and stickiness of bank credit cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Risk management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very necessary to examine the risk management capabilities of bank credit cards. Credit cards are &quot;unsecured revolving loans&quot; issued by banks based on their trust in cardholders. The risk management capabilities of credit card business affect the bank&#39;s operating efficiency and competitiveness. Credit cards are an important source of income for banks, and their revenue comes from interest, fees and annual fees. If indicators such as the bad debt rate, fraud rate, and theft rate of credit cards cannot be effectively controlled, the bank&#39;s costs will increase and its profits will decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the epidemic, the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks (including the non-performing ratio of credit card loans) will increase in 2022. At the same time, the measures to improve non-performing loan ratios disclosed in the annual reports of most listed banks are relatively general, and the measures taken by various banks lack comparability. In order to highlight the efforts and effects of banks in controlling the non-performing loan ratio, this evaluation system uses the credit card loan non-performing ratio indicator in 2022 and also sets a change rate indicator for the credit card loan non-performing ratio to directly reflect the achievements of the measures taken by each bank. Effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(3) Customer service and product innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition in the credit card market is becoming increasingly fierce, and banks are constantly launching new products, services, functions and activities to meet the diverse needs of customers and improve customer stickiness. This evaluation system evaluates from both the bank side and the consumer side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We use the types of credit cards issued by banks and the number of complaints about credit card business as positive and negative indicators respectively. On the consumer side, evaluations from third-party organizations are used, because third-party organizations obtain consumers’ evaluations of credit card products through a large number of objective questionnaires, which are more objective than those disclosed in bank annual reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We select China Customer Satisfaction Index (C-CSI) and China Net Promoter Score (C-NPS) as consumers’ evaluation of credit card products. index. C-CSI and C-NPS survey targets permanent residents between the ages of 15 and 60, and are randomly sampled according to gender, age, income and region, and completed through household interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We consider the card issuer’s distinctive credit card services of the year as bonus points. Each unique credit card service that is publicly disclosed and can be collected will receive 10 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Reward and punishment mechanism for information disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our research, we found that most banks have disclosed data on each of the above indicators, but a few banks have not disclosed one or more indicators. In order to reduce the impact of information asymmetry and punish banks that do not disclose sufficient information, this evaluation system will give the lowest score to any indicator item that does not disclose relevant data. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China Merchants Bank takes the lead&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Hua Xia is only better than city commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;We will 19 The credit card businesses of commercial banks are ranked according to their scores, and the &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List&quot; is selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Credit Card Quality and Efficiency Ranking&quot; shows that national commercial banks that started their credit card business earlier and have a large customer base rank high. But it does not mean that the larger the card issuance volume, the higher the overall score. As a joint-stock bank, although China Merchants Bank is not as large as the state-owned banks, it ranks first in the overall score of credit card business. This is due to its strategic vision of taking the lead in developing retail business and its innovation power that has been sustained for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/nrq2m73w7NwpA0YngHO0HozRPlvgzwOnrwyzdfu2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China closely followed China Merchants Bank in second and third place respectively. Among them, the total score of China Construction Bank&#39;s credit cards is only 20 points less than that of China Merchants Bank, with a very small gap. Three banks form the leading phalanx in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, the total score of Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China is far outside the top five. Not only are they far behind China Merchants Bank, but they are also surpassed by joint-stock banks such as CITIC, Ping An and China Guangdong Development Bank. Postal Savings Bank ranked thirteenth. Among joint-stock banks, Hua Xia Bank is at the bottom, with a score difference of 248 points from China Merchants Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/XPGZaas4gffibT9dkNVoXQWhd7gVkP1r0UbYHUiZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250763&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business and Industry The main reason why banks lose points with credit cards is that they only publish the total complaints but not the complaints of the credit card business. Therefore, when we do not consider the indicator of credit card business complaints, China Merchants Bank still leads the list, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China overtook China Construction Bank and rose to second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if the number of complaints is not taken into account, China Guangdong Development Bank and Bank of Communications leap to fourth and fifth place. This shows that the number of complaints from these two banks is relatively large. Of course, this does not rule out malicious complaints from gray products. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;State-owned banks and joint-stock banks are seriously divided&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks are catching up&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >; Regardless of state-owned banks or joint-stock banks, the credit card scores of the two echelons are seriously divided in their respective camps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the six major state-owned banks, only two and three are among the top five in the two lists, namely China Construction Bank, ICBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Bank of Communications. Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China ranked low in both lists. Especially in the list excluding the number of complaints, Bank of China’s score has reached fourteenth place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among joint-stock banks, China Merchants Bank has always been far ahead. The overall performance of CITIC, Ping An and GF is remarkable. Among them, China CITIC Bank’s total credit card score is second only to China Merchants Bank among joint-stock banks. This is mainly due to the fact that the bank has received more scores than its peers in terms of consumer services and credit card business complaints. Among them, the score for credit card complaints is higher than that of other companies on the list. Bank and credit card categories also scored over 80, indicating that they cover a wide range of consumer groups. Although Guangdong Development Bank is smaller among all joint-stock banks, the overall score of Guangfa Credit Card is high among all banks. This reflects the important position of China Guangdong Development Bank&#39;s credit card business in the bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The credit card scores of the four city commercial banks are at the bottom of the list, which shows that they still have a clear gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of comprehensive credit card strength. Affected by factors such as their short time in the credit card market, small business scale and weak customer base, city commercial banks as a whole lag behind in indicators such as credit card issuance volume and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, among city commercial banks, Bank of Jiangsu and Bank of Ningbo both scored 100 points for the credit card change volume indicator, especially Bank of Ningbo, which scored as high as 90 points for the proportion of complaints in the credit card business. This reflects that leading city commercial banks are working hard to catch up in the credit card business and have made great progress in some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Assistant researcher Liang Chenghao, Zou Huan and Yang Chaoqun also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲殴打猥亵女儿者，检察机关不予起诉：义愤彰显人性，震慑奸宄之徒丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256739]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 14:09:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a case published by the &quot;Procuratorial Daily&quot; made many netizens shout &quot;Yangjian News&quot; and &quot;very mentioning&quot; gas&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 9, 2021, Li learned that his 15-year-old daughter had been molested by Xie Moumou, the deputy dean of a certain vocational and technical college, and came to the school to beat Xie Moumou. Xie&#39;s injury was assessed as minor injury level two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The procuratorial organ believed that although Li&#39;s act of injuring Xie was suspected of intentional injury, it was an act of injury carried out out of anger in the process of claiming his daughter&#39;s legitimate rights and interests from the school. Because Li was a first-time offender and an occasional offender, his behavior was justified and the circumstances were minor, and he had lenient and lenient punishment circumstances such as surrendering, so the decision was made not to prosecute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Xie Moumou, after the procuratorate initiated a public prosecution, the court sentenced him to two years and two months in prison for the crime of forced indecency, prohibiting him from engaging in sexual relations with minors from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole. Occupations with special responsibilities such as education, training, and nursing that are in close contact with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among netizens’ reactions, no one complained about his father Li’s beating of Xie to a minor injury, let alone treating it as “intentional injury.” Instead, there were various “beatings” &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s not an exaggeration to beat him to death&quot;. Does such a sound sound &quot;tyrannical&quot;? not at all. This is the manifestation of the &quot;simple sense of justice&quot; or &quot;emotion of law&quot; inherent in every normal person&#39;s heart. Indignation makes us human, and integrity must mean knowing what to love and what to hate. Confucius said: Only benevolent people can love others and hate others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens also had complimentary words for the local procuratorate, such as &quot;the light of justice&quot; and &quot;wanting to send a banner.&quot; If the law were applied mechanically, the father could be prosecuted and sentenced if he beat someone to a minor injury of the second degree. There are many cases like this in reality: one spouse cheats, the other catches the cheater in bed, and beats the lover wildly in anger. Then the lover goes to assess the injury. As long as the injury is minor, the other spouse will either pay for a settlement or be charged with intentional injury. Although it is legal to go to jail and let the attacker go to jail, it is against human ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, to some extent, the above cases reflect the conflict between natural law and statutory/statutory law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called natural law/natural rights simply means that laws are discovered, not invented or formulated, which is often referred to as &quot;natural law&quot;. From the perspective of evolutionary game theory, natural law is the embodiment of &quot;evolutionary stable strategy&quot; (ESS). Tit for retaliation, or what Confucius said, &quot;repay kindness with kindness, repay hatred with directness&quot; is ESS. Only in this way , can promote cooperation among members of society, suppress breach of trust and aggression, and enable society and civilization to survive. The final rule derived from &quot;reciprocity&quot; is that each other respects each other&#39;s life, freedom and property rights, as the Chinese say, &quot;Kill to pay for life, debt to pay for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statutory law is made by people and will refer to natural law or customary law, but it is not always consistent with natural law or customary law, and sometimes even runs counter to it. In the fields of marriage, family and property inheritance, there are many cases Reflects the conflict between statutory law and natural law or customary law. The only daughter, Ms. Yang, wanted to inherit her parents&#39; inheritance, but found that 22 relatives of both parents also had the right to inherit (based on statutory law). Fortunately, these relatives did not think they had the right to inherit the inheritance of Ms. Yang&#39;s parents (based on natural law and common law). This is Heaven governs people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the case where his father Li beat Xie. Xie obviously knew how to use legal weapons to protect himself. After being beaten, he immediately identified the injury as &quot;minor injury level two&quot;, which showed that he He also suffered injuries, using this as a bargaining chip, or wanting to offset the disadvantages he faced in the molestation case, because minor injuries can be administratively detained, and minor injuries can be sentenced to prison. The show is &quot;I go to jail, you also go to jail, let&#39;s go together.&quot; posture. Judging from the local procuratorate&#39;s handling of both cases, it is obvious that the police also completed the investigation into the beating case of his father Li and handed it over to the prosecutor. It can be inferred that Xie reported the case to the police after being beaten. Reporting the crime + injury assessment, the direction of counterattacking Li is very obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the local procuratorate’s decision not to prosecute Li has resolved the conflict between natural law and statutory law in this incident. It is in accordance with the laws of nature and people’s hearts, and it is for the father Li to stand up for his daughter. The behavior and morality are very good, and it is also a good deterrent to those who try to extend their dirty hands to minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do individuals deal with conflicts between natural law and statutory law? My father, Li, is a good example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different statutory provisions and different judgments based on them mean different behavioral incentives for people and will change people&#39;s behavior. For example, the case of Datong, Shanxi, where she was accused of rape after getting engaged, triggered strong concerns and debates. , one of the motives discussed by everyone is &quot;how to avoid legal risks&quot;, but generally speaking, when the rights of parents and children are violated, the emotions and temperament of blood thicker than water will prevail, at least they will be very angry, and often stand Come out, instead of blindly looking forward and backward, timid, and appearing particularly &quot;rational and calm&quot;. If a person does not show blood and courage at this time, then he probably does not have these things at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every father and mother who stands up for their children is worthy of respect. When their children are hurt and most vulnerable and helpless, they stand up to confront the aggressor and expose the aggressor&#39;s evil deeds to the broad daylight. This is the best help and the best value for their children. educate. They let their children know that when they are hurt, their parents are their strongest backing and support; they must be as brave as their parents, dare to say no to infringements and infringers, and dare to advocate and defend their rights. If there are more parents like this, not only will those who are ready to make a move think twice about it, but they will also convey a strong and profound value system to the next generation and the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
