Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 7, 2023, local time, Min Aung Hlaing’s armed stronghold No. 11 at Dashuitang in the Western District of Kokang, Myanmar, was attacked. After 30 minutes of fierce fighting, the stronghold was captured by the Myanmar Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army (also known as the Kokang Alliance Army). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, the Kokang Allied Forces shared a battlefield video on social platforms. In the video, the red flag of the Confederate Army was flying high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, the Kokang Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army formed the &quot;Three Brothers Alliance&quot; and launched armed attacks on the Myanmar Army&#39;s military strongholds in many places in northern Myanmar. attack. For more than ten days since then, the Kokang Allied Forces have maintained a daily update frequency on social media and announced their results in a high-profile manner. According to the Kokang Alliance Army, the Northern Myanmar Alliance Army has occupied more than 120 National Defense Forces camps and is still continuing to advance towards Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Myanmar military government rarely expressed its position, only responding that three government-controlled areas were out of control. On November 2, the Myanmar National Defense Force declared a state of emergency and will launch a counterattack soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, civilian armed forces often launched operations against the Myanmar government forces alone. Even with the assistance of coalition forces, they fought alone on separate lines. However, this time the military operation of the Kokang Alliance Army not only involved civilian armed forces, but also It has also received response and support from other anti-military forces, which will make the war situation more complicated.&quot; Heng Kai, a Burmese Chinese scholar and assistant professor at the Institute of Overseas Chinese and Regional Countries at Huaqiao University, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the fighting continues to escalate. The northern Myanmar coalition forces and the National Defense Forces are constantly exchanging fire, and a confrontation situation is gradually forming around Kokang. Under the continuous gunfire, tens of thousands of people in northern Myanmar were forced to flee their homes, and the number of refugees continued to increase. Wanding, a small border town in Yunnan across the river from northern Myanmar, was also affected by the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on all parties to immediately cease fire and end the war, insist on resolving differences peacefully through dialogue and consultation, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure the security of the China-Myanmar border. safe and stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 31, 2023, volunteers were unloading supplies in the Kokang 125 refugee camp.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I have never been so nervous”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 4 o’clock in the morning on November 4, 2023, the Aren family was once again awakened by the intensive sound of gunfire coming from Lashio City, Myanmar. . &quot;The government troops fired about 17 artillery shells outside the city in a row, and everyone was awakened,&quot; A Ren told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aren is from Myanmar and has lived in Kunming, Yunnan for a long time. On October 25, he returned to Lashio from Yunnan to visit relatives. Unexpectedly, on the third day after arriving home, he unexpectedly witnessed the conflict in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhixiang, who has worked in Kokang Old Street in Myanmar for 13 years, seems to be luckier. On October 16, Zhixiang left the old street for something and happened to avoid it. He originally planned to return on the 28th, but as a result of the war, ground transportation was paralyzed, and Zhixiang failed to return to Kokang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting at 4 a.m. on October 27, Qingshuihe, Menggu, Guidi, Gunung, Lashio and other areas in northern Shan State were simultaneously attacked by the northern Myanmar coalition forces. Toll booths, police posts, The city&#39;s military as well as its police station were attacked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The sound of gunfire that day was so dense that it felt like it was exploding in my ears. It was very scary.” Aren recalled, “I never expected to encounter such a thing. There has never been such a tense situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lashio is the capital of Shan State in northern Myanmar and the seat of the Myanmar military&#39;s Northeastern Military Region Headquarters. &quot;On the top of the mountain in the center of the city, government troops have been launching missiles for more than ten days. &quot;Many artillery shells were fired.&quot; Aren said that in order to appease the people, the local media in Lashio once issued a special reminder that these artillery shells were mainly used to support other war zones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Operation 1027&quot; is named after its launch date, October 27. Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, a political analyst at The Diplomat magazine, estimated that approximately 20,000 northern Myanmar coalition troops participated in the operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Compared with previous conflicts in the Kokang area, this military operation is not only larger in scale, but also has wider and more comprehensive strategic coverage.&quot; Heng Kai pointed out that the &quot;Three Brothers Alliance&quot; not only targeted the areas including Qingshuihe They launched an offensive at the strategic location of Kokang in the country and simultaneously attacked Lashio in an attempt to contain the Myanmar National Defense Forces and prevent them from supporting northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson of the Myanmar National Management Council, responded that after continuous fighting in multiple places, the three government-controlled areas of Qingshuihe, Pengxian and Bangsai were lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingshuihe is located in Kokang, while Pengxian and Bangsai belong to Muse, both of which are important trade ports between China and Myanmar. The three places are close to the China-Myanmar border, and are separated by only a river of water. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce of the Myanmar Government, from April to September 2023, the total border trade between Myanmar and China was US$1.8 billion (approximately S$2.5 billion), more than a quarter of which was traded through Qingshui River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myanmar ethnic local armed forces stated that blocking the road from Lashio to Qingshui River and Muse can cut off the land access of Myanmar government troops into northern Shan State. But for the people in northern Myanmar, these land passages are even more important life supply lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Most of the supplies in Kokang Old Street rely on the Qingshui River. Now goods from China and Myanmar cannot come in, and the price of rice has soared more than three times.&quot; Alan, a Chinese from Myanmar, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot; A bag of rice used to cost about 200 to 300 yuan, but now it has increased to 1,400 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Worried about not being able to buy supplies in the future, Alan&#39;s friend wanted to stock up on several boxes of instant noodles for emergencies, but he failed Nowhere to buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiaomai and Lashio, because it is difficult to transport goods out of the country, prices are being sold at reduced prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Akin’s family is engaged in breeding in Jiaomai, northern Myanmar. &quot;There are a large number of farmers in Jiaomai, and they usually transport eggs to Mandalay and other cities for sale. Since roads are now restricted, eggs can only be sold cheaply in the city.&quot; Ajin told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 6, 2023, workers in yellow vests were cleaning the Kokang 125 refugee camp.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Retreating or staying, unable to escape&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the conflict first started, the Aren family was ready to flee Lashio at any time, and they prepared it in the car in advance food and drinking water. &quot;But now there is no such panic. It is safer at home. After all, Lashio is still in the hands of the government forces. They have a lot of heavy equipment.&quot; Aren explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in other war zones where conflicts are more intense, it is difficult for people to choose calmly between retreating and staying. Some people had to flee in a hurry, while others were forced to stay in fear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the conflict entered the second week, the northern Myanmar coalition forces fought continuously in Gunong and the Dongshan and Xishan Districts of Kokang, gradually forming a siege on Lao Cai. The Kokang Allied Forces unilaterally stated that it had eliminated many Burmese military strongholds around Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The situation in Lao Cai is getting more and more tense.” Zhixiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the people in northern Myanmar are facing difficulties that are difficult to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;From Lao Cai back to Lashio, you need to pass through Qingshui River, Gunong, Nanzala and Mubang. These places are either occupied by the northern Myanmar coalition forces or are engaged in fighting. It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want to leave, but I can’t leave because I’m afraid the road will become unsafe.” Alan told Southern Weekend reporters that many of her friends are now trapped in the old streets. “They are panicking, but they have no choice.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2023, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, said that since October 26, nearly 33,000 men, women, and children have been displaced in northern Myanmar. According to local media reports in Myanmar, the resettlement sites set up near the 125 Kokang border currently accommodate more than 12,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhixiang has been engaged in volunteer service in Kokang for the past 13 years. Since the conflict in northern Myanmar, his service organization and the Kokang United Youth Association have jointly taken on the operation of one of the refugee camps. In just ten days, the refugee camp has received more than 1,300 refugees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video of the refugee camp sent by Zhixiang to Southern Weekend reporters, simple tents in various colors of red, yellow, blue and green are densely arranged in a wilderness, with intrusive rocks under the tents. and loess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The current power supply in the camp is good, but what we lack most is water and rice, and the price of rice is getting higher and higher, making it increasingly difficult to buy.&quot; Zhixiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to successive fierce battles between the Northern Myanmar Coalition Army and the Myanmar National Defense Force, a large number of Gounong people fled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Southern Weekend reporter contacted a person who had asked for help on the social platform. She told the Southern Weekend reporter that &quot;it has been safely evacuated&quot;, but she was unwilling to discuss the specific details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even safe evacuation does not mean that you are immune to the suffering of war. A family fled for safety and found the house burned to an empty shell when they returned. Zhixiang has seen too many similar scenes in the past few years. &quot;As long as you run to remote mountainous areas to escape, you will basically have nothing when you come back, and I think this time is no exception.&quot; Zhixiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;November 6, 2023, breakfast in Kokang 125 Refugee Camp.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Peace is the most important”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Having worked in the Kokang area for 13 years, Zhixiang has experienced many conflicts in the area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kokang Autonomous Region and its capital Laojie Town, which borders Yunnan, have long been the stronghold of the Kokang Allied Forces. On August 8, 2009, the Myanmar government forces sent 30 police officers to search the Kokang Gun Repair Factory on the pretext that it was manufacturing drugs. After being refused, they formed a confrontation with the Kokang Allied Forces. Subsequently, internal strife broke out within the Kokang Allied Forces, and deputy commander Bai Suocheng led his troops to defect to the Burmese government. On August 30, Myanmar government forces took full control of Kokang, and the remaining Allied forces retreated into the mountains and forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the Kokang Allied Forces launched two consecutive military operations in 2015 and 2017 in an attempt to regain control of the Kokang, but both were collapsed by the Myanmar government forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the northern Myanmar coalition issued a joint statement stating that Operation &quot;1027&quot; aims to unite all revolutionary organizations to overthrow the dictatorship of the Myanmar military group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 29 is the 1,000th day that the Myanmar military government came to power. In Heng Kai&#39;s view, it was not accidental that the civilian armed forces in northern Myanmar chose such a time to launch the attack, but was based on comprehensive considerations of strategic goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the 2021 coup, Myanmar launched a massive anti-military operation, with constant conflicts between government forces and opposition forces. The northern Myanmar coalition launched military operations in the name of &#39;anti-dictatorship&#39;, making it easier to obtain counter-attacks.&quot; The military forces responded.&quot; Heng Kai analyzed that the most fundamental purpose was to recapture Kokang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than ten days, the northern Myanmar coalition forces have continued to advance towards Kokang. It said that from October 27 to November 5, three civilian armed forces had captured more than 120 National Defense Force camps. However, the Myanmar military government did not respond directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Northern Burma Allied Forces are so powerful that it is not difficult to capture these strongholds, but it is not easy to hold them.&quot; Heng Kai pointed out that, from the current point of view, the Kokang Allied Forces have won Most of them are only strongholds around the city, and it is difficult to say how much impact they will have on urban jurisdiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Min Aung Hlaing, the top leader of Myanmar’s military government, warned that the military would launch a counterattack against local ethnic armed groups in Shan State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Myanmar National Defense Forces still have overwhelming strength, but since 2021, the Myanmar military government has been attacked on all sides, and even the capital Naypyitaw has been attacked.&quot; Heng Kai analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 2021, Myanmar’s political situation suddenly changed, and state power was transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defense Forces, Min Aung Hlaing. Some anti-military figures immediately established a national unity government and the People&#39;s Defense Force, took military actions against the National Defense Forces, and took joint actions with local armed forces from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the Myanmar Institute for Strategic and Policy Research, in the 21 months from the coup in Myanmar to November 15, 2022, at least 7,855 conflicts broke out across Myanmar. Among them, the military exchanged fire with ethnic minority armed organizations 4,548 times, with the People&#39;s Defense Forces 2,267 times, and the military exchanged fire with ethnic minority armed organizations and the People&#39;s Defense Forces 925 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the northern Myanmar coalition launched the military operation, 14 &quot;revolutionary organizations&quot; across Myanmar have announced their support for &quot;Operation 1027&quot;, and some of them have announced that they will join the fight. According to local media reports in Myanmar, after four consecutive days of offensive, the Kachin Independence Army and the local People&#39;s Defense Force occupied Gaoling Town in Sagaing Province on November 6. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;With the Myanmar military government facing enemies from both sides, it is still difficult to say exactly where the war will go,&quot; Heng Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the people in northern Myanmar who have suffered from war, discussing politics may be too far away, and the rice waiting to be harvested in the rice fields is more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Myanmar has three seasons a year - hot season, rainy season and cool season. Now it is the rainy season rice harvesting season.&quot; Aren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A farmer in Lashio told local media, &quot;In the past two weeks, it was impossible to harvest rice because of the rain. After the rain stopped, the fighting started. Because the sound of aircraft and weapons was often heard, everyone did not If you dare to go to the fields to harvest, you can only act according to the situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interview, Southern Weekend reporters asked many interviewees about their views on this conflict, and the answers they received were almost unanimous. ——No matter who wins, for us people, &quot;peace is the most important thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Ajin, Alan, Aren, Zhixiang, and Zou Li are pseudonyms in the article.

Use social platforms to publicly publish birth certificate information, identify customers, and sell birth certificates and vaccine books. According to the online post, the buyer only needs to provide identity information and pay 96,000 yuan, and the hospital will follow the &quot;normal&quot; production process and handle a full set of true information such as filing, prenatal check-up, hospitalization, delivery, and discharge at the hospital. &quot;Two days after being discharged from the hospital, the customer can take the &quot;bought child&quot; to the hospital to collect foot blood (foot blood is collected when a newborn is born), and then apply for a birth certificate. The entire process can be completed in up to 7 days. At the same time, the hospital provides a national version of the vaccination book, and &quot;vaccines&quot; according to the &quot;real&quot; newborn birth process, printing hepatitis B and BCG vaccine injection records, injection dates, vaccine manufacturers, and vaccine batch numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the online post was published, it sparked heated discussions among netizens.

After retirement, he joined the Henan Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Old Foundation&quot;) and was responsible for collecting private funds from the county. In the eight years he witnessed, people were able to get their principal and interest back as scheduled. Until August 2021, no more money could be withdrawn, and savers began to &quot;visit&quot; every now and then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn on October 24, 2023, the first guest welcomed into Zhang Shihe’s home was 69-year-old Zhang Fenglan. Six years ago, she deposited the 100,000 yuan she had saved for most of her life into the Lao Foundation and became a &quot;five-star member.&quot; Zhang Shihe is the person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Fenglan’s reminder voucher is not a passbook or an IOU, but two membership certificates. The issuing organization is the Old Foundation. If you deposit money to it, you will receive consolation money, which is interest. In Shangshui County, for every 10,000 yuan saved, you can get 570 yuan/year in consolation payment, with an annualized rate of return of 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I thought I had saved my money in the safest place, but I never imagined that something like this would happen.” Zhang Fenglan sighed repeatedly to the Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe persuaded the other party in a low voice, saying that he was also a victim and felt very guilty for &quot;losing&quot; everyone&#39;s money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed that the entire Shangshui County involves more than 300 depositors, with a total of more than 41 million yuan in deposits. Looking at the entire Henan Province, the tentacles of the Old Foundation are everywhere. Several insiders of the old foundation revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the old foundation may absorb as much as 500 million yuan in depositors&#39; funds in Henan Province, involving 18 offices in Zhoukou, Nanyang, Luohe, Luoyang and other cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, 2023, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs mentioned in its reply to Li Yazhong and others’ letter of complaint that in June 2020, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs transferred Henan Herong Industrial Group Co., Ltd. ( (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) suspected illegal financing-related materials were handed over to the Henan Provincial Public Security Department in the name of the Lao Foundation. The official website of the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs also records that on July 28, 2020, the Lao Foundation was included in the list of social organizations with serious violations of laws and breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many heads of old foundations confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that under the guidance of the Henan Provincial Public Security Department, public security bureaus in many places have launched investigations into county-level old foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late October, Southern Weekend reporters visited several counties and districts in Zhoukou and Luohe cities and found that the Lao Foundation used local political and private network resources to weave a huge deposit-absorbing network. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did a provincial public foundation “self-raise” such huge sums of money in the past ten years? Where do these huge sums of money ultimately go? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Network&quot; retired cadres and farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to become a veteran foundation member? A &quot;Membership Instructions&quot; found by Southern Weekend reporters states that applicants fill out the membership application form, and after review and approval by the Old Foundation, register information and pay membership fees. After receiving the membership card, they become a formal member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that these membership fees will be returned to members when they expire (one year), and you can also receive consolation money by presenting your membership card to the issuing agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Membership fees are essentially deposits, and the amount is replaced by points on the membership card. Members are divided into one-star, three-star and five-star, and the corresponding points represent RMB 10,000, RMB 30,000 and RMB 50,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 82-year-old Lu Zhiqiang is a big customer of the old foundation and has 22 membership cards in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a retired cadre in Shangshui County. He has a monthly pension of more than 3,000 yuan, plus a front-end house, and an annual rent of more than 30,000 yuan. He and his wife cannot spend this money. How many. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled that in the early days of the establishment of the Lao Foundation, Chen Zhihong, the person in charge in Shangshui County, often invited people to have dinner together to promote the Lao Foundation in order to build momentum. As a fellow villager, he even participated once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because it is a public foundation, I think there is no problem. Even if you deposit money in a bank for a fixed term, you don&#39;t have much money.&quot; He remembers Chen Zhihong motivating him like this, &quot;This foundation is managed by the Civil Affairs Department, so it can&#39;t be wasted.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Zhiqiang hid the deposits of the old foundation from his children, not even his wife. &quot;If you tell them, they will stop it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Fenghua, 77, is the former head of the financial section of the Shangshui County Industrial and Commercial Bureau. She has deposited 250,000 yuan in the old foundation. She only learned about the old foundation through the introduction of a retired cadre from the Shangshui County Civil Affairs Bureau. &quot;I only knew that the interest rates were high and the certificates issued had the seal of the Civil Affairs Department, so I thought it was more reliable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t dare to tell my child at that time, for fear of exposing that my child was asking for the money. I wanted to save it so that I could hire a nanny when I get old.&quot; Guo Fenghua sighed, &quot;It&#39;s too late to regret it now. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres in the county, the Lao Foundation has also extended its tentacles to the vast rural areas of Henan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui, 70, is from Chengding Village, Guxiang Township, Linying County, Luohe City. He is responsible for helping the Lao Foundation collect deposits in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at first the villagers saved little money, &quot;but because of the high interest rates, you saw me saving, I saw him saving, and word spread slowly.&quot; Some villagers even offered to give him cigarettes in order to do something for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He absorbed 2.75 million yuan in funds, involving about 40 depositors, accounting for half of the village&#39;s population. There are also a few savers from other villages who are his relatives. Shang Fugui said that for every 10,000 yuan deposited, depositors can receive a condolence payment of 600 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, we are a small bank down there.” A head of the county-level office of the old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Luohe, the old foundation showed the first signs of trouble. In October 2015, the Provincial Lao Foundation said that its funds were broken and gradually stopped local principal and interest payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui recalled that after the payment was stopped, the depositors became enemies with him. Seven years later, in October 2022, he was beaten once by villagers. &quot;Sometimes the tricycles are not dared to be released outside. They will poke holes in you and vent your anger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every Spring Festival, Shang Fugui and his wife would run to the city. &quot;What if I don&#39;t run away? They all gather at the door of my house to ask for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A depositor has as many as 22 membership cards.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Jilin&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Using &quot;volunteers&quot; as the starting point&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Intermediaries such as Zhang Shihe and Shang Fugui are called &quot;volunteers&quot; in the old foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are often retired cadres or former loan officers. Their personal status provides credit endorsement to local people. Choosing such a group of &quot;hands-on&quot; is also a reason why similar foundations can always grow rapidly among the people. One of the &quot;mysteries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second floor of No. 8 Zhengxin Street, Shangshui County, Zhoukou City is the local office of the Old Foundation. When Southern Weekend reporters visited on October 23, the place was deserted and the door was locked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that there are five &quot;volunteers&quot; in the office, basically all retired cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Chen Zhihong is the person in charge of the Shangshui County Lao Foundation. He once served as secretary of the Party Committee of Tangzhuang Township in Shangshui County and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Shangshui County Party Committee. Zhang Shihe is the former vice president of a commercial bank in Shangshui County. The other two &quot;volunteers&quot; have served in the Shangshui County Finance Bureau and the Procuratorate respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former staff member of Weiji Township Government in Shangshui County told Southern Weekend reporters that he and Chen Zhihong are fellow villagers. I often sit at the same table with Chen Zhihong during meetings in the county. I am familiar with her, so I also saved some money. &quot;He is not like a liar, he is a very down-to-earth person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a criminal verdict obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, Yang Yiting, a &quot;volunteer&quot; at the Linying County Office in Luohe City, mentioned in his testimony that the old man When the foundation&#39;s Linying office was established, the director of the office, Xue Xiaoge, came to him and said that the provincial old foundation hoped to find a local cadre with prestige, good popularity, and retired cadre to serve as the honorary director. &quot;The foundation is engaged in charity. Shang Qi had been retired at home for two years and wanted to do something.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xue Xiaoge confessed that Yang Yiting was the former political commissar of the Linying County Public Security Bureau and the honorary director. &quot;When there is an event, he takes part in it. He doesn&#39;t usually go to work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres from government agencies, former rural loan officers are also an important force for the old foundation to sink into the rural market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;70-year-old Feng Junfu is a villager in Guzhuang Village, Daguo Town, Linying County, Luohe City. In 1975, he was elected as a loan officer of Daguo Township Credit Union by the Guzhuang Village Committee and worked there for 34 years until 2009. Get fired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Junfu said that township residents are accustomed to depositing funds in local rural credit cooperatives or township banks, and loan officers play the role of handling business for villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Loan officers must first be ideologically progressive, trustworthy by the people, and have no stains.” Feng Junfu told Southern Weekend reporters that there are 20 old foundation “volunteers” in Linying County, most of whom have worked as loan officers in township banks. , and people from all over the country regard them as their &quot;own people&quot; who are worthy of entrustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2013, Xue Xiaoge found Feng Junfu and showed him the approval document of the old foundation from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the foundation’s legal person certificate, tax registration certificate, organization code certificate, etc., saying that it was formal. organization and invite him to join. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most important thing is that we have depositor resources in our hands.” Feng Junfu told Southern Weekend reporters that he thought about staying in his old business and the process was roughly the same, so he readily agreed. In Guzhuang Village, Feng Junfu developed more than 50 villagers into members of the Lao Foundation and collected a total of 1.85 million yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Provincial Veterans Foundation stipulates that for every 10,000 yuan taken in, 300 yuan will be set aside for &quot;volunteers&quot; and another 200 yuan will be used for office expenses of the county and district offices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Origined from the Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the source, the old foundation is inextricably linked to the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the Henan Song Foundation collected deposits from villagers in the name of public welfare medical insurance. (See Southern Weekend’s September 2011 series of reports on “Where is the Money of China’s Most Fundraising Charitable Organization—Who Controls the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation”)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2013, the old foundation officially It was established and Lu Dawei was appointed as the president. According to the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Government website, Lu Dawei served as assistant to the governor. In addition, Southern Weekend reporters learned from the Henan Song Foundation website that he is also the vice chairman of the Henan Song Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A county-level person in charge of the old foundation revealed that the management method of the old foundation is under the leadership of the president, with the secretary-general taking responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge told Southern Weekend reporters that Guo Jianxin is the secretary-general of the Old Foundation and is responsible for the overall work, while the deputy secretary-general Huang Yuejun is responsible for specific work. &quot;Huang Yuejun turned out to be from the Song Foundation. Basically, we follow the management style of Song Foundation, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to get this thing done.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, we found that most of the county-level directors of the old foundations had working experience in the Henan Song Foundation. After the Henan Song Foundation&#39;s savings-absorbing business ceased, Guo Jianxin and Huang Yuejun recruited these people. &quot;In the past, we were all familiar with the business at the Song Foundation. Huang Yuejun gave us advice and introduced us to the old foundation,&quot; the person in charge said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Huang Yuejun by phone. The other party said that he had left the Lao Foundation at the end of 2015 and was currently residing in a nursing home in Sichuan Province. He did not know much about the past and then hung up. Disconnect the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Cuiyun was originally a depositor of the Henan Song Foundation. After the Song Foundation ceased its deposit-taking business, she withdrew the original 100,000 yuan from the Song Foundation and transferred it to the old foundation. Then save another 50,000 yuan every year until 450,000 yuan. &quot;Generally (every year) I don&#39;t ask for the principal, I get the interest, but I add some money to make up 50,000 and deposit it again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Left-hand foundation, right-hand open Company&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that the Elderly Foundation is located in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and its purpose is to &quot;promote the development of social welfare, culture, sports, education and other undertakings for the elderly in Henan Province.&quot; Access to the foundation’s official website is currently closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters obtained a reply from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on the establishment and registration of the Henan Provincial Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (Yu Min Han [2013] No. 47). According to the &quot;Foundation&quot; According to the provisions of the Management Regulations, after review, the old foundation, which was donated a total of 4 million yuan as the original fund by Guo Jianxin, meets the conditions for establishing a public foundation. It is hereby approved to register and obtain the legal person status of the foundation in accordance with the law. Its business supervisory unit is Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly contacted the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to verify many issues regarding the old foundation, but no one answered the relevant calls. Inquired through &quot;12345&quot;, but still no reply after waiting for many days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many savers, they are willing to deposit money in the foundation. On the one hand, they trust the &quot;volunteers&quot;, and on the other hand, they see the business scope on the foundation&#39;s legal person registration certificate. On this certificate issued by the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the business scope reads &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law and carrying out elderly cultural activities such as loving and helping the elderly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;, being able to &quot;raise social funds in accordance with the law&quot; means that they can legitimately accept deposits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A search shows that many foundations do mention &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law&quot; in their business scope. For example, the business scope of the Henan Province Yellow River Cultural Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, rescuing cultural heritage, and establishing cultural undertakings”; the business scope of the Henan Province Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, subsidizing youth entrepreneurship and employment, and conducting research on youth entrepreneurship, etc. &quot;Related social charity activities&quot;; the business scope of the Henan Province Old District Construction Foundation is &quot;raising funds in accordance with the law and supporting poverty alleviation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Zeng Jie of Guangdong Guangqiang Law Firm told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an essential difference between raising funds and deposits. Deposits mean a commitment to guarantee principal and interest. “The foundation can absorb funds from the society within its business scope. However, returns cannot be promised, and projects that repay principal and interest are not allowed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that deposit business requires a formal banking license. The old foundation used consolation money instead of interest without approval, which is a disguised form of absorbing savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The business scope on the registration certificate makes depositors and volunteers think it is &quot;natural&quot; to save money here.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Jilin&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2021, the Linying County Court of Luohe City convicted the Henan Elderly Cultural Development Foundation of illegally absorbing public deposits, sentenced it to a fine of RMB 200,000, and ordered the elderly to Participants in the foundation&#39;s compensation fund-raising raised 29.71 million yuan, and Henan Herong Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) bears joint liability for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the relationship between Herong Group and the Lao Foundation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the secretary-general of the Lao Foundation, Guo Jianxin is also the chairman of Henan Herong Elderly Care Industry Group and was once the major shareholder of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that Herong Group was established in 2010 and is an enterprise mainly engaged in business services. On March 15, 2010, Guo Jianxin, as the major shareholder, participated in 90% of the shares for the first time. Another shareholder, Wang Shuling, is also a member of the board of directors of the Lao Foundation and holds 10% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To put it bluntly, Herong Group and the Lao Foundation are one and the same to the outside world, but in reality they are the same.&quot; A person close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that there are people under the Lao Foundation and Herong Group. Division of labor, top management is a group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The registered office address of Herong Group is also the same as that of the Old Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 5, 2013, the Lao Foundation and Herong Group officially signed a letter of authorization. The Lao Foundation will authorize Herong Group to invest in projects with the raised funds to ensure the maintenance and appreciation of the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investigation by Southern Weekend reporters found that in order to avoid supervision, most of the private funds absorbed by the old foundation went through personal accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in a criminal verdict, the financial personnel of the Provincial Veterans Foundation are Zhang Xiaodan and Wang Jie. Wang Jie is responsible for receiving funds (resigned in September 2015), and Zhang Xiaodan is responsible for disbursing funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张晓丹在证言中提到，省老基会在各县区的办事处办有银行卡，银行卡户名都是省部人员的名字，大部分资金都是通过建行转的，少部分是通过工行和邮储银行转的。县区各办事处打入会费后，王杰就把这些款转到合融集团的账户上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“王杰直接从基金会总部的POS机上刷一下，就转到合融集团给的账户上了。”张晓丹亲眼见过王杰这样转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张晓丹称，各办事处转过来的会费，基金会再转给合融集团，“每天都是这样”，有进款就转给该公司，都转到个人的银行卡上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从老基会可查的年报来看，2014年度至2016年度，捐赠收入分别为30万元、46万元、27万元，与之相对应的公益支出分别为25万元、22万元、36万元。但到2017年度，捐赠收入和公益支出均为0。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这意味着，老基会吸纳会员的巨额“会费”并未经过基金会的公共账号，而是以个人银行账号进行私下转移。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“假如打起官司，查老基会的对公账户，账上都没有我们的钱。老基会对公账户只是接受捐款。储户的钱就不能打上去，打上去就算是捐款。”一位老基会县级负责人对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;巨款流入房地产&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;从全省范围来看，老基会资金兑付困难集中在2021年下半年。但挤兑困难早有先兆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年，河南省的担保公司、投资公司大面积倒闭。 “他们一倒闭，老基会也受到了波及。”一位接近郭建新的知情人士告诉南方周末记者，老基会成立一年后，资金链就开始断裂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该人士透露，2015年8-9月，储户开始向老基会县级办事处大规模取钱，“不仅客户恐慌，老基会办事处的主任、义工也恐慌”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位县级办事处负责人回忆，2015年10月，合融集团负责人郭建新在一次与县级负责人的会议上谈到，公司出现了债务，资金暂时兑付不了，让大家回去等，各自先自保。 “我们回去没跟储户们说，想着过一阵就好了。”为了给储户还息，还找亲戚朋友帮忙，不惜借贷，甚至把房子卖了，给储户付息了100多万元。直到2021年撑不下去了，才向储户坦白，并停止付息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“没办法，为了鼓励储户继续存款。停止了（兑付）我们就得进去（监狱），不付息老百姓能愿意吗？”该办事处负责人说，当初凡是继续干下去的人都成穷光蛋了，欠了一屁股债。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月20日，合融集团发布了《关于不能按时兑付河南省老年文化事业基金会筹集资金情况的说明》，称其开会研究决定，自2023年2月底兑付资金的10%—15%，2024年2月底再兑付资金的20%—25%；2025年2月份兑付30%—35%，其余的在2025年底兑付完毕。不过，上述承诺一直未能兑现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱去哪了？这是萦绕在储户和“义工”们心中的谜团。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;易家栋是合融集团的法定代表人，其在一份刑事判决书中供述，“合融集团在焦作的孟州市和新乡的原阳县投资了两个房地产项目，在郑州港区投了一个老年公寓项目，在商丘市也投了一个房地产项目，老基会所筹集的社会资金都用到这些项目上了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，郑州港区项目即合融国际康养示范园（下称“康养园”）被认为是合融集团的标杆项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公开资料显示，康养园位于郑州市航空港区银港大道与如云路交叉口西南角。总用地面积41398.22㎡，总建筑面积76754.40㎡，设计床位2000张，主要建设有老年公寓楼6栋、综合服务楼1栋、老年研究中心楼1栋、老年医养中心楼1栋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯春来是老基会一名县级办事处负责人，2022年9月15日，被推选为康养园院长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他向南方周末记者透露，港区的养老项目定位高端，曾得到不少地方领导的关心，未来有很大想象空间。除了有建设补贴、床位补贴、护工补贴，地价和其他投资商相比也有优势，“郑州港区的地价听说要一亩地200多万，这里才几十万。那时候房价每年10%的增长，光这也不会赔”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，它的建设并不顺利。冯春来说，2016年康养园开建，但因为扬尘、噪音等环保问题，曾被上级主管部门要求停工。直到2019年12月18日，一期才顺利开园。据央广网河南分网报道，卢大伟、郭建新还分别在开园仪式上发表致辞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯春来透露，郑州港区的养老项目9栋楼的主体工程2018年就完成了，但因为资金紧张，一直没有装修。 2019年初，老基会下属的8个县级办事处成立了项目推进小组，继续向社会吸收存款，并贷款装修了5号楼和4号楼，剩余的7栋楼因为资金问题尚未装修。 “我们不装修楼，这里早就垮了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，5号综合楼已入住约80位老人。但截至目前，康养园尚未验收，且并未取得营业执照。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位知情人士向南方周末记者证实，2022年下半年，郭建新及几位公司管理层因涉其他案件被公安机关批捕。随后，老基会和合融集团办公地点就从郑东新区商都路8号搬迁至康养园。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在老基会和合融集团几乎没人办公，有事情来，没事情不来，基本各回各家。”一位老基会内部人士称，康养园内5号综合楼2层本来是老总们的办公场所，现在人影难寻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月30日，南方周末记者以投资者身份联系合融集团的一名对外关系负责人，他说目前康养园还有2亿多元的债务，其中拖欠的施工队工程款不到1亿元，另外1亿多元为疫情前收取的部分老年客户的资金，需要退款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯春来介绍，目前康养园有30名员工，一个月开支二三十万元，最大开支就是水电费。虽然每月能从每位老人那里收取3700元费用，“但基本上不太够，想尽一切办法拖着、欠着”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个养老公寓能赚钱把老基会储户们的本金补上吗？他们想不了那么远，眼下，这里的运营也只是靠住在养老公寓里老人们的钱勉强度日。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，文中张世和、张凤兰、卢志强、郭凤花、刘翠云为化名。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;不过，这一痼疾浸润已久、既广且深，恐怕不是一个表态所能根治的。 2021年9月1日起施行的《未成年人学校保护规定》第八条：学校不得设置侵犯学生人身自由的管理措施，不得对学生在课间及其他非教学时间的正当交流、游戏、出教室活动等言行自由设置不必要的约束。针对的就是“消失的课间十分钟”。问题在于，徒法难以自行，没有哪家学校认为自己限制学生课间出教室、出教学楼、去操场是“不必要的”。所以，问题仍有待解决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北青网近日报道，一位家长说：课间孩子若要出教室，基本只能上个厕所、接个水，途中不能大声说话、跑跑跳跳；部分“宽松”的学校，会允许孩子在走廊里走动，不能上下楼或去操场；严重些的情形，是孩子只能待在自己所在的小组过道里，不能越界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一家媒体今年7月报道，在北京，小学普遍严格限制学生课间活动的范围和强度，记者随机走访中心城区的27所学校，至少有超过20所学校对学生课间活动做出限制。此外，在河南郑州、河北保定等地，也有学校采取类似规定，包括不准出教学楼、不准出教室、不准在教室内外高声说话和嬉戏打闹等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在70、80后小时候，课间十分钟可以出去多人跳绳、踢毽子、跳房子、自由嬉戏甚至互相追逐，尽情释放天性；在户外，在操场，静也好，动也好，总相宜，头顶蓝天，脚立大地，让阳光打在脸上，让微风拂面，与自然亲密无间，一下子令身心得到回血与治愈，也涵养质朴刚健有韧性的品性与价值观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而现在，一边连课间十分钟都限制甚至禁止孩子出教室、出教学楼、去操场，一边还天真地追问：我们的孩子为什么精神上这么脆弱，我们的男孩为什么普遍缺乏阳刚之气？这不是搞笑吗？连追逐嬉戏打闹都不容许，身体与精神怎么变得强健？阳刚之气从何而来？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种扭曲的理念和实践是怎么形成的？ 2021年6月1日，教育部体育卫生与艺术教育司司长回应央视说：“怕学生一旦动起来就容易受伤，现在所有学校都把安全放在第一位……这个也可以说是因噎废食。”如此看，对“绝对安全”的追捧及其发生机制值得辨析与反思。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，某些学生家长是有问题，认为自己的孩子在学校期间发生任何人身伤害，学校都应该负责。这是对学校施加了无限责任。别说学校做不到，家长自己也做不到。理论上，这个世界上不可能有比家长更关切自己孩子的安全了，但在家长看护之下，孩子发生伤害甚至死亡的事件层出不穷。没有人乐见这样的事情发生，但这个世界本身就存在各种已知未知的风险，不能对学校提出反人性的要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更进一步，识别风险，防范风险，应对风险，与风险共存共生，本来就是每个人生活不可分割的一部分，也是每一个孩子成长所必须习得的基础教育。很小的孩子不知风险为何物，当然要令其远离风险、尽量隔绝风险，但孩子在不断成长，需要在成长中习得识别、防范与应对风险的技能，这是最为重要的生存技能教育，在某种程度上比知识教育重要得多。而如此多的学校，居然屈从某些学生家长的想法，努力把学校打造成一个隔绝任何风险的绝对安全空间，为此不惜压制孩子爱自由、爱玩耍的天性，这本身是反教育的，也是徒劳的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，奇葩的学生家长总会存在，孩子在学校发生了意外，明明不是学校的责任，也要从财务上讹诈学校。但这还不是问题的关键，关键在于，学校、教育主管部门及公检法如何应对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果这三方都能做到按照事情的是非曲直与法理处理，不是学校的责任学校不扛，也不让学校扛，不抱着息事宁人的心态、不按闹分配、不和稀泥，对于胡缠乱搅的，坚决打回去。这样就能正气高涨，树立正派的价值观与正确的激励，学校还需要大搞特搞反教育、反人性的“绝对安全”吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;明明不是学校的责任，在家长的无理闹腾之下，学校自行或在上级部门的催逼之下委屈地赔了钱。这对某些心术不正或喜欢推卸责任的家长来说，是一个不好的激励。而学校与教育主管部门为了避免再次出血，顺理成章的做法就是限制孩子的活动自由，把孩子束缚在尽可能小的活动空间，无穷逼近隔绝一切风险的“绝对安全”，这才是问题的根子所在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某种程度上，这是一个社会问题，也是一个观念问题：会哭的孩子有奶喝，谁的声音大，谁更能闹腾，谁就能获得更大的利益，这种现象在舆论上与各行各业仍普遍存在。 “我弱我有理”“我闹我有理”“我声音大我有理”成了潜规则。扮弱者、卖惨，以弱凌强，造成了另一个丛林，被关在教室里的孩子，不过是这一丛林法则的另一群受害者而已。 &lt;/p>;

This is also the time for reporters who are working non-stop and running around all year round to stop and reflect. , an important moment for self-examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s world is full of chaos, the century-old changes are accelerating, the media field is deeply integrated and reconstructed, instability and uncertainty factors are significantly increasing, internal and external factors are stirring in the hearts of journalists... At this moment, Journalists&#39; Day, Perhaps each of us journalists should ask themselves the question: Do you still have journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a journalist, the news ideal is the &quot;beacon light&quot; that guides the direction; the news ideal is the &quot;engine&quot; that drives forward; the news ideal is the &quot;ballast&quot; &quot;Stone&quot; has the function of calming the mind; news ideal is the &quot;regulator&quot; and has the function of prompting and warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, today, the traditional journalism industry is facing an unprecedented industry shock: the circulation of newspapers and periodicals and radio and television ratings have declined, and the influence of the media has declined; the media industry has operating difficulties, and the income of news practitioners has decreased. ; The number of people leaving their jobs has increased, and people quitting the industry have been heard from time to time; the number of enrollment in journalism and communication majors in colleges and universities has been reduced, and the employment situation of graduates has become tighter... There is no shortage of comments on the Internet about candidates who plan to apply for the journalism and communication major. Although it is not without bias, This is by no means groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the founding words of &quot;Xiangjiang Review&quot;, Mao Zedong enthusiastically asked: &quot;What is the biggest problem in the world? The biggest problem is the problem of food.&quot; When the traditional journalism industry is climbing up and over the hurdles, a group of people who are confused and emotionally anxious have emerged. Psychological Inevitability – Will Traditional Journalism Die? Is there a future for journalism? Do we still need journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as we carefully study the history, reality and future development trends of journalism, we will find that traditional journalism will not disappear. Journalism still has its own future, and we still need journalistic ideals. This is because: From the perspective of the origin of journalism, news originates from people’s curiosity. As long as people’s curiosity does not die, journalism will not disappear. From the perspective of the evolution of journalism, although the carrier of news is constantly changing, the functional role of journalism has not disappeared. However, compared with the traditional ways of reading newspapers, listening to radio, and watching TV in the past, people now obtain news in a different way. It’s just a new carrier such as a mobile phone. From the perspective of audience needs, news focuses on meeting people&#39;s communication needs. As long as people&#39;s communication needs exist, the demand for journalism will always exist. From the perspective of journalism production, the authoritative news, in-depth reports, news reviews, elegant programs and other products provided by traditional media cannot be replaced by the vast number of new media and self-media. Therefore, traditional journalism is unlikely to disappear in any of the above senses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is impossible for traditional journalism to disappear, it is impossible for journalists to disappear. The ideal of journalism will inevitably accompany and advance together with journalists. Otherwise, we will lose our way and lose our way. Without motivation, lack of soul, and chaos, you will be at a loss, useless, muddle along, and do nothing. Therefore, in such a special context of the times, each of us journalists must still have journalistic ideals in mind, promote journalistic ideals, adhere to journalistic ideals, and practice journalistic ideals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always have a loyal heart. Loyalty means that as a journalist, don’t ask what the country has done for me, but ask what I have done for the country; loyalty means not being confused in the face of major events, not wavering at critical moments, and being able to withstand various complex situations and problems. The test; loyalty means being indifferent to fame and wealth, willing to work as a coolie, working hard, sweating, and traveling thousands of miles for the cause of journalism, and striving to become an excellent journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always maintain a keen sense. Sensitivity is an essential quality for professional journalists. Only journalists who are sharp-minded, have unique vision, are good at seeing the subtleties, respond quickly, and have a sharp eye can effectively improve the dissemination, guidance, influence and credibility of news and public opinion work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must always practice seeking truth. The world-famous journalist Farage once said: &quot;The duty of a reporter is to reveal the truth.&quot; In an era of widespread media communication, despite the excess of news information, real news is always valuable. We should always maintain the spirit of truth-seeking, practice truth-seeking skills, and provide the public with truth, true knowledge, true feelings, and truth in a timely and rapid manner in the turbulent world of massive information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always hold the ruler of justice. Some people say: &quot;The reporter&#39;s pen contains countless fortunes, reputation and reputation, loyalty and villainy, right and wrong, and life and death.&quot; This shows how heavy the journalist&#39;s pen is. Therefore, we reporters should be very clear about why we write, what we write, how we write, and to what extent we write. We must always grasp the yardstick of &quot;fairness&quot; and must not be influenced by some kind of power, money, or interest relationship. Those pens soaked in grease and booze can&#39;t possibly do them justice. This is why we need to always be in awe of &quot;justice&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the occasion of Journalists’ Day, I wish every journalist’s journalistic ideals to be evergreen and never wither! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者系河北媒体人）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末App“hi，南周”栏目期待您的来稿。投稿邮箱：nfzmreaders@163.com）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[森林消防“全覆盖”31个省份]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260136]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;(On the morning of November 7, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a press conference to introduce Progress in the reform of the fire rescue system.

Li Shangyu, head of the Education and Training Department of the Ministry of Emergency Management, said that there was a plan to recruit 15,000 people in 2023, but nearly 110,000 people signed up, marking the fourth consecutive full recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shangyu introduced that the average age of new firefighters is 21.8 years old, and 52.6% have a college degree or above. They are currently undergoing a one-year induction training. So far, the total number of firefighters recruited after the transformation has reached more than 94,000, accounting for 65.3% of the total number of existing firefighters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Forest firefighting adds more than 8,200 people&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;National firefighting After the rescue bureau was officially established, a new mobile team was formed. Xu Zhongshun, deputy director of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau, said that this is &quot;a major decision made based on the basic national conditions of my country&#39;s frequent natural disasters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xu Zhongshun said that as a critical force in national emergencies and major disasters, the mobile team is mainly responsible for forest and grassland firefighting duties, supplemented by flood fighting and earthquake and geological disaster rescue. Responsibilities, task arrangements focus on fire fighting in winter and spring, flood control in summer and autumn, year-round disaster relief, seasonal cross-regional garrison, and implementation of preparatory operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The National Fire and Rescue Administration has integrated the forest fire corps and related fire and rescue mobile detachments, forming 10 cross-regional fire and rescue mobile corps and several detachments, brigades, and squadrons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the original establishment of forest firefighting teams is 25,000, mainly deployed in 10 provinces including Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Sichuan. On this basis, the Central Organization Office has approved the establishment of more than 8,200 forest firefighting teams, mainly to strengthen the first-line firefighting and rescue mobile forces in key forest areas, national parks, seven major river basins and surrounding areas across the country, and to achieve comprehensive coverage of 31 provinces. &quot;Full coverage&quot; of all administrative regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xu Zhongshun said that as of now, 17 provinces in the first batch of additional mobile teams have basically completed their deployment, and are now organizing the second batch of additional mobile teams. There are teams stationed in 3 provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;All disasters, major emergencies&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Firefighting After the rescue team was reformed and transformed, its functions have also been expanded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiong Se introduced that on the basis of the original fire fighting and emergency rescue focusing on rescuing people&#39;s lives, the National Fire and Rescue Bureau focuses on &quot;all disaster types&quot;.

The employees or students of the institute are those who come to the institute for further study from other places and have returned to work in their original units.

The houses with blue roofs in the distance are in Myanmar.

Having lived in Wanding for more than 20 years, she told the Southern Weekend reporter that there had been wars on the opposite side before, with mostly gunshots, but the fighting in 2023 was the most fierce, all with heavy shelling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xia climbed to the roof of her house, where she could see Myanmar across the river. In a 39-second video she shot, the sound of gunfire and artillery continued from the valley, and helicopters circled the top of the mountain. At the foot of the mountain were dense houses, stretching from Myanmar to the eastern town of Ruili City, Yunnan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, 2023, government army strongholds in many places in northern Myanmar were attacked by armed forces and exchanges of fire broke out. The fighting was fierce and the stalemate has continued to this day. On the national border, Wanding Town, which borders Bangsai Town in Myanmar, is a Chinese town that has been greatly affected by the war. Stray bullets have fallen into this town of about 10,000 people many times. In order to ensure the safety of residents, the local government arranged for school closures and mobilized residents to leave the town to avoid the war. The town implemented a &quot;only exit, no entry&quot; control policy, and even the town government staff evacuated to work in safe places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wanding Town is located on the border of China and Myanmar.

Drawing by Liang Shuyi&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Don’t come out of your home”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 28, a shell from Myanmar hit a residential building in Wanding Town, destroying the top four floors. A big hole was blown out of the building. A few hours after the explosion, Mr. Yang, who sells aluminum doors and windows, rushed to the scene out of curiosity. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the shell had exploded and there were no casualties. “An old lady told me that when the shell exploded, It was so shaken that she couldn&#39;t hear anything for two hours.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Peng Qi first heard the sound of shells and gunshots, she didn&#39;t know what they were. She thought someone was setting off fireworks. In June 2023, she was transferred from Ruili City to Wanding Town and worked as a store manager in a chain milk tea shop. The locals told her that it was the sound of war in Myanmar and comforted her: &quot;It&#39;s okay, we hear this sound every year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locals who are used to the sound of gunfire seem to be also attracted by it. This time the battle was frightening. At two or three o&#39;clock in the morning on October 29, Wu Xia was awakened by several gunshots while she was sleeping. That day, she listened to the sound of gunfire outside and judged that the exchange of fire between the two parties was fierce. The windows of a house about 200 meters away from her home were shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wuxia Snack Shop sells some local specialty snacks, such as Pauluda, fried bait cubes, etc. It is only about 200 meters away from Wanding Port. Children in the third grade of primary school are afraid that artillery shells will penetrate the iron sheet and will go home when they hear the sound of artillery fire. Wu Xia believes that hiding at home is not necessarily safe. &quot;If there are really shells coming, you can&#39;t hide anywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan, who lives by the boundary river, seems to be at greater risk. She once saw a picture of a helicopter bombing on the other side of the river on a short video platform. The community administrator also kept telling her not to come out of the house. However, She works at Wanding Town Health Center and still needs to report to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that on October 31, she was at work when she was suddenly informed that a large crater had been blown up near her home, and her son, who was in primary school, was staying at home alone. &quot;It was really urgent at the time. I called my husband and ran home. When I got home and opened the door, I saw that my son was taking a nap.&quot; Tao Wan looked at her son sleeping soundly and felt, &quot;My heart is going to be broken.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan told Southern Weekend reporters that when she was a child, the sound of fighting on the other side of the river could be heard in Wanding Town. The most intense year.&quot; The scene of community workers and street broadcasts telling residents to retreat and avoid the fighting made Tao Wan feel panic like never before, &quot;I felt like I had to leave this home.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that on October 27, the night when the war broke out, community members came to persuade them to leave: “If you have family and friends in Ruili, go to Ruili. &quot;Not only that, the community also informed that if you hear the sound of gunfire, please do not go out, and immediately find shelter to take shelter. Do not wait and see out of curiosity, and avoid exposing your body in open spaces to avoid being hit by stray bullets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, an on-duty staff member of the Wanding Town Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the staff in the government building had moved to a relatively safe place to work, leaving only a few on-duty staff, and the new place was still open. Within the Wanding area, it is five or six kilometers away from the town government building. The reason why they moved out of the town government building was because the building was &quot;directly opposite Myanmar and posed a major safety hazard.&quot; The person on duty said he was unclear about how many people were transferred in Wanding Town and when students would resume classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The fourth floor of a residential building in the town was hit by a shell, but fortunately there were no casualties.

In addition to the fierce gunfire, there were also Students are completely suspended from classes. The milk tea shop where Peng Qi works is only a few hundred meters away from Wanding Middle School. She discovered that on the evening of Friday, October 27, all the high school students who were originally on holiday on Sunday were taken home by their parents. Wu Xia&#39;s snack bar is not far from the middle school. She saw many parents driving to the school gate to pick up their students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Lili, a 21-year-old girl who grew up in Wanding, recalled that there was an emergency in the local area a few years ago when classes were suspended due to the war in Myanmar, but she could not remember the time clearly. She only remembered that it was the same time at that time. There are stray bullets flying into the territory. &quot;The most serious thing in recent years is the two incidents of stray bullets flying over. The situation in Myanmar has always been unstable. Once war starts, Wanding&#39;s geographical location is destined to be affected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cai In Lily&#39;s impression, there is only a boundary river two or three meters wide, and there are frequent exchanges between Wanding and the Myanmar town of Bangsai on the other side. She recalled that when she was five or six years old, it was easy to travel to Myanmar from the border crossing. When she was in primary school, seven or eight of the more than 40 students in her class were from Myanmar. &quot;We all studied Chinese courses and we all played together.&quot; The boundary river is also one of her recreational areas. She often goes fishing and picnicking by the river with her family and friends. A walking trail is built close to the boundary river, and Wanding residents often go for walks by the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that some Wanding residents were indeed accidentally injured, mostly with skin injuries. &quot;After we debridement, we will ask them to go home quickly, because the hospital is located on a relatively high ground and is not safe. Some people were also transferred to higher-level hospitals by ambulances.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xia discovered that since the beginning of the Northern Myanmar War Later, there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, especially tourists. As a famous border town and border port, there are endless tourists here all year round. Her snack bar is not far from the national gate and has about a hundred customers every day. But after the war broke out, only a few old customers who lived nearby came to the store, and &quot;there was no one on this street.&quot; Not only that, on October 30, the &quot;only go out, no go in&quot; rule was implemented in the central area of ​​Wanding Town. However, according to locals, the rule was only implemented for two days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Qi also obviously felt that the flow of people had dropped sharply. In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter at 16:00 on November 2, Peng Qi said that the store&#39;s turnover that day was only more than 100 yuan, which is the price of about 10 cups of milk tea, and most of the customers were from nearby shops. Before the war, the store&#39;s daily turnover was about one thousand yuan. There are also brave tourists who go to the border to shoot short videos. Wu Xia said: &quot;Many men and women may also be afraid. They basically just take pictures and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the men and women Wu Xia saw, Perhaps there is also Zhou Feng, a melon seller. On November 2, 37-year-old Zhou Feng also visited the national gate of Wanding, but his destination was the Wanding Watermelon Wholesale Market. As the largest watermelon market in Southeast Asia, from the end of October to May of the following year is the time when Myanmar watermelons are on the market and exported to China. Zhou Feng revealed that during peak periods, the market could have 1,000 vehicles a day, each carrying 16 tons of watermelons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of October 2023, the price of Myanmar watermelon that has just been launched can reach four or five yuan per kilogram, which is not low. After the war broke out, Wanding&#39;s national gate was closed and watermelon could not enter the territory. Zhou Feng analyzed that the most affected people in the watermelon industry chain are melon farmers. The price of contracted land in Myanmar is relatively low, only three to four hundred yuan per mu, so most of the people who plant watermelons on contracted land in Myanmar are Chinese. Zhou Feng has been engaged in this industry for 13 years. He is grateful that it is the early stage of the watermelon market. &quot;If it takes more than a month to start the war, I will be annoyed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In previous years, at the Wanding Watermelon Wholesale Market, melon stalls were filled with watermelons imported from Myanmar.

Guo Yu runs a B&amp;B. Since the war started, there have been no guests staying. Fortunately, the shells did not fall near them, and the family&#39;s food, clothing, housing and transportation were not affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Yu’s mother is from Myanmar, and his father’s ancestral home is in Baoshan City, Yunnan Province. When they were young, they came to Wanding to buy land and build a house, and settled here. Guo Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that his grandmother&#39;s house was not affected by the war and was relatively safe for the time being. Guo Yu also feels safe and has no plans to move away. However, if the shells hit nearby, the family may move to Ruili, 20 kilometers away, and stay with relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan was not prepared to evacuate, but sent her youngest son back to her husband&#39;s hometown in Dehong Prefecture overnight. &quot;We all buy a house and a car on our own. This is my home. If I leave, it won&#39;t even have its roots.&quot; Since October 27, Tao Wan has felt uneasy every day. She is afraid that if an accident occurs, the house will be lost. . &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do in that situation. When I think of this possibility, I almost burst into tears.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan came to Wanding Town with her mother when she was 5 years old. Now she has Is 40 years old. Because she had to take care of her mother who didn&#39;t want to leave Wanding, Tao Wan, who went to college abroad, came back here again, until now. After the war broke out, Tao Wan placed her mother in a village far away from the border. She planned to wait until the war calmed down before taking the old man home. Tao Wan said that there are some elderly people in the town who have inconvenient legs and feet who are unwilling to move. They have deep feelings for Wanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Dai language, Wanding means &quot;the place where the sun is at the top&quot;. Today, the town&#39;s shine is no longer dazzling. In Tao Wan&#39;s impression, Wanding was prosperous 20 to 30 years ago. Later, due to road planning, administrative divisions and other reasons, Wanding was slowly declining. Tao Wan felt aggrieved for the small town where she lived, &quot;There was an epidemic in the past three years, and now there is this war.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Lili never felt that she was a girl who came out of a small town. She felt that Wanding was more like a small city. She remembers that Wanding Town was very lively around 2007, with people coming and going, and the shops on the street would sell Myanmar specialties, such as hot and sour noodles, milk candies, etc. Now, some of the shops that impressed Cai Lili have been closed, and many shops on the street are empty. &quot;After its decline in recent years, I gradually felt that it was really just a small town.&quot; Cai Lili said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, this town is facing another test. On November 6, Peng Qi told Southern Weekend reporters that compared with the chaotic sound of gunfire in the past few days, the streets in Wanding are now &quot;eerily quiet&quot;. Except for the occasional pedestrian passing by, only military green trucks are left on the street. patrol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Wan has not heard the sound of gunfire recently, but she feels that the government departments and schools have shown no signs of relaxing. The school has not notified the resumption of classes, teaching is conducted in the form of online classes, and the community still counts every day and has not evacuated. resident information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, the characters in the article are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从“局外人”到“第一个人”：加缪110周年诞辰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260148]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 22:45:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/07/X8roS3vaHvLlXA5wUixtuv0kj5ZOHMRmVSmK7F8E.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1241&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/X8roS3vaHvLlXA5wUixtuv0kj5ZOHMRm VSmK7F8E. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257306&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Albert Camus (November 7, 1913 - 1960 January 4), French writer and philosopher, born in Algeria. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature at the age of 44 and died unexpectedly at the age of 47. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 7, 1913, Albert Camus was born. On January 4, 1960, he died in an accidental car accident at the age of 46. Today, it has been 110 years since Camus was born and more than sixty years since his death, but people do not feel that Camus belongs to a distant era. He used his short writing career to create a series of distinctive contemporary images. , is still closely related to our living situation today. The embarrassment, discord, and sense of powerlessness of &quot;outsiders&quot;, the repeated hard labor in &quot;Sisyphus&quot;, and the struggle and dignity of people facing disaster in &quot;The Plague&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus is both a writer and a thinker. He does not capture readers with the splendor of his words, but shocks them with his postmodern understanding of life. He is the youngest winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. one. Camus&#39;s enduring popularity is symptomatic. Just like Kafka, he wrote a &quot;clinical diagnosis&quot; of contemporary people&#39;s mental dilemma; just like Lu Xun, he does not provide bright answers, or even It&#39;s a bit dark and cold, but at the end of the coldness is a philosophy of resistance and hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus once worked as a journalist. On January 1, 1940, he wrote an editorial for the last issue of the &quot;Republican Evening News&quot;. You can get a glimpse of his restraint, coolness, and calmness with a sense of power. Words: &quot;This year, hoping for happiness will be in vain, building it through work is the key. Don&#39;t hope for anything, but do something. Don&#39;t wait for others to build your destiny from beginning to end, especially when destiny It is still in our hands. The Evening Republican will not wish you happiness this year, knowing that you are going through a severe physical and mental trauma. But it will ask you to maintain the necessary strength and sobriety to strive to maintain your own tranquility and dignity. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was the darkest moment of World War II. Shortly after Camus wrote this dedication, while fleeing on the border of France and Spain, Benjamin failed to get a pass and came to the end of his life. At the end, although Zweig fled to Brazil, he still committed suicide in despair. Camus belongs to a new generation of young people. He once joined the French Communist Party, fought and resisted, and condensed the power of his resistance into continuous writing. If the deaths of Benjamin and Zweig marked the spiritual boundaries of yesterday&#39;s world, Camus established the starting point of his writing on the wasteland of war and post-war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The postwar world is neither a wasteland nor a new heaven and a new earth. His arguments with his friend Sartre and his ambivalent attitude toward the Algerian War made Camus increasingly lonely while receiving literary honors. When he returned to autobiographical writing and the &quot;first person&quot;, an accident caused this sharp soul to bid farewell in advance. For a writer like Camus, commemorating him at any time is both our condolences and an invitation for him to return. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;France’s “outsider”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 2 a.m. on November 7, 1913, her mother Catalina gave birth to Camus, who was the first child in the family. second son. The next day, at the Mondovi Municipal Government in Algeria, the father registered the birth of his child. He was 28 years old and worked as a wine cellar manager. The mother was 31 years old and filled in the occupation column as a housewife. The birthplace of Saint-Paul Farm is located 8 kilometers south of the city of Mondovi. The nearby city of Bonny is the most important port in French Algeria, not far from the Tunisian border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Algeria became a French colony in the 19th century, most of the immigrants who immigrated here were poor people from all over France, as well as Spain, Italy and other European countries. New immigrants were granted residence rights under French protection and lived among the overwhelming majority of locals. “The French in Algeria are of mixed race. Spaniards, Alsatians, Italians, Maltese, Jews, Greeks gather there,” Camus later wrote. Camus is a mixed-race child, his mother is Spanish, and he believes that his father comes from Alsace, the battlefield where France and Germany have fought for generations. The reason for &quot;thinking&quot; is that my father&#39;s exact ancestral home has been lost and difficult to find. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus had never met his father before he could remember. My father is 1.8 meters tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. He works in a wine company, supervising the grape pressing, winemaking, storage, and shipment to the Port of Pawnee for shipment. Not long after Camus was born, World War I broke out, and his father was conscripted into the French army. Almost as soon as he entered the battlefield, he was injured in the Battle of the Marne to prevent the German army from advancing towards Paris. He was hit by shell fragments and was sent to a rear hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 11, 1914, my mother received the bad news by telegram, as well as a small piece of shrapnel removed from her husband&#39;s head that the widow had asked to keep. His father was mysterious to Camus. He often asked his mother: &quot;Am I really like my father?&quot; &quot;Oh, you look exactly like your father.&quot; During the four years of World War I, his mother received no After passing a penny in France, it was only a few months before the end of the war that I received official notification of her husband&#39;s death and a pension check. An accountant next door helped her fill out the pension application form because no one in her family knew how to fill it out. In order to make a living, my mother sorted warheads in an ammunition manufacturing factory until she suffered from rheumatism and was unable to continue this work, so she began to work as a domestic helper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 8 months to 17 years old, Camus lived with his mother and grandmother under the same roof in Algiers, the capital of Algeria. It was Belku, the workers&#39; district of the city, home to people who worked hard in small workshops and port equipment factories, craftsmen, small traders, grassroots civil servants and clerks. As an adult, Camus returned to the house frequently, sometimes to visit the elderly and sometimes as a temporary haven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was in middle school, football fascinated Camus. He was very brave and liked to tackle from the feet of his opponents, so he was often injured. Camus described a fierce football match, on a pitch adjacent to a cemetery, in which the opposing players pressed forward mercilessly. They “were all on top of me, spikes on my shins, knees on my crotch, squeezing me against the goal post…” “I quickly learned that the ball doesn’t come from where you expect it to. This was very helpful in my life, especially in France, where not everyone is honest,&quot; Camus later wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Camus came to settle in Paris in early 1940, he felt that &quot;I am not from here, nor from anywhere else. The world is just a strange scenery, and my spirit is helpless here. Everything It has nothing to do with yourself.&quot; He was stuck between France and Algeria, between Paris and impoverished Bercoux across the Mediterranean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/D85zsS7RbQjcftzjyXxFffCFWWU1bBZahgssH1sC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;969&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/D85zsS7RbQjcftzjyXxFffCFWWU1bBZahgssH1sC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257305&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Camus (first from right) is backstage with two actors during the performance of his drama &quot;Martial Law&quot; in Paris in 1948. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Sisyphus&quot;: The victorious loser&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;While Sartre, who came from a middle-class background, was dreaming of a literary hero, and Beauvoir was enjoying her books and the gifts in the candy shop window, Camus was in a home without electricity, running water, newspapers and books, and no Growing up in the world of radio, he once wrote in his diary: &quot;Living in poverty for a few years is enough to create all the sensitivity.&quot; Tuberculosis plagued Camus throughout his life, but it also exempted him from military service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1942, &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; were published one after another. The former tells the story of a French-Algerian named Meursault who experienced two deaths. The first was his mother&#39;s death. He couldn&#39;t even remember the date and didn&#39;t shed tears. The second was when he had an affair with a holdover on the beach. There was a conflict with the Arab about the knife. Meursault happened to be holding a friend&#39;s gun. When his eyes were dazzled by the reflection of the sea and the blade, he almost subconsciously shot the man. After being arrested, Meursault told the judge in confusion that the reason he shot was the sun. Meursault did not defend himself, and the court also lacked interest in the murder case and focused on investigating his personal life. Indifference became the biggest evidence of crime and was sentenced to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of the essay collection &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; is taken from a story in &quot;Homer&#39;s Epic&quot;. King Sisyphus disobeyed God and was sentenced to push a huge boulder up a mountain for eternity, each time the boulder approached the top of the mountain. When the time comes, it will slip from his hand and roll down again, and he can only go back again, starting over and over again. Camus used the myth of Sisyphus, just like Freud through the Oedipus complex, to make the mythical figure deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts again. The most famous sentence in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; may be: &quot;There is only one philosophical question that is truly serious, and that is suicide. To judge whether life is worth living or not...&quot; Camus said in the preface of an English translation many years later , wrote this book because &quot;even within the borders of nihilism, it is possible to find ways to move beyond nihilism.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play Caligula, published in 1944, discusses freedom and meaninglessness pushed to the extreme by recreating the story of the assassinated Roman Emperor Suetonius. These three books are collectively called Camus&#39; &quot;Trilogy of the Absurd.&quot; They were written and published in the critical state of war and occupied Paris, where everything was compromised and everything was lost. From Kierkegaard&#39;s existential philosophy, Camus saw Abraham, who sacrificed his son, as &quot;infinitely He gave up everything, and then took it all back with the help of absurd power.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus took the initiative to get to know him during the rehearsal of Sartre&#39;s play &quot;The Fly&quot;, and the two hit it off. Previously, Sartre had written an article for Camus&#39;s novel &quot;The Stranger&quot;, and Camus had commented on it. The special &quot;Disgusting&quot;. Beauvoir and Sartre found that Camus was a simple, happy man who was always funny and vulgar in his conversations, very emotional, and would even sit on a snowy street at two in the morning and talk about his love troubles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don Juan went from one woman to another not because of a lack of love, but because he loved them with equal passion and devoted himself to them every time. He must repeat this talent and harmony. Explore... Why do you have to love less to love well?&quot; &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; reads. Camus had two marriages. His first wife, Simone, was unable to quit morphine, which caused him great psychological trauma. After remarrying Francine, Camus maintained semi-public intimate relationships with many women. , including theater actress Maria Casares, who exchanged more than 800 love letters. It is as if Don Juan became an incarnation of Sisyphus pushing the boulder. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Plague&quot;: End and Resistance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the end of World War II and the liberation of Paris, the reputations of Sartre, Beauvoir and Camus were at their peak, and the Left Bank The Flower Goddess and the Double Sole Cafe in Shanghai have shrouded the halo of existentialist writers, and the radius of the halo extends to the United States on the other side of the ocean. All three of them received invitations to visit from New York. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From March to May 1946, Camus traveled around the United States. He was more nervous than Sartre and felt that he was always affected by endless little troubles. He&#39;s also a careful observer, noting that Americans drink juice in the morning, drink scotch and soda across the country, and are passionate about animals, from gorillas at the Bronx Zoo to taxidermy at the Museum of Natural History. , death and the dead can be dressed up as quickly as possible, &quot;die and leave the rest to us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only place that made Camus feel familiar and at ease was the Bowery Street in New York. At that time, it was still an abandoned area, full of cheap bars and run-down hotels, with the elevated railway running from the height of the second floor. Passing by, shadows covered everything below. Camus was disgusted by the United States and felt that there was a lack of pain and tragedy, but in the eyes of many critics, &quot;The Stranger&quot; is a parody of American noir novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, the novel &quot;The Plague&quot; was published and was so popular among readers that it was reprinted eight times in two years. After that, &quot;The Plague&quot; and &quot;The Stranger&quot; were at the top of the French literary bestseller list for a long time. From 1941 to 1942, the plague was prevalent in Algeria, which was the starting point for Camus to prepare &quot;The Plague&quot;. The reason why this novel is so thrilling is because the plague is described as both real and terrifying, and it is also symbolic. It alludes to World War II. During this period, the harsh reality of the Nazis in Germany was wreaking havoc. Nazism and fascism are also a political and spiritual plague. Its military power, spy system, autocracy and racism sweep across everything like the god of death. After being manipulated by it, they either succumb to it, cooperate with it, or know that it is impossible. Those who resist for the land are like all living beings in the plague. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Camus highlighted three symbolic situations of life. One is the situation of separation, including the separation of relatives, separation of husband and wife, and separation of lovers, which means isolation, blockade, imprisonment, and exile. , concentration camp... The second is that there is no condition of any woman in the novel, which means imbalance, deformity, bitterness, and lifelessness... The most terrifying atmosphere and situation is death...&quot; Liu Mingjiu, the translator of the Chinese version of &quot;The Plague&quot; Said, &quot;&#39;The plague is lurking in everyone, because no one, yes, no one in the world is immune to it&#39;... In this way, Camus also put his philosophy about the absurd world in &quot;The Plague&quot; It greatly broadens and deepens the story, and points the absurd roots to human faults and human society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the desperate situation of World War II, Camus was not the only one who chose to write about a critical state through the background of the plague. , the German playwright Brecht also created &quot;The Life of Galileo&quot;, in which Galileo also experienced a narrow escape from the plague. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I tried to use the plague to express the suffocation we suffer and the environment we endure that threatens and drives people into exile.” Camus said. In the apocalyptic city of Ahlan, the protagonist of the novel, Dr. Bernard Rieux, became an ordinary hero because of his dedication to his duties. Camus reshapes heroes in the form of anti-heroes. When disaster strikes, what we can expect is not a hero falling from the sky, but every ordinary person resisting evil through the smallest efforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Resistor, a collection of essays published in 1951, is where Camus clearly proposed the philosophy of resistance after the philosophy of the absurd, &quot;What is a rebel? A person who says &#39;no&#39;. However, although he He refuses but does not give up: he is also the person who says &#39;yes&#39; from the very beginning.&quot; However, this book with a huge amount of information put him in a situation where he was surrounded by others. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Back to &quot;First Man&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Rebel&quot; involves a commentary on Surrealism and was immediately criticized literary by the group. Refute. More intense criticism came from leftist thinkers. Because he disagreed with Camus&#39;s many views on the revolution and Soviet history, the magazine &quot;Modern&quot; edited by Sartre published a fiercely criticized article by its editor, Francis Chanson. Camus had to respond and wrote an open letter to Sartre to defend himself. This led to Sartre&#39;s &quot;Reply to Camus&quot;, which was extremely harsh and mean, calling Camus &quot;a bourgeois&quot; and &quot;abandoned history&quot;, and the publication of &quot;The Resistance&quot; was a counter-revolutionary &quot;Thermidor Coup&quot;. . Their long-standing friendship was ruined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many writers who only define their writing by &quot;pure literature&quot;, Camus has always been an organic intellectual. It was the strong &quot;political nature&quot; of &quot;The Resistance&quot; that stirred up the hornet&#39;s nest. The break between Sartre and Camus, the pair of existential writers, and the subsequent breakup between Godard and Truffaut, the twin stars of the French New Wave of cinema, became sensational and intriguing events in the postwar cultural history. Sartre stood in a more radical position. Even when it came to the Nobel Prize, he was more radical and rejected it outright. What is depressing is that Camus, a writer who has always been in the progressive camp, was denounced as conservative because he was more moderate on certain issues, or did not follow a certain principle or dogma and put forward his personal understanding and judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1949, Camus created a play &quot;The Just&quot;, in which a group of &quot;terrorists&quot; debate whether innocent people can be harmed when carrying out political assassinations. Camus made it clear that this was wrong. When Algeria&#39;s independence struggle broke out in 1954, he also believed that the rebels&#39; planting bombs and killing innocent people were equally unfair as the French government&#39;s violence and execution. This view made him controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a speech celebrating Camus&#39;s winning of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, Camus was asked to explain why he did not support the Algerian uprising against colonialism. He said: &quot;Now people are going to Algeria. put bombs on the tram tracks. My mother might have been on one of the tracks. If that was justice, I would have chosen my mother.&quot; Camus called for the creation of an Arab, Berber, Blackfoot nation in Algeria A coalition government in which Frenchmen (European immigrants) governed as equals made everyone hate him. French nationalists feel that he sympathizes with Algerians, and Algerians feel that he represents white French people. However, his father died needlessly at the age of 29, and his mother was an extremely poor and illiterate woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 4, 1960, the car driven by publisher Michel Gallimard with Albert Camus in the back seat crashed into a tree, rolled and struck another. In the tree, Camus was thrown out of the back window. In the mud not far away, people found a briefcase containing Camus&#39;s diary and an unfinished novel &quot;First Man&quot;. This book is based on his childhood life in Algeria and imagines him. &#39;s father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Camus passed away, although Sartre did not forgive him, he wrote an obituary full of praise in the &quot;Osservatore Française&quot;: &quot;He was the heir to the ethical school of anti-historical trends in the 20th century. , his works are perhaps the most original of all French literati.

This year&#39;s pilgrimage month is in midsummer. On the edge of the Central Asian steppes, a black flag army knelt down and prayed in the direction of the Holy Land on the right bank of the Talas River, completed the morning ritual, and then set up its formation facing the rising sun. : At the front are light cavalry equipped with large horses. They hold Damascus scimitars and stand on foot to harness their power; then there is an infantry group mainly composed of Khorasan and Tocharian people, and behind them are archers and long-range soldiers. Spearmen; on both wings are Sogdian cavalry from the river countries. Although they are high-spirited, they have not been naturalized for a long time, and they are pagans. Their combat effectiveness is still questionable, so they are used to protect the flanks of the Islamic army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opposite the black flag army are the enemy forces from the mysterious silk country in the east. They were much smaller in number, so they placed their infantry in front in a defensive formation. These infantrymen are uniformly holding Eastern-style long-handled swords, which are bladed on both sides, reflecting dazzling light in the morning sun. The huge stainless steel blade is extremely sharp, no less than the cannibal&#39;s scimitar. With its weight Able to split a galloping horse in half, and as strong as a spearman to withstand the impact of cavalry. These infantrymen are also equipped with horses for marching, but these pack horses are now scattered along the Talas River behind the enemy&#39;s side. Behind the infantry were crossbowmen equipped with powerful crossbows, and on both sides were Qarluks Turkic cavalry from the northern steppes. Behind the main force of these infantry and cavalry are their commanders, divided into main generals, deputy generals and special generals, as well as vassal troops from Bakhna as reserves - I heard that those guys started this war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The commander-in-chief of the Black Flag Army, Abu Muslim, is The great food in black &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(currently translated as the Abbasid Dynasty)&lt;/span>; is the leading founding father and a military genius who became a monk on the way. He was born as a slave of Persian descent and had been preaching at the bottom of the Great Food Empire for a long time. He returned to his homeland of Persia six years ago and raised an army to resist the white-clothed Food Empire&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(now Translated by Umayyad Dynasty)&lt;/span>;. Last winter, he led his army into Mesopotamia. In the Battle of the Zab River, he won with a small number and a large number. He first used an array of spearmen to withstand multiple rounds of attacks by the opponent&#39;s cavalry, and then launched a cavalry charge to defeat the enemy who had lost their fighting spirit. The infantry forced into the river with floating ice floes, defeated the enemy that was at least three times their size, hammered the last nail in the coffin of the white-clothed food that had enjoyed the country for ninety years, and established a more than 500-year-old army in Baghdad. Years of black food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year he once again set out from Persia on an expedition to Central Asia to face the Chinese army who also came from afar. The commander of the other side heard that he was a handsome man named Gao Xianzhi.

The envoy said that a group of barbarians from the west were attacking Persia: they asked us to choose one of three situations: either accept their faith, pay a poll tax, or go to war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The envoy did not know that when he begged Tang Gaozong to send troops to rescue Persia, Yi Siqi had already died on the way to escape. The surviving prince Belus &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Persian means &quot;Victor&quot;)&lt;/span>; suffered repeated defeats and finally fled to China. , and died here, buried in Luoyang, the eastern capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;barbarians&quot; who destroyed the Sasanian Dynasty were called &quot;Tachik&quot; by the Persians, but they were actually Arabs. The name &quot;Dashi&quot; comes from the Tayyi tribe in eastern Arabia. It was regarded by the Persians as a collective name for Arab Muslims. After it was spread to the Tang Dynasty, because they used white flags, Chinese history books called it &quot;Dashi in White&quot;. . After the Persians converted to Islam, they were called Tachik by the Turks. This is probably the origin of the name of the Tajik people who also speak Persian today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhi, who had been on the throne for less than three years, had no interest in rescuing Persia, which was far away. At that time, the Tang Dynasty had not yet completely pacified southern Xinjiang, and its limited military resources had to be used to control the four towns of Anxi to the east of Congling, and were beyond its reach to the west of Congling. After Dashi conquered Persia, the expansion momentum in the east was suspended due to domestic battles for throne. It was not until the 60th year that the rear sent the famous general Qutaybah ibn Muslim to the east to attack the Transoxiana region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Hezhong&quot; area, as the name suggests, is the Amu Darya River, the two largest rivers in Central Asia&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (called Wuhu River in ancient times)&lt; /span>;The plain area between the Syr Darya River (ancient name Yaoshashui), it borders the Central Asian grasslands to the north, the Tianshan Mountains and the Hindu Kush Mountains to the southeast, two long and high majestic mountain ranges, and Persia to the southwest plateau. Business travelers who walked out of Congling along the two rivers gathered here, and the goods changed hands here and continued to the Mesopotamia and Asia Minor through the Persian Plateau. Therefore, the Transoxiang area has been an important hub of the Silk Road since ancient times. During the Han Dynasty, the Yuezhi people migrated here from the Mongolian Plateau under the attacks of the Xiongnu and Wusun. After merging with the locals, they formed the Sogdians. They established many oasis countries such as Kang, Shi, An, and Shi in the arid river area. Chinese history books call them the Nine Surnames of Zhaowu. Because the Sogdians lived on the trade route, they became an outstanding commercial nation that integrated trade between the East and the West in the Middle Ages. A large number of merchants moved to the Central Plains to work as businessmen. The image of the Hu people on the camels and horses in the Tang Sancai is the Sogdians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/zWVM9sgAhdxB6FB4f9sVoP03czN5Ac0gFEb5Mdgw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/zWVM9sgAhdxB6FB4f9sVoP03czN5Ac0gFEb5Mdgw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257243&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; >;In the first year of Xiantian of the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(712 AD)&lt;/span>;, Qu Dibo marched into the river from Khorasan in northeastern Persia, and successively Capture Samadan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now translated as Samarkand)&lt;/span>;, and the Kingdom of Shi , STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Tashkent)&lt;/span>;, Bakhna&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s translation of Fergana)&lt;/span>; and other countries. At that time, Li Longji, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, had just ascended the throne and was plotting to overthrow his aunt Princess Taiping, who was involved in politics. They were as indifferent to the killings west of Congling as his grandfather Li Zhi was. Two years later, Qu Dibo, who was militarily unstoppable, was accidentally killed during civil strife. The white-clad army retreated as quickly as it came. Tubo, which had coveted this place for a long time, took advantage of the opportunity and established the new king Ada in Bukhanna. This move immediately aroused great vigilance in the Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/Gu8dOFRAYyug80Y3jExmNtI4WyKn7reqLtfQmyJc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/Gu8dOFRAYyug80Y3jExmNtI4WyKn7reqLtfQmyJc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Samarkand, Uzbekistan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;中Sub-geopolitics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Bahanna&quot; is an ancient name, now it is called &quot;Ferg&#39;ona&quot;, and its consonant &quot;g&quot; was still given by Russian colonists In addition, I heard that the local people actually pronounce it as Fer&#39;ana, and the pronunciation is close to &quot;Fuana&quot;.

It was a single-ethnic Sogdian country. It was located in Between Suiye, an important town in the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty, and the Hezhong countries, it was the key point from the Anxi Protectorate to the Hezhong area via Congling. What&#39;s more important is that the Tang Dynasty could accept the food control of Bukhana, but it could not sit back and watch Tibet enter the Central Asian grasslands - this involved the geopolitics among the four major countries in Central Asia at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bakhanna is surrounded by great powers, with Turks in the north, Tubo in the south, Dashi in the west, and Tang in the east. The Turks were traditional conquerors of the grasslands, and used their strong fighting power to collect protection fees from the riverine countries; the White Food was an emerging empire that combined politics and religion, but in the early stages of its expansion, it was neither for war nor for wealth, but for &quot;Find an outlet for the warlike spirit of each tribe&quot; - Turks and Dashi are a zero-sum game between the old and new conquerors, which cannot be reconciled; Tubo arose in the bitter cold land of Qinghai-Tibet, and always aimed at the rich Central Plains, but suffered from Unable to open the tightly-knitted fences of the Tang Dynasty, they detoured to Congling, hoping to join forces with the Turks in the north to carve up the western regions of the Tang Dynasty, and then enter the hinterland of the Central Plains along the Hexi Corridor; and the Tang Dynasty was the only one of the four great powers to be dominated by farming. The political power established by the nation, the primary goal of opening up the Western Region is to use offense as defense to defend its own territory: from Guanzhong via Longxi and Hexi to Anxi, and finally reach Congling, the western border of the Tarim Basin. Just defend the towering Congling. Block external forces from entering the Central Plains. Therefore, the Tang Dynasty’s pursuit was not to plunder land and colonize&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(大食)&lt;/span>; or to exploit the natives&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Turkic)&lt;/span>;, opening up channels&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Tubo)&lt;/span>; or protecting trade routes ——The trade routes were just a by-product of the expansion of the Tang Dynasty, not the purpose. Instead, they simply defended themselves and blocked the north-south passages to prevent powerful enemies from forming alliances to deal with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Tubo and Turks from the south and north seek to join forces to attack the common enemy Tang Dynasty, while Datang Dynasty and Dashi Dynasty occupy both sides of Congling, one from the east and the other from the west. Once Tibet crossed this east-west equilibrium line and was expected to enter the northern grasslands and join the Turks, Datang&#39;s &quot;red alert&quot; was triggered. In the third year of Kaiyuan of the Tang Dynasty (715 AD), Qu Dibo was killed, the food army withdrew, and the Tubo army In the year when they conquered Ba Khanna, Zhang Xiaosong, the supervisory censor who was inspecting the Anxi Protectorate, made a decisive decision. He marched across the Daidai territory and commanded the vassal army of the slave country to march thousands of miles straight, crossed the Congling Mountains and arrived at the Ba Khanna Basin, where he defeated the heavy Tibetan army. Eight hundred years after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty conquered Dawan, he occupied this place again and blocked the Tibetan entrance to the Central Asian grassland through the Congling West Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Tubo tried to open up the Congling East Road through Taobolu, but was also frustrated by Zhang Xiaosong, who was the governor of Beiting at the time: in the tenth year of Kaiyuan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;(722 AD)&lt;/span>; Zhang Xiaosong sent 4,000 cavalry to rescue Xiao Bolu and defeated the Tibetan army. This matter has been mentioned in the previous article &quot;Visiting the &quot;King of the Mountains&quot;: Gao Xianzhi&#39;s Plateau Footprints&quot; and, so I won’t go into details. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Expedition to Congling West Road&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Eight Years of Tianbao in the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (749 AD)&lt;/span>;, two years after Gao Xianzhi regained Xiaobolu, he returned to Boxian &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (today&#39;s Qiemo, Xinjiang)&lt;/span>; span>;Destroy Tubo. The Tibetan army, which suffered a bloody blow on the eastern front, had to turn around and head to the Congling West Road on the western front to find the weaknesses of the Tang Dynasty&#39;s Western Region defense system. After receiving the information, Gao Xianzhi could have gone to Bahanna, where he would have been waiting for the Tibetan troops who had been on an expedition to come and give them a head-on attack. However, Gao Xianzhi, who had been pursuing the initiative on the battlefield all his life, did not do that: since the Congling West Road was still passable. , then I will cut it off completely! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/3rArVE0YBeev16pAJzunHE89Ik8YSr6hsWP04pSA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/3rArVE0YBeev16pAJzunHE89Ik8YSr6hsWP04pSA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Street scene in Chitral, Pakistan, the seat of the ancient Shishi Kingdom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianbao Nine Years&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (A.D. 750)&lt;/span>; Gao Xianzhi sent troops to Congling for the second time and came to Xiaobolu again. From there, he followed the Suyi River (Today&#39;s Gilgit River)&lt;/span>;Go upstream, cross the Shanduer Pass, and head to the Kingdom of Shishi at the eastern foot of the central Hindu Kush Mountains ;&quot;>;(now Chitral, Pakistan)&lt;/span>;. Some historians have verified that the Kingdom of Shishi was the end point of Alexander the Great&#39;s Eastern Expedition. The ancient tribes that thrive in the nearby Kalasha Valley are said to be the descendants of the Greek expeditionary force. The distance from Xiaobolu to Yushi is more than 700 miles. Now it takes two full days to travel by road. The road conditions are very good on the first day, and there are long-distance buses available. On the second day, we can only take the local four-wheel drive with the villagers. It is possible to travel west along the Mastuj Valley, with the continuous snow-capped mountains of the Hindu Kush to the north and the 6,542-meter-high snow-capped mountains of the Hindu Raj to the south. Peak Buni Zom. The Mastuje River cuts deeply into the dense loess at your feet, forming a T-shaped towering platform, which is reminiscent of the Tuolai River Valley outside Jiayuguan. The soldiers under Gao Xianzhi must have drank by the Tuolai River on their way from the Central Plains to the Western Regions via Hexi. Let&#39;s cross the horse, I believe they also discovered the similarities between the two places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/XKBIVpjK1iLdWvZmVtjxBKcinAQzrDdombTDnHD8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/XKBIVpjK1iLdWvZmVtjxBKcinAQzrDdombTDnHD8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257247&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Toolai Valley outside Jiayuguan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two Tang Books&quot; &quot;&quot; does not record how long Gao Xianzhi went on the expedition against the Xu division, and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; only mentions the winter march of the Tang army. According to my estimate of the terrain along the route of our division, it would have taken an ancient army at least half a month to carry its baggage. It was even more difficult for the Tubo army: since the Tang army had controlled Xiaobolu and the Suyi River Valley three years ago, the Tubo army had to detour through the high mountains in the south. Whether they could reach Yushi in a month was a problem. The Kingdom of Yushi is an ally of Tubo. It is located at the midpoint of the West Congling Road. After passing Yushi, you can cross the Hindu Kush Mountains, then follow the Panchi River through the Alai Mountains in the west of Congling and the West Tianshan Mountains, and finally arrive at Bakhna Basin - that was another more than a month&#39;s journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Gao Xianzhi made a surprise attack on the Chu army and cut off the west road of Congling, the extremely tired Tibetan soldiers who had come from afar no longer had to cross the four great mountains of Hindu Lage, Hindu Kush, Congling and Xitian Mountain. Mountains, not to mention struggling to attack the fortress jointly guarded by the Tang army and the Sogdians in the scorching Bukhan, you can return to the cool Qinghai-Tibet Plateau all in one piece - isn&#39;t this the peace dividend brought by General Gao of the Tang Dynasty? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, after losing the important relay point of Xushi Division, Tubo completely gave up the idea of ​​opening up the east and west roads of Congling. Zai and Thirteen were defeated by Gao Xianzhi&#39;s successor Feng Changqing on the two eastern fronts, so that the Tibetan army was unable to pose a major threat to the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty for the next ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Xianzhi successively put down the Tibetan offensive on the east and west fronts, and pushed the Tang Dynasty&#39;s military control line from the east of Congling to the west of Congling, achieving the strategic goal of stabilizing the Western Region and defending the Central Plains. It can be said that it has achieved reached the pinnacle of personal military achievement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, at this moment, he received a letter of request for help from Ba Khanna, asking him to stop by the army to attack the Shi Kingdom. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;拔汗那先被白衣大食灭国，又被吐蕃扶植傀儡政权，最后依靠大唐援军方得以复国，因此是中亚地区对大唐最为忠诚的属国，可以比拟为高丽之于大明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么拔汗那为什么要吁请唐军攻打石国呢？此事缺乏明确的史料记载，一般认为可能有三方面的原因，一是拔汗那与石国有隙，拔汗那位于药杀水上游的盆地中，而石国位于药杀水流出盆地的下游方向，其首都拓折城就是今天的乌兹别克斯坦首都塔什干（Toshkent），“拓折”就是“塔什/Tosh”，乃是突厥语“石头”的意思。两国同为粟特国家，石国扼拔汗那通往中亚草原的出口，而拔汗那则扼石国的水源，两国或有积怨；二是拔汗那向大唐输诚，趁河中之地陷入权力真空之机予以控制；三是石国位于河中地区与中亚草原接壤的前沿，与突厥的主要部落突骑施的继承者黄姓突骑施交好，而突骑施长期是大唐的威胁，踩到了大唐的红线。总之高仙芝采纳了拔汗那的建议，引军北上进入费尔干纳盆地，再沿着药杀水抵达石国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石国属于河中地区的昭武九姓诸国，是大唐的羁縻之地，它们奉唐朝为宗主国，向大唐定期朝贡，但没有行政、财政和军事上的实际管控关系。高仙芝讨伐石国的名义是“无藩臣礼”，但史书上没有列举具体罪状。弱小的石国提出讲和，高仙芝假意应允，却囚禁了亲自前来和谈的石国国王那俱车鼻施——他曾在小勃律之战中使用过相似的计谋，以财货诱捕亲吐蕃的小勃律贵族出城后实施抓捕斩首——然后兵不血刃地占领了拓折城。破城后，高仙芝纵兵大肆杀戮，还掠夺了石国的大量珍宝，光其本人就获得“瑟瑟十馀斛、黄金五六橐驼、良马宝玉甚众，家赀累钜万”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里所说的“瑟瑟”乃是中世纪最为昂贵的矿石之一：青金石。它原产于乌浒水上游的巴达赫尚地区&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（今阿富汗东北部）&lt;/span>;，经河中地区转口贩运至世界各地，既是珍贵的宝石、治病的“神药”，也是稀有的蓝、紫色颜料。 2022年跨年舞蹈《只此青绿》而爆火的青绿色调，其缘起就是宋徽宗以宫廷御藏的珍贵青金石供青年画家王希孟绘制的传世珍品《千里江山图》，而白居易的千古名句“半江瑟瑟半江红”，诵咏的也是江水在夕阳照射下泛出的青金石色彩。高仙芝从石国劫掠了大量青金石，想必是其府库历年蓄积的珍品，尤列于黄金之前，其价值可想而知。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;而根据大食史料记载，战争的起因是拔汗那与石国敌对，向大唐求援；唐军包围石国，石国国王投降，并未受到迫害；大食得知此事后出兵与大唐交战——这一叙述前后缺乏逻辑，难以解释大食出兵的原因。据我看来，那一年大食刚好完成改朝换代，黑衣大食取代了白衣大食，正需要一场对外战争的胜利来弥合内部的分裂。统帅并波悉林则刚刚镇压了安国&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（今乌兹别克斯坦布哈拉）&lt;/span>;的叛乱，得以腾出手来以安国为基地出兵侵占他的前辈屈底波曾经征服过的河中地区。如今河中诸国主动前来归顺，正中其下怀。并波悉林遂照单全收吞并了河中之地，然后率领士气正旺的大食雄师与河中诸国的附庸军沿着中亚草原向东进发，兵锋直指大唐在西域的前哨碎叶城。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而高仙芝得知河中巨变，第三次统率安西四镇的主力部队以及葛逻禄和拔汗那的附庸军越过葱岭，前往河中平叛，两支大军遂在拓折城与碎叶城之间的怛逻斯遭遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/LV5mMBRraRxnE4FS4opPUvRpUNPCVATVuQfAItbC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;史载这场战役打了五天，前四天大食军队主攻，但未能突破唐军构成的严密防御阵形，可到了第五天，战场形势发生了戏剧性的逆转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有日本学者把这场战役比喻为“中亚的关原之战”——关原之战是日本安土桃山时代投入兵力规模最大的一场战役，西军主力以寡敌众，即将赢得战场主动之际，原本按兵不动驻扎在侧翼山顶的友军小早川秀秋部突然倒戈，切入了正与东军激战的西军主力后方，对其形成夹击之势，西军遂土崩瓦解。这一类比虽然不尽确切，但确与怛逻斯之战的逆转颇有相似：唐军精锐的陌刀队挡住了大食军的多轮攻击，原本有望复刻对方主帅并波悉林去年在扎卜河战役中的成功范例，用骑兵反冲锋压垮敌军斗志。只可惜大唐联军的骑兵部队是葛逻禄附庸军，在这个唐军即将赢得战场主动的关键时刻，与大食早有默契的葛逻禄人反戈一击，反而切入了正与大食军激战的唐军后方，对其形成夹击之势，唐军主力遂陷入重围苦战之中，伤亡殆尽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主将高仙芝不甘心就此失败，还指望用预备队稳住阵脚，收拢前线败兵后再与敌军一决雌雄。他的副将、曾在连云堡战斗中立下奇功的猛将李嗣业在危急关头劝他撤退：将军孤军深入，没有援军，而周围胡人诸国都是追随胜者的墙头草，一定会对我们群起围攻。一旦我们全军覆没，还有谁回去守卫南疆呢？我虽然是个莽汉，也看得清形势危急，将军可不能再拘泥固执了！ &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（《旧唐书·李嗣业列传》：愚者千虑，或有一得，势危若此，不可胶柱）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是，李嗣业拽着高仙芝放弃了被包围的唐军主力，沿塔拉斯河谷向东撤退。地势渐高，山道渐窄，作为预备队最先调头撤退的拔汗那附庸军把道路堵得严严实实，后面的唐军无法通过，眼看就要被大食追兵赶上。这时李嗣业放下陌刀，抡起大棒向拔汗那友军左右开弓，“人马应手俱毙”，拔汗那军纷纷向左右避让，高仙芝得以逃出生天；而唐军的第三把手、别将段秀实挺身而出，责备上司李嗣业为了自己逃命而杀害友军，“惮敌而奔，非勇也；免己陷众，非仁也”，李嗣业这才羞惭地停止杀戮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是唐军在怛逻斯大败后的惨状。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/31CN9JVyp9irZvMms8DXX6lpHkT9teKviZsTsvFl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot;

In May 2016, Er Zhu quit the company and 26-year-old Yue Chengqi took over. One year later, the construction of the Yuecheng Plaza complex began, and Haifeng Weiye&#39;s market entity type was changed from &quot;natural person investment or holding&quot; to &quot;natural person sole proprietorship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A civil judgment with the case number &quot;(2018) Black 0822 Minchu No. 272&quot; shows that before 2016, Haifeng Weiye, who mainly worked on projects in Hegang, was heavily in debt, so he paid annual interest rates Borrow money from Yue Chengqi at 6% interest. In 2016, Erzhu completely gave up Haifeng Weiye and transferred it to Yuecheng Qi. At this time, Zhu Hai and Zhu Bo still owed the Hegang Gongnong District Local Taxation Bureau and the National Taxation Bureau a total of 2,059,920.94 yuan in taxes plus late payment fees. They borrowed money from Yue Chengqi and paid the taxes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2018, Yue Chengqi sued Erzhu for repaying the loan and interest, and received support from the court. However, Erzhu said that he had no money and could not repay it for the time being. This loan totaling 2.42 million yuan was not enforced until 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first took over Haifeng Weiye, Yue Chengqi tried many ways to make money, such as purchasing resettlement housing that had been delivered but was resold several times. Later, the court believed that he was purchasing a house. He failed to verify the situation of the actual residents at the time, which constituted a gross negligence. Therefore, his claim for physical ownership of the relocated house is not supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also participated in gambling and ended up with 7,500 yuan in gambling capital. After losing all, he borrowed 10,000 yuan on the spot, with interest of 300 yuan per day. Later, he was caught on the spot by the public security organs on December 2, 2016, his gambling funds were confiscated, and he was subject to administrative penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Chengqi&#39;s social software avatar is a picture that says &quot;Life depends on oneself&quot;, and the signature is &quot;What parents give is called background, what one works hard for is called country, there is a kind of hard work called relying on oneself&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before taking over Haifeng Weiye, Yue Chengqi had no experience in managing construction companies or large-scale construction projects. But through hard work, he used a Hegang construction company that was being enforced for debt arrears to take over the Yuecheng Plaza, a star project in Hunan County with an investment of 170 million yuan. After that, Haifeng Weiye became a major tenderer of Huanan County Government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After sorting out the public bidding information, &quot;Southern Weekend&quot; concluded: &quot;(Haifeng Weiye) has participated in a wide variety of projects. In terms of municipal engineering, it has undertaken the construction of public parking lots, roads, high-speed rail parking lots, etc., as well as medical projects There are the county CDC, the infectious disease area of ​​the county hospital, and the 120 emergency center, as well as the beautiful rural infrastructure construction in Huanan County, the material reserve warehouse of the county power supply bureau, and the black soil transfer earthwork in the pig slaughtering plant area of ​​​​Huanan Economic Development Zone.
