This is mainly because premiums continue to rise. From 2003-2023, 20 years, personal premiums have increased by 37 times. The second one. The reason is that many unborn residents are healthy. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This explanation is wrong. The State Medical Insurance Bureau&#39;s &quot;Development Statistics of the 2022 Medical Security Career Development Statistics&quot; clearly said that as of the end of 2022, the number of basic medical insurance insured was 134.57 million. With the national unified medical insurance information platform, the provinces have increased data governance comparison. The number of insureds is mainly due to the decline and repetition of the insured by 17.27 million ... Among them, the number of basic medical insurances participating in the employees is 36.242 million, an increase of 8.11 million year -on -year increase People; 98.28 million basic medical insurers participating in urban and rural residents, a decrease of 25.38 million year -on -year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Basic medical insurance for urban and rural residents (referred to as &quot;residents &#39;medical insurance&quot;) is merged by the previous urban residents&#39; basic medical insurance and new peasants to reflect the integrated medical insurance for urban and rural residents. It is significantly different from the operating model of the basic medical insurance (&quot;employee medical insurance&quot;) in urban employees. The biggest difference is that the former is voluntary insurance, and the latter is forced insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Theoretically, because the medical insurance for residents is voluntarily participating in insurance, of course, it can actively surrender or not to participate, but this is unwise. Because the personal medical insurance individuals pay hundreds of yuan a year, the premium is a small head, and the government subsidy is the big head. Regardless of whether it is men, women, and children, the personal advantage strategy is to buy and keep insurance every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Taking Shanghai as an example, Shanghai residents&#39; medical insurance payment standards are higher than other provinces. In 2022, the individual students paid 220 yuan, and the financial subsidy was 1,660 yuan, the latter was 7.5 times the former; the 15-59-year-old personal payment was 860 yuan, and the financial subsidy was 2,750 yuan. The latter was 3.2 times the former; The payment is 690 yuan, the fiscal subsidy is 5940 yuan, the latter is 8.6 times the former; the personal payment is 520 yuan, and the financial subsidy is 6110 yuan. The latter is 11.8 times the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As an individual, if you don&#39;t need to force participation in employee medical insurance, will you voluntarily participate in residents&#39; medical insurance? Will you choose to surrender after participating? The answer is self -evident. In the final analysis, residents&#39; medical insurance is a fundraising model for personal small heads+government financial subsidies. Of course, one step down, government fiscal revenue or taxation comes from taxes paid by workers and enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In terms of comparison, employee medical insurance is forced to participate in insurance. Based on personal pre -tax salary, the rate is generally paid by individuals, 8%of enterprises pay. It will be higher. Of course, whether in the name of individuals and enterprises, it is essentially part of the cost of all individuals or all employment costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The minimum and maximum payment base of employees&#39; medical insurance is 60%and 300%of the average salary of local society, that is, two people, one top payment, the highest premium, the other top payment, the minimum premium, the former payment of the former payment, the payment of the former’s payment It is 5 times that of the latter, but in addition to the different personal account balances, the two for outpatient and hospitalization are the same, which has nothing to do with personal payment. This reflects the internal transfer payment attributes of employees&#39; medical insurance: high -income people&#39;s transfer payment of low -income people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This leads to some effects: some &quot;marginal enterprises&quot; in the free competitive industry and sensitive cost. For employees to participate in employee medical insurance, the strategy is to allow &quot;formal employees&quot; Salary, because in the eyes of enterprises, the mandatory payment of employee medical insurance has a significant taxability, and naturally can avoid it; some people are flexible employment or freelance occupations. &quot;, And choose to participate in residents&#39; medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compare the medical treatment enjoyed by residents&#39; medical insurance and employee medical insurance insurers. ， ， 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿 囿, only compare the proportion of hospitalization reimbursement. It is not difficult to find that, on the premise of the difference in personal payment costs of the two, the proportion of hospitalization reimbursement of residents&#39; medical insurance insurers is not much lower than that of employee medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Taking Shanghai as an example. At present, the proportion of reimbursement in the hospitalization or emergency observation room of residents is at the negative section of 50-300 yuan. Infants and students are 80%(level) -70%(level 2) -60%(level 3), 19 By 59 years old is 80%(level first) -75%(level 2) -60%(level 3), 90%to 69 years old is 90%(level first) -80%(level 2) -70%(level 3) , 70%(level first) -60%(level) -50%(level) or more, in parentheses are the hospital level. The lower the level of the hospital, the higher the reimbursement ratio. This is to encourage the insured to go to the grassroots hospital as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In terms of comparison, the current hospitalization or emergency observation room of the employee&#39;s medical insurance, the reimbursement ratio of the employee, 85%above the payment standard, the maximum payment limit below 85%, and the maximum limit of 80%; The starting payment standard is 92%above the maximum limit, and the maximum payment limit is 80%. It is higher than the proportion of residents&#39; medical insurance reimbursement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is not difficult to see that the intergenerational transfer property of employees&#39; medical insurance: Workers, young people and the next generation of retirees, the elderly and the previous generation can be intuitively understood as &quot;all the all ones all of them Children raise all parents. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, regardless of the medical insurance or employee medical insurance, although it is called insurance, it is different from the operating logic of general commercial insurance. Commercial insurance will determine and collect premiums based on the age and health status of the insured. When suffering from certain diseases, it will be rejected, and individuals may not conceal certain diseases before they may be rejected. If a fixed premium is charged each year, it actually means that you will receive more when you are young, because the probability of getting sick when you are young is low, and the consumption of the collected premium deducting the year is the so -called &quot;cash value&quot;. The government&#39;s medical insurance will not refuse to insurance because the insurer is too old or the body is too poor, nor will it be actuary premiums based on the age and health status of the individual. Therefore, this is a guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In short, if your parents are unemployed in the city or in the countryside, it is a wise choice to urge or purchase medical insurance for them for them. On this basis, it is also a good choice to buy them for medical mutual assistance supplementary insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[莫砺锋：“花瓣飘落的方向，是风决定的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259413]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-10-27 09:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Doctor file &amp; nbsp; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot; FONT-FAMILY: Kaita, Kai Trio_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Mo Lifeng, the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; April 1949, born in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; 1963-1966, Jiangsu Province Suzhou High School entered high school. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; 1968-1977, farming in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province and Si County, Anhui Province. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; 1978-1979, undergraduate students in the Department of Foreign Language and Foreign Language of Anhui University. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; 1979-1981, a master&#39;s degree in Chinese in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University, from Cheng Qianfan Mr., a master&#39;s degree in literature. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; 1982, became a doctoral student in ancient Chinese literature in Nanjing University. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; October 1984, graduated from ancient Chinese literature in Nanjing University.

There is a black insulation cup and a plain backpack on the table. An old gentleman wearing a light blue long -sleeved shirt and wearing frameless glasses sit on the podium and said, &quot;Thank you for your classmates for not taking me so far Boom in the forum and let me complete my teaching career. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The old man is called Mo Lifeng. Long, at the age of 74, he completed the last lesson of his teaching career that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September 1979, Mo Lifeng was admitted to NTU and began to study the study of ancient literature. After that, he stayed in school to teach. So far it is the 44th year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Little known is that Mo Lifeng is also the first doctor of literature in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1981, the State Council&#39;s Degree Committee announced the list of the first doctoral tutors of New China. This group of elites that represent the highest level of academic circles at that time trained the first doctoral PhD in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In October 1984, Dr. Mo Lifeng&#39;s thesis defense appeared on the CCTV News Press. He also got the first PhD in literature after the founding of New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a senior professor in the field of ancient Chinese literature research, Mo Lifeng&#39;s first half of his life has nothing to do with ancient literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In April 1949, Mo Lifeng was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu. In 1966, when he graduated from the third year of high school, he applied for all his volunteers to fill in Tsinghua&#39;s engineering majors. In July of that year, the enrollment of the college entrance examination was suspended, and the dream of becoming an engineer was broken in an instant. In the next ten years, he went to the countryside to close the country and spent bitter youth in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and his life ushered in a transfer -entering Anhui University&#39;s English major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the reform and opening up, the graduate education recovered, and Mo Lifeng seized the opportunity again. In 1979, the second year of the recovery of the graduate exam. After studying three semesters in the English Department of Anhui University, he was admitted to the graduate students of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After retiring, he is still committed to the popularity of the Tang and Song poetry, holding a lecture, attending a book fair ... He once said that the biggest wish is to be at the entrance of the Tang poetry and Song poetry &quot;Xianshan Secret Realm&quot;, and give it to tourists to instruction The road to the mountains, explain the tour guide along the way, tell everyone, where there is no flavor, where the curvature is quiet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September 2023, the Jiangnan was rainy and the passers -by was in a hurry. The leaves of the sycamore fell with the raindrops. In a residential area in Xuanwu District, Nanjing, Mo Lifeng talked about his life experience. Blowing down by the wind, the direction of the fall is not determined by petals, but the wind determined. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; There is no way to read &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You you In the previous interviews, your father often mentioned, and also talked about the scene of &quot;brothers and sisters and dads play Tang poetry&quot;. Is your love for literature sprouting from the family environment? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; My father is from rural Henan. He studied in junior high school for more than a year. After liberation, he has been working at a local supply and marketing agency, and his mother has only read the first grade of junior high school. When I was a kid, I was poor at home. I read Tang poems because there was a book &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; in the family. My father liked it, and we also read it. It was not until graduating from high school that I had more contact with classical works after cutting into the countryside. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The influence of my parents on me has nothing to do with the majors I am currently engaged in. Their biggest impact on me is that I am sincere, hardworking, and a good attitude to life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; On the way to study, you have always performed well, volunteer volunteers college entrance examination entrance examination Filled Tsinghua&#39;s Department of Electrical Engineering and Department of Mathematics, but learned that the college entrance examination was suspended before the college entrance examination. How did you face such a huge gap at that time? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I was in high school in Suzhou Middle School. This school was very good. When I was in elementary and middle school, I performed average in Chinese, but mathematics was pretty good. I graduated from high school in 1966, but that year happened to abolish the college entrance examination. Junior high school students from 1966 to the three sessions of 1968 went to the countryside. Everyone was disappointed, but we had no choice, so we had to face it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在1968年深秋开始下乡，在In the ten years after going to the countryside, while working, I was tirelessly studying, and I even read a &quot;New term Dictionary&quot;. You have also mentioned the experience of reading kerosene lamps. What was the reading environment at that time, was there a lot of reading time for you? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; In fact, there are not many reading time. Collective labor occupies a lot of time. At that time, rural Jiangnan was really intensive, and every day was very long. Only in heavy rain and around the Spring Festival, there is no work in the ground. Those days can read books. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is no power in the village. You can only order kerosene lamps. One month of quota supplies a pound of kerosene. Therefore, it is basically dark to sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The books I read are also chaotic, because the books I have done are accidental, and I do n’t know what book I can read. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What are the other people doing? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I have a lot of educated youth partners who do not read, but play poker. At that time, the popular &quot;reading useless theory&quot; was popular. We participated in the use of sickle and hoe for agricultural labor. The production team raised 6 cattle plow grounds. These agricultural labor did not require book knowledge. Everyone thinks that reading is very stupid. In 1972, the university began recruiting workers, peasants and soldiers, but there were very few places. The recommendation system was adopted. Most people did not have the hope of entering the university, and I didn&#39;t. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; In the case, why do you love reading? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; This is many reasons. One is that I like reading. If I do n’t read it at all, I will feel that my life is meaningless. The second was that I was completely deprived of the opportunity to go to college at the time. Self -cultivation learning, there is no other way except reading. Five or six years after going to the countryside, I completely cut off the hope of entering the university in my life. In fact, there is no possibility. At that time, we called on us to &quot;take root in the countryside&quot; for a lifetime. I have prepared for a lifetime of farmers who like to read for a lifetime. Cultivating books is a lifestyle advocated by our ancestors. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, I faintly feel that the status quo of &quot;reading useless theory&quot; is abnormal. It will end sooner or later, but I don&#39;t know how to drag it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/kfynd0aoqqx1wyskwkoiQEKVBM5MTTRQ9.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;865&quot; height = &quot;575&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/kfynd0aoqqx1wyskbRNVOKWKOIQEKVBM5MTTRQ9.JPG&quot; data-key = &quot;255704&quot;>; &lt;/>; &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; In 1979, Mo Lifeng admitted to graduate students in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University and embarked on the research path of ancient literature. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (People&#39;s Visual/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; When applying for the exam, I don&#39;t know who Cheng Qianfan is &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What is the opportunity for you to apply for the English Department of Anhui University when he took the college entrance examination in 1977? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I was in Anhui at that time. In the provincial enrollment regulations, candidates must not exceed 25 years of age, only &quot;learning with expertise in studying expertise &quot;The third high school students were allowed to apply for the exam. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I was 28 years old at that time, and I have been in high school for 11 years, but I have no expertise. Cultural and educational officers in the commune sympathize with me. He noticed that when I was reading a very thick English novel during that time, I borrowed it from my classmate&#39;s uncle. The officer determined that I was in English and allowed me to sign up for the college entrance examination with the qualification of &quot;expertise English&quot;. After entering the school, I found that some students actually filled out &quot;learning and expertise&quot; at will, and no one came to assess at all, but I was more honest, so I reported to the English department of Anhui University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; In the year of reform and opening up in 1978 At that time, you studied 3 semesters in the English Department of Anhui University, and resolutely decided to apply for graduate students at the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. What was the original intention of doing this? &amp; nbsp; &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The original intention was very simple. The monthly aid of the month can rise from 18 yuan to 35 yuan. I can receive 18 yuan a month on Ontario, and I am very tight. I went from the Anta dormitory to the Provincial Department of Education to check the enrollment directory of various famous universities. I never thought about applying for the Chinese Department. I wanted to take the Department of Foreign Languages ​​of NTU, but the Department of Foreign Languages ​​took the second foreign language -French, German or Spanish. And I haven&#39;t learned it, I can only be temporarily changed to the Chinese department. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; When you apply for a graduate student, this is only a sophomore, this is in the sophomore, this is in the sophomore, this is in the sophomore Should it be not common at the time? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The graduate students in the sophomore are not allowed, but it was special at the time. The general situation of our 77 undergraduates is that the students are older, and the biggest difference between the biggest to the youngest in my class is 13 years old. At that time, the English major in the Department of Foreign Languages ​​in Ontario was divided into 7 classes, and I was in 7 classes. Class 6 is a fast class. Many students are from Beijing and Shanghai. The English foundation is good. They think they already have the level of undergraduate graduation. Therefore, they asked the school&#39;s request to take the postgraduate entrance examination in advance. The school did not agree at the beginning, but they kept grinding. Eventually, the school said that considering that you are older, you can study for four years. Then I decided to open this mouth. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Our classmates 撺掇 I follow the classmates in class 6 to take the postgraduate entrance examination. As a result, I happened to be examined, so I went to NTU to read ancient Chinese literature. The most interesting thing is that when I applied for the exam, I knew nothing about the ancient literary disciplines of NTU. I saw that the mentor on the admissions chapter was Mr. Cheng Qianfan. I didn&#39;t know who he was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; In important choices, are there some consistent principles or concepts, and how do you view the accidental and inevitability of them? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; These are not my decision, but the decision of fate. I am a successful fate. In recent years, I often say that we are like the petals on the tree. We float down by the wind. I do n’t know where to float in advance. I just floated to Nanda. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Invasiveness must contain inevitability, but the environment is still accidental. If the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; is not erupted in 1966, I either can&#39;t get into Tsinghua. My biggest ideal at the time was to be an engineer, and so did my father expect me to me. Unfortunately, after many years of his death, I entered college. My father did not see that I became a college student, a graduate student, and a university professor. It was the biggest regret in my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The fate of the generation of the third year is almost the same, and there are no ways to choose many things. At that time, some students were lucky to be recruited, but when they went to the city, they could only obey the arrangements. It is very lucky to be able to recruit work. We are all envious. After all, we can get wages, and farmers can only earn work points. The value of a day work is only two or three cents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, there are also subjective initiative. I have never given up studying, and many students have given up. I have some classmates in Suzhou Middle School very well.

The first sentence he said to us was: &quot;There are many candidates who come to find me in the test, come to see me at home, some still bring gifts, only three of you (Mo Lifeng and brother Xu Youfu and his brother Zhang Sanxi ) I haven&#39;t written the letter, so good! &quot;&lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti &quot;>; In 1979, the degree regulations for admission in school have not been officially promulgated.

Isn&#39;t it an adventure at that time? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; At the opening ceremony of September 1979, President Kuang Yaming said that the degree regulations are being formulated. He is a member of the Degree Committee of the State Council and participated in the work. When we enroll school, we do not distinguish between master&#39;s and doctors and doctors. President Kuang Yaming said that you will be the first batch of masters and doctors in the future. We graduated two years later, the degree regulations were promulgated, I got a master&#39;s degree, and then followed Mr. Cheng to continue reading the blog. I think reading is a good thing, and there is no feeling of &quot;adventure&quot; at all. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What is the expectations of life? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; There is no specific expectation, who knows what the doctoral career is. I just feel that reading the master is so hard and nervous, and I will definitely only be more nervous, so I have prepared for the cold bench for a few years. Anyway, I have eaten a lot of hardships when I was young. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How do you read the blog as the first doctorate in literature, how do you study and write doctoral dissertations? It is said that when you first read the blog, Mr. Cheng didn&#39;t know what extent the doctoral dissertation was to write. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; This is true, because the doctor is a new thing in China. At that time, there was no complete curriculum system, and the training mode was also secretly explored. Mr. Cheng did not know what extent the doctoral dissertation was to write. He borrowed a bunch of doctoral dissertations published from the school library, and many doctoral dissertations from Hong Kong and Taiwan universities. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Where does Mr. Cheng come from? Forming? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I think he is thinking about it, of course, it may be derived from the academic level of a doctoral dissertation in foreign countries or Hong Kong and Taiwan. from. Since there was only one doctoral student in my department at that time, Mr. Cheng did not start class for me in the classroom. Except for foreign languages, my curriculum learning completely adopted a special book reading method, that is, studying by myself, and encountering difficulties to ask Mr.&#39;s house for consultation. Mr. Cheng stipulates that I have studied 8 classics: &quot;Book of Songs&quot;, &quot;Chu Ci&quot;, &quot;The Analects of Confucius, Mencius&quot;, &quot;Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;Selected&quot; and &quot;Wen Xin Daolong&quot;. Each book has to be read, and 4 of them later published them as academic papers. The cultivation model is a bit like old craftsmen to bring apprentices. For disciplines such as ancient Chinese literature, that way is quite effective. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; When the graduate education was resumed in 1978, it was admitted to that year. 10,000 people. Today, there are about 560,000 doctors. Many doctoral students can&#39;t help worrying about employment prospects. They are confused about the future and doctorate in liberal arts. Will you be confused when you graduate, and how do you view their current concerns and confusion? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;Span>; When I graduated from a PhD in 1984, I can allocate a lot of units. Finally, I choose to stay at Nanya. At that time, there were fewer bloggers trained in the country and objectively without employment pressure. This is different from the situation of many liberal arts doctors. I understand the current classmates. Now there are many doctoral students, and there are fewer posts. After many years of large -scale graduate enrollment, most units are not short of people, so employment is becoming more and more difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is entirely a problem of the times, not a personal problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is difficult to find a job to find a job. If I can&#39;t find a job, the pressure will extend to me. Of course, the three doctoral students who graduated this year have all found jobs, going to Sichuan University, South Central University for Nationalities and Zhejiang Normal University respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1oMhfOmrHc3MQsFfLDaH9gy2B27iG9KPackfRB5z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/1omrhc3MQSFFFFFFFFFFFLDAH9GY9KPACKFRB5Z.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;255703&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2008, Mo Lizhen signed a book signing for Baijia Forum in Beijing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Committed to researching &quot;everyone&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; P>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You mentioned that ancient literary research was mainly due to all views, because all views were being viewed, because all views were being viewed. People have said that the new point is to make an article. Most of your research subjects are masters such as Du Fu, Su Dongpo, and Huang Tingjian. What is your original intention in choosing to study these &quot;masters&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Mo Lifeng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, all academic research is about reversing the case, and the same is true for science and engineering. When I was studying for a PhD at NTU, the school recruited 10 doctoral students in the first batch, each from a different department. Our dormitory lives with 3 people, a chemistry department, and a computer department. I communicate with them and find that they do research. Find questions and write papers. They are exactly the same as us. Pursue some innovations to supplement or overturn previous research results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for the subject of ancient literature, what can truly represent the academic achievements of an era should be &quot;everyone&#39;s&quot; research. Whether there is an overall breakthrough in the research of an era depends on how well &quot;everyone&quot; studies. &quot;Xiaojia&quot; research only fills the gap and cannot become a symbol of the academic level of an era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Your favorite two poets are Du Fu and Su Shi, and even once You said you were willing to travel back in time to the Song Dynasty and go to Huangzhou to help Su Shi farm.

I started reading Du Fu and Su Shi before I entered college. The only motivation at that time was that I liked them. I felt warm and comforted when I read them. I have said many times that when I spent the night in the hut that was scratched by the wind, when I saw the stars and shivering, Du Fu&#39;s &quot;The House Breaking the Autumn Wind&quot; brought me the soul of the soul. Shock. I planted for ten years, and I felt that I was a farmer. But I really do n’t want to let Su Dongpo also grow land in Huangzhou. There are more important things to do with the outstanding people with both virtue and talents! &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The biggest understanding of Du and Su brought me to me is the human feelings of &quot;Ten Thousands of Rooms in Anshongshan&quot; and the attitude towards life of &quot;a cigarette and rain&quot;. I am willing to do my best to preach them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How do you innovate in &quot;everyone&quot; research? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Real innovation is difficult, how can I do it. Because innovation requires you to look deeper or farther than others, I am not so high. In addition, innovation also requires accidental opportunities. It happens good new topics, or very precious new materials, which are all impossible. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I can only try to try to not be as cloudy as possible, and do not stir -fry the cold rice. I have done a lot of work now and talk about some common sense content, but how to make common sense content accurately, and the requirements are also very high. This should be uniformly uniformly uniform with the rigor of academics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Note What are the opportunities for the popularization of classical poetry and start to do popularity? You once said that the biggest wish is to be a tour guide at the entrance of the Tang poetry and Song Ci &quot;Xianshan Secret Realm&quot;. Is this wish now realized? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; It is also accidental. During the Centennial Celebration of the Nanda, CCTV&#39;s director was invited to record the show. After the recording, it was broadcast in &quot;Hundreds of Lectures&quot;. The effect was not bad. Later, they came to me to tell Tang poetry. After the show was broadcast, many audiences believed that the response was enthusiastic. I felt that the popularity of the popularity was quite meaningful. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/sps>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The purpose I want to achieve now is to make ordinary readers like Tang poetry and Song poetry as much as me, and like Du Fu and Su Dongpo. The so -called popularity is to walk out of the school&#39;s small classroom and go to the major cathedral. What I was pleased was that when I started a lecture, people of all ages and identities of all ages and identities were available.

Facing some difficulties? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Mo Lifeng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The current research has the trend of conceptual and fragmented, and the popularity of popularization has a trend of vulgarization.前者比如一定要强行发掘某些古典诗词中的现代性，实际上可能没有。如果生搬硬套一些新名词来贴标签，结论就不符合历史真相。还有一些学者选题过于细碎，意义不大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在如今鱼龙混杂的演艺圈，的确鲜有人像李健这样讨喜的歌手。我们很少听到乐评人对他的批评之声，也没见微博的各类营销号抖他的什么黑料，他就是红了，红得那么理所当然，红得那么众望所归。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/huSjlbT3I3FOoTHypGp5yeS64ovaHlSp8XRIbh88.jpeg&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;出世：&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;知识分子的气质&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;李健具有这样的底气。清华大学电子工程专业毕业，与许多歌手“寒碜”的学历或文化素养相比，李健是一览众山小，“清华高材生”本就是一个令人羡慕之极的身份，又不同于我们对理工男邋遢、不修边幅、长相平凡的印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更关键的是，李健身上那种知识分子的气质。李健的家中整整齐齐堆满了唱片和书，他听的唱片是Leonard Cohen、The Beatles、Freshly ground、Michael Buble、Fabio Zanon，看的书是博尔赫斯、茨威格、劳伦斯·布洛克、乔治·奥威尔，最后他拿出来的是Leonard Cohen的传记《我是你的男人》。他有着知识分子的那种清醒、自持，他与物欲横流的世界自觉保持着一定的距离，并在精神世界上追求精进。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而从他的选歌，也可以看出他的这种独立气质，有人说他是“音乐诗人”，其实他凸显更多的是“音乐傲骨”。比如线上演唱会，10首私藏翻唱，14首原创作品，诠释他心中对于海和诗的感悟。李健总是在浅吟低唱，他不秀技巧，不飙高音，旋律轻柔绮丽，唱腔空灵婉转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是李健出世的一面——他并不孜孜追求外在的功名和财富，有的是作为一个独立个体的追求、傲气和坚持。纸醉金迷的娱乐圈，他没有迷失自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/eAAaCHmRWWJ7NoJc5uuf8J6QNxhWB6R48hPNeYUt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255636&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;入世：希望刚毕业的&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一帆风顺&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;如果这是李健的全部模样，或许他也很难这么讨喜。毕竟音乐圈里高冷的创作歌手不少——比如梁博，一首《灵魂歌手》惊为天人，他的人气和受众基础却远不如李健，其他小众歌手更不必提了。李健的独特之处在于，他又有着入世的一面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健尽管不耽于物质，他却能够把自己的生活过得很好。他健身，旅行，懂咖啡，家里有专门的茶室，收集唱片……每一次出现在镜头前，他的穿着打扮总是给人熨帖舒适之感。李健的生活，有着一种高冷的格调，他不是满大街随处可见的大众品牌，他是Fendi、LV和Hermes。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些访谈中你可以看出，李健对社会发展中出现的一些问题有所关切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如因“希望大家少经受挫折磨难”的话题登上了微博热搜，他不久前在音乐会上对年轻人说：“我希望所有的人能够生活得简单轻松，不需要付出很大的努力就可以过上很好的生活，尤其是那些刚刚毕业的朋友，少经受挫折和磨难，不经受挫折和磨难更好，希望你们一帆风顺。”对于困境，他不愤世嫉俗，不声嘶力竭，而是祝福与前行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就如同他的选歌，他始终在吟唱着爱情、故乡、童年、月光、星辰、年华等美好的事物，他不直接批判庸俗，但他吟咏美好的事物曲折地达到这个目的。你也许会说李健很“保守”，但他却非常安全。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何况，李健还是一个接地气的“耿直boy+高萌的段子手+可爱的吃货”，轻描淡写就能够把许多严肃的、刻板的话语方式消解掉，让人会心一笑，并察觉到他的可爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，在李健身上，出世和入世是如此完美地组合在一起。很多人只能做到一点，或者连一点都做不好，或者在二者之间撕扯纠缠，李健完美地拥有了二者，他是很多人的人格理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无怪乎不少评论说，李健是中产的灵魂抚慰者。李健的歌迷虽然囊括了各个群体，但诚如媒体人朱伟所说，喜欢李健的人主要是“文青”“小资”“受过良好教育且感情细腻的群体”。这些人都是属于中产阶层或者预备中产阶层。如果说中国中产阶层有什么显著的特点，在出世入世之间“撕扯”便是其一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中产们既有入世的一面，他们追求物质，追求格调，安分守己，保守中庸，渴望岁月静好、现世安稳的生活；可遗憾的是，为了这岁月静好，他们又得奔走在大都市的钢筋水泥森林，疲于应付职场中的快节奏与复杂人际，承受巨大的生活压力与精神压力，稳定安逸的生活似乎触不可及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是他们又有出世的一面，他们很想逃离这一切，不去理会什么房子、车子、孩子、职场，想辟出一块属于自己的精神家园，屏蔽外界的一切纷纷扰扰；但真的要放下这一切，他们又会有所眷恋，有所不甘。中产的撕扯是因为他们无论是出世或入世，均不可得。于是他们时常在二者之间彷徨犹豫，左手是马云，右手是星云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李健完美出世又完美入世，他活成了许多中产想活成的模样，他就这样成了中产的抚慰者。这样说绝不是贬低李健，李健无意于扮演这样的角色，他只是刚好踩到了时代的节点上——这个时代的中产阶层真是太累了。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;所谓“祖源分析”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;人类遗传主要分为父系、母系、常染色体三个部分。其中父系溯源比较直观，就是查Y染色体，因为其只能从父亲传给儿子；而母系溯源的原理也差不多，就是查线粒体基因。无论男女，线粒体都只能从母亲那里获得。但Y染色体和线粒体，都只占人类基因非常小的一部分。而父母各给一半的常染色体，则占比超过98%，可以说常染色体真正决定了你是谁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各种商业检测所谓的“祖源分析”，也基本都把常染色体作为最大卖点。如果不了解原理，可能就会被误导——所谓的祖源分析，其实是先把全世界各地的主要人群，都抽样测一下存档。然后再用你的检测结果，去和档案里已有的数据比对，看看和哪些人群最接近。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以如果你测出来了“40%的南方汉族，50%的北方汉族，10%的蒙古族”，这并不表示你的100位祖宗里，有40个南方人，50个北方人，10个蒙古人——这个检测结果仅仅表示，你和该公司的北方汉族样本最接近，其次是南方汉族样本，最后是蒙古族样本。把这3个样本按以上比例混合得到的常染色体数据，和你的检测结果接近，仅此而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而我们都知道，东亚大陆没有种姓内婚制，南北人群的基因肯定是渐变的。加上各机构取样不同，结果就是同一个人在不同公司往往会测出不同结果：比如有的机构取山西汉族为“北方汉族样本”，于是山西汉族去测，就会测出来“100%北方汉族”；而有的公司以华北汉族为北方样本，山西汉族去测，又可能测出来“蒙古血统”了......&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以从本质上来说，这不是“祖源分析”，而是“亲戚分析”。但你和某个人群接近，就必定有共同祖先，所以虽然是商业噱头，但也不算凭空捏造，还是有其科学依据的。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;满族基因与汉族无异&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“我从哪里来”是全世界人类都感兴趣的哲学问题，基因检测这么火也是自然之中了。为了吸引顾客，各大基因公司也纷纷完善样本数据库，希望能给所有族群都筛选出没有争议的比对样本——然而这个宏大计划，却在满族基因上碰了一鼻子灰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一个人口上千万的民族，各大机构对满族反复取样计算，却发现始终无法得到满族的标杆样本。无论怎么扩大样本量，改善分析方法，即使对满族的抽样人数已经达到数千人，却依然是一个结论：满族无论父系、母系、常染色体，都与汉族没有区别。如果用已有标杆样本进行分析，那么现代满族群体的民族血统，以北方汉（80%）、南方汉（6.57%）、日韩（5%）、蒙古-通古斯（3%）等成分为主。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的结果，让很多学者和人类学爱好者都很惊讶：其他通古斯语人群，比如鄂伦春族，和汉族的基因差异是非常明显的。满族在遗传上却和汉族几乎一致，要知道清朝是严禁满汉（旗民）通婚的，那么满族作为通古斯语系的一员，到底是怎么变成汉人血统的？&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;掠奴传统&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一个可能的解释是，这和满洲（女真）社会的掠奴传统有关。满洲入关前后还处在奴隶社会，每次出征都必定大量掠夺平民作为奴隶，满语称为“阿哈”，如果是家生奴隶就叫“包衣阿哈”。比如明朝成化三年，明军深入打击建州女真，一次战役就解救了1165名沦为女真奴隶的汉人。而随着建州女真的不断崛起，掠奴的规模也越来越大，动辄以万计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后金/清对明朝掠奴的人数规模，目前国内没有研究。但同时期清朝也对明朝属国“李氏朝鲜”多次用兵，根据史料记载，1636年丙子战争，清军将60万朝鲜官民男女掠为奴隶，押回沈阳市场贩卖（这个数字还不包括清军中的蒙古士兵掠往蒙古的朝鲜人口数）。现代学者大多认为60万有所夸大，实际数量大概在40万-50万。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在整个明清易代战争中，清军掳掠的汉人恐怕更难以计数了。比如1698年来华的法国传教士巴多明，就在写给法国科学院的信中提到：“年老的鞑靼人在关内渐渐死去，他们的子女更容易学习被征服地的语言而不是父辈的语言，因为他们的母亲和仆人几乎全是汉人”——可见清初的满洲家庭，女眷和仆人都源自掳掠来的汉人奴隶。这样几代之后，其母系和常染色体遗传，必定都会变得和汉人无异，母语也会自然替换成汉语。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;清代战争制度与抱养继嗣&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而现代满族的父系遗传，也和汉族相差无几，这就不能只用清军掠夺汉女来解释了。有一种观点推测，这可能和清代独特的战争制度导致的旗人家庭抱养继嗣成风有关：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多历史爱好者都注意到，明代调兵动辄数万数十万，比如万历年间的播州之役，三省各出兵8万，合计24万明军。而清代却只能一次调动数千士兵，最多也不过一两万人。比如乾隆年间的某场边境战争，开战初期居然只派出3000八旗兵和100名侍卫巴图鲁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为清军必须首先防范汉地起义，因此绿营极度碎片化，分散在全国各地。然后在各个关键城市设立满城，调入八旗驻防。通过相对集中的八旗，去监视绿营。如果某个地方出现了民变，可以第一时间出兵弹压。把起义消灭在萌芽状态，同时防止汉人构成的绿营坐大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是这种碎片化的军制，一旦碰到外敌入侵，或是需要组织军队对外进攻，就很难凑出一支规模庞大的军队了。先不说调兵需要极长的时间，为了保证对内的镇压力度，只能抽调小部分兵员。即使花了大力气凑出了一支稍具规模的，这支军队也是各种支离破碎的小部队集合体，缺乏组织度，难以用于打大规模会战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顺治五年编审完成的丁册记载，八旗壮丁共计34.7万人，其中满洲5.5万人，蒙古2.9万人，汉军4.6万人。而满、蒙古旗下家奴汉人21.7万人，占比达62.5%。满蒙汉八旗，共计13万壮丁，是战斗兵的主力。这些清军一半在北京，一半分散各地满城驻防。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此清初八旗每次出兵，抽调1万人都是大兵团了。这样的结果是，满洲士兵在各种战争中被快速消耗，而汉人家奴不参军打仗，即使随军也以承担辅助和后勤工作为主。这部分人口在清初一系列战争中，受到的人口损失应该是最小的。而且家奴算是八旗的私产，如果折损了，旗人还会想办法“补充”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等到雍正年间，清朝在和通泊战役中仅仅损失7000八旗兵，就把京城旗人打得家家披麻戴孝。接下来乾隆又号称“十全武功”，战争愈加频繁，八旗人口的损失来不及通过自然生育填补。很多旗人家庭男丁战死后又亲族凋零，只能偷偷从汉人家奴里抱养孩童为养子以充门户，避免家门绝断，一家女眷无人赡养。民间一直有传说，乾隆抱养自海宁陈氏，其故事原型可能就来源于此。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

She usually has the habit of hoarding garbage. When she encounters cans, mineral water bottles, cartons Cardboard boxes, scrap wires, and even scraps from the village mosquito net factory were all picked up and taken home. She didn’t see much of them sold, so they were all piled up in the yard. My sister and I spend a long time cleaning up every time. Before long, she picks up so many things that they pile up like a mountain, and the small yard is like a garbage dump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, my mother also has a lot of old things stored in her two rooms, including clothes, shoes and hats from many years ago, rusty iron pots, shovels, farm tools, and even old things that her father brought to her from Xinjiang when he was still alive. The cotton felts, blankets, and sheepskin jackets were in tatters and a mess. We have to clean her out, and mother protects her like a baby, for fear that we will throw her away as garbage when she is not paying attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some villages and towns, old people with my mother’s habits are quite common. Some store less and put them in categories; some store more and put them in disorder; some garbage is mixed with daily necessities and they simply eat and sleep in the garbage pile. It is understood that this is mostly done by lonely elderly people. Very little of the garbage they pick up can be sold. Since they are unable to move it out, they have to coexist with the garbage over time. There are also elderly people who have children and also like to hoard rags. Their behavior and habits are often disgusted by their children, and they are even ridiculed as &quot;nostalgia mania&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do these elderly people like to hoard &quot;rags&quot;? Investigating the reasons, I found through investigation that they are nothing more than the following:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it is based on frugality and cannot bear to throw away old things. The elderly are used to living a hard life, and they can make do with the old things at home, and seldom buy new clothes or new supplies. Even if their children buy them, they are often not used to them. They still think the old ones are better and are reluctant to throw them away. Some old people do not want to sell the rags they pick up for money, but feel it would be a pity to throw them away. Old man Wang in his hometown village likes to collect old furniture discarded by young people. It is often seen that he uses a tricycle to transport it home. Someone asked him: &quot;You have saved so much, can you use it yourself?&quot; Old Man Wang said: &quot;They are all high-quality wood. Where can I find this before! I can dismantle it and it can be used.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The second reason is based on nostalgia. There is warmth and emotion in the rags. Many elderly people are nostalgic for old things. Many of their clothing items have been with them for decades. Old things have memories, stories and feelings. In my family, my mother has a deep affection for the rags that have been piled up in two rooms, especially my father’s belongings. She left some of them when he was buried. Every time he wanted to dispose of them, my mother always said: “You throw them away as garbage.” &quot;Where can I miss your dad? I took out these things, rubbed them, and talked about them, as if talking to him...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is based on loneliness, to relieve loneliness. This situation is more common among the elderly who like to hoard rags. According to my mother, Aunt Zhang&#39;s three children all work in developed areas and earn a lot of money. They send her money on time every month. It should be said that Aunt Zhang has no worries about food and clothing. But she got up early and stayed up late at night, rain or shine, picking up trash everywhere. Aunt Zhang explained the reason: &quot;My children all know how to be filial, and I don&#39;t lack anything. But they rarely come back throughout the year, and I feel empty. I don&#39;t pick up rags all for the sake of selling them, but I just have something to do and feel at ease.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is based on being noticed and longing for short-term happiness. When my friend was chatting with me, he mentioned that his relative, Grandma Li, who lives in the city, had a unique reason for picking up garbage. Her old courtyard is rarely visited by people, and only during holidays and New Years are the children and grandchildren reunited. The small courtyard is filled with laughter and joy. Those are the happiest and happiest days of the year for Granny Li. Later, Granny Li discovered that whenever the house was messy, her children would come to clean it, so she had an idea and deliberately picked up garbage and made the yard messy and dirty, so that the children would come back to clean it up, which made the house more popular and lively. , it’s lively. The two daughters-in-law couldn&#39;t stand her behavior and said that Granny Li was a little mentally disturbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elderly are keen to hoard rags and rags, which is not only unsightly and affects the sanitation of the family environment, but more importantly, the elderly have more or less problems with their mental health. As a child, you should not only clean up regularly, persuade and comfort them, and return them to a normal life track, but you should also look for the reasons at a deeper level. As the saying goes: To untie a bell, you must tie the bell. Children should not only pay attention to material support, but also pay attention to spiritual support. Just like the old song &quot;Go Home Often and See&quot; sings, &quot;Find some free time, find some time, take your children, and come home often; Bring a smile, bring blessings, accompany your loved ones, and go home often...&quot; Give the elderly more spiritual comfort and let them feel the deep family affection and the warmth of home. To a certain extent, this is richer than simply giving them Material support is more important! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a staff member of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Tancheng County, Shandong Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions .

He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before becoming an actor. work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren&#39;s voice came from the other end of the receiver. Like an old-fashioned man, he carefully confirmed the name of the newspaper and the reporter&#39;s name, and his tone sounded gentle and gentle. He is on vacation. When he is not working, he spends his time in the same way as ordinary people. He passes the time by watching anime such as &quot;Spells Come Back&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren may have been the actor with the broadest role map in the Chinese-language drama market. His images in movies and TV shows are so varied that it&#39;s jaw-dropping. In 2021, he dressed up in women&#39;s clothing, put on lipstick, and played the role of Mama Sang &quot;Baby&quot; in the highly acclaimed drama &quot;The Lights Are Coming&quot;. The character photo was published in Taiwanese newspapers, but no one reacted, &quot;It took two days to be discovered by others. Isn&#39;t this Wu Kangren!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 drama &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, he plays A pervert who is sexually harassed in the workplace has a female fan who is so angry that she wants to &quot;quit her fans&quot;. Wu Kangren is very calm about this. He told Southern Weekend reporters that he is not worried about the loss of fans of the drama and movies. &quot;The next role will be different.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These roles are a huge departure from the &quot;flower boy&quot; image he played early in his career. At the age of 27, he played Hana Takuya in the classic idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; - affectionate, broken, and in line with all the settings of a tragic male lead. But in the following years, he continued to break away from that image full of romantic arcs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, on the 54th Taiwan Golden Bell Awards stage, Wu Kangren took the stage as the award guest. Everyone looked at the thin actor with sunken cheeks and a bald head with some suspicion. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bald man?&quot; A barrage floated across the video. At that time, for the new drama, he lost weight to only 64 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become routine for him to adjust his body shape, skin color and accent according to the requirements of the role. Someone made an Excel polyline table of Wu Kangren&#39;s weight data from &quot;Termites&quot; to &quot;Love&quot; and found that his weight suddenly went up and down, showing a steep W shape. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him if he was not afraid of physical damage caused by drastic changes? He smiled and replied: &quot;I&#39;m still alive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fight&quot; is the key word that many people first think of when they mention Wu Kangren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Wu Kangren changed his appearance again in the Taiwanese drama &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; broadcast exclusively on Station B. He put on a Hawaiian shirt, revealing his dark skin, and became the 41-year-old frustrated middle-aged Gao Jiayue. As the eldest son in his family, he has been drifting away for a long time, running a restaurant named &quot;One Million&quot; with a rating of only 2.8 in Xiaoliuqiu. After several years of bleak business, his girlfriend couldn&#39;t bear the island life and cheated on him and left. His career went bankrupt, his love failed, and he tried to hang himself in a restaurant, but the rope broke. Dive to the bottom of the sea, take off your oxygen equipment, and prepare to drown yourself. He suddenly remembered that the oxygen equipment might be eaten by sea turtles and was not environmentally friendly, so he had no choice but to surface and returned home dejectedly to meet his family and have a &quot;long farewell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents ran a breakfast shop in Taipei to support their three sons. The mother struggled to endure her father&#39;s mental infidelity and continued to live under the same roof with resentment. The second son is an adopted son. He lives a regular life as an office worker and takes the initiative to take over the responsibility of taking care of his parents. The younger son is older and unmarried, and helps in the breakfast shop. The whole family is stuck in the inertia of the old life and is stuck in moving forward. Everyone is in a &quot;stuck moment&quot; in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren said that he doesn’t have much in common with the character, but as a peer of Gao Jiayue, he has also experienced Kaka moments in real life. &quot;What&#39;s the hardest time for an actor? The role you want to take is taken away, or people don&#39;t like your good performance when it comes out.&quot; Wu Kangren told a reporter from Southern Weekend. His response was simple and clear: keep eating, sleeping, and trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be a harvest year for Wu Kangren. Two of his films, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were screened at the film festival. Both films focused on the bottom class. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was filmed in Malaysia, with Wu Kangren playing a deaf-mute illegal immigrant. After getting off the plane, he intuitively felt the gap between him and the character. At first glance, he was a &quot;white and clean civilized person&quot;, while the character he played lived in a dirty place all day long. He began to starve and continued to bask in the sun until his skin was tanned by ultraviolet rays and the locals in the market stopped looking at him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 First Youth Film Festival, he won the best actor for this role. The organizing committee commented on his performance: &quot;Faced with unconventional character settings, Wu Kangren used all available physical resources such as expressions, body parts, movements, and eyes to perform, interpreting the emotions and emotions of the film extremely vividly. Hearing thunder in silence reflects the actor&#39;s great empathy for the character&#39;s situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren has a rare sense of relaxation. He has no agent or company and works for himself. Lasted nine years. There are no personal restrictions or team control. It&#39;s all up to you to decide what kind of scenes to take on, what roles to play, how much to talk to the media, and what the standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked a Southern Weekend reporter which episode of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; he had watched. After getting the answer, he conveyed his preferences as if he were a friend: &quot;Look further down, the back is really better. I really like it.&quot; I like it.&quot; Faced with the reporter&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; question, he also bluntly said: &quot;This question is too broad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the outside world, the different types of roles over the years have brought Wu Kangren Emboldened. But he said that when he was young, his sense of self-identity was very low and he felt that he was just a &quot;nobody&quot;. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before the age of 20. He worked as a rough laborer on construction sites, ran a street stall, and also worked in cafes and bars. Now that I am in my forties this year, the feeling of insecurity has subsided, and new questions have arisen in my heart. He said that in recent years, he feels that his life as an actor will not be too long, so he cherishes it more and increases the frequency of taking roles. This year, he has at least seven film and television works released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, he almost subconsciously revealed his expectations for his subsequent career. He said: &quot;I want to continue acting until I am old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot; In &quot;In This Lifetime&quot;, Wu Kangren plays Gao Jiayue, a frustrated middle-aged man. After his career went bankrupt and his love failed, he tried to commit suicide but failed and returned home in despair. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, Wu Kangren accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. The following is a self-narration compiled based on the interview content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the invitation from &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; At that time, I had just finished filming the movie &quot;May You Live Longer&quot; in Hong Kong. When I finished filming, I only weighed 53 kilograms, which was too light. So before joining the set of &quot;In This Life Time&quot;, I ate as much as possible and weighed 66 kilograms when I returned. Last year I went to Malaysia and Hong Kong to shoot a movie respectively. I was made thin and dark. I came back to play the role of Gao Jiayue, a kid who came back from the island. In fact, he looked quite similar. In addition, director Xu Zhaoren is here, and I also like the script. I knew beforehand that Brother Xixiang (Xi Xiang, who plays the father) and Sister Guimei (Yang Guimei, who plays the mother) would take the role, so I also wanted to act together in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director took the sad story very lightly, and made the sad things somewhat funny, even humorous. Gao Jiayue is a person who really wants to die. But if you take what Gao Jiayue said to his nephew, &quot;I jumped into the sea, I wanted to die, but I saw turtles again, and I was afraid that the turtles would eat my equipment and it was not environmentally friendly.&quot; People say that he must think you are lying or joking. But when the audience actually saw the picture, all this became no longer such a joke: it was true, he wanted to die. I think this is where life is ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is not about university knowledge. My own interpretation is, &quot;It would be good to grow this big in your lifetime.&quot; This sentence reflects a lot of feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When things don’t go as planned, it’s always a “stuck moment.” In our lives, sometimes things go against our expectations, and sometimes hard work may not necessarily pay off. This is a very cruel thing. You can’t get what you want, and you can get what you don’t want. How you can stabilize your mood, continue to live, continue to love the people around you, or make the people you love live happily is all a matter of subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people choose to escape, such as the parents in the play who have marital problems. Gao Jiayue came back to tell them not to continue evading. Some people tried to persuade them to make peace but not to leave. Gao Jiayue tried to persuade them to leave but not to make peace. Some people are always in his comfort zone, such as his two younger brothers, who complain about life but are unwilling to step out.一个像高嘉岳这样的角色，怎么样推他们一把，但用的方式又这么的讨人厌，他有一种被讨厌的勇气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real-life family dramas are not as easy as genre dramas. It is very difficult to act in a very real-life way. We actors have been acting for so long and are very familiar with rhythm, technique, and movement. We are also very familiar with how to perform well on camera. But when we try too hard to show the good side, the sense of drama will be stronger and the audience can see it. Xu Zhaoren hopes to adapt it to life, so we revised the lines in the direction of life. Chatting with the director and imagining the characters every day before going on stage is actually very brain-burning and tiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is very well structured, and the relationship between everyone is clearly written. But we didn’t act according to the relationship between everyone in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We feel that we have put a lot of effort into it. In fact, at that time, I was so thin that I deliberately imitated Brother Xixiang. Since I wanted to play his son, did I have any similarities with him? We looked at his posture and sometimes imitated him in jumping and sitting. At that time, I had a lot of discussions with the director. Since you want to play a son and a brother, do you have the same attitude towards each family member, or is it a little different? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when you are getting along with your younger brother, you just love to bully him. How to bully him? The screenwriter will not teach you to hit them with your hands in the play. This kind of action must be designed by yourself. And it has to be connected to when you were a kid. The second brother in the play is not your biological brother. Your attitude towards your biological brother (reporter&#39;s note: third brother) may be different from that of the second brother. In fact, it is very subtle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the relationship with his father was not good in the script, but in fact when we acted it out, Brother Xixiang felt that he loved his eldest son the most because he was his first son. Child. It is a very straightforward way for parents to express their love for you verbally. Brother Xixiang’s method is the kind of love in which he scolds you the harshest and hits you the hardest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original way of quarreling with my father was to talk to each other, but now as the show continues, it has become that I can actually have a good chat with my father. You are a rebellious son, but you are always unwilling to take what adults say seriously, which means we are acting the other way around. So in the first episode at the beginning, the father guarded the drunk Gao Jiayue from getting up, saying that he was afraid that you would spit it out and choke to death. Therefore, the relationship between Gao Jiayue and his father was not a quarrel at the beginning, but a show of weakness, that is, I was homesick and came back to see it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the script, there is no drinking in the scene of returning home. We discussed with the director and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of state Gao Jiayue was in before he dared to step into this home again. A failed person, a person who is unwilling to start over, a person who dares not face himself again, but is so arrogant and thinks that I will succeed when I go out to start a business, and then returns to this home penniless, at this time, what should I do? How to do it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what I thought of was, otherwise we would have a drink, and he would have to get himself drunk before he dared to return to this house shamelessly. In the end we decided to use this method. How on earth would he face the truth? You can only get yourself drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that scene, I really drank sorghum wine. I&#39;m not that good at drinking, but I drank in a situation that I could control. After filming, I fell asleep, and the actors called it a day, leaving me alone on set. When I woke up, the only thing left was the lighting crew taking out the lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Wu Kangren&#39;s film and television image has been very varied, and he has played many impressive supporting roles. In 2023, he will have at least seven film and television works released. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At that time, I only wanted to take supporting roles&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;In recent years, Taiwanese dramas have become more varied in genre. Since they are so varied, of course actors have the opportunity to be varied. They just complement each other, from early idol dramas to later craftsman dramas, police and gangster movies, ghost movies, and now back to life. It&#39;s a big test for actors. You can&#39;t use your past skills to perform every play. When you encounter different plays, you have to make different adjustments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no particular pursuit to play various types of characters, I just want to accumulate different acting experiences. It should be said that I think the life of an actor will not be too long. I dare not say that for everyone. I think it is a question mark in my mind how long an actor can act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in my early 30s, I began to realize this, which may have something to do with my upbringing. In the past, my self-identity was not so high. The so-called self-identity refers to self-confidence and even the value of existence. You may feel that you are just a nobody, a child who grew up on a construction site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I really felt that I could only work hard, otherwise what would I do? That’s why I got so many roles later. The reason I take on so many roles is not because I want to make a lot of money. In Taiwan, I can’t make much money from film remuneration. I hope that within a limited time, I can see my own possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after I turned 35, I started to play different roles quite quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She and Her Her&quot;, &quot;The Lights Come on&quot; and &quot;Mom, stop making trouble!&quot; ” were probably all filmed at the same time, and during that time I only wanted to take on supporting roles. Because I think the burden of the protagonist is too heavy. The protagonist sometimes shoots for three or four months at a time. He is always immersed in a role or a long period of work. He is very tired and easily tired. I might as well play a supporting role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the epidemic was also going on at that time, I felt that filming supporting roles could be more fun and not be so stressful. You may say it&#39;s good to have more fun, but I have also reviewed it myself and found that those characters were really overplayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her and Her Her&quot; was a guest appearance to help, and I didn&#39;t think too much about it, because the role had to be played in a perverted way. I remember that the producer and director couldn&#39;t find anyone at that time, so they called me later. I had some friendship with the producer, so I went to help. I didn&#39;t want to attract everyone&#39;s attention, I just went to serve, serve. That role. I&#39;m not worried about losing the audience. The next role will be different. I&#39;ve never worried about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The First Light&quot; is another story. It was really because of good luck. I had a good role as the &quot;baby&quot; and he had a lot of space. He found me only after the filming started. I was free at that time and even Director Yi Qi asked you to act, and I said yes. I said you have to give me time to prepare, because I need to find a teacher to practice high heels and dance. In fact, we prepared everything in private, chatting with those drag queens, eating and drinking with them, and imitating their looks and voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So sometimes taking a role is not so calculated, sometimes it’s just a feeling, because the director is right, I go because the script is right, I go because there are certain actors, or I feel that If it helps this drama, I will do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When you are not acting, you are just a nobody&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In This Lifetime&quot; has helped me a lot in my life. I&#39;m really lucky to be able to film &quot;In This Life Time&quot; at this age. Xu Zhaoren is a very good director, and it is very difficult to perform his scenes well. It was the third time I worked with him that this time I seriously felt that I might actually have done a good job. In the past, I didn&#39;t feel like I was able to add points to his dramas, but this drama did a little bit, and I felt like I was finally worthy of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, I take myself very seriously. Sometimes the success of a drama is the result of the team, sometimes it is the credit of the marketing, and sometimes it is the accumulation of credits between the characters. It is absolutely impossible to do it because of one person. Man, this drama is hit or miss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always been confident in my life as an actor. The so-called confidence means that I am willing to do it, not that I am very good. This is a concept. In the past, it was a very simple and clear thing to work hard and be rewarded. This thing has a profound impact on me. If you work, work hard, and sweat for the construction site, you will get the salary you deserve. This is a must-have condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And be responsible. You really have to do your job well, otherwise the boss will scold you, fire you, or ask you to pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting is the same for me. Sometimes why you are so fat and why you are so thin is because no one has done it, and no one knows what can be gained from it. I want to know what I can gain from the state of mind of being hungry or obese. I think this is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard for you to tell others that I was hungry for 4 months from May to August last year. From &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; to &quot;May I Live Longer&quot;, I lost 53 kilograms. I was so hungry. , how I lived. People just say, wow. But it’s not because my character has to be so thin that you can see how great I am, no. It’s about putting the characters there and seeing the finished product in the end. Even if the movie doesn&#39;t go well, people will think you&#39;re just thin, so what&#39;s the big deal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because you will really experience it after you do it. We are not like the protagonist of the anime. Why is he almost defeated in the end and still able to wake up? Because he thinks about his family and friends. Like Luffy in &quot;One Piece&quot; and Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he suddenly doesn&#39;t know where he came from. strength. We are human beings, and we still have our own limits. Limits can only be reached through self-examination again and again. If people don&#39;t make mistakes, they won&#39;t know that they will make mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was acting, I often made mistakes, and I still make them now. It&#39;s just that sometimes someone will correct your mistakes, sometimes not, but I always hope to meet a director who can deny you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of each actor is different. Some talented actors need to retain their energy. I consider myself to be mediocre and I need to accumulate that energy. The growth process of each actor cannot be compared. Since it cannot be compared, there is no repetition. The lack of repetition means that only I understand what I am going through, and you will not understand. Only after each finished product comes out will you see the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an actor is not acting, you are just a nobody. At most, you will be exposed to fashion or commercial performances, and you will see the glamorous star appearance. In fact, if you take away those appearances, who you really are is very vague. Celebrities have a popular persona, and that persona is the persona that the audience likes, because now everyone likes to see good things, kind people, and even people with high moral standards. The actor&#39;s appearance is very blurry, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being blurry, it&#39;s just a different experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always felt that actors are people living in the past, and the works you see are all me from the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acting has never been free&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, I have always felt that my work experience, having worked 50 jobs before I was 20, was not of much help to me. big. The accumulation of work experience is very life-like, but sometimes drama does not require you to perform life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;Copycat&quot;. It is a genre drama, and genre dramas are not life-like. If you want to stick to a life-like performance and conform to the rhythm of the camera and the director, when should you react? This is the pull between you and yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing Guo Xiaoqi in &quot;Copycat&quot; was very difficult for me, very difficult, extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The skeleton of the genre drama is better written, but the portrayal of the characters may not be outstanding. Because it serves a crime and captures the real culprit, it takes the audience to see the reaction of each character. After watching it, the protagonist is actually empty. The so-called empty means that you can only accumulate some plots to serve the audience. How to put your own human flavor into it requires a lot of thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you want to play him very smart, but you don’t want to play him too handsome, a little quirky, but you don’t want to make him too mythical. If you just look at the ferocity of the supporting characters, the main character will easily disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;Copycat&quot; is about using all the things accumulated in the past into one film, &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is about forgetting all the things that I know. This is a transition between very skillful and unskillful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting has never been free. How can acting be free? Acting is very scientific, including lenses, camera positions, performances, types, and even opponents. Acting is very unfree but very organic. Any situation may affect the whole body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called lack of freedom is that you cannot perform exactly the way you want, sometimes because of the orientation of the camera, sometimes because of the rhythm, sometimes because of the opponent actor, and sometimes because of what the character wants to present. situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do you think you have to take on so many roles? Because I think acting is a very passive profession, I just hope to put some of my own initiative into acting work in a passive situation as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The passivity of an actor is to be chosen. You will be there only after the script is written. If the script is not written, you will not exist. You may just act in another play. What space is there to be able to choose and take the initiative? That means to become thinner or fatter, to make the character more internal or more external, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter what method you use, show your initiative. Those initiatives will affect the director&#39;s thoughts on the character, or the character can have a chemical reaction with other actors. This is the initiative that I think is valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s what acting is, you bring out your own life experience. If you don&#39;t have this life experience, you need to rely on a lot of field research and investment. Except for a few who can&#39;t do it, others can rely on self-study and hard work to accumulate the short one or two seconds on the screen to deceive everyone and say that I look like me. But when you go deeper, whether the performance is good or bad depends on each actor&#39;s own interpretation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, I like many senior actors, such as Mr. Li Xuejian from Mainland China, who can act at that age, or Mr. Jin Shijie, etc. Actors who grew up in Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Tony Leung Ka Fai, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Nick Cheung Ka Fai, and Andy Lau, each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas, leaving his own place. But for me, that kind of accumulation is very difficult. If I follow the current pace of actors, I will never be able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nine years without an agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I have been without an agent for about nine years. In the early years, I was still looking for one, but because of one job after another Come, I will keep acting. If there is a job, I will take it, if I get it, I will act, and if I act, I will go on stage. If someone says hello, I will applaud. I will say thank you, and I will keep acting like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four or five years, it seems that people (agents) no longer come to me. They seem to think that I can do this. But in fact, I am very busy and have many things to deal with, including contracts and work. Time, schedule. I haven&#39;t taken on so many commercial projects, and shooting commercials isn&#39;t too complicated. Relatively speaking, my acting life is pretty simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I feel that every decision I made before was good. I did not sign for a big company, but signed for a small company, and I will live a happier life. Later, he left the protection of his original agent, and finally became an agent by himself for no apparent reason. I also have to be an assistant and carry my own bag, which contains travel supplies and stomach medicine. Be your own driver and drive to the scene, finish work by yourself, and borrow clothes by yourself. There are things to do and things not to do. There are some jobs that you can choose, and there are some jobs where you don’t have to make this money. If you don’t make this money, you won’t have so many burdens and baggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an actor, and what we talk about is what actors do. In fact, I rarely talk about conditions, because if you talk about conditions, it will be complicated and waste a lot of thought. Being able to act well is the first condition. I&#39;m not a person who likes to compare. I don&#39;t compare myself to actors of the same age and tell them what they are like. If you don&#39;t think about it, nothing will happen. If you think about it, something will happen. You feel you are at a disadvantage because you have a value standard and judgment: my salary must be so high, or my conditions must be so high. If you don&#39;t have this value standard, there is no such thing as suffering a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, last year&#39;s &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were both very low-cost movies, so why were they filmed? Because I like the script of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, I want to try to go out and experience life. Different environments will have different sparks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did go, it was very worthwhile, and I made a great movie. &quot;May I Live Longer&quot; is from Hong Kong, so it&#39;s the same. I just read the script and said I would go. I didn’t talk about where I would live, and I didn’t even talk about my salary. The producer was surprised and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask about the price?&quot; I said I don’t need to ask about the price, just call the contract. He called over the contract and it was this price. I laughed. I know they don&#39;t have money. If I think I can accept it, I will go, and I will be very happy in my heart, and you will be very relaxed, because you have nothing to ask for, so you will go, just asking for a good performance in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to now, I don’t want everyone to think that because my life has become easier, I am not willing to make progress. I also hope to accumulate something. At least the stuff coming out this year is above the level, and I don’t want to deal with the performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard to say fate. It’s unlikely that you will have a breakthrough in every drama, really. This is a market. To survive in this market, we can only rely on each drama and how to play the role well after joining. In fact, there is not much that actors can do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清远一所学校七百多名新生退学，官方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:48:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School’s blind expansion of enrollment in the fall semester of 2023 without approval and replacement with online courses In the case of face-to-face teaching, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau has set up a city and county joint working group to station in the school, ordering the school to actively respond to the concerns of students and parents, conscientiously rectify problems, effectively protect students&#39; legitimate rights and interests, and ensure normal education and teaching order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School is a private secondary vocational school with 3,981 students currently enrolled (including: 1,215 in the 2021 grade, 837 in the 2022 grade, and 1,929 in the 2023 grade). After a preliminary investigation, it was found that the school expanded its enrollment without authorization, resulting in insufficient teaching staff and an inability to meet teaching needs, resulting in online classes replacing face-to-face classes.经工作组督促，该校秋季学期招聘的新教师陆续到位，基本满足教学需求，网课教学问题已整改，教育教学秩序正常。目前，该校已对退学的730名学生全额退费。清远市教育局指导该校依规办理2023级新生的学籍录入备案工作，督促学校加强师资培训和管理，确保教学质量。同时，为保障学生及时转校就读，清远市教育局提供市内有富余学位的中职（中技）学校信息供退学学生参考报读。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;美国在亚洲、中东的扩张&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;两次越战对美国的冲击，其实比朝鲜战争还要大。朝鲜战争中美国损失了约四五十万军人，这在美国历史上是空前的；而两次越战，美国都没有讨到好处——这两次越战延续，加在一起几乎有三十年之久，尤其是第二次美国从越南撤退，狼狈不堪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;战争中不使用毒气，这是国际公约。二战期间，美国与德国之间、美国与日本之间，都遵守了这一原则。但是，日本人常常在中国战场使用毒气。美国在越战也使用了毒气，今天越南的幼儿之中，有畸形儿、难产儿；美国在越南森林之中散布的毒气，至今还弥漫于空气中，这都是造孽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;587&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在苏联控制范围之内，东欧与北欧、南欧的一些国家，数次尝试脱离苏联阵营。每一次这种事情发生，CIA都深度介入，造成动乱。有的后果是国家改制、新的政权出现，但政权能够维持稳定的，只有匈牙利之春、波兰之春（1956年6月波兹南事件、10月匈牙利事件）。余外，中东的埃及、阿尔及利亚、利比亚等一串地中海岸回教国家的“颜色革命”，没一次不是破坏了原有的秩序；而那些国家原本已经开始的经济建设，几乎停步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从地缘政治而言，中东是必争之地，这片地区也是世界上最大的石油产区。美国用尽心力，从控制沙特阿拉伯开始加以掌控。沙特是英国当年从波斯帝国分离出来，独立的酋长国，后来变成酋长世袭的一个“阔财主”，却成为美国“心爱的宝宝”——为了他们的基地以及石油资源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1948年，犹太人回归故土，居然在耶路撒冷旁边切出一块土地，重建以色列——单单靠流亡的犹太人，能有这种力量吗？实际上是英国和美国在背后支持。英国在战后一蹶不振，以色列的主要支持者是美国。这个国家有它可佩之处，“无中生有”，很快就把国家建设得像模像样。希伯来大学的水平，不亚于中国的头等大学，不亚于美国的一流大学。台湾的军事研究院，常常请教以色列顾问帮助解决导弹问题，也请他们来帮助解决建立核电站的问题，这些人都是头等专家。我去过以色列好几次，人们纪律严明、生活简朴、奋发有为。但几十年来，以色列当年建公社的勇气、尝试与学习的心态都丧失了。可是，美国必须维护以色列。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国深入干预中东政治，发动了三次战争：海湾战争/科威特战争、伊拉克战争、阿富汗战争。然后紧接着，是伊朗战争。最近，美军才从阿富汗狼狈撤退。每次战争到最后，是颓垣残壁，当地被破坏得不成样子。美国三十多年的战争，将中东打得稀巴烂，地中海南岸、非洲北岸的国家，到今天元气还没有恢复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些都是“围堵政策”延伸出来的后果——美国扩张成瘾，每位总统任上都有一批将军希望扩张。与美国当权者有密切关系的黑水国际公司，专门做雇佣兵生意，杀人成千上万，一个个国家被毁坏，他们不用负责任。中东的阿联酋也是美国主导下的产物：将这一带几个小酋长联合在一起，建立“联合酋长国”——那里有全世界最奢侈的酒店，停靠着世界上最豪华的游轮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，战后的日本，相当于美国的“殖民地”。在朝鲜战争中，日本为美国提供后勤补给、维修保障，也借机将二战时的老旧设备全盘更新。 1970年代，日本的工业辉煌一时，其生产率全世界最高。世界上日本商货遍地，丰田汽车、松下电器、西田百货，等等——日本商人所在之处，当地房价能翻两三倍。东亚一带的经济，也随着日本起来了，所谓“雁行理论”——中国大陆沿海地带，也在这一波经济荣景之中占了一角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此情形，美国不能接受：“我将你扶植起来，现在你反而骑到我头上，将我的买卖都抢占了。”于是收紧银根、提高关税、专利索赔等手段齐施，三年之内将日本打到地下，到今天还没爬起来。所有著名的日本品牌，美国公司都占有股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台湾比日本聪明，当年的建设不用美国的品牌，像台湾集成电路制造股份有限公司这种企业，都是自己申请专利权——台积电生产了全世界80%的芯片。当初设计台湾经济模式时，就考虑到日本的前车之鉴。台湾的长荣海运公司，是世界上最大的航运公司之一。希腊的大船队现在被美国“卡脖子”了，挪威的大船队美国卡不住。所以，这个“龙头”不讲江湖义气。中国江湖上的龙头老大，是老大吃亏、小弟兄占便宜。美国这个老大是：“你做了我的小弟兄，就得听我的，随我处置。”如此行径，怎不令人失望？最近美国在提高中国的关税，又以台湾问题要挟大陆。从东方到西方，美国的如此行为，使得其领导的国际圈内怨声载道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“美人迟暮”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;数十年来，我们也见过美国曾经的荣景，百年繁华。 1957年我到美国，正好在报纸上读到：一个非裔小学生要进入白人学校而被挡住了；国家动员了该州的自卫队，以政府的力量，将民众的反抗压下去。这种“黑白”之间的纠纷，至今没有停歇过。因为黑人群体仍旧陷落于社会底层，即使金（Martin Luther King, Jr）作了多大努力，也于事无补——种族纠纷问题，如今变成“种族惰性”，弱势种族不再争自己的权利，反而去争政府的失业津贴。从数字上看，美国缺工120万，失业人口只有25万，差不多100万人在领政府的失业津贴，不愿意出去工作。生之者寡，食之者众，经济就走下坡路了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国科技迅速发展，今天的数字化、自动化、人工智能到此地步，厂房里面不见下层工人，只见工程师、检查员。 1970年，我从台湾到匹兹堡大学教书。当时一次大罢工，白宫震动，全国不知道怎么办。今天如果再有同样的事情发生，是否能同样撼动国家？一个国家假如有四分之一的人口，实质上是靠国家“社福基金”养活的，政府税收不够用时，只能靠印钞解决。支撑美金实质的力量，应当是国际贸易和国内的所得税——但实际上却是一团乱账。很多美国公司，收入在别处，富余的钱存在国际户头。如今美国的经济摇摇晃晃，所有货币发行限额等经济学上的定律，都不遵守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1980到2008年，两次巨大经济危机，都是信用问题、贪污问题、虚假抵押等问题所致。原本，这都是资本主义制度不容许发生的问题，因为健康的资本主义市场经济，是靠信用承诺。两次经济危机几乎让美国经济崩溃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255339&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近的美国经济，本该是大恐慌、大不景气的时候，居然出现物价回涨、股价回涨的情形——我们都看得出，其中有假。如此情形说明，美国这个国家在自我欺骗。但国内有如此多弱势群体在依靠国家的津贴生活，长此以往，怎么办？这些弱势群体，拥护不讲理的激烈右派，该怎么办？罗斯福当年倡导的“四大自由”很对，但现在“第五个自由”出现了：“别惹我”的自由。要不要工作、是否上学，等等，大家都认为是个人的事——如此“独立精神”，不是健康的独立精神。我希望中国的年轻人不要“躺平”——但是，世界的潮流似乎在这样发展，怎不令人担忧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，我写了一篇有关美国社会反思的文章，后来发展为一本书：《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》。那时候，我批判美国将要面临的危机：政府官僚化、社会涣散、铺张浪费——尤其浪费在军事、国防上。然而，政府该做的事情却并没有尽到责任：全国的硬件设施，桥梁、机场、公路、水泵很多坏掉了，却没人管。当前美国社会，最重要的问题是国家精神涣散：政府天天在争吵的，是堕胎是否合法、变性人的权利，等等——不是说这些问题不重要，而是说这些话题占据了大家的注意力，沦为政客哗众取宠的项目，真正关乎国计民生的事情反而没人管。这个国家正在掏空自己的精神文化、经济实力，这个国家正在走向浪费、走向懒惰、走向消耗、走向空洞化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“9·11”以后，美国以报复恐怖分子为口号，在中东介入无数纠纷。为了惩罚他们，美国在外战上消耗有多大？得到的丑恶名声有多少？国家多少的实力花在杀人上面？花在雇佣枪手上面？花在一架架无人机上面？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历史上最骄奢的罗马帝国、最浪费的法王路易十四、最野蛮的俄国沙皇，他们的骄奢、浪费，都没有美国如此严重。假如美国经济这条大船沉没，像我们住在美国的人会跟着被淹死，全世界经济会随之没顶。如此危机，该如何挽回，这是令人彻夜难眠，也想不到出路的问题。但是美国如此败象，确实已经很难弥补。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，有很多批评美国资本主义的书，但对于这些批评声音，美国的政客不愿意听，或者来不及听——对于他们，最要紧的是如何抓到选票，入主白宫。当年我开始写《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》时，至少有十二本书和大量批判美国的文章可用——今天我去查，这些自我批判的书没有了。可是，有识之士还是在批判，《纽约时报》《大西洋月刊》《星期六评论》，少数的几个记者和评论家，不断提醒：危机就要到了。 “火马上要烧起来了”，可没人注意。这件事令我不但感觉心酸，而且心伤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也劝告国内的“唯美派”，不要唯“美”是尚。 “美人迟暮”，会影响世界各处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾看见美国人奋发努力的时候，看见美国民主运作是许多人努力的累积，看见美国对穷国、小国的援助，甚至于教会在各地对当地教众的支持和教育，都是令我钦佩的。而且，我曾经盼望美国的政治体制，有不断的进步和因时的修改。因此，今天看见美国社会的涣散、政治的庸俗，在国际关系上又如此地骄横而不知点检，大家可以想象，美国这个社会，从记忆中的美好形象，居然一变而为现实中破碎的残镜，我的心情不言而喻。 &lt;/p>;
