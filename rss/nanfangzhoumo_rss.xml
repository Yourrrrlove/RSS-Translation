If you cross on foot, you will be banned from entering for life. In recent years, there have been many such privately organized hiking activities, and there have been many dangerous incidents. For these illegal outdoor activities, on the one hand, the penalties must be increased, and on the other hand, the public&#39;s enthusiasm for adventure must be given an outlet. Some crossing routes can be developed to allow explorers to take risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a recent report from the Siguniang Mountain Scenic Area Management Bureau, two tourists, Wang and Cai, purchased tickets to enter the scenic area, and then ignored the signage instructions and staff dissuasion in the scenic area and started hiking through the scenic area. But because it snowed that night, the two called the police for help and were rescued down the mountain. The report stated that the two violated the prohibition regulations of the scenic spot and caused certain harm and adverse effects to the protection and management of the scenic spot. Therefore, it was decided to ban the two from entering the Siguniang Mountain Scenic Spot for sightseeing and other forms of tourism for life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many netizens agreed with the decision of the Scenic Area Management Bureau. Mount Siguniang is no ordinary scenic spot. It is a world natural heritage and a national nature reserve. The Scenic Area Management Bureau is a public institution that manages the scenic area under the authorization of the Aba Prefecture Government. Although the two tourists purchased tickets to enter the scenic spot legally, they then hiked through the scenic spot privately, violating the prohibitive regulations of the scenic spot. The administration has the right to ban them from entering the scenic spot again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banning entry has become an option adopted by many scenic spots for serious violations of tourists. Since 2023, many tourists have been banned from the Chengdu Panda Base for one year, five years, and life due to uncivilized behaviors such as spitting water at giant pandas and slapping the glass of giant panda enclosures. In 2021, three tourists carved words on the walls of the Great Wall and were included in the &quot;blacklist&quot; of uncivilized tourism by the Yanqing cultural and tourism department in Beijing. 12 local scenic spots jointly banned entry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many netizens believe that simply prohibiting entry is not a punishment. Serious violations such as unauthorized crossing should be severely punished and required to bear the cost of rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aggravated penalties are also legal. According to the &quot;Nature Reserve Regulations&quot; formulated by the State Council, anyone who enters a nature reserve without approval or fails to obey the management of the management agency within a nature reserve may be fined between 100 yuan and 5,000 yuan depending on the circumstances. In 2019, seven travelers hiked through the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan without authorization, and one person died. The other six people were fined 5,000 yuan each by the protected area administration and required to bear medical expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Outdoor adventure activities such as cross-country and time-traveling have become more and more popular recently. However, many of these activities involve routes that have been explicitly prohibited by the government, and accidents often occur due to insufficient logistical support and insufficient awareness of risk avoidance. For example, during the May Day holiday in 2021, many &quot;travel friends&quot; lost contact or died while illegally crossing in the Qinling Mountains. The &quot;Ao Tai Line&quot; that travel enthusiasts are keen to cross has long been banned from crossing by the Shaanxi Taibai Mountain National Nature Reserve Administration, the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Public Security Bureau and other departments. However, these crossing activities are still prohibited frequently, and there are frequent incidents of travelers being in danger, requiring rescue by all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These rescues often require a huge investment of manpower and material resources. For example, in February 2022, a traveler was in danger while trekking through the mountains in the snow in Tibet. More than 100 auxiliary public security police, grassroots cadres, farmers and herdsmen, more than 20 rescue vehicles, and 9 horses were dispatched to search and rescue 20 people in the ice, snow, and violent storms. Many hours. In May 2021, a male traveler in Shanghai lost contact while crossing the Qinling Mountains. After the incident, more than 10 professional rescue teams with more than 200 people carried drones and other equipment into the mountains to carry out blanket search and rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cost of such a large-scale search and rescue operation is very high. Who should pay for these rescue costs? As such incidents increase, official rescue agencies are overwhelmed. Many places have begun to implement paid rescue. The Anhui Huangshan Paid Rescue Measures, which came into effect in July 2018, stipulate that tourists who violate the regulations of scenic spots and enter undeveloped or unopened areas without authorization shall be provided with paid rescue. Tourists who violate regulations are required to bear the labor, pre-hospital treatment, and medical expenses incurred during the rescue process. Transportation, accident insurance, logistics support, introduction of third-party rescue forces, etc. In August 2018, the Ganzi Yading Scenic Area in Sichuan also announced that it would implement a paid search and rescue system for tourists who violate regulations. The search and rescue fees start at 15,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan respectively according to different regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, paid search and rescue does not mean giving money first and then saving people. When someone is in danger and asks for help, rescue agencies still have to dispatch rescuers as soon as possible. After all, human life is at stake. However, after the rescue is completed, the rescue expenses should be settled and borne by the rescued person. If payment is refused, enforcement can be enforced through court proceedings and other means. If the rescued person dies, it is paid out of his estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, adventure is also human nature. Adventure activities can inspire people to challenge their limits. True explorers are often admired by the public. Simply banning it will not completely prevent travelers from traveling through time travel. It is better to block than to open up. Consider opening some popular crossing routes appropriately and setting up certain emergency facilities along the way to reduce the difficulty of crossing. At the same time, it should be clear that outdoor adventure is a high-risk activity. Even if you are well prepared, unexpected situations may occur. Well-known diving explorer Han Ting died in an accident while diving in a cave in Jiudun Tianluo, Guangxi. Participants in outdoor activities must fully understand the risks, be prepared for logistical support, and bear possible risks on their own. If you need rescue, you have to pay for it yourself. If you can&#39;t bear these risks, it&#39;s best not to play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[高端家教与留守儿童，时髦机车与过期月饼丨人在职场]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258648]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Two years ago, after my Harvard internship psychology mentor passed away, I was a little sad and planned to briefly The perspective shifts from laboratory literature to psychological cases in real life. Coincidentally, a teacher from a &quot;high-end tutoring&quot; institution found me, and I was quite interested in it. Between July 2021 and April 2023, I briefly took a peek into this circle. After May 2023, I came into contact with the circle of local charity cram schools for left-behind children. The two circles have different terms, lifestyles, emotional patterns, and family structures, which are worth pondering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before matching with high-end families, the general process is to prepare a resume in Chinese and English, list your relevant tutoring experience and a one-minute self-introduction video in English. Then, the intermediary agency will conduct a two-way matching. Driver&#39;s license, teacher qualification certificate, and early childhood education certificate can be given extra points. Specialties such as painting, piano, and dancing are also within the requirements of many parents. Generally speaking, parents are quite picky, and as British and American graduates with undergraduate and postgraduate degrees are actively pouring into this industry, it is becoming more difficult to apply for jobs with a target monthly income of 150,000 to 350,000 yuan. It usually takes 8-10 families to interview before we hear back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the nearly 10 families I interviewed, demand is generally concentrated in the five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou, and other scattered families are also scattered around these cities. Most of these families live in villas or large flats with an area of ​​more than 300 square meters, and are equipped with nannies, drivers, and housekeepers. Most of them are interviewed by the mother alone (only one family is attended by the father, who works to make money), and the father is not at home. Most of the needs of mothers require teachers to formulate work schedules and study plans, supervise their implementation, take their children to and from school and complete extracurricular homework. A small number of parents have competition needs. Families who understand psychology and education better will put forward requirements for developing children&#39;s intelligence and seizing the golden period of language development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, take the example of parents in a certain megacity. Both parents have master&#39;s degrees in Hong Kong. They have three children at home and live in a relatively remote villa group. Their grandparents live with them at home, and their mother stays with their children full time. The father travels between two cities every day and has little time to take care of his children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I took over the care of two children, the children were very proficient in English, studied in private schools, and had a wide range of interests. The 4-year-old boy A is the second child in this family. He likes fashionable cars. His mother will buy a whole wall of fashionable cars and related car picture books. When he sees me, he will say: &quot;Hi, teacher, I hope you like This motorcycle!&quot; The 7-year-old girl B is her elder sister. She likes painting and ballet. She has her own dance practice room and art studio in the basement, and has won rankings in large-scale competitions in nearby areas. In addition to attending classes every week, teachers need to accompany them to football classes, swimming classes, ballet classes and math competition classes on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This mother plans to use her child’s Hong Kong ID card in the future to allow her child to enter top universities in the mainland through the joint entrance examination, or to enter a prestigious Hong Kong university through DSE to study as an undergraduate. If I immigrate in the future, I will stay in the United States to study. I can advance or retreat. Therefore, children do not study hard in private schools and always feel that they are different from ordinary children and have a sense of superiority. It is obvious that the three children are emotionally healthy, lively and positive, love to say hello to others, have no stage fright, and are not afraid of difficulties. They live a carefree life every day and grow up healthily and safely in happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, primary school children still need a nanny to help them brush their teeth, wash their faces, and change their shoes every day. Their mothers also expect tutors to personally help their children clean up their house. From a psychological point of view, I think this will hinder the children to some extent. autonomous development. In May, I quit my job as a family escort and took a short break at home. A relative came to me: Are you interested in using your spare time to teach left-behind children? It doesn’t need to be all day, just three hours a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning the basic situation of the children, I readily agreed. My salary ranges from three to five thousand yuan, which can be said to have shrunk significantly. For the left-behind children, a lot of help is needed, and it must start from the most basic level. For example, I initially bought a math tutoring material for primary school to junior high school for girl C, who is in the first grade of junior high school, to help her transition to junior high school knowledge. But she doesn&#39;t know how to calculate fractions, 1/5+1/5, she calculates it to be equal to 1/10. After taking the quiz, I only got about 20 points. The reason was that the teacher said he was playful and lacked basic skills in elementary school. In my opinion, it is very likely that my mathematical intelligence has not been developed in the past few years. Now I have only begun to learn mathematical knowledge seriously at the age of 13. It is likely that I need step-by-step mathematical enlightenment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The left-behind children and I stayed with each other for a while. In terms of English, due to the lack of English teachers in rural primary schools, they have never learned English. Children A and B from high-end families are fully qualified to be their home teachers; they are very poor in mathematics; they have never read extracurricular books in Chinese. Due to financial constraints, I have never used a computer or become addicted to the Internet. Because my parents are not at home for a long time, I don’t get enough sleep, eat poorly, and are often listless. I don’t know how to make good use of tutoring time to interact with teachers, proactively ask questions and talk about my problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talk about the future with the mother of girl C. The child wants to transfer to a school near her, but that school is very poor and there are no cram schools nearby. &quot;Teacher, do you think my child is good at reading?&quot; My mother expressed her gratitude to me for giving her children inspirational books such as &quot;You Be Like a Bird Flying to Your Mountain&quot; to encourage her to learn more on her own. The girl&#39;s parents both graduated from high school. They are easy to talk to and are very concerned about their daughter&#39;s condition. They send me WeChat messages to chat with me every day and they have a very good attitude. The girl herself has no hobbies and doesn&#39;t like to talk. She has a small smart watch for calling her mother and a worn-out school bag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just after the Mid-Autumn Festival, a teacher from a local institution sent a box of mooncakes. After a closer look, I found that they had expired the next day. I originally wanted to share a few with the kids, but forget it. Whether it&#39;s a fashionable motorcycle or a mooncake that&#39;s about to expire, every life has its own flavor. Behind these two non-intersecting social classes is a new direction worthy of re-anchoring in my future scientific research life and application practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Family private information in the article has been blurred, any similarity is purely coincidental.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an undergraduate graduate of City University of Hong Kong)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(&quot;People in the Workplace&quot; of the &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of the Southern Weekend App. Welcome to write in to share your workplace opinions and complain about your workplace experiences. , break stereotypes and reveal industry rules.

This is the most significant revision of the Measures since it was promulgated in 1999 and individual provisions were modified in 2004. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, individual companies have deliberately declared and used names illegally, disrupting the market order and causing great concern... Some deliberately &#39;similar to famous brands&#39;, deliberately counterfeiting the names, abbreviations, etc. of central and state-owned enterprises, infringing on the legality of well-known units Rights and interests.&quot; mentioned in the interpretation of the new regulations issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2021, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council has announced three batches of lists of counterfeit central enterprises. The website of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council stated on August 26, 2023 that since July, according to incomplete statistics, there have been more than 20 The Central Enterprise Group issued a statement, announcing hundreds of counterfeit central enterprise names, unified social credit codes and other information, revealing illegal use of central enterprise names and logos, impersonating the identities of central enterprise cadres and employees, and developing and operating fake APPs. Southern Weekend made a detailed report on this (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents /252936?source=131&quot;>;Secrets of Thousands of Fake Central State-owned Enterprises: Buying an Identity with Millions, Fake Central SOEs Transformed into Group Companies&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/253625 ?source=131&quot;>;&quot;Manufacture&quot; fake central state-owned enterprises: Become a &quot;boss&quot; in a week, and you can change your vest even if you are investigated&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/255216? source=131&quot;>;The business strategy of a &quot;fake central enterprise&quot; in Yunnan: the operator of the 35 billion hydrogen production super project&lt;/a>;》.&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, in order to prevent In order to prevent illegal activities such as counterfeiting state-owned enterprises and central enterprises, the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; details the prohibitive provisions in the registration of enterprise names and explicitly prohibits the submission of false materials or other fraudulent means for independent declaration of enterprise names. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Automatic comparison, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Declaration system&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Internet&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; The requirements for corporate name specifications and independent declaration services are more detailed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Article 16 stipulates that corporate names must not “use words related to major national strategic policies, causing the public to mistakenly think that they are related to state investment, government credit, etc.” The names (including abbreviations, font sizes, etc.) of others who have a certain influence in the industry are the same or similar.&quot; &quot;It includes the names and trade names of central state-owned enterprises.&quot; Lawyer Han Shuai, a partner at Beijing Strategy Law Firm, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; also require that provincial enterprise registration authorities are responsible for establishing, managing and maintaining the enterprise name declaration system within their own administrative regions, and cooperating with the national enterprise name standardization management system and the national market supervision and management system. Connect with the enterprise name declaration system of the General Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an applicant declares a company name independently, the company name declaration system automatically compares the company name submitted by the applicant, and makes bans and restrictions based on the company name prohibition and restriction rules, identical and similar comparison rules, etc. Instructions or risk warnings. At the same time, the interconnected enterprise name declaration system can better compare enterprise names and effectively prevent the illegal registration of enterprise names by exploiting loopholes in cross-provincial information incompatibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, provinces and cities were not connected to each other. For example, if a central state-owned enterprise is registered in Province A, and you want to be associated with it in Province A, the system may screen it, but if it is in Province B or C Province, if you fake the background of a central state-owned enterprise in Province A, you may not be able to screen because you are not connected to the Internet.&quot; Han Shuai said that after being connected to the Internet, the authenticity, legality and validity of the materials submitted by the company can be more accurately reviewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Establish a random inspection system&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;an administrative adjudication mechanism for name disputes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For existing counterfeit central For state-owned enterprises, the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; also strengthened the supervision and management system, requiring the enterprise registration authority to find that the registered enterprise name does not comply with the relevant provisions of enterprise name registration management, it should make timely corrections in accordance with the law and order the enterprise to change its name. The enterprise registration authority at the higher level may correct the enterprise name that has been registered by the enterprise registration authority at the lower level and does not comply with the relevant provisions on enterprise name registration management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the State Administration for Market Regulation has established a spot inspection system to supervise and inspect the enterprise name registration management and enterprise name declaration services of provincial enterprise registration authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Shuai believes that the market supervision department regularly selects a certain proportion of company names for verification. It may be random, or it may be reported by relevant units or individuals. If it is found that there are counterfeit central state-owned enterprises and forged registration materials circumstances, they can be punished in accordance with the law and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another highlight is that the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; also improve the administrative adjudication mechanism for enterprise name disputes, clearly stipulate the considerations for dispute review, and refine the procedural provisions of the litigation process, including jurisdiction, application and the time limit and process for acceptance, dispute mediation mechanism, factors to be considered in review and processing, summary adjudication procedures, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Shuai introduced that there are usually three ways to protect the rights of central state-owned enterprises when they are counterfeited. In terms of administration, the first is to apply for the registration authority to make an administrative ruling; the second is to apply to the administrative authority to investigate and punish the unfair competition behavior of the infringing enterprise. At the judicial level, a lawsuit can be filed in the People&#39;s Court. The Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China also has relevant provisions on the protection of corporate names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Summary adjudication proceedings are now also possible. The &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; stipulate that for enterprise name disputes where the facts are clear, the dispute is not major, and the case is simple, the enterprise registration authority may apply summary adjudication procedures in accordance with relevant regulations. &quot;After the new regulations, how companies protect their rights has been designed more clearly, which improves administrative efficiency and helps companies resolve disputes.&quot; Han Shuai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[乾隆资助北美独立战争？封建帝王的眼界和见识不值得吹嘘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258644]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 16:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, a certain big V posted on Weibo saying: &quot;After the gunfire in Lexington, Emperor Qianlong should At the invitation of King Louis XVI of France, he funded the North American militia with 1,000 taels of gold... It turns out that the Qing Dynasty contributed a lot to the independence of the United States.&quot; In order to prove that what he said was true, the blogger also listed the sources of relevant historical materials: &quot;The Ministry of Internal Affairs Manufacturing Office File Volume 27. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qianlong, who has always been regarded as a man of great achievements and self-proclaimed, actually had such &quot;far-sightedness&quot; as &quot;joining France to support the United States and resisting the British and barbarians&quot;. This anecdote aroused the interest of many netizens, and many believed it to be true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this seemingly novel story is actually a very low-level rumor. The blogger listed the words in the so-called letter from Emperor Qianlong to King Louis XVI of France in the comment area, &quot;Bederi &quot;Use money and get wet with rain and dew&quot;, and based on this, he categorically claimed that Qianlong did not use treasury funds, but chose to use private funds to fund the North American militia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this sentence comes from the second sentence in the &quot;Emperor Qianlong&#39;s Edict to King George III of England&quot;. The original text is: &quot;The products of the Celestial Empire are abundant and everything is available. Originally, they did not borrow goods from foreign countries. Whether there is anything or not. Especially because the tea, porcelain, and silk produced by the Chinese dynasty are indispensable to Western countries and your country, so I showed my kindness and sympathy and opened a foreign business in Macao to provide daily necessities and make a profit.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, this passage has been cited by historians to explain that Emperor Qianlong in his later years was closed-minded and short-sighted, and was ignorant of the drastic changes in the external world. It is completely ridiculous that such a paragraph was cut off by the blogger and placed on the head of King Louis XVI of France to prove that Emperor Qianlong was a far-sighted strategist with an international vision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why so many netizens believe this crude &quot;wonder&quot; is not only because it is indeed a gimmick, but also because of the aura around Qianlong. So does this &quot;King of the Prosperous Age&quot; really have the kind of &quot;international vision&quot; that netizens believe? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Grandfathers who are not far apart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the Opium War, when Emperor Daoguang ordered Yijing to interrogate British prisoners, he asked him a series of ridiculous questions. It became a joke in history:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How far away is Kashmir (now Kashmir) from the country? Is there a waterway accessible? Does the country have any contact with the British? Why should we comply this time? To Zhejiang?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How many places are around this country? How many are there in the country it belongs to? How many are the most powerful and independent of the country&#39;s rulers? Is there a dry road from Yingjia to Huijiang? Are there any exchanges? Is there a border with Russia? Is there any trade connection?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, Daoguang, who was devastated by the war, could not understand the concept of &quot;world colonial empire&quot; at all. Although the old and shabby intelligence network left to him by his emperor Ama and his grandfather was still working, the intelligence they continued to send from Kyaktu, Manila and Kashgar about the &quot;British barbarians&quot; not only failed Asking him to figure out who his enemies were made the emperor even more confused. He couldn&#39;t understand why &quot;British barbarians&quot; appeared in all directions of the Qing Empire at the same time, so he asked whether there were any enemies in Britain and Xinjiang. There are issues such as being connected by dry road and whether it borders Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, these ridiculous questions asked by Emperor Daoguang are not worthy of ridicule. The vision and knowledge he displayed were only the normal level of the emperors of the Qing Dynasty. In terms of understanding the world as a whole, he is certainly not better than his father and grandfather, but he is not far behind. Because the system through which they receive education and the channels through which they perceive the outside world are essentially the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the world is changing too fast, the concept of &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&quot; is indeed a bit &quot;over the top&quot; for Emperor Daoguang. So Emperor Qianlong couldn&#39;t figure out where the two cities of Nerchinsk and Yaksa in the &quot;Treaty of Nerchinsk&quot; were, and whether they belonged to the Qing Dynasty or Russia. This only shows that the &quot;international vision&quot; of his grandfather and grandson was not far from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fifty-seventh year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1792), Emperor Qianlong ordered a letter to the then Heilongjiang General Mingliang: &quot;During the Kangxi Dynasty, in order to capture the cities of Yaksa and Nerchinsk, they fought with Russia for several years. The two cities are there. But are these two cities now under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang? If they are under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang, who will manage them and who will be stationed there? Send a message to the general and others so that Russia will not notice, quietly find out, and use a toilet Please do not make any announcement. Please accept this. Send a letter in compliance with the order.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Treaty of Nerchinsk&quot; was the first diplomatic treaty signed by the Qing Dynasty within the framework of the Westphalian order. , was also the first time the Qing Dynasty came into contact with the modern international diplomatic system. The treaty not only delineated the national boundaries between China and Russia in the east, but also demarcated the spheres of influence of China and Russia in Northeast Asia. It can be said that the signing of the Treaty of Nerchinsk was a crucial event in establishing the basic territory of the Qing Dynasty. However, a hundred years later, the supreme ruler had no idea where Nerchinsk and Yaksa were. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s even more interesting is that Emperor Qianlong’s idea of ​​​​solving this problem was not to retrieve the text of the Treaty of Nerchinsk for review, but to ask the Heilongjiang generals, and the Heilongjiang generals also discussed with Emperor Qianlong Similarly, he was completely confused about the location of Nerchinsk and Jaxar. Similarly, he did not check the treaty, but &quot;ordered people to check&quot; and reported to Qianlong. It can be seen that the emperor and his ministers did not take this crucial international treaty seriously. To them, the Battle of Yaksa was just a border conflict where &quot;foreigners were looking for trouble.&quot; The signing of the treaty was just a means to solve this minor trouble. It was not a code of conduct for the Qing Dynasty in diplomacy, and once the troubles were resolved, the treaty was shelved and completely forgotten over time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The established national policy of &quot;preventing internal affairs and financing external affairs&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This kind of indifference and ignorance of the outside world by the Qing monarchs and ministers actually came from the political tradition and political tradition of the ancient autocratic emperors of &quot;preventing internal affairs and financing external affairs&quot; With established national policies, they always believed that the source of their core interests was not outside the empire, but that factors that could threaten and shake their rule were within the empire. Foreigners come from afar, and even if they are tyrannical for a while, in the final analysis they are people without roots. As long as they win over them from the massive benefits obtained from squeezing their own people, they will be able to live in peace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, it is entirely possible for the nationals of this country to repeat their path to power and threaten their rule. This kind of political tradition and established decision-making determines that the attention of autocratic kings, including the emperors of the Qing Dynasty, is always inward and not outward. Therefore, when some of them, such as Emperors Kangxi and Qianlong, occasionally became interested in some &quot;strange skills and tricks&quot; in the outside world, it was only as personal hobbies and pastimes. These hobbies and pastimes could neither change their views on The way they perceive the world makes it even less likely that they will have an &quot;international perspective.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most typical example is that during the Qianlong period, Zheng Xin, a Chinese military leader in Southeast Asia, seized power in Siam during the war and requested for canonization from the Qing Dynasty. From an international political perspective, this was a An excellent strategic opportunity, the Qing Dynasty may gain a firm and reliable ally and strategic fulcrum in Southeast Asia, and once and for all eliminate the threat from Myanmar to the Qing Dynasty&#39;s southern border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Emperor Qianlong&#39;s response to this opportunity was: &quot;(Zheng Xinhe) The king of Siam should be a monarch and his ministers. Now that the country is in ruins and people are perishing, they dare to take advantage of the crisis and no longer care about it. Therefore, he asked his descendants to restore the country and take revenge, and he often thought of self-reliance, and he wanted to grant the imperial edict in vain, thinking that it was a great contract, but it was actually an act that violated the rules and violated the rules.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, Zheng Xin&#39;s act of taking advantage of the chaos and seizing power in Siam as a courtier reminded Emperor Qianlong of the story of the founder of the Qing Dynasty who took advantage of the chaos and robbed the world as a courtier of the Ming Dynasty. He was worried that accepting Zheng Xin&#39;s regime would threaten the Qing Dynasty. The legitimacy of the founding of the country thus gave rise to feelings of disgust and rejection. It can be seen that the thinking mode of an autocratic emperor always comes first to consolidate his rule internally. In this case, how can there be any talk of &quot;international vision&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier in the fifth year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1740), the Nanyang Chinese, who had been oppressed by the Dutch colonists, rose up in resistance in Indonesia and were massacred by the Dutch colonists on the banks of the Red Creek outside Batavia. Nearly 10,000 overseas Chinese died. After some discussions between the Qing emperors and ministers, they came to the conclusion that &quot;(the Chinese who were killed) were originally native to that place and were no different from the Ban people.&quot; Emperor Qianlong finally approved the disposal plan that &quot;the Bans in Nanyang are still allowed to trade as usual.&quot; Nothing happened and no sanctions of any kind were imposed on the Dutch colonists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above historical facts show that what makes an autocratic king truly superb is his internal skills of protecting, governing, weakening and exhausting the people. To brag about the vision and knowledge of an autocratic king is obviously a lie. It would be even more stupid to misdirect their efforts and spread rumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[复旦人体科学馆馆长：与标本“交谈”，让人体不再神秘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258640]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/15/XcjddVb9DUbrdQ7P2UiaoVzt3pUZ4emkQcuY9TuQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/XcjddVb9DUbrdQ7P2UiaoVzt3pUZ4emkQ cuY9TuQ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Guomin often personally introduces visitors, and volunteers do so when he is in class or out. Visitors explain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A human science museum hidden in the Fenglin Campus of Fudan University has become popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people came here after reading Xiaohongshu and Dianping. Everyone is curious about how a place displaying human specimens has become a &#39;niche check-in place&#39; and an &#39;Internet celebrity museum&#39;.&quot; In order to Not to miss every consultation call, director Zhou Guomin specially bound the landline of the science museum to his mobile phone number. Therefore, Zhou Guomin&#39;s mobile phone almost never stopped ringing throughout the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What few visitors know is that being the curator of the Human Science Museum is just one of Zhou Guomin’s many jobs. He served as the head of the Department of Anatomy and Histoembryology at Fudan University School of Basic Medicine for nearly two decades. , at the beginning of the fall semester of 2023, he will also be responsible for teaching more than 20 class hours/week, and he also has many anatomy-related positions and titles outside the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year is my tenth year at the Human Body Science Museum. I also want to do a better job in popularizing science and discover more stories so that ordinary people can feel the warmth of medicine.” Zhou Guomin said to the South reporters said over the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is compiled based on the dictation of Professor Zhou Guomin:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;Tell children how new life is born&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;Although the Human Science Museum is small, it has a long history and a rich collection, such as tissue sections labeled with Yenching University, a micromanipulator produced in Germany in 1930, a complete skeleton and whole-body plastinated specimens. But the most conspicuous place upon entering is the baby specimen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1944, Professor Yan Fuqing’s daughter-in-law gave birth to a pair of twin baby girls, who died due to premature birth. For a long time, Chinese people have believed that &quot;the deceased is the most important&quot; and there are few body donors. However, Yan Fuqing selflessly donated the bodies of his relatives to medical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/aruBfaepCDnnJMJ5gjgYQiBs6u5QTNFXISupbcvd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/aruBfaepCDnnJMJ5gjgYQiBs6u5QTNFXISupbcvd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254081&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 9, 2023, Zhou Guomin introduced the specimens of twin baby girls to visitors and the story behind the specimens. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Fuqing is the former National Shanghai Medical College (the predecessor of Fudan University Shanghai Medical College) and the Chinese Medical Association The founder of the company is known as the &quot;Father of Modern Chinese Medicine&quot;. For nearly eighty years, these baby girls have been studied and admired by generations of medical students, and are now placed where they can be seen at first sight when entering the museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Fuqing’s grandson Yan Zhiyuan is also studying and working in medicine. Similar to his sister, he is also a twin, but his brother unfortunately died at birth. In order to fulfill his grandfather&#39;s last wish, Yan Zhiyuan decided to donate his body to his alma mater for autopsy after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some baby specimens in the Human Science Museum with brain malformations, which are very distressing to see. This was actually because some pregnant women at that time lacked necessary vitamins, resulting in poor fetal brain development. Later, after folic acid supplementation was advocated, the incidence of fetal brain malformations was greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the people who visit the Human Body Science Museum are parents who bring their children to learn about human body science. I like to tell children how new life is born, starting with the production of sperm and eggs. Every child is a champion, healthy, strong, hard-working, living in the dream palace provided by his mother, and comes into this world with love and hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many doctors are working hard for the birth of new life. If any of these interested children are willing to engage in medicine in the future, I will be even happier. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Both an &quot;alumni&quot; and a &quot;mentor&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Every time a visitor comes, I want to ask them where they come from and why they think of it. Gotta visit this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Shanghai’s museum resources are really rich, and the name of the Human Body Science Museum seems a bit scary at first glance, but they come all the way here and have to make an appointment to enter the school, which is more cumbersome; On the one hand, I am also looking for potential connections between visitors and this pavilion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the visitors, some are engaged in medical-related work themselves, some have relatives who are ill and are seeking treatment in nearby hospitals, and they come to visit and study while accompanying them, and some want to learn about body donation. A visitor surnamed Wu once added me on WeChat to learn how to donate a body to his seriously ill mother, which was her mother’s wish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who studies medicine knows that without corpses, there would be no anatomy, and without anatomy, there would be no modern medicine. Without visible and tangible human specimens, it would be difficult for medical schools to train excellent doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we are full of respect for body donors and call them body teachers. These general teachers are both our &quot;alumni&quot; and &quot;mentors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, I have been collecting older body donation certificates. There are many application and volunteer forms from the 1980s and 1990s taped to one wall in the museum. The papers have turned yellow, but the handwriting is still beautiful and clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest note that can be found is on September 23, 1981. An old man named Zhao Leshi expressed his willingness to contribute his body to the cause of medical science after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/1UFIGjNIY2RPt6417kNBRkbOgxLLYYV6m1FDoNcT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/1UFIGjNIY2RPt6417kNBRkbOgxLLYYV6m1FDoNcT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254084&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The earliest body donation record that can be found was on September 23, 1981.

There were no telephones at that time. Now can I find the relatives of these early donors and express my gratitude to the doctors? If their family members knew that the name of Teacher Da Ti had been engraved on the monument in Fushou Garden in Shanghai, would they want to pay homage to the deceased and tell them about the pain of separation for thirty or forty years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have found one, and I hope to find more in the future and record the story of Teacher DaTi. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Science popularization should also be innovative and interesting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For many people, the body is like a blind box. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The onset of the COVID-19 epidemic has made everyone more concerned about their health and more willing to understand their bodies. For example, people know that infection with pneumonia may lead to &quot;white lungs.&quot; Look at the male anatomy teacher in the corner. His lungs are black and gray. This &quot;black lung&quot; is caused by smoking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudan University has always had a tradition of attaching importance to science popularization. In 2013, the school allocated millions of yuan in special funds to carry out large-scale reconstruction and upgrade of the two original exhibition halls (referring to the Human Science Museum and the Pathological Specimen Museum, founded in the 1930s). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called collections and treasures of the museum are of course important, but I care more about everyone’s experience of coming to this exhibition hall. In addition to various microscopes, we also introduced VR, 3D printing, digital human systems and other equipment to enhance the sense of technology and interactive experience. Some children lingered and came several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to popularize science more interestingly, we have also engaged in several cross-border cooperations. Currently going on is &quot;Open Your Blind Box - Human Anatomy Art Exhibition&quot;, where the creators combine medicine and art. After the opening, the number of visitors who made reservations online increased significantly, and some people came specifically for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/n9Kvb9iJFI4HrfBABGoZDm5i6mOZaYDDAwc40BVW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/n9Kvb9iJFI4HrfBABGoZDm5i6mOZaYDDAwc40BVW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254083&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In April 2023, the &quot;Open Your Blind Box - Human Anatomy Art Exhibition&quot; at the Human Science Museum of Fudan University officially opened. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine painting each bone with colorful patterns such as giraffes and Garden of Eden. A blood vessel or nerve can have different colors. Each specimen is sketched with a black pen to form a volume of pictures. At this moment, the human body becomes no longer mysterious and becomes more exciting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that the same object and the observation perspectives of different disciplines and fields will bring different discoveries and experiences. Art is the constant experimentation and innovation of viewing angles. More importantly, art can give people the courage to observe from conventional angles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旋转的白森林]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/CDGLWAR98C8pWtIuxfWnkE9P6QN98wHniNqZbJhv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/CDGLWAR98C8pWtIuxfWnkE9P6QN98wHniN qZbJhv. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Grassland Sky Road Observation Deck&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All things are one and connected to each other. The signs appear, but their meaning is difficult to decipher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I spent the whole morning roaming in the wilderness. On the rolling hills, oats and sunflowers sway in the wind, waiting to be harvested. Autumn has come to Zhangbei grassland again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under a cement pole, I took off my backpack and sat down to rest. It&#39;s quiet around here. Occasionally a car would pass by silently on the road in the distance. Listen carefully to the hum of wind turbines grinding the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number &quot;76&quot; is affixed to the pole. This number has special meaning to me - the birthday of a close relative. A few black feathers and a dried neck bone were scattered on the grass. Seven years ago today, I was driving her on the highway and killed a magpie. The night before, she slept in an orchard near the China-North Korea border and had a nightmare - an eye stared at her in the night sky. After waking up, she heard a woman crying all night on the mountain - an eagle owl was crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2R802a1KiPtLOBbZJKzTQcIEW7CBNMyaP8HyiAaN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;362&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2R802a1KiPtLOBbZJKzTQcIEW7CBNMyaP8HyiAaN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mature sunflowers&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the hill Opera and the sound of tractors came from the villages. I looked away from the feathers. The village square became a threshing floor, and shelled oats were spread on the cement floor like kraft paper. Oats like cold, tolerate drought, and are resistant to salt and alkali. They have been cultivated by Guansai border people since ancient times. They are easy to feel full after eating and difficult to digest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I passed a poplar forest and faintly smelled the scent of sheep. There are a group of sheep in the forest, heads gathering together, as if they are performing some kind of silent ceremony. I sneaked into the woods quietly, fearing to disturb them. Unexpectedly, the owner of the sheep suddenly appeared and startled me. A woman wearing pink sneakers holds a mobile phone and a whip in her hands, and a baseball cap on her head is embroidered with the Chanel logo. I asked her what the sheep were doing together, and she said they didn&#39;t like to move when they were full. I said: There are thirty of them, right? She said there were more than seventy of them, clustered in a pile so they couldn’t be counted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;White impeller, circular pointer. Rotating, without beginning or end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/jvmN7nZl3VkQS06XfxjZbn4bpxBAThbh1jGDRrSj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/jvmN7nZl3VkQS06XfxjZbn4bpxBAThbh1jGDRrSj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253668&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Oats waiting to be harvested&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wan On the winding country road, I met another shepherd. He was old and walked slowly. He was leaning on a dead branch in his left hand and holding a ewe in his right hand. The ewe has a stubborn character and keeps wrestling with the old man, trying to break free. The reins connecting them are stretched straight. The old man told me that he went to his daughter&#39;s house in a neighboring village to tend sheep early in the morning. The ewe was two years old and had given birth to two litters of two lambs. One lamb was sold for six hundred. The ewe seemed to be eavesdropping on our conversation, nibbling on the sunflower trays on the roadside and looking at us sideways with her yellow eyes. The old man tightened the reins again and made another circle in his hand. He wore several layers of clothes, and his red baseball cap was embroidered with the logo - ×× Fertilizer. &quot;It will take an hour until we get home,&quot; he put the tip of his tongue against his sunken lips, with a hint of complaint in his tone, &quot;I forgot to put on my dentures when I went out, and my daughter stayed to eat...&quot; I glanced at his dark mouth, with only the lower gums remaining. A loose crooked tooth is like a stone monument in the dark night. I think of another &quot;mouth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/i3VIfLsnnkMqtKL9vctv3GvstFEtBAhv7dzQi5pi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;359&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/i3VIfLsnnkMqtKL9vctv3GvstFEtBAhv7dzQi5pi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253676&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the poplar forest, well-fed sheep&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The autumn wilderness is colorful and full of temptation. Not long after driving out of Zhangbei County, I couldn&#39;t wait to leave the main road and drove toward the distant hills, dragging the yellow dust cloud behind the car. Went around several old elm trees covered with moss, turned two turns, and finally reached a plateau. A van was parked next to a wheat field, with black film on the windows and half-open side windshield of the cab, without a driver. The view here is wide and unobstructed: countless white windmills are spinning lazily; harvesters are raising puffs of dust and smoke in the wheat fields; a box of &quot;Gatling&quot; fireworks tubes are lying quietly on the grass after being discharged. Accompanying them are drink bottles, cigarette boxes, grocery bags and tissues with lip gloss stuck on them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The van started suddenly, turned around suddenly, and drove towards the road at an unusual speed. After the van drove away, I noticed that there was a commanding point on the high ground - a hill covered with grass. The hills are surrounded by wheat fields. I stepped over the wheat stubble and patrolled around the mountains. The locusts in the fields were flying like shrapnel. This is an &quot;artificial mountain&quot; about 4 meters high and nearly 8 meters in diameter. The moment I climbed to the top of the mountain, I was glad I stopped in time. There is a hole the size of a wellhead in the middle of the top of the mountain. The entrance of the cave is circular, and the cave wall gradually becomes a trapezoid as it goes down. When it is close to the ground, the tunnel turns into a side cave. The hole was dug cleanly, with no residual soil around it. The entrance of the cave is like an open mouth, shouting silently towards the sky. I turned up my collar and carefully walked down the hill.

They lower their heads in the forest, pick mushrooms, and shoot videos; groups of well-fed Dauri jackdaws sit on the roadside wires, chattering and quarreling.

I stood there, holding the telescope and not daring to move. Between the loss of focus and the pursuit of focus, I stared at this unpredictable gray-white elf with almost no blinking.

After climbing two hills in a row, I saw the scenery behind the mountains - a basin as big as a playground that was very different from the surroundings. The flat ground was covered with a layer of black stone chips that looked like volcanic ash, and there was no grass growing on it. A strange circular rut appears in the center of the basin. On a collapsed cliff, a wall made of masonry and reinforced concrete was exposed. I looked around and saw no other buildings except the towering windmill. I guess the purpose of this place is: mining factory, school, pasture, experimental base...it seems none of them. Another possibility suddenly occurred to me - fortifications. In the 1960s, Sino-Soviet relations broke down. In order to prevent a large-scale invasion by the Soviet Union, our country built a large number of defense fortifications along the borders of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Fortunately, a large-scale war did not break out, and the useless fortifications gradually turned into historical relics that no one cared about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I regret not bringing a tent with me on this trip. This is an ideal camping spot. Open, hidden, leeward, silent, the surrounding scene is shrouded in a mysterious science fiction color. Funnel spiders swung back and forth between the rocks, searching for joints; ant ants dragged the dying wasps forward; white butterflies stood on the porous basalt and fluttered their wings. Every life is the crystallization of billions of years. A blue pebble shaped like a snake egg jumped into sight. After examining it, I knocked it against a rock. Miraculously, the 3 mm-thick &quot;eggshell&quot; split into two and fell off completely. There was a hard stone heart hidden inside, as black as a crow&#39;s feathers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/eOSVuWtlfvdRqjTWJnDAhRPPxmyLunqGyGM0vdMl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/eOSVuWtlfvdRqjTWJnDAhRPPxmyLunqGyGM0vdMl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253673&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xiang Road Station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rotating white Paddle, the wind catcher of all seasons.

The large green spaces behind the shops along the street are also enclosed into courtyards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are constant disputes between shop owners and villa neighbors over the ownership of this green space. Some villa owners claim that this green space is the &quot;backyard&quot; listed on the property certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, Lu Caiyun and other shop owners have repeatedly complained to Hefei City Letters and Calls Bureau, Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, High-tech Zone Management Committee, High-tech Zone Shulu Community Service Center and other departments. Until 2022, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center admitted that the contents of the real estate certificates of villa owners were incorrect and needed to be updated. In May 2023, the mayor&#39;s mailbox replied that the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau had identified the &quot;backyard&quot; as an illegal construction in accordance with the law. But so far, these &quot;backyards&quot; have not been demolished.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Businesses represented by Lu Caiyun wrote in the complaint letter: &quot;Repeated visits to the same problem have not only consumed a lot of government resources, but also affected the public health. We live a normal life. The relevant departments have also admitted their mistakes, and the facts are very clear. When will it be resolved?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public green space has been included in the private property certificate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;Xuhuihushanyuanzuo Community is located on Fushan Road, High-tech Zone, Hefei City. In 2016, Lu Caiyun purchased a street shop in the community and opened a Chinese restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to her recollection, after the shop was delivered, she installed the outdoor air conditioner on the south wall near the villa in accordance with the property management requirements. At that time, no one was living in the villa behind the south wall. The area between the two was planted with green plants and there was a stone road for people to pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, due to a malfunction of the air conditioner in the store, maintenance personnel needed to repair the outdoor unit of the air conditioner. At this time, the area between the shop and the villa has become the private garden of the villa area, and the south wall of the shop has become the &quot;wall&quot; of the garden. With the coordination of neighborhood committee staff, Lu Caiyun was able to enter her neighbor&#39;s &quot;garden&quot; to repair the air conditioner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Caiyun is not the only one who has disputes with the owners of villas because of the open space behind the shop. As early as 2018, some shop owners discovered that the vacant land had been turned into villa courtyards, and the east and west sides were blocked by walls, which seriously affected the use of the shops. They sued the developer Xuhui Group Co., Ltd., demanding that the 7-meter-wide space behind the shops be restored. Public land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shop owners lost both cases. However, according to the second-instance judgment (2019) Anhui 01 Minzhong No. 4059, the evidence provided by the shop owners in the second-instance trial showed that the open space between the shops and the villa area was green space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Basic Terminology Standards for Urban Planning&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Construction (later changed to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development) states that green spaces refer to urban areas specifically used to improve ecology, protect the environment, and provide recreational areas for residents. and landscaping landscaping. The developer recognized this and stated that the actual construction was also constructed in accordance with the requirements of the green space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general layout plan of the Xuhui Lake Shanyuan Project approved by the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau provided by Lu Caiyun can also support this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan map shows that there is a passage between the S5 commercial area where the shops are located and the villa area. There are clearly illustrations of multiple plants on the map, indicating that this is a green space in the residential area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 274 of the Civil Code stipulates that green spaces within building zones belong to the owners, except those that belong to urban public green spaces or that are expressly owned by individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Encyclopedia of Applications of the Chinese Civil Code (Property Rights Volume)&quot; compiled by the Leading Group for the Implementation of the Civil Code of the Supreme People&#39;s Court further explains: Roads and green spaces within building zones are usually owned by the owners. According to the legal theory of divided ownership of buildings, the roads and green spaces within the building zone belong to the common supporting facilities in the common property of the community. Under special circumstances, certain roads and green spaces within the building zone are not shared by the owners. As for the green space that is expressly owned by individuals, it mostly refers to the green space in front of the window of a first-floor building unit or the green space in a specific area adjacent to the building, and this part of the green space needs to be clearly sold together with the exclusive part of the building in the commercial housing sales contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the originally planned green space was divided into courtyards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since May 2018, 25 shop owners, including Lu Caiyun, have repeatedly reported to the Hefei High-tech Zone Shulu Community Service Center, the High-tech Zone Management Committee, the Hefei Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, and the Municipal Government. The Complaints Bureau, the Mayor&#39;s Mailbox and other departments reported that the owners of more than 20 villas in Buildings C55, C56 and C57 had occupied green space (8 households in one building) and set up private basements. Some of the problems were solved, but there has been no substantial progress in the encroachment of green space. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local media reported that the owner of the villa produced a property certificate, which stated that the land was indeed his backyard. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to contact the owner of the villa. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Multiple consultations failed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the then Party Secretary of Shulu Community Service Center in Hefei High-tech Zone was interviewed by local official media It said that Lu Caiyun submitted materials to the community on June 9, 2020, reflecting the problem of encroachment on public areas. After receiving the report, community staff went to the developer’s Shanghai headquarters to interview him and required the developer to respond within 3 months. Areas related to public access were set back, and the developer also signed a letter of commitment in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, because the developer failed to fulfill its concession promise, the community and urban management bureau planned to demolish the illegal building in the villa. However, the owner of the villa showed the property certificate on the spot, which contained the word &quot;backyard&quot;. area. Out of respect for legal and valid documents, the community temporarily suspended the demolition. At the same time, the Hefei Municipal Party Committee inspection team present was also aware of the situation and stated that it would investigate issues related to the real estate certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the problem could not be resolved, Lu Caiyun and others complained to the Anhui Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau in November 2021, requesting to find out why the green space was registered in the property certificates of more than 20 villa owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22 of that year, the Anhui Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau stated in a return visit that the Hefei Real Estate Registration Department had teamed up with relevant departments to investigate and verify the marking of the community’s personal property rights certificates, and was currently studying and handling opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 16, 2022, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center also issued an announcement requiring the owner of the villa involved to correct the real estate certificate. The announcement stated that according to Article 81 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Interim Regulations on Real Estate Registration&quot;, because the owners of Buildings C55, C56 and C57 of Hushan Yuanzuo Community have incorrect content in the real estate certificates, they need to wait until they receive the notice. Change the registration and renew the real estate certificate within 30 working days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the fact that the green space is occupied has not changed. On May 9, 2023, Lu Caiyun once again reported the situation to the mayor of Hefei’s mailbox. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 23, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center responded, saying that based on the previous request of city leaders during the interview, the High-tech Zone Management Committee organized an inspection of Buildings C55 and C56 of Xuhui Lake Shanyuan Building. An investigation into illegal construction was launched in the north yard of Building C and Building C57. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, in response to the illegal construction of fences that encroach on public green space and other issues, the Urban Management Bureau of the High-tech Zone has submitted investigation materials on the illegal construction of fences in some buildings to the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau for identification of illegal construction. , Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau has determined it to be an illegal construction in accordance with the law, and the High-tech Zone Urban Management Bureau is handling it in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Caiyun said that they still don’t know the handling of the property certificates that were previously registered incorrectly, and there are no signs that the villa owner’s garden will be demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend contacted Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau and Hefei Real Estate Registration Center many times, but received no positive response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Linxi Community of Shulu Community Service Center. The staff informed, “The community and self-regulatory bureau, the real estate registration center and the villa owners have negotiated many times to no avail, and it is difficult to Promote the demolition of illegal constructions.&quot; In addition, according to his understanding, the property certificate of the villa owner has been corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters checked the relevant regulations and found no clause that requires the consent of the illegal builders to demolish illegal buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the Urban Management Squadron of Shulu Center of Hefei High-tech Zone. The staff said that they were already going through law enforcement procedures against the courtyard walls built privately by the villa owners. “Previously, Use drones to take photos and collect evidence, and after the planning department approves it, the parties will be allowed to dismantle it by themselves within a time limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 13:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲突又起，中东“和解大潮”难再续？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258634]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 11:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, 2023, local time, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) launched an attack on Israel in recent years. The Israeli Defense Forces launched the largest rocket attack in the country, sent a large number of militants into southern Israel, and broke out in street battles with Israeli security forces. The Israel Defense Forces quickly launched a counterattack and launched a &quot;comprehensive siege&quot; of Gaza. The situation between Palestine and Israel suddenly escalated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has aroused widespread attention and concern from the international community due to its sudden outbreak and the huge casualties it caused. It is in sharp contrast to the &quot;reconciliation trend&quot; in the Middle East this year. It reveals the complexity and variability of the Middle East issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The intensity of the conflict is limited&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, this round of conflicts has more obvious high-intensity characteristics, as well as the amplification effect of war news in the Internet era, causing It has raised people&#39;s concerns about whether the sixth Middle East war will break out, but at present, it is highly likely that the scope of this round of conflict will be limited to Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries surrounding Palestine do not have sufficient motivation or reason to go to war with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, Egypt’s economy has continued to slump due to the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Exporting natural gas to Europe through the Arab Gas Pipeline and Israel’s Leviathan Gas Field has become an important channel for earning foreign exchange income. At this time, if Egypt is at odds with Israel, its economic development will undoubtedly fall into huge difficulties; Syria, in the north of Pakistan, is in jail, and its limited resources will also be prioritized for domestic economic reconstruction; Lebanon is experiencing a severe economic and financial crisis, and there is no are willing to participate in the war; the Gulf Arab countries with strong economic and military strength should only provide moral support and humanitarian assistance to Palestine as long as their core interests are not affected; Fatah, which represents the legitimate Palestinian regime, chooses I watched from the sidelines. Therefore, without the actual participation of other sovereign states, this round of conflict will eventually return to become a stage in the spiral evolution of Palestinian-Israeli relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Infinite Vicious Circle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The conflict between Israel and Palestine continues. To be precise, it is a confrontation with the radical factions dominated by Hamas. It is the inevitable result of the long-term deterioration of the relationship between the two parties, and the explosive manifestation of crossing the critical point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, surrounding issues such as Palestine&#39;s pursuit of statehood, the &quot;legalization&quot; of Jewish settlements, and the competition for holy sites, the tense situation between Palestine and Israel has never changed, and has even become more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since January 2023, the conflict between Palestine and Israel in Jerusalem has continued to intensify. The Israeli military and police have repeatedly forcibly expelled Palestinian residents near the Al-Aqsa Mosque; in early July, the Israeli military carried out A large-scale military operation was launched in the Jenin region, causing a large number of casualties and displacement of Palestinians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Radical factions such as Hamas and Jihad, which firmly advocate armed struggle, continue to promote the spread and expansion of their political and military power, causing the Palestinian-Israeli relationship to gradually deepen into an infinite vicious cycle of &quot;reacting violence with violence&quot; , and laid hidden dangers for larger-scale conflicts and crises that may occur in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Against the background of extremely disparity in power between the two sides, the living space of the Palestinian people has been continuously compressed. The Gaza Strip has been under strict blockade and surveillance by the Israeli military for a long time, and the population density has reached approximately 10,000 people per square meter. kilometer. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) statistical report, 57% of households in the Gaza Strip have experienced a significant decrease in income in 2022, the local unemployment rate has increased by 49%, and 65% of the population is in poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The continued economic downturn has brought infrastructure construction in the Gaza Strip to almost a standstill. When former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Gaza, he said that Israel&#39;s policy of blocking Gaza was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the relations between Arab countries and Israel have become increasingly easing, especially the recent continuous exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the possibility of even reaching a peace agreement, the Palestinians&#39; insecurity has been infinitely magnified. As the Palestinian issue becomes increasingly marginalized, the Palestinians have no choice but to rely on their own strength to survive. At the same time, the continued inaction of the Palestinian Authority, which legally represents Palestinian sovereignty, has actually created more public support for Hamas within Palestine, making it a &quot;firm defender&quot; of Palestinian national consciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, the current conflict between Pakistan and Israel is also the product of the collision between long-term conflicts that have not been resolved and changes in the game situation inside and outside the region. In fact, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been experiencing cyclical ups and downs since its existence, which makes it almost impossible to achieve a lasting and fair solution. The call for national self-determination and the restoration of legitimate rights and interests has been circulated among generations of Palestinians. As Israel&#39;s &quot;most right-wing government&quot; comes to power, the way Israel and Palestinian radical factions get along will also be full of violence and hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly complex&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the short term, this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict will still have a greater impact on peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, and at the same time promote The game relationship between the various forces has undergone a series of changes. It is worth noting that the various conflicts in the region and the intricate interest relationships between countries determine the impact of this incident on the Middle East and even the world, and will not be presented in a simple linear rise or fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the reconciliation process between the Arab-Islamic world and Israel will enter a state of suspension or even regression in the short term. On October 10, local time, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said when answering a call from Palestinian President Abbas that Saudi Arabia will continue to support the Palestinians in realizing their legitimate rights, which means that the Saudi-Israeli reconciliation process has attracted much attention. It has been &quot;temporarily terminated&quot;; as Iran announced its support for Hamas&#39;s actions in Israel, its relations with Israel will also fall &quot;below the freezing point&quot;. Although Turkey will actively play the role of mediator between Israel and Palestinian forces , but it is almost impossible for its relationship with Israel to return to its original state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the reconciliation process within the Arab world will be accelerated, and Palestinian affairs may become the glue to curb the &quot;fragmentation&quot; of the Arab world. In the past few months, as the crisis of Qatar&#39;s severance of diplomatic relations has been completely resolved, and Syria has returned to the Arab League family, there is a glimmer of an end to the divisions and internal strife that have lasted for more than ten years in the Arab world after the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. Under this situation, the Arab world&#39;s political sympathy for Palestine will further promote the ill-fated Arab countries to unite and strengthen themselves, and give them the spiritual motivation to achieve true strategic independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the main contradictions in the Middle East may change. In the past few decades, the contradictions between Arab Islamic countries and Israel, the contradictions between Sunni and Shia forces, and the contradictions between regional countries and external interference forces have intertwined and superimposed, thus shaping the current geopolitical pattern of the Middle East— —Changes in the structural proportions of any set of contradictions will rewrite the geopolitical demands of the relevant forces. Against the dual background of the Saudi-Iranian reconciliation and the continued strategic contraction of the United States in the Middle East, this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict will undoubtedly further highlight the contradictions between Arab Islamic countries and Israel, resulting in a series of chain reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to the conflict itself, whether it is Hamas armed raids on Israeli targets or Israel&#39;s violent counterattacks with revenge, it has caused huge casualties and economic and property losses to both sides - a large number of Israeli hostages Being hijacked by Hamas affects the nervousness of Israeli residents. At the same time, the Gaza Strip&#39;s only power plant ceased operations due to Israeli bombing and siege, which also means that despair will spread to every street in the area. However, hatred and violence can never fundamentally solve the problem. It is difficult for both Palestine and Israel to make concessions to each other on issues involving their core interests. The Palestine-Israel issue may become even more difficult in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an associate researcher at the Economic, Trade and Industry Investment Research Center of the Mediterranean Research Institute of Zhejiang International Studies University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国籍女子在新加坡被控罪：入乡应随法，别搞“舆论化妆师”那一套丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258632]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 10:47:05&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to Singapore&#39;s &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; report, a Chinese woman was suspected of being hit by a driver and injured her foot. While receiving medical treatment at the Central Hospital, he allegedly insulted a nurse and refused to cooperate with the police in taking a statement. In addition, he was suspected of verbally abusing a security guard earlier. He was charged with six counts, including one count of public nuisance, two counts of contravening the Prevention of Harassment Act, and three counts. One count of contravening the Private Security Industry Act. If convicted, the woman involved may face a penalty of &quot;a fine of up to 7,500 yuan, or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter is not complicated and the facts are clear. In the early morning of October 10, the woman involved went to the emergency room of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to seek medical treatment. She said that she was hit by a substitute driver and requested rapid treatment. The medical staff noticed that she was not wearing a mask, so they handed it to her and reminded her that she must wear a mask in the hospital. Not only did the woman refuse to cooperate, she cursed and insulted the nurse, complaining that she had &quot;waited for three hours.&quot; The hospital had no choice but to call the police, who sent police officers and investigators to the hospital to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the video released by the woman involved, she not only refused to cooperate in recording a confession and let the investigator &quot;guess&quot;, but also changed the topic many times, accusing the nurse of discriminating against her, and also swore at the investigator. , and tried to pull the ID of an investigator, but was firmly stopped by the latter. According to an announcement from the Singapore police, the woman in question even had a criminal record. On October 3, she was drunk, pushed and pulled the security guard who sent her home, and used insulting and abusive language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prosecution pointed out in court on October 13 that if the defendant intends to plead guilty, they will conduct a trial on four of the charges, and the remaining two charges will be taken into consideration by the judge when sentencing. The defendant directly said, &quot;I plead guilty and I apologize.&quot; When the judge asked the defendant whether he would hire a lawyer, the defendant asked if he could get a lighter sentence by pleading guilty early without hiring a lawyer. The judge explained that pleading guilty early would help mitigate the crime. The defendant expressed his understanding, and the judge postponed the case to October 25 and approved her bail of 15,000 Singapore dollars. In addition to the bail, a Singaporean citizen was required to vouch for her. From the news, it seemed that no one came forward to vouch for her, but she was taken back to the police station&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case seemed to be a trivial matter, but it turned out to be more and more troublesome. Not only are the legal consequences extremely serious, but the public opinion effect can also be called &quot;full of influence&quot;. After carefully examining the timeline of this case from the incident to the aftermath, the words and deeds of the woman involved are a living lesson in the rule of law, worthy of analysis and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the words and deeds of the woman involved during the incident may have been &quot;scripted&quot; in advance, but they hit a brick wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question refused to obey hospital regulations, did not wear a mask, and was impatient to wait for medical treatment. This is all true; shouting obscenities at the nurse was her intention to vent and engage in emotional blackmail. ; When facing investigators, she denied and insisted that &quot;the nurse discriminated against her&quot;, hoping to &quot;preemptively draw a portrait&quot; to take the initiative in public opinion; recording the video and publishing it on social media was also intended to launch a public opinion offensive to influence the judiciary and escape punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the investigator acted strictly in accordance with the law and stated that the trip was only to investigate &quot;whether the woman in question swore at the nurse.&quot; At the same time, the investigator warned the woman in question three times not to record the video. Facing the investigator&#39;s official business, the woman involved not only ignored him, but also had an extremely arrogant attitude. While speaking incoherently and swearing again, she also made hilarious remarks such as &quot;please bring all the police in Singapore here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case has aroused a lot of resonance in the domestic public opinion field. &quot;Distorting facts,&quot; &quot;preempting portraits,&quot; and &quot;recording videos and posting them online&quot; are common tricks used in similar public opinion incidents in China, and those involved have tried them repeatedly. There are endless news stories such as &quot;Shijiazhuang woman attacks subway security guard from behind&quot;, &quot;Chongqing woman slaps security guard&quot; and &quot;Woman leads dog into elevator and posts video slandering security guard&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the woman involved encountered trouble when she tried this trick in Singapore: the nurse did not give in, the investigator did not reconcile, and the police complaint afterwards was carried out in accordance with the law. Afterwards, the woman involved confessed in court, showing that the accusation she made that &quot;the nurse discriminated against her because she was not a Singaporean and could not see a doctor&quot; was definitely a slander. She recorded a video despite three warnings and failed to gain public opinion. Instead, she got herself into trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the attitude of the woman involved that she &quot;no longer defends herself, but only seeks a reduced sentence,&quot; she has realized that the &quot;script&quot; is not working and can only stop losses. At the time of the incident, he attempted to seek privileges through emotional blackmail. During the incident, he recorded a video to deny the incident in order to escape punishment. Afterwards, he finally confessed and surrendered in the face of fair law enforcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this case also shows once again the importance of law as &quot;clear rules&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singapore’s Health Minister Ong Ye Kung posted a message on social media to thank the police for their fair enforcement of the law and reiterated Singapore’s zero-tolerance attitude towards such behavior. “This is exactly the behavior we want to protect medical staff from.” According to the emergency regulations of Singapore General Hospital, patients coming for treatment are divided into four types according to their priority. The woman&#39;s minor injuries were originally considered non-emergency &quot;P3&quot; level. Medical staff give priority to using medical resources for &quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot; patients. If the woman in question is dissatisfied with this, she can go to a private hospital to spend money on medical services instead of clamoring for privileges or making up stories. Denied on the grounds of “discrimination”. At the same time, the woman involved transferred her emotions about the traffic accident to the nurses and investigators who had nothing to do with it, which was even more of a giant act without asking right from wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance of all parties in the incident once again proved the significance of the law as &quot;clear rules&quot;. According to Section 6 of Singapore&#39;s Prevention of Harassment Act (POHA), &quot;using insulting words against public officials&quot; is a criminal offense; the woman involved did not wear a mask, spoke rudely to the nurse, and took the video without permission, which itself has violated the law. It’s not just the understatement of some marketing accounts that “just cursed a few words”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the woman involved’s verbal attacks and filming, the police investigators did not retort, exercised a high degree of restraint, did not exceed their authority and used violence, and did not make peace with the woman involved because of her exaggerated words and deeds. , but to initiate a complaint according to the normal process; if the woman involved is not satisfied with the interview between the investigator and the police, she can also complain about it afterwards, instead of doing the words and deeds in the video that clearly violate the law. Judging from the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; of the Singapore General Hospital, if the woman in question really encounters discrimination, she can make a complaint through normal channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Just because you waited for three hours does that mean you can swear at the nurse?” The investigator’s words in the video made many medical staff “relieved” because the investigator emphasized an essential point. It should be consensus common sense: the woman involved should act according to the rules and the law, and should not try to use emotional blackmail, manipulate public opinion and other unforeseen tactics, bypass the clear rules to seek privileges for herself, or kidnap justice to avoid punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The significance of law as a clear rule is that &quot;if a person only needs to obey the law, then he is free.&quot; The disastrous failure of the &quot;cultural export&quot; of the woman involved also proves once again that only by adhering to the principle of the rule of law and discord can this kind of &quot;spin doctor&quot; behavior no longer succeed. In similar public events, Protect the interests of other parties and maintain social justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[用“算法”找到的舍友是完美选项吗？丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258559]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/JJWJQrgM14LzNNBhaoDc1A8mfKbnkJfWIvlQ33Xb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;847&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/JJWJQrgM14LzNNBhaoDc1A8mfK bnkJfWIvlQ33Xb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/257236 &quot; title=&quot;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&quot;>;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the topic &quot;MBTI dormitory allocation statistics of Beijing Institute of Technology&quot; became a hot search topic, more and more universities refused to randomly allocate dormitories. People pay attention. However, each school has different criteria for allocating dormitories. It may be work and rest habits, major, student origin, or the most popular MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question that has been lingering in my mind throughout the interview is, would using certain specific indicators to allocate dormitories be better than randomly allocating dormitories? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, a long time ago, when the department needed to recruit interns, I tried to use MBTI to find the most &quot;perfect&quot; interns. My definition of &quot;perfect&quot; includes the following three indicators: enthusiasm for news, reliability in work, and perseverance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, based on the definitions of the 16 personality types classified by MBTI, I summarized several ideal types. However, during the recruitment process of several consecutive interns, I was surprised to find that there was no one. &quot;Ideal type&quot; students send us resumes. Later, when I communicated with the editor of a magazine, she quickly found a suitable intern classmate after hearing me talk about these &quot;ideal types.&quot; One of my guesses is that when submitting resumes, she would be interested in newspapers and magazines with different styles. The preference is the manifestation of a certain personality type. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, my strategy became to observe among the existing intern students. If any of them showed the above three traits, then I would understand their personality type and then recruit intern students. At this time, you can follow the gourd and draw the scoop. Of course, since the sample size is far from enough, this exploration is definitely not statistically significant. In other words, it must not be generalizable to the population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting interns is also a process of finding suitable peers. However, during the interview, we found that, unlike our definition of a “perfect intern”, each university’s definition of a “perfect roommate” The definitions are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some schools hope that students can chat well, and some students hope that students with outstanding performance can &quot;get rich first and then get rich later&quot;, which leads to various distribution methods. Even if they all consider the distribution of MBTI personality types and how to consider the matching of different types, the key points considered by different schools are slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your university dormitory is randomly assigned, will you further think about this question? Why has having a perfect roommate become so important that each school needs to figure out its own &quot;algorithm&quot; &quot;Up?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible answer is that the context is changing. Some people who want to improve dormitory relationships spent their college life in the 1990s or 2000. At that time, roommates were the most important partners in life. And when these people became university teachers one after another, they discovered that today&#39;s college students will understand roommate relationships from another perspective. In the manuscript, an interviewee mentioned: &quot;Many children have very clear goals after entering college: to secure a postgraduate degree and go abroad... From the beginning of their freshman year, they will arrange their lives according to their goals and will not participate in dinner parties, etc. For group activities, the dormitory may just be your own resting place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these &quot;algorithms&quot; really useful? This question will not get a definite answer in four years, or even further in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I only look at the &quot;perfect interns&quot; recruited, I will still ask each classmate about their personality type later, usually at the end of the chat, and will never refuse to let a certain classmate because of this. Come for an internship. I will also tell him my personality type. Knowing this information in advance can reduce a lot of friction in future communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI attempts to simplify complex individuals with some specific descriptions. In reality, even the same personality type will have completely opposite responses to difficulties. It is just a slice of a certain stage of life. The lovely thing about people is that they change every moment. A certain difficulty or a pleasant experience will make people change a little bit. Therefore, &quot;perfection&quot; should also be a process. Any &quot;perfection&quot; found with a single indicator will cease to exist the moment it is found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
