Four years ago, she once shouted &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a variety show. Four years later, at the age of 16, she fulfilled her promise with practical actions and became the youngest person in China to climb Mount Everest from the south slope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Influenced by her father, Xu Zhuoyuan started climbing when she was very young. When she was 4 years old, her parents took her to climb Mount Siguniang and unexpectedly found that she adapted well to altitude sickness. When she was 12 years old, she traveled to Tibet with her father Xu Jianglei. At that time, she regretted not being able to see the sunrise on Mount Everest due to weather conditions. On the way back, she climbed the peak of Mount Siguniang with her father. “It was my first time to climb a snow-capped mountain in a real sense.” From then on, she buried her desire to climb Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mountain climbing is an extreme sport that relies on luck. Since she got into climbing, her mood has become more stable. &quot;People often die during climbing. Now for me, life and death are no big deal.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;This climb six months ago was Xu Zhuoyuan’s first challenge on Mount Everest. Before setting off, she packed her father Xu Jianglei&#39;s gloves when he climbed Mount Everest into his backpack, hoping to keep them as &quot;a kind of inheritance.&quot; In 2007, Xu Jianglei climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, becoming the first person in Hunan Province to summit Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Zhuoyuan remembered that when she was approaching the summit, the Sherpa guide beside her reminded her that she was almost at the top and it was still dark. &quot;The only thought in my mind was that I must see the top of Mount Everest.&quot; At sunrise on the mountain, my father’s summit photo has always impressed me. In the photo, he is high-spirited and smiling brightly facing the sun. I can feel his love for the snow-capped mountains. That photo is still displayed in my home. .&quot; Fortunately, the sun came out almost at the moment she reached the top. Now, next to a picture of her father, there is a picture of her reaching the summit, with the rising sun behind her. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;When you were 12 years old, you said &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a show. What did you think at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Ever since I was a child, Mount Everest has always had a different meaning to me. The summer after I graduated from primary school when I was 12 years old, my father took me to Tibet, but I didn’t see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain due to the weather. Later, my father and I went to climb the peak of Siguniang Mountain together. This was my first time to truly climb a snow-capped mountain. It snowed on the mountain at that time. As a southerner, I found it very novel. From then on, I very much hoped to have the opportunity to climb Mount Everest to watch the sunrise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After setting that goal at the age of 12, my father How to say? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He was quite shocked at the time. He didn’t expect that I would have this idea, and he probably thought that I wouldn’t really take action. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you set a deadline for yourself at that time? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What I wanted at that time was to complete it as soon as possible. Since it was something I wanted to do when I was a teenager, if I waited until I was in my twenties or thirties to do it, my mood might be different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since then, you have started to work for the four Are you preparing to climb Mount Everest in the next year? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I started to do some training from then on, but in the past few years, due to my studies, the training schedule was not so full. It wasn’t until I completed the climb of Muztagh Peak last year and got the ticket to Mount Everest that I started systematic training. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to training with 22 kilograms of sandbags every day, you What preparations have you made for climbing Mount Everest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For example, Bulgarian squats and rock climbing. My training emphasizes leg muscle and core strength training, as well as endurance, physical fitness and cardiorespiratory training. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Will intensive training affect your studies? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many people like to ask me how to balance studies and climbing. It is indeed difficult to balance them, but if you really love it, you will try your best. All ways to balance. My current high school coursework is very heavy, and my mountaineering training is also very heavy, so I will fill up all my free time and study ahead of schedule. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Climbing to the top is not success, returning home is&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you feel when you climbed to the top of Mount Everest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I thought I would be very excited. Climbing to the top would be regarded as fulfilling my dream of the past four years, but I didn’t know it was because the weather was too bad at that time. Cold and high altitude can compress some of people&#39;s emotions, but I&#39;m actually quite calm. I remember taking out the flags in my bag one by one, taking pictures, and then calling my mother to report that everything was safe. Because the weather was so bad and there was a heavy snowstorm, the Sherpa guide urged me to retreat quickly, so I thought about retreating quickly. At that time, my parents suggested that I stay at Camp 2 for one more day and take a helicopter back to Everest Base Camp the next day. But I stayed on the mountain for 8 days. I didn’t take a shower or have an Internet connection for 8 days. This actually reached the limit for me. I threw my sleeping bag and moisture-proof mat directly to Camp 4 and decided to return to the base camp that day. , so it took me 22 hours to withdraw that day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to not being able to take a shower, as a girl, you What difficulties did you encounter during the climb? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, women have more inconveniences when climbing than men, such as washing and going to the toilet. But both men and women are equal in front of the mountain, but women have to work harder to achieve this goal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 8 days without the Internet, you have nothing but What are you doing for training? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Mainly training. We adapted to Camp 2 for 3 days, and then we were waiting for news from Camp 3 to see the road construction team. Can it be cultivated to the top? We were very lucky. If the road construction team had not repaired it at that time, we might have to withdraw to the Everest base camp and wait for the next cycle. The rest of the time, I would chat with my teammates on the mountaineering team, play cards, and fight against altitude sickness. I vomited violently the night I first arrived at Everest Base Camp. I don’t know if it was because I was not used to the climate in Nepal, so I rested for about two days before recovering. Later, I was training alone with my teammates at the base camp. My mother called me and advised me to withdraw. So this is also my first time to climb a mountain without my parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Didn’t you think about withdrawing it at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Maybe I am a bit stubborn, thinking that I have suffered so much and have to climb so many snow-capped mountains in one day before climbing Mount Everest. I&#39;ve been training all night and finally got here, why not keep at it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;That call you made to your mother at the top of the mountain What was said on the phone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I said that I had reached the summit and told her not to worry, I would descend as soon as possible. My mother has always been reluctant to allow me to climb mountains because it is a very dangerous extreme sport. She had been worried. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What did mom say back? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;She told me that climbing to the summit is not success, but returning home is, and asked me to pay attention to safety. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do you still insist on climbing when it is so dangerous? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mountain climber George Mallory is often asked why he climbed Mount Everest. He always answers, &quot;Because the mountain is the mountain.&quot; over there&quot;. We are lucky enough to be able to climb out of love, but climbing to the top is not only for me to let the world see me, I hope everyone can also see our new generation of Chinese youth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;One cannot stay at the moment of climbing to the top forever&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After climbing Mount Everest and returning to school, will your friends and classmates be curious about your experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;They would ask me what the scenery was like on the mountain. But I didn&#39;t feel much change. Everyone attends classes as usual, and I also attend classes and train step by step. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What impact does reaching the summit have on your current life? Influence? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, it’s nothing. One cannot stay at the moment of climbing to the top forever, and I also feel that I should not be too indulged in the joy of climbing to the top of a mountain. There will be countless mountain peaks in the rest of my life, whether in a physical sense or in other dimensions. My next goal is Kilimanjaro and I will start training again soon. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But you will because you already have a good Are you more stressed because of your performance? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, it’s not bad. Every mountain has its own characteristics, and there are good and bad luck. For me, the important thing is to have the courage to try. I&#39;ll do a lot of preparation to get it done, and if it doesn&#39;t work this time, then next time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After reaching the summit, you will receive the Nepalese national The Tourism Bureau’s congratulatory message was certified by CCTV as “the youngest female athlete in China to climb the summit from the south slope”. Many people think this is a perfect life, what do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is a very satisfying thing to determine your dream and fight for it. For me, climbing Mount Everest is just a satisfactory answer at this stage. I am only sixteen or seventeen years old. The road ahead is long and there are still many papers to hand in. Mount Everest is just a way point. My goal in the next stage is to complete the 7+2 plan (the highest peaks of the seven continents plus hiking at the North and South Poles). At the end of this year, I will complete the climb of Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa with my mother. This is the first step of my 7+2 plan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[魏书钧：描述理性漏洞与失控]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261268]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/ObzGU1xbMHbyjhzQ4InEp1BTKxpqC0FgdSbNhsQZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;719&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/ObzGU1xbMHbyjhzQ4InEp1BTKxpqC0 FgdSbNhsQZ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259206&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Picture from Honor 100 series Photography/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Out of curiosity about the three bizarre murders and the murderer’s motives, Wei Shujun read the novel “The Mistake by the River” several times, but still didn’t understand. Feeling humiliated and excited at the same time, he opened the first page of the computer document and read &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; in enlarged font size. Below it were two lines of small characters, original work: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wants to adapt this novella published in 1988. The perpetrators of the three murders all pointed to madmen, but they could not build a complete chain of evidence to bring him to justice, which made both the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe uneasy. Writer Yu Hua&#39;s parody of detective novels in the avant-garde literature period used violent absurdity as the surface and subversion of tradition as the core. I have sold the copyright several times but have never changed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficult thing is to find a word that points to the philosophy behind all suspenseful stories. In 2021, Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei entered the second year of their adaptation. After overturning the general direction twice, they were determined to find the word. They searched for two days and two nights, wandering around the house until they got something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Bug.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new development. &quot;It is a word born from the progress of information technology. It is a vulnerability problem based on code and the best rational logic. We think it is too accurate. , isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this one is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was August 2021, and Wei Shujun was preparing to shoot a new film in Northeast China &quot;White Crane Spreads Wings&quot;. After work, the crew plays badminton together. However, indoor venues have been closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they are planning to play basketball outdoors instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month ago, his second feature film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; was selected for the Directors&#39; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival; a year ago, his first feature film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was nominated for the Cannes Newcomer Award. As a feature film director, his graduate work &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; won the Cannes Short Film Special Mention Award. He received critical acclaim when he first appeared on the scene. Industry seniors and critics praised his talents and talents, and were curious about the possibilities he brought to the table. sex. Wei Shujun received attention as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the adaptation of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. Bugs do not exist alone. To describe rational loopholes and loss of control, the premise is to explain what rationality is. The argument about rationality is a wide-ranging, academic discussion that is energy-consuming and unnecessary. &quot;We looked in the wrong direction again,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By chance, while scouting locations in Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;The causes of their deaths are not completely connected on a rational level and cannot serve to solve the case. But in the dream, they interlock with each other, as if they are all established, revealing a certain inevitability in a series of accidents, giving people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, dreams became the core sequence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seems to be his consistent creative approach, which values ​​the true feelings of the creative subject and expresses them effectively in the film. Photography director Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We basically create based on our feelings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met for the first time in Shanghai three years ago, and they chatted quite well. . They have many consensuses on the nature and creative concepts of movies, two of which are simple but very important: movies were created to create &quot;realistic illusions&quot; at the beginning, and they should still be so today, and movies may not be the best way to tell stories. It is a medium, but it is a channel for storing and transmitting the creator’s feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, regarding &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot;, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it was restrained, quiet, and elegant, and that many things happened on a humid and rainy day. This was how he felt when reading the novel. Accordingly, Cheng Ma felt that the images should be consistent with the 1990s, when the characters were wandering and out of place, and geographical features such as counties or towns were far away, not close. Cheng Ma suggested shooting on 16mm film, and they hit it off immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, with 45 days left before filming, the crew arrived in Nanfeng, Jiangxi Province, where the filming took place, to make preparations. The actors were busy with their own work. Tong Linkai had to practice splits and back fists. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket to visit the local police and gained 30 pounds to achieve an overworked figure. Zeng Meihuizi was also making herself gain weight in order to look like a pregnant woman. The crew cooked together, watched movies, and played badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think the best state of creation is when all the main creators are relaxed. I don’t like that kind of tense, night-and-night (state) like a repair project, which is very tiring. That is to say, although it is You are working, but you still have your own life order, and you still retain your pursuit of beauty and passion for life.&quot; Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often carries a film camera with him - the crew has a total of more than 20 film cameras, and even a darkroom for developing black and white photos - to capture the daily life of the crew. There are more saved in his mobile phone photo album. When he opens it and looks through it, he sees friends meeting, travel scenes, rivers, trees, and the sea. “It seems to have some kind of ability to preserve time, making you think of it as a pleasant time.” In the afternoon, a happy state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relaxation is rare. What is also rare is that, in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun places a particularly high importance on creation. &quot;As a director of his age, he can actually withstand a lot of pressure. We have to shoot smoothly, but many people ask us what to do with the scenes and what to do with the actors&#39; time. For example, a certain role has many scenes, but the actors can only come for 10 days in total. , the usual approach of the crew is to focus on filming all his scenes in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that smooth filming is of great value to his creation, so he will give up scenes that cannot be matched by actors or at inappropriate times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has an almost intuitive ability to control the scene. I always told him, you shine on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his character&#39;s name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s subordinate is Xiao Li, a young man who takes the initiative to report case analysis from time to time. So of course Tong Linkai’s name is Xiao Li. After a few days of filming, Wei Shujun suddenly said, thank you so much &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Thanks&quot; means shit)&lt;/span>;, don&#39;t call me Xiao Li. Just call me Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and revised his lines. The printed police officer ID card of Xiao Li was re-attached. Tong Linkai&#39;s role became Xiao Xie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to be honest, the feeling at the scene was not that wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;Imagine that when you were in school, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 a.m. every morning to study early. On the way from home after breakfast, you felt that you were still waking up. When you got to class, you thought about writing yesterday&#39;s homework. No, I didn’t write it, so I wrote it quickly. After I wrote it, I felt very at ease. I started to think about going to the canteen to buy something to eat during recess, and then I went to the actual class to listen to the teacher. It was the same on the set, everyone was here, Shui After brewing it, we started drinking water. We walked around the scene and the actors were almost done. Then we discussed the scene and confirmed our schedule with the photographer. Everyone prepared individually and then started to prepare for shooting. If something didn’t feel right in the first two days, Adjust it, and it feels good. If you take a few more shots, it will be time for lunch. It really feels like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a slope every day, and you have to climb up a slope. You have to crawl over to get to that position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; was completed accurately and efficiently, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the Cannes Film Festival. Five months later, it won two honors: Best Film and Cinephile Choice at the Pingyao International Film Festival. After another four days, it was released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, there was often chatter in the theater. Wei Shujun used a long dream to allow Ma Zhe to reveal himself in order to resolve his own uneasiness and chaos. The dream was clear, coherent but illogical. After witnessing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on an old cinema seat and saw the director on the big screen holding a ping pong ball with the number 3 printed on it, shouting at him. ——Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this shot where conjecture and prophecy overlap, thousands of ping pong balls roll down from the bottom of the screen and swarm towards Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone was very excited during the shooting. After taking one shot, everyone picked up the thousands of ping pong balls while shouting &quot;One more, another one&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the show, the audience was full of doubts and endless interpretations and comments about the film, forming multiple dreams outside the screen, a kind of &quot;rationality and irrationality, the combination of the viewer and the viewer.&quot; effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s initial uneasiness when reading the novel, his exploration of the creator&#39;s intentions, and his several elusive moments during the adaptation were all conveyed to the audience. We think we have the answer, but in fact we have the illusion of an answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not too obsessed with pursuing the truth in life, because I feel that it is difficult to find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun that the truth is difficult to find, &quot;the so-called The fate of your life is a random existence. You can only see its existence and don’t know the truth behind it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slight existentialist tendency of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is just that Back to &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, or in other words, &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;. Just reiterate one point, &quot;I believe that I &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(creator)&lt;/span>; has determined the sole right of interpretation, and the audience must accept this interpretation Right, this is the biggest paradox.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the movie was released, Wei Shujun sent a message to Yu Hua, saying that it seems that we did not use a movie to write annotations for the novel, but used the movie to write an annotation for the novel.

As a tribute to the centenary, &quot;Star Wish&quot; certainly closely follows this theme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of the movie is set in a kingdom of wishes called Rosas. People come from all directions to offer their dreams to the magical King Manifico, and the king will choose the right person from them. Help them achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine Yasha’s biggest wish is that her grandfather’s dream comes true. However, when she came into contact with King Manifico, she realized that &lt;span>; the king was not as kind and generous as he appeared on the surface. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/13d838d9212ca2dcc2eb87255e9f04b0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259601 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Manifico is an extreme conservative. He will only select dreams that he considers harmless to realize, while shelving creative dreams. He regarded such dreams as a scourge that would shake Rosas&#39;s foundations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course Asha disagrees with the king&#39;s point of view, so she joins forces with the wishing star and Valentino the goat to try to get her grandfather&#39;s dream back. The king, under the temptation of lust for power, further darkened. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/74d2011fa8ecac1b3913c1015dd621ca.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/74d2011fa8ecac1b3913c1015dd621ca.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259600 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The assists in the movie, the wishing star and the goat, are easily reminiscent of the combination of Olaf and the reindeer in &quot;Frozen&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In fact, &quot;Wish&quot; did use the production team of &quot;Frozen&quot;, directed by Chris Buck&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (&quot;Frozen&quot;)&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Co-directed with Fawn Villasensohn&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&quot;Dragon&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;; Jennifer Lee&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&quot;Crazy&quot;) Zootopia&quot;, &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, Allison Moore, Chris Buck&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&quot;Frozen&quot;)&lt;/span>; &lt;span>; Co-screenwriter; Liu Yifei and &quot;Feng Shen&quot; star Yu Shi voice the heroine Asha and the goat Valentino respectively. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/b84fb45c94d73c7e1f362563182558b4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;423&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/b84fb45c94d73c7e1f362563182558b4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259596 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/88d8e113486ed2c5ea475b6ca9393435.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;481&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/88d8e113486ed2c5ea475b6ca9393435.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259597&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the past, Disney always promoted the truth, goodness and beauty in the world, but &quot;Star Wish&quot; used a lot of space to depict the process of the king&#39;s ambition expanding and eventually being backlashed. And &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;No matter what the situation, Asha was always loyal to her heart, &lt;/span>; and won more allies, and finally overthrew Manifico&#39;s rule. The dystopian nature of the movie is very un-Disney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your point of view, but I will defend to the death your right to speak.&quot; Putting it here is an excellent comment. Everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, and the king cannot deny it easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being good at creating dreams, Disney is also good at creating princesses. Since the release of Snow White (Disney&#39;s first animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) in 1937, Disney has followed the development of the times for more than 80 years and successively launched more than a dozen characters.

Later princesses have improved their initiative and self-awareness. For example, Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) sacrifices singing to walk on land in order to meet the man she loves; Ariel in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) Belle and the ugly beast have been in love for a long time; Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; refuses the king&#39;s offer Referring to marriage, falling in love with Aladdin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The princesses of this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; will take the initiative to fight for what they want, but&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Their goal in life is still to find true love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/631f8f80da83892c3fea154bbfc85969.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259603 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such &quot;progress&quot; was obviously not enough.

The family relationship between the two sisters became the main thread, and the handsome prince became the villain of the entire film. The princess no longer passively waits for the prince to save her, the princess herself is very powerful; true love no longer involves the prince kissing the princess, and the sisterhood is also very touching. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/c1da20b56f8dbd4531cb0b088ba7c214.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259606 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be said that Disney subverted Disney. Starting from this&lt;/span>;movie, Disney princesses completely got rid of the male gaze. They took off their costumes and became their own heroes. Like the &lt;span>; princesses in &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) and &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; (2021), they all gave up on romance. One lived her life how she wanted, and the other led her people to protect their home and country. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259607 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;And this &quot;Star Wish&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is also of the same origin&lt;/span>;. Asha dares to question and is not afraid of power. In order to protect all the residents of Rosas He did not hesitate to stand on the opposite side of King Manifico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But compared with the previous princesses, Asha&#39;s combat effectiveness is obviously weakened. She no longer has the ability to go to heaven and earth. She is more like an ordinary person, a civilian hero who resists the aloof king. Just like the theme song of the movie sings, &quot;Maybe you are afraid but you still reach out your hand, and you will not run away because of a weak tremor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This may also be the century-old road that Disney has walked for itself.

Everyone has a story, attracting attention and extraordinary. But Yi Mengling&#39;s story obviously does not belong to this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How to define Yi Mengling, it seems to be a issue that the public is more interested in now. She is a model, a blogger, an Internet celebrity, and a newcomer to the film and television industry. And Yi Mengling is still making a lot of attempts and challenges, maybe the label and identity will be added in front of her name in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is widely known, which stems from Yi Mengling&#39;s unique styles and short videos. In a good aesthetic, makeup and dressing, coupled with the sun, smile, and eternal state, Yi Mengling won tens of millions of fans on social platforms. She did not actively define anything, but all kinds of labels followed, &quot;atmosphere&quot;, &quot;pure desire&quot; ... these labels or envy, or love, or unhappy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the day of the interview, the thin girl with too many eyes took the shooting scene on the second floor and greeted all the people who came all the way. During the shooting gap, she communicated with the photographer with technical issues, &quot;You have to believe me.&quot; When discussing some kind of lighting skills, she gave her suggestions sincerely, attracting the photographer Haha Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da laugh. When Yi Mengling has not eaten at noon, when the staff hurriedly handed in the take -out in the rest, she said, &quot;It&#39;s okay to put two cushions&quot; and &quot;Ready to call me at any time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This may be what Yi Mengling looks more real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For a long time, some people imitated her, some disdain her, and more and more discussions about her, but Yi Mengling almost did not fight with netizens. fragment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She also occasionally respond to some controversial discussions. For example, &quot;big mouth&quot;, it brings iconic smiles, and also brings ridicule. Yi Mengling&#39;s response is more self -accepting and thanking this for making itself characteristic in the model field. For example, the first experience of recording acting variety shows, netizens have compared her with female stars because of acting skills and looks, and more about the &quot;Internet celebrity should not enter the entertainment industry&quot;. But in Yi Mengling&#39;s view, she regards the world as a big playground and is an experienced player. Trying different things and challenging different things requires courage, but the process of challenging is cool, and she chooses to challenge her. &quot;No matter what the result is, it is experience. I think it is worth it.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Everyone likes Yi Mengling. In addition to her beauty, she also likes her character that she is not surprised. Many times, she is trying to alleviate some anxiety and output some positive energy. For example, Su Yan appeared in the photo, shared the tips behind her to take pictures, and sent a small belly photo with meat after meals, making everyone feel that the beauty is not a statue, but a living person. Similarly, such behaviors will still cause dissatisfaction. Some people think that this is deliberate, or in the &quot;concave ground.&quot; Regardless of the remarks, Yi Mengling collected the order in the order. In her opinion, she has no taboos. As a public figure, it is essential to face comments. Many of them are very exaggerated, and they just over after watching. Yi Mengling said: &quot;Try not to fall into the strange circle of self -evidence. After all, the explanation is never endless.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; She is an amateur and possesses a place with her own advantages on the Internet. In her, it seems that she can find all the shadows of the Internet celebrity, but she can&#39;t attribute her to her. Yi Mengling&#39;s story may not be complicated, but in any case, she is killing a more intense traffic place, killing a siege. To some extent, the public recognizes and disagreed, and she has the courage, tenacity, and strength beyond her age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How do she face all this about an ordinary girl who becomes under the spotlight? The following is Yi Mengling&#39;s answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;Compared to self-consistent, it is better to say that I am trying to find growth here&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font- Family: Kaiti, Kai Trioons_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Do you remember the turning point node that you feel more important?

Visual China | Picture &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qiu Yunqing, Executive Deputy Dean of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, also understands that queuing is the most headache in the process of medical treatment -registered number pick -up, payment appointment to queue a lot of time. As soon as he entered the hospital&#39;s outpatient hall, the crowds of the black and hot air were inevitably more depressed in the mood of patients who had a good body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Thanks to the medical insurance code (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Medical Insurance Electronic Volume&quot; &lt;/span>;) The first hospital has more than 7 million outpatient volume a year, and the outpatient hall &quot;will not seem so crowded.&quot; &quot;Patients have a registration fee for settlement of small program medical insurance in advance and reported online. After the clinic, the consultation fee for medical insurance settlement directly through the small program.&quot; Qiu Yunqing told Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The data provided by Qiu Yunqing shows that the patient&#39;s hand -held medical code can go to the entire process of medical treatment, which significantly improves the patient&#39;s diagnosis efficiency and the hospital operation efficiency. %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Like the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, 31 provinces across the country (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, Stkaiti;&quot;>; municipality, autonomous region &lt;/span>;) The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have supported medical insurance codes for medical and purchase medicines, and more than 800,000 medical institutions were connected to fixed -point pharmaceutical institutions, and medical insurance code users exceeded 1 billion. At the press conference of the State Medical Insurance Bureau on November 24, 2023, Fu Chaoqi, deputy director of the Office of the State Medical Insurance Bureau, provided the above data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fu Chaoqi pointed out that from the activation of the provinces of the medical insurance code, Zhejiang and Qinghai provinces have taken the lead in achieving coverage of insured in the province, and the activation rate of more than half of the provinces of more than half of the provinces exceeds 75%. Data from Tencent Health Calculation shows that for an ordinary insured person, he can make an appointment through the WeChat public account before seeing a doctor, and use the medical insurance code to complete online medical insurance payment during settlement, saving an average of 43 minutes for each patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Breaking the barriers, use the entire process of medical purchase of medicines &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Purchase medicines at hospitals and pharmacies, and the mobile phone &quot;bright code&quot; can be traced back to four years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 24, 2019, the first medical insurance code (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Medical Insurance Electronic Volume &lt;/span>;) Provincial Jinan City activation. At that time, the National Medical Insurance Administration hoped that the medical insurance code would not only be simply electronic, but also realize the vision of &quot;seeing a doctor without a card, only using the medical insurance code&quot;. The standards would be unified across the country, mutually recognized across regions, and all procedures could be done with an electronic voucher. All medical insurance business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Four years later, these visions not only gradually landed, but also made new attempts. Take Zhejiang Province as an example. In the past, there were 54 medical insurance systems in Zhejiang, which were separated from each other and not shared with each other. Until March 2022, Zhejiang Province’s “Smart Medical Insurance” system will be fully connected to the national medical insurance platform, realizing the unified medical insurance settlement in Zhejiang Province. system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Cao Cen, deputy director of the Zhejiang Medical Insurance Bureau, introduced that all designated medical institutions in Zhejiang have transformed the HIS (hospital information management system) to support the use of medical insurance code throughout the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, in Zhejiang Provincial Hospital, from registered, medical, payment, inspection tests, printing reports, to obtaining drugs, hospitalization and medical insurance settlement, it can be completed as long as the code scan the code; , Medical Insurance Code support prescription circulation, purchase of drugs and medicine, medical insurance settlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The medical insurance code also opened up the barriers outside the hospital. Zhejiang Jinhua City Central Hospital mentioned in a paper that the electronic prescription circulation through the application of medical insurance codes can choose &quot;dual channels&quot; by themselves (through the two channels of fixed -point medical institutions and fixed retail pharmacies, to meet the conditions for synchronization of conditions and include medical insurance payment ) Purchase prescription drugs for fixed -point retail pharmacies to enjoy the same reimbursement treatment as the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The service scenario changes from the&quot; single point &#39;to&#39;. &quot;Xie Zhangyi, deputy director of the State Medical Insurance Bureau&#39;s Financial Regulations Department, said that the entire process of medical insurance codes is the key work of the medical insurance department in 2023 One is to promote the use of medical insurance codes from the entire process of reservation registration, sign -in, diagnosis and treatment, report inquiry, pharmacies and drugs in reservation registration, sign -in, diagnosis and treatment examination, report inquiry, and pharmacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Family favors, so that the elderly and children are convenient. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; The hospital is mostly the elderly. It is particularly important how fashionable technology takes into account the needs of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A paper from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital mentioned that the average age of medical insurance patients in Hangzhou in 2021 is 55 years, of which about 40%of them are 60 and over. &quot;On the one hand, elderly patients are intelligent. The use of mobile phones is low; on the other hand, compared with young people, the proficiency and fluency of elderly patients using smartphones are poor. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In terms of aginging transformation, the WeChat medical insurance code has been launched on the barrier -free version, supporting the visually impaired people to use the medical code through voice, and at the same time launch a family account service in many provinces, apply face recognition and other technologies to support relatives to support relatives Agent business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qiu Yunqing told the southern weekend reporter that most of the elderly have family members to accompany them. Through the function of medical insurance family account function, the family members who accompany the companion can bind the medical insurance code of the elderly to their accounts to facilitate the appointment and payment for the elderly for the elderly cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, according to the medical insurance policy in Zhejiang and other places, the personal account of insurance participants has passed the &quot;family support filing&quot; in the years, which can be used to directly pay the spouse of the same medical insurance to participate in the basic medical insurance. The medical insurance cost of children and parents. For example, young people&#39;s personal accounts cannot be used, they can be used for parents, &quot;(&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti; &quot;>; Parent &lt;/span>; The medical insurance sent a text message. What medicine and how much money was prescribed, it was also very convenient after binding. You can pay with your own account money. &quot;Qiu Yunqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We also pay attention to the needs of medical insurance services that are more difficult to use in intelligent technologies such as the elderly, minors, etc., effectively integrate traditional services with intelligent methods, and launch family accounts, medical treatment on different places, etc. Function, and adding offline activities of the medical insurance code in the medical insurance agency, helping special groups to obtain and enjoying the medical insurance services, and improving the accessibility of medical insurance convenience services. &quot;Xie Zhangyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Be wary of the use of medical insurance codes to ensure the safety of medical insurance funds &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; However, while the medical insurance code is convenient, how to ensure the safety of the medical insurance fund also brings challenges to all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Guangzhou Medical Insurance Service Center pointed out in a paper that there is no related photo information for medical insurance electronic vouchers. Regulatory work brings difficulty and challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September 2023, the Putian police detected a case that used medical insurance codes. After the villagers died, their relatives used medical insurance codes to seek medical reimbursement and cheated 1232.73 yuan for medical insurance funds. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Junjie, general manager of Alipay Medical and Health Division, said that the system will analyze multi -factor security technical analysis of information such as the use habits of the insured, account change and other information. Once abnormalities are found, immediately report the medical insurance bureau and start the risk control system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2023, the State Medical Insurance Bureau issued the &quot;Two -Combination of Three Supplements&quot; Work Plan &quot;of the National Medical Insurance Bureau, requiring medical insurance data to be connected vertically and horizontally to achieve comprehensive supervision of the medical insurance fund. The National Medical Insurance Administration also requires that all coordinating regions will launch an intelligent supervision subsystem by the end of 2023. By the end of 2025, an intelligent audit and electronic monitoring system will be basically established, and the &quot;medical insurance code&quot; will be used to allow users, medical institutions, insurance handling units, and pharmaceutical and device companies to The data are closely connected to form a normalized supervision system that handles daily audits and on-site inspections, big data analysis, full-scenario intelligent monitoring and other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the medical insurance code users broke 1 billion, the National Medical Insurance Bureau was also promoting the service function of the medical insurance code from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;easy to use&quot;. &quot;Currently, the public&#39;s demand for medical insurance services is multi-layered, diversified, and personalized. Based on the actual needs of the people, the medical insurance department has launched a number of &#39;Internet + medical insurance services&#39; that are easy to use and popular with the public, such as online inquiries Medical consultation, one-click prescription refill, follow-up prescription dispensing, online settlement, home delivery of medicine, etc., to better meet the people&#39;s needs for medical treatment and medicine purchase.&quot; said Xie Zhangshu, deputy director of the Department of Regulation, Finance and Law of the National Medical Insurance Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Xi Lijie also contributed) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[父亲带脑梗儿子跑网约车感动万千网友：灵活就业让赚钱与陪伴得以两全]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261194]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-25 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; This is a news that all middle-aged fathers will see it. In Chongqing, a 53 -year -old online car driver Yi Heping runs the car with a cerebral infarction son every day. Every time he receives orders, he will apologize to the passengers first: &quot;Sorry, the co -driver is my son, he is sick ...&quot; In September this year, he mentioned that he had apologized more than 1,800 times. Visually, this data will increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; His son is unfortunate. In 2021, Yi Heping&#39;s son was admitted to the hospital for cerebral infarction; in early 2023, Xiaoyi was sent to the emergency room again due to cerebral hemorrhage. After treatment, Xiaoyi&#39;s physical condition gradually recovered, but he lost his ability to take care of himself. In order to better take care of his son, Yi Heping took Xiaoyi to &quot;on the road&quot; together. He has encountered the cancellation of orders and is also understood and considerate by more passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As far as the destiny and the set of people are concerned, he has two &quot;cuts&quot;. One is the loser of Shanghai. Yi Heping used to be &quot;Boss Yi&quot;. In 1996, he went to Shenzhen to start a business and became an earlier group of people who operated communication equipment. Since then He decided to return Yijin to his hometown and return to Chongqing to start a business. At that time, there were more than 20 million yuan on his personal account. There were all villas and luxury cars, as well as his own full -time driver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2015, Yihe&#39;s investment failed, resulting in bankruptcy, and many years of hard work. This trajectory is desolate and sad, full of frustration of middle -aged men; the other is the father who is struggling between making money to support his family and take care of his son. His wife could not take care of her son due to diabetes, coronary heart disease, etc. This burden could only be carried by this tired father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, such a story is &quot;lonely&quot;, but those who bring their children or their loved ones &quot;on the road&quot; to ask for life is not just Yihe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, Anhui Takeaway Brother Li Yuanyuan put the only six months old, and put the takeaway in the takeaway box, which attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In January 2022, the media reported that Guizhou guy Xiao Xin took his 3 -year -old son to takeaway. Life is not good for him, divorced, second child, baby, and work hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2022, a video of a playback and review volume of 100,000 + attracted attention. Children, and take her takeaway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2023, the Hyundai Express reported that &quot;Uncle Bald&quot; Fu Zhenyang from Liu&#39;an, Anhui, began to sports in Suzhou with his sick wife in Suzhou since 2017. It was 6 years of running. Fu Zhenyang wants to pay more than 200,000 yuan in debt, and also take care of the half -paralyzed wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; No need to do it one by one. The common point of these stories is that most of the heroes came from the countryside to the city to work hard, and they all encountered a huge twists and turns. They chose not to abandon or give up. They sparen the heavy pressure and endless test of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The direct reason they are difficult to add is to stay away from the family zone and bloodline bond. The strong and optimistic post -00 mother -in -law was ruthlessly launched by her mother -in -law, and more situations had to come to a big city to make a living in order to change the situation. Obviously, in the rural and family context, a person has difficulties, and everyone can set up a handle. You go to work, some people can help you see the child, you are ill, and someone will send you a hot meal to your family. This echoes your power to a large extent. But after coming to the city alone, all the &quot;reinforcements&quot; disappeared. In the scene of the neighbors &quot;do not know each other&quot;, you can only rely on yourself. The first thing you wake up every day is to rely on your loved ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What they encountered is a substantial &quot;atomicization&quot;. As the experts say, social atomicization mainly refers to the process of changes in social connection status during the change of the unit system. It is mainly manifested by the weakening of personal connection and the alienation of individuals and the public world. And these daily busy situations are the actual portrayal of &quot;post -units&quot; and lonely individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They are actually in a lonely island, is isolated and helpless, and they are not even qualified to fall down -Yihe is the most worried that once they are gone, what should their sons do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Earning money and companionship are important and cannot be given up, but how to do both is a problem. Obviously, it is difficult for them to enter a &quot;regular unit&quot; in the secular sense and check in nine to five places. Even if they have such ability, they need to take care of themselves and cannot take care of their loved ones. Moreover, almost no unit allows employees to bring dolls or wives to work. Whether it is an enterprise&#39;s system or order, they will say &quot;no&quot; to this situation. After all, the employer does not have this obligation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fortunately, they found places to live in the flexible employment field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the realistic situation of the bone, the &quot;dilemma&quot; hanging on their heads forced them to find another law. The rise of platform employment and freelancing has given them great hope. This is a way of working where you don’t need to clock in and you can use your time freely. It can be said that the Internet economy, including the takeout economy, provides the final guarantee for this group of people. What is shown behind this is actually a new way of thinking developed by a society to help solve the practical difficulties of a certain group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For this group, this is the only way they break the state of &quot;atomicization&quot; and get out of the predicament. Only those who are desperate to fight doom and hardship can find this difficult but quite solid path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other hand, those wandering people with the children &quot;on the road&quot; also set an example for the children to persist in and glow in adversity. Children who have this process of life can also read the true meaning of life, and they will also be sensible earlier than their peers. A recent video video shows that a mother with a paralyzed lower limb in Yan&#39;an in Shaanxi accidentally fell when she was paralyzed on the wheelchair, and her 4 -year -old son tried his best to raise his mother again and again. On November 14, Li Yuanyuan released a video of the three -year -old daughter, Yu Er to help brush the bowl, and once again triggered discussion among netizens. Netizens directly called the little girl &quot;the smile was too cured.&quot; Hardness is also the best tutor. I am convinced that those who flew to the streets with their children have also had the psychological construction that cultivated children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When we explore the social assistance mechanism to protect the group, we should also see that mortals grit their teeth and carry the burden of a family, and support the extraordinary significance of a beloved loved ones. This narrative seems to be sporadic, loose, atypical, but also converges a lively sample that confronts uncertainty and unsatisfactory, becomes a society that is &quot;atomicized &quot;The indispensable force in the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成长的烦恼：中国电子竞技20年观察]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261254]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-25 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/t1g2je6q32xcmpwjvlgvou4ntf4yhCllLagsce.png &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1598 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;915&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.cms/medias/i/i MAGE/23/11/22/T1G2je6q32XCMPWJVLGVOU4NTF4YHCLLLLAGISce. png &quot;data-key =&quot; 259255 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Lu Junjie/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Household registration &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2002, 258315 fires occurred in China, causing 2393 people to die. However, the fire of the blue -speed Internet cafe that occurred in Beijing College Road on June 16, which caused 25 people, was undoubtedly the most discussed by public opinion that year and also caused the largest follow -up impact. All the Internet cafes in Beijing were closed after the accident, and then the Internet cafes across the country joined the rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Juvenile, arson, Internet cafes, video games ... A series of keywords that are called &quot;the most serious minor crime since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, almost overnight the mainstream public opinion of the society against electronics overnight The anger of the game has intensified to the maximum value. In the next two years, relevant departments have issued multiple regulations to strengthen the standardized management of Internet cafes. This directly led to Li Xiaofeng, a fanatic &quot;StarCraft&quot; player in Ruzhou, Henan at that time, could not find an Internet cafe that could play games for a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;E -sports&quot; has become a proprietary term at this time, and it has become a new entertainment industry that cannot be ignored globally. &quot;Important component of strategy. However, for Chinese society that has just joined the WTO and even looks strange to the Internet, e -sports is not only strange, but also because it is associated with the game, it also looks quite negative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, China held a positive attitude towards e -sports, with a batch of elite elites in the literary system, and more of a group of ignorant young people with pure love. The former is Gao and Widow, and the latter is not serious. Based on common interests, the two groups formed a wonderful resonance in the same time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to prove that they started to launch an impact on the champion, Ma Tianyuan and Weichi Di won the first WCG &quot;StarCraft&quot; project in South Korea in 2001, wearing a five -star red flag in Seoul Deeds, the little earth shocked their hometown and the people who had seen related news at the time -including the later WCG World Championship, Li Xiaofeng, who was still studying in Ruzhou at the time, they learned that playing games actually actually played games. There are also competitions, and they can compete for the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The TV station began to have e -sports programs, which introduced game culture, e -sports events and players, and also broadcast some events from time to time. From 2002 to 2003, the &quot;Game East and West&quot; of Tourism Satellite TV, Shanghai Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;Game Player&quot;, and &quot;E-sports World&quot; of CCTV Sports Channel successively launched, and quickly became the top fist products on their respective channels. Many people&#39;s understanding of e -sports -this is a brain activity based on video games that emphasize competition, honor, professionalism, and teamwork that emphasizes competition, honor, professionalism, and team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Against the background of such a major environment and at the same time, the fire of the stars everywhere, e -sports was listed as the 99th sports competition project by the State General Administration on November 18, 2003 - The household registration was resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The mainstream games or their prototypes of the later e -sports pattern have also appeared before this time. At that time, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Anti -Terrorism Elite&quot; were the mainstream e -sports projects at that time; &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; released in July 2002 will become the new mainstream after a short time; a player named EUL uses &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; 3 The attached map editor produced a battle map called Defence of the Antients &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Defense Relics&quot;) &lt;/span>;. Called DOTA. At that time, the map that seemed very simple at the time will hatch a new type of game in the short after, and two games that support the global e -sports, &quot;DOTA2&quot; and &quot;League of Legends&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The previous work &quot;Flash Dot Action&quot; of &quot;Armed Assault&quot; was released in 2001. This military simulation game developed by a Czech Studio and officially released in mainland China for a period of time is to pursue a high degree of truth. The operation is extremely complicated, resulting in a mediocre market response. However, it won a group of military enthusiasts. One of the enthusiasts named Brandon Green &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti;&quot; (Brandon Greene) &lt;/span>; This game made a &quot;Battle Royale&quot; battle map. In it, dozens of people will be dropped into a map, killing each other until the last person won -he later put this game into the game he participated in the development &quot; Jedi Survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This opening looks incomplete, but it is not bad -if no accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Forbidden broadcast order &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; At 14:00 on September 25, 2023, CCTV Sports Channel broadcast the Hangzhou Asian Games e -sports project &quot;Glory of the King&quot; Asian Games version of the Chinese team and the Thai team. In the end, the Chinese team defeated the Thailand 2-0 to advance to the final. At this time, the last time the e -sports event appeared on the Shangxing Satellite TV channel on Mainland China, it has passed nearly 20 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The successful account has not brought any visible policy support or funding for Chinese e -sports. Compared with the official management method of other sports projects, e -sports can be said to be unattended -until 2004 until 2004 On April 12, 2014, less than half a year after the official becoming a sports competition project, the management department issued the &quot;Notice of Broadcasting for Broadcasting Computer Online Game Program&quot;, which stipulated that after May 1 of that year, including &quot;E -sports World&quot;, All video game -related programs across the country&#39;s open TV channels are stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of these programs have set a brilliant viewing record before stopping the broadcast. Taking &quot;Game East and West&quot; as an example, since the broadcast on July 28, 2002, it has taken the top spot in tourism satellite TV for a long time. Users who watch this show every day have reached about 4 million. The show group received hundreds of enthusiastic audience letters from all over the country every week, and some people packed five -yuan banknotes in the envelope to encourage the program team to make the show. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Yang, a senior e -sports practitioner and the author of &quot;History of Chinese E -sports&quot;, believes that e -sports had a very good mass foundation in China at the time, and the blow to the ban on broadcasting policies was quite serious. The most critical media link in the realization of e -sports has been blocked directly. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The ban on broadcasting policy has actually left a certain space. Paid channels such as &quot;Game Storm&quot; appear. However, obviously, this knife is cut off, the audience market driven by e -sports skills is greatly limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/acahxccfztjrmvp58xdbukhoamww9oubcmomux&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;626&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/acahxccfztjrmvp58xdbukhoamw9oubcmomoxp7.jpg =&quot; 259240 &quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; December 21, 2003, Zhengzhou, the first CS (&quot; Anti-Terrorist Elite &quot;) contest in Zhengzhou, players played the game &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; ( Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; E -sports was almost only one of the business routes proved to be available at the time -like traditional sports, it was sold to sell TV broadcast rights by competition to attract the title, and attracted the names. Sponsorship and advertising are also the classic model of traditional sports commercialization that made Korean e -sports that have developed less than 10 years. Of course, no one can ensure that the Chinese e -sports set can be achieved with this model, but no one knows how other roads are at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Yang believes that, in addition to the realization of monetization in survival, whether e -sports programs can be broadcast on national channels such as CCTV, which can be broadcast on the TV channel. Very different. Even today, even if there are dazzling live broadcast and video communication platforms, as long as CCTV broadcasts e -sports programs, it will still have a different impact. &quot;Advertisers will always calculate its actual monetization ability and influence. For example, why does Nafei take the subscription system? Why is it not enough for selling advertisements? Because the amount and influence of the Internet is not too large enough You can feed the entire system. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Metapleration &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Today, after 20 years of successful hukou, Chinese e -sports has basically solved the problem of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, this road is quite difficult to go. Chinese e -sports practitioners have been forced to explore the way that no one has passed from the beginning. Perhaps God will open another window when closing a door. In 2004, the P2P streaming broadcast technology began to appear in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Using limited bandwidth to ensure the maximum of the video playback P2P live technology, it has almost become the core channel for e -sports. Of course, this channel is far less influential as TV, but it is worse than not. It can be said that the entire generation of e -sports audiences watch various events through the P2P video live platform and witness the Sky Li Xiaofeng and the WNV team to become a world champion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although there are also a lot of viewers, the traffic did not find an effective way of monetization during this period, and few people in the entire e -sports industry could see money. In 2005, Li Xiaofeng held a salary of 1,800 yuan a month at the club and became the world&#39;s top competition top game project championship. reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Next is the crackdown of the 2008 financial crisis.原本就没把电竞领域投放太当回事的赞助商纷纷撤资，赛事停办、预算削减、赞助收回，接下来便是俱乐部裁员、解散，从业者开始另谋出路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终给电竞续命的是一条当时还很新的路——带货。 2010年后，带货的基础条件已具备：第一代的电竞观众逐渐步入社会，有工资收入了；上网购网的习惯开始普及；视频网站崛起，直播平台出现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘洋曾深度参与过这个将电竞内容关注度变现的环节。一开始他们尝试卖玩游戏相关的键盘、鼠标、耳机等配件，但这些东西消耗得很慢，网店回购率很不理想——直到他们开始卖一种零食，肉松饼。 “它很便宜，成本大概不到一毛钱一个，利润率可以达到20%-30%。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了带实体货还能带虚拟货。众多页游也盯上了电竞圈的流量，而且出手相当大方，像页游《神仙道》甚至宣布把70%的收入分给推广渠道。从李晓峰这样的选手，到“星际老男孩”黄旭东这样解说出身的主播，都成了这个模式的受益者。但当年迈出这一步并不容易，李晓峰宣布与《神仙道》合作联运时，一度引起圈内不小的非议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在争议声中，页游联运和肉松饼成功拯救了变现难的电子竞技行业。一部分做视频解说的试水页游联运或者卖肉松饼等小零食大获成功后，现役或退役的知名选手们开始有样学样。 2014年曾有热心网友特地统计过前《英雄联盟》战队WE队长“若风”的网店数据，认为他月盈利保守估计在80万元左右。网店的收入，直接为网红选手或解说们标上了明确的身价，于是后来在直播平台烧钱最凶的阶段，各种直播平台动辄上千万元签约电竞主播的消息开始不断传out. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;厂商时代&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;能让2012年左右刚刚摸索出变现路径的电子竞技在10年后一跃而成收入过千亿元的庞大产业，显然不能光靠肉松饼和直播打赏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年12月4日，腾讯启动“腾讯游戏竞技平台”，即TGA。这个平台之后孵化出来的很多联赛全都比它有名，比如《穿越火线》赛事CFPL、《英雄联盟》赛事LPL、《王者荣耀》赛事KPL。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腾讯开始做电竞也意味着游戏厂商亲自下场做赛事的新模式出现，这一新模式也正好迎合了新一代游戏的营销。在《反恐精英》和《魔兽争霸3》等游戏流行的年代，游戏厂商卖完游戏拷贝基本就可以撒手不管后面的事，电竞赛事很难为厂商带来什么值得一提的后续利益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但对于《英雄联盟》和《王者荣耀》这样的网络游戏就不同了，它们本来就是免费下载可玩的，赚钱靠的是游戏中的附加产品内购，比如角色皮肤.如此一来游戏销售就成了一个被无限拉长且需求在不断被创造的过程。自此，电竞对于游戏厂商而言，有了带货的功能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;资深电竞从业者庄明浩就认为，一个游戏厂商亲自主导自家游戏电竞赛事的格局几乎不可避免，“即便有一个足够强大的第三方出现，它也会慢慢变成第一方谈过。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，厂商自己做赛事的重心难免模棱两可，你究竟是想做赛事生意，还是想做游戏营销？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但10年前这个问题还不重要，不管厂商的目的是什么，它们可能依然是最有动力把赛事做好的人——电竞开始迎来厂商主导的时代，早期第三方此起彼伏、混战不断，随便一个厂家花点钱搞个赛事，然后拉几个俱乐部来比赛的草台班子时代终结。也正是在这个时期，如LPL这样的联赛开始组织起俱乐部联盟、取消升降级确立席位招标制、把线下比赛开进了鸟巢体育场、推行地域主客场制度……一个像样的电竞联赛是什么样子，就此有了模板。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;LPL成了全球规模和影响力首屈一指的电竞联赛，中国电竞的产业规模和社会影响力在这个时期也获得了最大幅度的增长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在LGD俱乐部CEO潘婕看来，电竞内容的好坏是游戏生命力能否延续的核心价值之一。在这样的底层逻辑下，厂商势必将尽自己全力保证赛事的公平性，做好大型电竞联盟管理者的角色，为这个电竞联盟吸引更多的赞助商、粉丝以保证整个电竞内容的healthy growth. “厂商主导赛事相比之前的第三方更持久、更规范、更职业，也更能够保证参赛各方的权益。选手、俱乐部、粉丝、媒体、赞助商以及游戏品牌都能得到自己想要的东西，这对电竞行业生态本身来说是一件很好的事。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;蛋糕&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;大树底下确实好乘凉，不过乘凉人多了，总有被晒到的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国音数协电竞工委发布的《2022年中国电子竞技产业报告》显示，2022年中国电竞产业收入1445.03亿元。但这1445.03亿元的收入中，有81.52%是游戏本身的收入。剩下的18%里，有15.28%是电竞内容直播收入；再剩下的那点，基本由俱乐部、赛事收入平分。不算游戏收入的话，电竞产业实际收入规模约为258亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大头的钱好像都让游戏厂商赚了，并且厂商不见得愿意再分出来。于是这个问题开始变得尖锐起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;厂商赚大头的收入结构在潘婕看来倒是很合理，至于厂商是真心做赛事还是只想靠赛事搞营销，二者不一定矛盾。 “只有更规范、更健康、更良性的电竞赛事生态，才能帮助游戏厂商以及电竞上下游产业共同做大蛋糕，从而源源不断地产出更优质的内容和热点。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;俱乐部的赚钱能力确实也随着电竞赛事的影响力水涨船高。庄明浩记得，2013-2014年间网络公司想买一家LPL俱乐部制服的胸前冠名一年只要20万元，“今天没有2000万元没有人跟你谈的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过真正靠电竞赚到钱的俱乐部依然不多，传统体育项目那种围绕赛事和俱乐部运营展开的生意显然还没真正做起来。 2021年，EDG电竞俱乐部总经理潘逸斌在采访中透露，目前国内能做到自负盈亏的电竞俱乐部不超过5个。而据中国音数协电竞工委发布的《2023年1-6月中国电竞产业报告》，截至2023年6月，中国可查询的电子竞技俱乐部已有191家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄旭东认为国内电竞的商业潜力还没有完全挖掘出来，“我就一直想问，篮球、足球或者包括乒乓球等传统体育项目，在国内的影响力今天能够跟电子竞技拼吗？我觉得篮球、足球可以拼一拼，剩下的哪一个项目能跟电子竞技项目拼？但就很奇怪，一些传统体育项目，流量虽然拼不过，但它的收入远高于电子竞技。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然比起20年前环境有大幅改善，但社会承认度依然是个问题，“还是觉得你是不务正业，年轻人可能认可，但是对掌握着一些社会资源的人群来说，他其实对这个东西的认可度依然没有传统体育那么高。”黄旭东说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/vbHCEfsdmr4LfNjeBubF97TZpEODJIiJlDSxMbI3.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;“星际老男孩” 孙一峰与黄旭东&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;寿命&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;即便厂商主导的赛事体系中各环节都赚到钱了，皆大欢喜，不过还是得面临另一个问题：游戏厂商不止一家，而且游戏寿命必然有限。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;什么游戏会火，会成为下一个统治级的电竞项目，行业里的每一环——厂商、赛事运营、俱乐部、选手、主播或者解说——应该选择哪一条赛道下注，或许可以说出很多门道，但归根结底“看命，真的就是看命”。黄旭东说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如当年凭借《星际争霸》和《魔兽争霸3》如日中天的暴雪无论如何不会想到，《魔兽争霸3》附带的一个地图编辑器竟会孵化出人气远超原作的DOTA .而羊刀&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Guinsoo）&lt;/span>;和冰蛙&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Icefrog）&lt;/span>;还在免费为爱发电、不断更新《魔兽争霸3》里的DOTA地图时，不会想到他们二人后来一个去了拳头游戏做《英雄联盟》，一个去了维尔福做《DOTA2》。暴雪更不会想到，一个自家游戏孵化出的伟大创意，诞生了两个伟大游戏，最后跟自己一点关系都没有。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下一个统治级的电竞游戏项目，是让当下大部分电竞从业者一刻都不敢松懈的存在，哪怕它还没出现。今天中国最具人气的两个电竞项目游戏，《英雄联盟》于2009年发布，《王者荣耀》于2015年发布，它们站在舞台中央的时间比之前的几乎所有热门电竞游戏都要久，位于第二梯队的《DOTA2》和《CSGO》捆一块，收入也赶不上前二者中的任何一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这当然离不开游戏厂商在赛事运营上的精心布局，厂商主导赛事的模式，以及赛事运营水平的提高，有效延续了这个时代很多热门电竞项目的寿命，并且可能也抬高了新游戏项目改朝换代的门槛。潘婕对此评价，“其实还是因为最近出来的可电竞化的游戏项目没有那么优秀，尚不足以对现在的热门项目造成冲击，这就倒逼新的电竞项目必须拿出新的想法来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/O7IperkYCoU0x1xf9UxIr9uEz8XHtcnqtQYWqek3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1795&quot; height=&quot;1198&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/O7IperkYCoU0x1xf9UxIr9uEz8XHtcnqtQYWqek3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月26日，在杭州亚运会电子竞技《王者荣耀》亚运版本决赛中，中国队以2比0战胜马来西亚队，获得冠军&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天挑起中国电竞大梁的这些游戏，收入几乎都在下滑。普通玩家感觉《英雄联盟》排位时间变长，《王者荣耀》排位赛机器人明显变多，就是一个不太乐观的信号。在宏观的数据上，2022年电竞游戏收入1178.02亿元，同比下降15.96%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年横空出世、曾被电竞圈寄予厚望的《绝地求生》因为国内版号问题一直纠缠不清，手机端版本《和平精英》直到2019年才发布，也并没有如期待中那般打开新局面，从2021年起《和平精英》的收入便呈现下滑趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旧王的没落只是时间问题，在新的接班游戏到来之前，“只能寄希望于没落的时间延长了。”庄明浩感慨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;沙特&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;有时候没落是润物细无声的，也有时候没落是电闪雷鸣的。比如《星际争霸2》，随着2023年1月24日中国服务器的关闭，厂商在中国大陆市场终止所有运营，正常渠道登录的中国玩家全部消失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;讽刺的是，差不多半个月后，2023年2月13日，赛前完全不被看好的中国选手李培楠&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Time）&lt;/span>;在《星际争霸2》IEM卡托维兹站总决赛中，以4-1的比分战胜韩国选手Maru，夺得世界冠军。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指望厂商做好赛事也有不确定性，厂商靠谱也就罢了，万一厂商发疯呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以潘婕希望未来专业的厂商赛事和高规格的第三方赛事能实现有效结合，“明年俄罗斯喀山未来运动会以及沙特利雅得电竞世界杯的落地，也标志着高规格的第三方赛事将重新回到舞台中央。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个有史以来最大的第三方逐渐浮出水面。 2023年10月23日，在国际足联主席因凡蒂诺和正在沙特联赛踢球的球星C罗的簇拥下，沙特王储兼首相穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼宣布，沙特将启动一年一度的电子竞技世界杯&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Esports World Cup）&lt;/span>;，首届赛事将于2024年夏季在利雅得举办。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位据说是FPS游戏《使命召唤》老玩家的年轻首相明确提出了一个目标：“电子竞技世界杯是沙特阿拉伯成为全球首屈一指的游戏和电子竞技中心的旅程中自然而然的下一步。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，沙特主办的年度电竞赛事Gamers8开幕。到2023年，它已经成了全球奖金池最大的电竞赛事，被中国网友戏称为“石油杯”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然这个第三方空前强大，但游戏厂商主导赛事的格局也不见得一夜之间会发生什么改变，一轮新的博弈必然发生。黄旭东便发现，两届Gamers8，一直没有《英雄联盟》的身影。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;游戏厂商做赛事固然已经证明是一条相对成功的路径，但黄旭东认为不见得每家厂商都有这个心力，面对做不做赛事的选择时，厂商的心态也很复杂. “有些厂商想自己干，也有些厂商就想把游戏做好，至于电子竞技赛事，可以去合作。如果真有个像沙特这样的第三方，干得很好，投入也很大，厂商也不用花钱，甚至能在里面挣钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄旭东觉得沙特人最大的优势或许就是，电竞作为国家影响力战略的一部分，他们根本不指望靠这个赛事本身赚钱，而是想要每年沙特电竞世界杯开打时涌来的几十万游客，以及游戏公司在本国落地等更大的齿轮，“又有钱，又砸得起，又不要短期收益，他要长期，他要2030&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（指沙特2030愿景）&lt;/span>;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;假以时日，谁也不确定沙特会不会永远只是个第三方。 2022年沙特穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼基金会MiSK还通过旗下游戏开发公司EGDC收购了日本游戏公司SNK 96.18%的股份，从而掌握了知名格斗游戏《拳皇》的版权。这两年，来自沙特的资本对游戏制作厂商、电竞赛事运营公司的投资动作不断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;鸡蛋&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;如今，中国的电竞选手们起码不需要再像当年李晓峰和苏昊那代选手一般，为了省钱来练习而靠吃水煎包或鸡蛋饼过日子了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于29岁的《英雄联盟》退役选手阿兰来说，他出道的时候也不需要像过去那般千回百转才找到一家开在网吧里的随时可能倒下的俱乐部.像他这样有天赋的选手在游戏积分或排位崭露头角后，很自然就会被俱乐部接触，加入战队就有了4000元底薪加包食宿的待遇，基本能心无旁骛地开启专业选手的生活。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当阿兰发现自己年龄不占优势、天赋和实力也没有高到足以让他走向更高台阶时，他在俱乐部的建议下从分析师助教做起，开始从选手到教练transformation.如今他在一家青训营做教练，为更高级别的赛事培养新鲜血液。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青训营无意间还产生了另一种功能：很多自以为有电竞天赋或者根本分不清打游戏和电竞概念的孩子，进青训营按职业选手的方式训练、生活，并见识到了真正的天地后，发现自己不是这块料时，老实回家上学了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今天至少在（电竞）行业有很多从业者，你不至于担心明天没有饭吃是吧？今天做选手，明天还可以转到相关的一些赛道上去，上下游的厂商也在变多……虽然可能大家都活得很辛苦，但是至少有更多分工对吧？”庄明浩觉得，一个发展不过20年的行业能有这般光景，已经很不容易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起不用吃水煎包和鸡蛋饼更重要的是，行业的巨变和震荡变少了，新一代电竞从业者的选择和退路变多了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像“星际老男孩”黄旭东这样的老一代从业者依然不敢懈怠。事实证明他是对的，他作为主播玩了10年的《星际争霸2》，说停服就停服，“从第一天开始就觉得我们做的项目并不是一个特别顶流的项目，所以我们危机感很重。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以这些年除了主播，像MCN主播孵化、网红经纪、游戏广告投放、游戏制作，乃至跟电竞毫无关系的直播带货，甚至医美，“星际老男孩”都有涉及。 “我们尝试过很多事情，有些东西也失败了，但我们永远还是信奉鸡蛋不要放在同一个篮子里。”黄旭东说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;伴随着大众对健康饮食的生活方式的追求，中国人的饮食结构正在往多元化发展，无论是老式还是新中式，抑或是欧式和日式，面包作为烘焙食品的一大分支，正在经历从点心到主食或代餐食品的转变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一方面，趋向饱和的中国烘焙市场竞争激烈，市场规模仍在扩大，未来烘焙赛道更新要求提升。比如零糖产品消费成风，代糖需求引起烘焙产业链的巨大变动，提升工艺、更新设备、创新产品和销售渠道等将成为烘焙行业面临的新挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一方面，消费者对烘焙食品已形成定期购买习惯，沿海地区以及一、二线城市的消费能力较强，其中女性用户和中青年成为拉动烘焙食品消费的主力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;烘焙食品在满足消费者日常生活需求的同时，作为一种文化符号、身份标志以及社交货币占据大众视线，像“citywalk+咖啡+贝果”的组合已成为当代年轻人潮流的生活方式之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;消费潮流的更新迭代，背后是一种集体行动的自我强化——这导致了烘焙行业一轮又一轮的洗牌。前人退场，后人登台，烘焙市场呈现冰火两重天之势：“闭店潮”与“融资热”共存。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;行业大洗牌，不变的是“烘焙刺客”仍然屹立不倒，悬在消费者头顶的达摩克利斯之剑仍未消失.据业内人士透露，某些烘焙高价关键词，每出现一个就加5块钱。那么，年轻人对此买账吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在日本学者三浦展《第4消费时代：共享经济，让人变幸福的大趋势》所提及，“第4消费时代”的趋向是简约、现实、低价和低消费欲望，消费价值观出现社会、地方和共享倾向，这种消费特征似乎在中国年轻消费群体中初露倪端。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;面对“烘焙刺客”，他们拒绝被“割韭菜”，选择更为简单的预制烘焙产品，拒绝被黄牛加价，他们把目光投向社区面包房，线上开团抢面包；拒绝大排长龙，居家手作享受烘焙乐趣与美味，有些高级烘焙玩家甚至开始养酵种，打造烘焙的精神趣味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“知道”跟你谈谈，当面包变得越发吃不起，年轻人会如何应对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/12945c742d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

title=&quot;人类请回答：科幻能否跟上现实的魔幻&quot;>;人类请回答：科幻能否跟上现实的魔幻&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我小时候见过UFO。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是在2008年北京奥运会的前几天。 The time in the county has been worse than the big cities for ten years. The popular flying saucer exploration and the mystery of aliens in big cities will be blown to me when I graduated from junior high school.那个夏天我格外着迷UFO和外星人，在文汇书店看了很多外星人的书，又看地方电视台里寻找幽灵和外星人的节目，我走路时常常突兀停下，往天上望，觉得天上一定有什么也在望着我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有个傍晚，我抬头时终于看到了UFO。那是两个贴在一起的火球，呈橘色，在高空中匀速飞行，飞行器的尾部看起来在喷火。 “你们终于来接我了。”我欣喜地跟着天上的飞行器一直走了下去，完全忘了自己身在陌生的城市，直到它完全消失。后来父母找到迷路的我时，我什么也没说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月，我在成都郫都参加第81届世界科幻大会，脑子里常浮现出那个UFO，我想，在场任何一位科幻迷都不会嘲笑我吧。科幻大会真是热闹的几天，成都科学馆最多的元素就是熊猫和刘慈欣，我读的科幻少，但采访中冒出越来越强烈的好奇：为什么恰恰是科幻，为什么在成都，为什么科幻崛起发生在近十年的中国？与此同时，我像被唤醒了孩童时期对宇宙的模糊情感，是啊，我们一直在猜测世界和宇宙的真相。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人们对科幻作家的期待，也来自科幻作家群体在以往创造的历史，他们在作品中对未来的想象在不断兑现。科幻大会的现场采访结束后，我在离开成都前去了朋友的新书店，成都过去几年中新书店涌现，这家还在试营业的书店叫“白读”，6位创始人里有3位是做web3的。店里第一排大书墙比较特别，非常流畅，先是技术，再到机器,再到互联网、人工智能，整排书籍的尽头，是一列科幻文学作品——关于未来网络社会的想象,里面只有两本中国科幻作家的书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听到我这次出差是采访科幻大会时，做web3的女生拉着我问了半小时，直到我不得不赶去机场乘机。今年她和伙伴们在湾区的一场会议上，来自全球的前沿网络技术人员纷纷表达了对AI接下来即将改变人类命运的恐惧。她近乎急切地不断问我，人工智能已经势不可挡了，为什么中国最顶级的科幻作家没有指明人类社会即将发生的深刻变化？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可是，为什么会对一种文学类型提出这样的要求？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应该没有任何其他文学类型会被赋予这样的期待了。看起来，这几位网络从业者知道技术接下来会创造出什么，但并不清楚技术最终将把人类引向何方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;越来越多的文学论坛，讨论新技术之下的写作和人存在的意义，ChatGPT带来的恐慌是我没想到的，“前面几次工业革命创造的都是物质，这次创造的是精神。”科幻作家、就职于新华社的韩松在采访中说，“更早以前大机器出现，人感觉到要失业，核武器出现，感觉到人类会被灭绝，但是这次不一样。”这更像是一种人类的物种危机，可能被更智慧的生物所更替。如果这就是演化的一部分呢？指明演化规律，也实在不能算悲观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一切真是让人好奇。在郫都的科幻大会，我还是会走着走着突然伫足抬头望，乐不可支。对外星生物来说，见到地球上这群开科幻大会的家伙，一颗颗望着它们的大圆脑袋，也会吓一跳吧，“这群两眼炯炯有神的外星生物，又要怎么写我们了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我们需要怎样的图书馆？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261216]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;一边是有关纸质书衰落的消息此起彼伏，有很多人甚至明确表示，不再购买纸质书，也不看纸质书，只看电子书。一边是很多人仍然苦于没有方便的图书借阅方式，迫切需求社区图书馆等贴近生活的借书地点。未来的图书馆形态，到底应该是怎样的？</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
