On November 17, Ms. Li, who bought the &quot;pillar ticket&quot;, told Nandu reporters that a total of nine audience members filed lawsuits against the concert organizer, Shanghai Rubik&#39;s Cube Pan-Cultural Performing Arts Co., Ltd.

Ms. Li said, &quot;The result of the court trial has not yet been announced. We are waiting for the organizer&#39;s mediation plan. If we still cannot accept the plan they propose, we will wait for the court&#39;s decision.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Li introduced that this Among the 9 spectators who filed the lawsuit this time, 6 were spectators of the May 20th matinee and 3 were spectators of the May 21st matinee. The ticket prices included 1,299 yuan, 999 yuan, etc. &quot;We submitted materials to the court in early August to apply for filing a case, and received news of the court filing the case at the end of August. We all met through social media, and because the early negotiations with the organizer failed, we had no choice but to choose to sue. We wanted to We need to find out whether the organizer has violated our legitimate rights and interests.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Li said that she purchased two tickets for the second-floor stand worth 1,299 yuan on May 20, and the attendance rate that day was quite high. The photo shows that in the middle of Ms. Li&#39;s field of vision is a hollow pillar, and the singer can be vaguely seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Nandu reporter searched for the seat distribution map and found that the two diagonal lines formed by the four corners were basically blocked by pillars, but this was not marked on the page. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the organizer, Shanghai Rubik&#39;s Cube Pan-Cultural Performing Arts Co., Ltd., has responded that it is only responsible for the implementation of Liang Jingru&#39;s Shanghai concert, and the stage will not be built by the company. During the ticket sales stage, the company did not know that the stage design would have four pillars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Li told Nandu reporters that the organizer had said that within the coverage area approved by it, a 200 yuan shopping card would be given as a token of appreciation. &quot;No matter what the price of the ticket, only 200 yuan will be compensated.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The focus of the dispute is whether the organizer should inform in advance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 15, during the court hearing of the case, the two sides focused on &quot;whether the organizer should notify Court investigations and debates were conducted on controversial issues such as informing in advance the existence of &#39;pillar tickets&#39; and whether these locations would affect the concert experience.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Li introduced to Nandu reporters that the nine plaintiffs&#39; requests mainly include three aspects - requesting an order to order the defendant to return the plaintiff&#39;s concert ticket money; ordering the defendant to pay punitive damages to the plaintiff; ordering the defendant to pay punitive damages to the plaintiff; Bear the litigation costs of this case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plaintiff’s attorney said that the focus of this case is whether the defendant informed all the plaintiffs in advance whether their views would be blocked. The plaintiff’s purpose for attending the concert was to “see” it, and having his view blocked was a very serious breach of contract. The plaintiff&#39;s right to know was violated, resulting in the loss of the right to choose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defendant’s attorney said that the reason why the performance used load-bearing columns was because the venue’s ceiling was not load-bearing enough. Without the load-bearing columns on the ground, the performance would not have been able to be held normally and would not have passed the safety approval. So the ground load-bearing columns were used. Columns are also common practice in the industry. &quot;It is common sense that certain positions in the auditorium will inevitably block the view. The defendant has never deliberately mentioned in the publicity that there are no pillars or obstructions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plaintiff believes that the design and layout of the scene It should have been completed earlier. Before the concert begins, the organizer should also fulfill its corresponding responsibilities, inform consumers whose vision will be blocked, and ask them whether they want a refund or other solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defendant’s attorney stated that the defendant set up the stage mainly for safety reasons and did not intentionally deceive the audience. Moreover, this performance is the first stop of a series of tours, and they cannot be harshly criticized for considering so many things in advance. details. The response methods for other subsequent performances were improved after being affected by this performance. The first stop cannot be required based on the handling plan for subsequent performances; nor can it be considered that the defendant did not inform the defendant in advance just because the line of sight was blocked at some individual performances. There is an intention to deceive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 3 pm on the 15th, the trial of this case ended, but the verdict was not announced in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The China Consumers Association has criticized the phenomenon of &quot;pillar tickets&quot; by name&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Concert organizers have dealt with &quot;pillar tickets&quot; differently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nandu previously reported that on August 14 this year, Shanxi Xingtai Lighting Culture and Entertainment Co., Ltd., the organizer of Jay Chou&#39;s 2023 Carnival World Tour Concert in Hohhot, issued an announcement saying that it would meet the needs of fans and allow more Fans can experience the joyful atmosphere of the concert live and reduce congestion outside the concert. After coordinating and fighting with all parties, the organizer will sell the seats with poor visibility in the area blocked by the sound console at a special discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the organizer stated in the announcement that the viewing angle of the seats in this area is affected by the sound console and is blocked to varying degrees. It is impossible to fully see the entire stage. A large screen is set up behind the sound console for the convenience of the audience. Watch, special discounted tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable after purchase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 2, the China Consumers Association criticized the phenomenon of various &quot;pillar tickets&quot; and &quot;wall tickets&quot;, pointing out that consumers encountered &quot;blind selection&quot; of seats when purchasing performance tickets online, and some performance venues did not support consumption. The visitor chose his seat when purchasing the ticket, but when he arrived at the venue, he learned that what he had purchased was a &quot;pillar ticket&quot; or a &quot;wall ticket&quot; with blind spots, which caused a ticketing problem of &quot;only sounds but no people&quot; throughout the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Consumers Association said that relevant performance ticketing platforms and organizers should consider how to better protect the rights and interests of consumers and improve the consumer experience from the perspective of promoting the release of consumption potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说 | 陈云生：宪法监督的研究任务依然任重道远]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260736]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chen Yunsheng, the first Ph.D. in constitutional law in New China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in 1942 in Pinggu County, Beijing (now Pinggu District);&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1966, graduated from the Law Department of Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law (now China University of Political Science and Law); worked in Guangxi after graduation Served in judicial, education, and administrative work; in 1978, he was admitted to the Law Department of the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences for further study.

He planted beans, sweet potatoes, pumpkins and corn on a piece of wasteland he &quot;claimed&quot;, and irrigated and cultivated it from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The interest in farming stems from his background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This rural boy, born in Pinggu in 1942, is the first high school student, the first college student, and the first doctor of law in the village. In 1966, after graduating from Beijing University of Political Science and Law (now China University of Political Science and Law), he was assigned to rural areas in Guangxi, where he ate and lived with farmers, waking up to the steaming heat of beef and feces every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the country resumed the postgraduate examination, he relied on a &quot;survived&quot; constitutional law tutorial and was admitted to the law school of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences with the first score in the reexamination. graduate School. Later, he studied for a doctorate and became the only student of the famous legal scholar Zhang Youyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During this period, he read all the professional books in the law school and went from a &quot;minion&quot; in constitutional law to &quot;the first person in the country to supervise the constitution.&quot; In 1980, he participated in the formulation of the &quot;82nd Constitution&quot; amendment. He always believed that the true meaning of the Constitution did not lie in the constitutional document itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On his academic journey, he did not like to participate in administrative affairs and turned away many opportunities. He laughs at himself as &quot;a lonely ghost in academia&quot;, who only seeks to achieve the ultimate in knowledge and will never be swayed by trends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He advised students to endure loneliness. He always followed the third item of Descartes&#39; code of conduct: he always only sought to overcome himself, not to overcome fate, but only to change his own desires, not to change the order of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;God helps me&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After retirement, what is your daily life like now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I usually get up at four in the morning, have something to eat, and then go to the river. exercise. I used to run or walk. After I got seriously ill in May or June this year and was exhausted, I cycled for an hour to exercise. Then come back to research or write for an hour, then make breakfast and clean up. After breakfast, I go to work in the fields, usually for two hours, and then come back to continue my research. Two days ago, I was still harvesting vegetables grown in the fields. After lunch break, I worked at my desk again. Then I went to the fields to do some work, and then rode a bike for exercise in the evening. There are no weekends or holidays, and I don’t know what day of the week it is every day. It has been the same day for decades. For me, going out to give lectures and attend societies is also a rare way to rest. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There are not many old people like you who are still farming in their eighties. Why do you live such a life as a farmer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My family has been poor farmers for generations. There are five brothers in the family, and I am the second oldest. When I was a child, Confucius said, &quot;I am a young man, so I can do many despicable things.&quot; In addition to going to school, I had to help the family with work, planting fields, harvesting wild vegetables, chopping firewood, feeding pigs and cows, and I did all the work that rural children do. Pass. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was about to enter middle school, a junior high school was established in a neighboring village. Children from the eastern, southern and northern areas of Pinggu could go to school. As a result, after we registered, Found that there was only an open space. The first thing we do when we go to school is dig the foundation and build the house. It took more than half a year to have a classroom and a canteen, and a simple basketball court was built. The students borrowed villagers&#39; houses as dormitories and kitchens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, the school funds were not enough, and there happened to be a shoe factory that made cloth shoes, so we contracted part of the factory&#39;s projects. My shoemaking skills were relatively good, so I was made a supervisor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the high school entrance examination, the whole county accepted more than a hundred high school students. I was the first in the village to pass the high school entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the college entrance examination, only three subjects: mathematics, Chinese and chemistry. In the summer, I lay on the field or on the hillside and looked at the clear sky. Meteors came one after another, and the Milky Way was clearly visible. So when I applied for my college application, my first choice was the astronomy department, but only a few people were recruited, so I failed. Beijing University of Political Science and Law was my last choice. My grades were up to standard and I was admitted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In your time What is college like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I entered school in 1962. The schooling system was first 5 years and then changed to 4 years. , mainly studied political and legal subjects. In the first two years, he studied Marxism and criticized revisionism. During this period, he also organized a trip to Emei County, Sichuan (now Emeishan City) to carry out the &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot; movement. After graduating from college, I was assigned to Guangxi, but the receiving unit in Guangxi sent a telegram: &quot;Please postpone your registration.&quot; This was postponed for two years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; When you went to Guangxi two years later, what impressed you most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I just arrived at my workplace in Guangxi. I haven’t settled in yet and haven’t unpacked my luggage yet. The leader organized employees to beat gongs and drums and send me to the countryside to receive education from poor and lower-middle peasants and undergo labor training. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was assigned to a village on the China-Vietnam border, eating and living with farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I live on the lower floor of the building, with the soles of my feet facing the cowshed. The space under my bed is not wasted, and I have a litter of puppies, which are close to my ears. It&#39;s the chicken coop next door. At three or four o&#39;clock in the morning, a cow started to defecate. The smell of feces was steaming, and it immediately spread to the entire building. Then the dog under my bed also started to defecate. These are small things. I clean up dog excrement every morning. Cow dung smells bad, but it doesn’t touch my body. The most difficult thing is the rooster, which makes me unable to rest. &lt;p>; Like a decent and authentic farmer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;My biggest achievement in rural Guangxi is that I endured hunger and hardship, tempered my perseverance, and laid a solid foundation for my subsequent development in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you decide to participate?

Although I went to college, I had no room for improvement and felt that my personal future was bleak. On the other hand, I have a strong sense of ruralism and cannot leave my hometown, so I still want to return to the north for development. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​day in 1977, my wife suddenly asked someone to bring me a message from the county seat, saying that the country wanted to recruit graduate students. I learned about it and it was indeed an opportunity. But I didn’t study very well in college. I stayed in the countryside for another 10 years without reading newspapers or listening to the radio. I thought at that time that the number of undergraduates we graduated in 1962 was more than 400. If we add those who graduated two or three years ago, there would be more than 1,000. Many of these people have married and established businesses, and many have become leaders and have stable incomes and families. Therefore, there are definitely not many people who applied for the exam, probably only a hundred or so. I decided to give it a try and reported it to the county leader. He was very supportive and let me go back to the county to prepare for the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After all, put down the book for ten How many years have passed, how to prepare for the exam? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There was only two months of preparation time. The first problem was, I I can&#39;t find any books, especially no professional books to read. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another problem is English. The English I learned in college is basically wasted. I borrowed junior high school textbooks and started learning from ABCD. I was completely unsure. After studying for two or three months, I thought I had made some progress and was ready to take the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then how to deal with it in the end What about the exam? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The day before the exam, I was still memorizing textbooks, the 1975 Constitution and the Some newspaper articles. God helped me with the exam questions. I remember that the title of the essay at that time was &quot;Follow Chairman Hua on the New Long March&quot;, and the legal theory examination question only had five words - &quot;The French Civil War&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Leading the new Long March, the compositions are all relatively familiar political discourse. Naturally, whether it will be difficult for the candidates depends on their personal performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the preparation for the exam, I borrowed some Marxist-Leninist books. I have repeatedly read the articles about proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship in the book, such as &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot; and &quot;The French Civil War&quot;, and have gained a lot of experience, so it is natural to answer the jurisprudence exam questions smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was left with no knowledge of English, so I was happy as soon as I opened the test paper. It was an English report from the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; about learning from Dazhai in agriculture. I don’t speak English well, but I am very familiar with the feats of Dazhai people in transforming the world and the professional terms involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, if you were asked to translate &quot;seven ditches and eight beams&quot;, I don&#39;t know the English words for &quot;gou&quot; and &quot;liang&quot;, but when I saw &quot;seven (seven)&quot; )&quot; and &quot;eight&quot;, I immediately knew that this must be Qigou Baliang, and I passed the English test at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After the adoption of the 1982 Constitution, &quot;little fame&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is life as a graduate student different from what you imagined? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Goed to school on September 1, 1978, and registered at the Law Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Later, I discovered that there was no school building for graduate students. The school leaders went to Beijing Normal University to borrow space. We built a simple classroom with linoleum in the open space between other people&#39;s buildings, and borrowed the building to use as a dormitory, with 8 people in one room. This is how study and life at the postgraduate level are settled. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than a year later, the Graduate School of the Academy of Social Sciences also found it inconvenient, so they asked us to move out and live in Beijing No. 11 School again. go. Usually, we go to the School of Law of the Academy of Social Sciences for classes and come back after class. I study for 12 hours a day, exercise for 2 hours in the morning and evening, and sleep for 6 hours. After studying hard for three years, my academic performance was quite good, and the school leaders were quite satisfied with it. After graduating with a master&#39;s degree in 1980, I stayed at the law school to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is related to undergraduate graduation Later I was assigned to work in rural areas of Guangxi, and my experience was completely different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;That’s true, especially when I entered the work and formulated 82 Working on the Constitution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; What specific jobs have you been involved in? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The work of amending the Constitution was mainly led by the then Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. The director, Mr. Zhang Youyu, is in charge, and a secretariat is set up to be responsible for research and drafting work. At that time, Wang Shuwen, director of the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was a member of the Secretariat, so Zhang Youyu naturally handed over some of the academic research and data preparation work of the Secretariat directly to Wang Shuwen. Every time Wang Shuwen received a task, he hurried back to the law school and summoned all the staff to divide the work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The five of us are generally not allowed to leave the unit and stick to our jobs 24 hours a day. As soon as they come, we are instructed to conduct research immediately and write research day and night. Report, at that time we could only take a brief rest in the office. It was late at night, and we bought a bowl of instant noodles to eat by ourselves. At that time, it was difficult to find information, and the academic world was in a state of desolation. There were books transferred from Tsinghua University and Peking University in the law school. No one had read them for more than 20 years. The dust was an inch thick, so I dug through the dust to look for information. From the beginning of preparations in 1980 to the completion of the constitutional amendment in 1982, we persisted in this way for more than two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The process of constitution-making is complicated. We are only doing the most preliminary work. After the report is submitted, experts from the Secretariat will collect opinions from all parties and then bring it up to the leadership level. After the draft was passed, the People&#39;s Daily published a total of three solicitations for opinions. At that time, people were very enthusiastic about participation, and they may have hoped that through the formulation and implementation of the Constitution, the social disorder and national chaos like the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; could be ended forever. During the public participation in the discussion, more than 3,000 opinions were collected, and some people even suggested which words and punctuation should be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Participated in the formulation of the 1982 Constitution Has the related work had any impact on you personally? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; After the adoption of the 82 Constitution, the Constitution suddenly became a major event that attracted national attention. First of all, there was a lot of publicity. At that time, even &quot;little minions&quot; like me published hundreds of articles on tofu cubes in newspapers. Publishing houses have also requested manuscripts from us, from leaders to experts to little people like us. I was extensively involved in publishing dozens of pamphlets promoting the new constitution. In the process, I became &quot;a little famous&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Speaking of Mr. Zhang Youyu, what special impression do you have of him? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because of the amendment of the Constitution, I had contact with Mr. Zhang Youyu, who was eight years old at the time. When he was more than ten years old, he thought the articles I wrote were more interesting, so he liked to ask me to help him write manuscripts, and then he would revise them. I actually took on the job of his writing secretary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Around 1982, leaders of the State Council advocated the cultivation of academic successors by several senior experts in the traditional &quot;master-apprentice&quot; format. Mr. Zhang Youyu chose me at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After more than a year of studying, the country changed the inherited master-apprentice model and officially changed it to a modern doctoral education system. I took the state-mandated doctoral examination, which included jurisprudence, constitutional law, English and politics. I was the only candidate and thus became his doctoral candidate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;As a scholar, we must maintain a &quot;normal mind&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt; strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You studied constitutional law with Mr. Zhang. How did you later pay specific attention to constitutional supervision? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because after the implementation of the 1982 Constitution, it is only a textual legal provision. However, whether the implementation process of government agencies is just and rational, and whether the implementation and supervision mechanism of the Constitution are scientific, all need to be continued to study. Naturally, I entered into the study of the theory of constitutional supervision. Judicialization of constitutional supervision has been my main focus for more than ten years. I have published three books, one of which is my revised and expanded doctoral thesis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fate of constitutional law is to deal with the highest power of the country. At that time, I strongly advocated changing the Legal Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress into the Constitution and Law Committee. This was proposed by me, and was repeatedly demonstrated by generations of constitutional scholars. In 2018, the &quot;Constitution and Law Committee&quot; was finally established in the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think about academics? Relations with politics? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Academics cannot be separated from society, nor can they be completely isolated from politics. There are quite a few scholars who place their main academic interests and attention on directly serving real-life politics and law. This is understandable. Of course, people need to study practical problems. This is also a university knowledge, and it is a more difficult knowledge. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;The problem is that people who do this kind of knowledge should adjust their mentality. You must be mentally prepared that not all research reports and suggestions for improvement that address practical issues should or may be accepted and adopted by the relevant political decision-making bodies. We have said that theoretical conclusions and political decisions do not always coincide. Theoretically, it is necessary to study physics carefully and observe the subtle details, while in politics, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons, pursue advantages and avoid disadvantages. The two stand on different positions and pursue different value goals, so the conclusions and decisions will naturally be different. As a scholar, it is important to maintain a &quot;normal mind.&quot; It is naturally a happy and encouraging thing to have your opinions adopted. Even if your opinions are not adopted, you should not feel disappointed or discouraged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; As far as you&#39;re concerned, what&#39;s the fun in learning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My book has been published. If someone reads it and experiences it, do you think it’s good? Just accept it, if it’s not good then reject it. However, we do not consider its impact when doing scholarship. That is a matter of whether contemporaries and future generations agree with it. It may be thirty or fifty years before anyone is interested in reading the book I wrote in depth. I know that at that time there was a scholar who had done such research and had such advanced ideological understanding. I don’t expect anyone of this generation to understand. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Doing academic work is not only for gaining practical benefits, but also for learning. &quot;Liangzhizhi&quot; and a means to support my family. In addition to doing academic work, I also want to increase my knowledge. I groped forward according to my own research ideas, had the courage to explore, studied all my life, and was willing to be lonely. I would never be moved by the trend or follow the trend. So I laughed at myself at a certain society and said that I was a lonely ghost in the academic world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;I just want to learn this knowledge thoroughly and achieve what I think As mature as you are, you can enjoy it. My students said that 30 years later, they are still studying the topic of &quot;constitutional supervision&quot; that I studied at the time. Because the research task of constitutional supervision has a long way to go. In my academic career, I have gone through a meaningful and tortuous path. If I can achieve the ultimate in this aspect of knowledge, it will be a blessing to be able to masturbate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&quot;For this reason I am&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Nowadays, young people, whether they are looking for a job or taking postgraduate entrance examinations, are facing fierce competition, and they are also relatively confused. . What advice do you have for young people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have taught at Beijing Normal University for seven or eight years, and I have a deep understanding of this situation. When a master&#39;s degree or doctorate is admitted, the first thing to do is to take exams, such as judicial qualification certificate, computer certificate, IELTS, etc. You have to take five or six certificates in three years, so how can you have time to study and read? Now that you&#39;ve almost passed the certification exam, it&#39;s time to send out your resume and look for a job. He waited until two weeks before the defense of his master&#39;s thesis before he hurriedly put together the paper, and its quality can be imagined. I always tell students that if they study well, they will not have to worry about finding a job in the future, and gold will shine. This society must always be supported by people with knowledge and vision. But secondly, the competition in society is so fierce that people will be unemployed immediately after graduation. Nowadays, many people deliver food after graduating from Ph.D., which is very realistic. If you set your starting point so low in the beginning and just find a job to support your family, how can our society progress? In the past, we talked about &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, but now I think it is &quot;I am, therefore I am&quot;. The reason why you are who you are is because of the things you have done. Personal self-realization and success always require a lot of effort or even a lifetime of effort. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the current master&#39;s and doctoral training system? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yunsheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think our current training system is a kind of indoctrination education, and it is strict and strict. out. When I was studying for my Ph.D., the teachers only had one class every three to five weeks. They mainly relied on themselves to go out to listen to lectures and academic conferences, and tried their best to expand their knowledge. When I was studying in the United States, the school invited a professor from another school or our own school to give a keynote speech during lunch every day. Others listened while eating, or put down their knives and forks and raised their hands to ask questions, and no minute was wasted. Today’s students are also less active in participating in academic activities. Therefore, the main difference between the current and previous training models is that one is indoctrination and the other is heuristic; one is open and the other is closed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江苏205国道将收费引质疑：公共福利易涨难降，能否推进有待观察丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260825]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a toll station was built on the Huai&#39;an section of 205 National Highway in Suqian, Jiangsu, and the news that vehicle tolls will be collected soon has aroused social concern. great concern and doubt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to China Jiangsu Net, on October 20, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved that after the Suhuai Toll Station of National Highway 205 is completed and meets the traffic conditions, it will be managed as a government loan repayment road and jointly operated by Suqian and Huaian. Charges have been set and the charging standards for various types of vehicles have been determined, ranging from 10 yuan to 50 yuan. Media reports indicate that the toll station has been built. This means that tolls may be activated on this section of the national highway at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;New toll stations on national highways! Many people believe that this is contrary to the country&#39;s policy of gradually canceling ordinary highway toll stations in recent years. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Transportation Department stated that the toll collection of first-class highways for which the government repays loans complies with the policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the current &quot;Toll Road Management Regulations&quot;, roads constructed by the government using loans or paid funds raised from enterprises and individuals can collect tolls upon approval. The Suqian and Huai&#39;an sections of National Highway 205 were built with government loans. According to the Jiangsu Transportation Department, this section still has nearly 1 billion yuan in debt to be repaid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After sorting out the historical context of the Suhuai Toll Station on National Highway 205, we can find that the toll collection on this section is not a recent decision. In the early 2010s, the Suqian and Huai&#39;an sections of National Highway 205 were successively renovated and expanded and upgraded to first-class highways. In 2014, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved in a document the establishment of a toll station at the junction of National Highway 205 Huai&#39;an and Suqian, and the two cities will jointly charge fees. In 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Development and Reform Commission approved the feasibility report for the construction of the toll station. Today, the toll station is built and the provincial government issues documents approving the toll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the minds of many people, only expressways still charge tolls, and all other ordinary highway toll stations have been abolished. However, in fact, there are not only ordinary highway toll stations, but they have increased in the past two years. According to information released on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation, as of December 2022, there are still more than 10 national and provincial highway toll stations in Jiangsu Province. Also on National Highway 205, more than 90 kilometers north of Suhuai Toll Station, there is Xinyi Toll Station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the National Toll Road Statistical Bulletin of the Ministry of Transport, at the end of 2021, there were 308 first-level highway main line toll stations and 115 second-level highway main line toll stations across the country. Compared with the end of the previous year, there were 308 second-level highway main line toll stations. The toll stations were reduced by 7, but there were 8 more toll stations in the first -level highway, and the total mileage of the first -level highway for charging was 17,600 kilometers, an increase of more than 200 kilometers from the previous year. According to media reports, since 2022, the provinces have added at least 7 national toll stations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, in recent years, the cancellation of charges for ordinary highways has become a trend. The central government has repeatedly proposed to reduce the cost of road transportation and reduce the cost of crossing the bridge. As early as 2009, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Finance jointly issued a document, requesting that the government&#39;s second -level highway charges were gradually canceled in an orderly manner. The draft of the &quot;Regulations on the Management of Toll Highway&quot; announced in 2018 stipulates that the first, second -level highways and independent bridges and tunnels announced by new charges must be stopped. Only highways can be charged. However, this revision has not yet been completed. In 2020, the General Office of the State Council forwarded the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Transport &#39;Implementation Opinions on Further Reduce the cost of logistics, and once again required to ensure that the overall burden of the truck&#39;s traffic fee was not increased. Based on these policies, a large number of toll stations have been canceled across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, although Jiangsu&#39;s newly built 205 National Highway Suhuai Toll Station is not inconceivable, although the section of the road is based on loan renovation and charging loans at the beginning of the expansion. Loans, and there is still a huge loan, but it is not paid off, but at this moment. In the early 2010s, the first -level highway of the newly rebuilt charging charging was still allowed, but after a few years, the policy has shifted. Except for the highway, the central government has not encouraged or even clearly proposed to stop the first and second -level highways of new charges. Many places have also been revoked. A large number of toll stations on the first and secondary roads. Especially in the past one or two years, affected by the epidemic, the economy is recovering difficulties. In this situation, a new toll station has been added to increase the public&#39;s traffic costs. Of course, it will be questioned by the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although there are no explicit regulations, &quot;national highways such as national highway should be free&quot; have become &quot;common sense&quot; in the public minds of the public, just like highway holidays for free. Once this psychological expectation is formed, if you want to reverse, of course, it will be questioned. Welfare from scratch, from nothing to difficult. From charges to free, from free to difficulties. Previously, the public would think that the public would benefit. But in turn, free of charge before, now they have to charge, everyone will feel that their own interests have been infringed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not only is this public policy, but the same is true of the business field. From the beginning of the Internet, various services are almost free to ordinary users. Netizens are accustomed to enjoying free services. Once they start charges, they must pay for videos to use large -capacity, high -speed download network disks, and of course they will feel very uncomfortable. Broadband and data traffic has been charged from the beginning, and no one thinks these should be free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the real free lunch is actually not existing. To watch free videos, you must endure a lot of advertisements; if you use free network disks, you can only endure the download speed of the small water pipe. Similarly, public welfare also needs to pay for it. The national highway does not charge, and the cost of building and maintenance is indispensable. It can only be produced from fiscal revenue such as taxation, that is, the taxpayer is required to pay together. If the local government has enough fiscal revenue, it is certainly not a problem. However, if financial tensions are tight, I am afraid that it can only reduce the expenditure of road repair and raising, or the idea of ​​charging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 205 National Highway Suhuai charges to prepare for charging at this time may have something to do with local financial difficulties in recent years. However, after attracting great attention and opposition, it remains to be observed whether it can continue to advance. Although Suqian and Huai&#39;an in northern Jiangsu, the economy is not so developed than the economy in the southern Jiangsu region, but compared with many places in the west, after all, it is still much prosperous. Caves. What&#39;s more, Jiangsu, as the second economic province in the country, should have enough financial resources to transfer and pay the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, if the national highway and the provincial highway cannot be charged in the future, will the enthusiasm of the local government&#39;s new road will be greatly reduced? This is also worth paying attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[的里雅斯特：微型世界丨意长意短]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260814]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-18 10:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/23/ 11/17/GFLG06M7CGDUE6NVUXAXWXKLLUQ2SXGEMB5ummec.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 736 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/medias/i MAGE/23/11/17/GFLG06M7CGDUE6NVUXAXWXKLLUQ2SXGEMB5umMec. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258623 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; 1895, Riyaste&#39;s style. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Every time Riyaster goes through, you have to go to the ancient San Marco cafe to sit for a while for a while . The city has the best coffee in Italy, and the headquarters of &quot;Illy&quot; is here. Like many cities that have been silent after glory, half of the city is reality, half of the text. Riyaster used to be the most important port of the Austro -Hungarian Empire, where the blend of Slavic, Latin and Germanic culture. More than a hundred kilometers away, Venice maintained the world&#39;s attention in a glittering way. Although each stone that built her is from other places, all beauty is artificially beautiful, but at first glance in Venice, it will make it to let the first glance of Venice will make People are amazing and obsessed. In comparison, Riyaster is a dusk city. She is located in the northeast of Italy. It is Slovenia, facing the sea, leaning against the Karst mountain rocks. There are many deep house courtyards on the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The British James Morris, who was once a soldier here -later, became Jane Morris. After World War II, she wrote a full -time writing, became a reporter from the Guardian, and a famous travel writer. In her &quot;Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere&quot;, Riyaster is an unforgettable city. The face. The city has no unforgettable landscape, no unique cuisine, and even no Italian color. In a survey in 1999, even 70%of Italians did not know it belonged to Italy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nevertheless, Riyaster also has her unique charm. This former free port, in the last century, in the dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy, chose to enter Italy. The chaotic past can stimulate people&#39;s imagination and reflection. She is more literary than any other cities. At the beginning of last century, Joyce lived in many places in this city. He was an English teacher and began to write &quot;Ulysses&quot; here. At the time, there were many artists and writers who gathered in the wine. For him, Riyaster was a place where he was particularly liver. Joyce and the gloomy ITALO &amp; Nbsp; Svevo encouraged the Jewish merchant to write, and highly respected his &quot;Zeno&#39;s Consciousness&quot;. Svevo&#39;s text has a relatively slow st for Italian. Most of the texts are a businessman who is torture his conscience, which complements the thought of conscious novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The literature of this city also has a continuity. The contemporary Riyaster writer Claudio &amp; Nbsp; Magris also has the depression of Savid. It is not surprising that German translates into Italian, because Magris is a professor of German literature at the university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Writers want to present a city, it is actually difficult to reach her spirit and soul. Magris has been talking about this land. As the most important seaport of the Austro -Hungarian Empire, Riyaster&#39;s once brilliant history made her currently dim, and the whole city was shrouded in a twilight. Magris&#39;s writing is a pursuit of the tradition of Lyaster literature in a sense, and it is also a kind of attempt close to real. His &quot;Micro World&quot;, which won the &quot;Straiga&quot; award but is incredible, has many texts related to the space of the city and past literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person&#39;s life experience is limited, and it is difficult to conclude a profound connection with the vast world. Sociologist Xiang Biao proposes the concept of &quot;nearby sex&quot;. Magris is a model of practicing &quot;nearby sex&quot;. He lives in this city, understands here with a tenacious scholar, and go deep into his life here. His &quot;miniature world&quot; is actually composed of cafes, parks, and Shengxintang. After reading his &quot;micro -world&quot;, and then seeing San Marco cafe, parks and the Holy Heart Hall nearby, you will recognize every thing, and think that the world is what he described. The St. Marco Cafe in 1914 opened in 1914. The ceiling is extremely high. There are leaves and coffee beans on the top. The ebony bar and the walls of the wall stand steadily standing there. You will recognize the mask behind the counter. The golden coffee machine identified by the Flying Eagle, the lion -shaped table legs under the table, reminiscent of Venice&#39;s sacred Marco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The ancient coffee shop in the city resisted the times in its own way. At the San Marco cafe, the bar is still dignified dark wood, and the decoration on the tables and chairs and walls is still a hundred years ago. Its &quot;L&quot; structure, one of which has been transformed into a bookstore, full of nostalgic books. The most conspicuous place is Margiris&#39;s &quot;Mini World&quot;, which are dozens of pages in this book describing the past and present of the St. Marco Cafe. The cafe is the living room of the city. An open public space, some faces have disappeared, and new faces appear. In this city space, the history of literature is recorded. The San Marco Cafe is a place where the &quot;Xiangke&quot; of literature is often gone. Everyone hopes that the &quot;Ark&quot; of this culture will exist in their own way. In addition to drinking coffee, this cafe can also eat delicate pasta. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Out of the cafe, you can go to a nearby park to take a walk to breathe. The park is a towering French sycamore. The sun is sprinkled from the leaves, and the golden light is shining, falling in a pool in the garden, which is described by Magris. There are bench everywhere in the garden. People read newspapers, read books, or just sit away. In the innermost of the park, there are children&#39;s playgrounds and an open -air cinema. There are statues of city celebrities scattered around. There is a half -body statue of Joyce wearing a hat and glasses. It was stood at his century in 1982 and the half of the local poet Saba.

There are beaches and hills in this city, so there is a hint of the countryside. Looking at life at heights, but not participating in life, and at the same time, I do n’t feel like an outsider. This is exactly what the city was given to Saba. Magris lives in this city in another way. He exists in a strict ritual, as cautious and solemn as the black and white floor of the Holy Heart Hall. For him, everything is nearby, and it is close at hand. It is like a weekly tour of the world. The clear sanctuary pool of the Holy Heart Hall is like Xiaoquan in the forest open space. The dark light of the church is as deep as the sea at night. Unfathomable. His life penetrates in San Marco Cafe, Street Heart Park, and the two -step Holy Heart Hall, Magris even designed a peaceful ending for himself: under the consolation of the two sons, in the Holy Heart In the golden sky described by the hall, two angels were skipped in the fire circle in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Riyaster in Magris is a dusk city. In 2019, he published &quot;Krems&#39; Bend time&quot; at the age of 80. This is a twilight -filled book. There are five short stories in the book, telling the story of five twilight men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the &quot;Gongwen&quot; is an old man who retreats, a president of the company who once owned several companies. He entered an unknown field to get rid of the reality of facing the enemy. He is the Czech -developed Czech who came from inland. The youthful time is beautiful and big in the world. He successfully played his role, using checks and profits to build a strong armor for himself. However, one day, he left him with the desire for success and his inner panic. He became relaxed, sold his own company, and became a apartment&#39;s door with a calm mood. Once the sea returned to the water again. In the morning, he tried to bypass the road where he could see the sea, took the bus, and walked to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The protagonist of &quot;Music Course&quot; is a Jewish Jewish who entered the twilight years. A survivor with shameful ashamed. He took a car to go up the mountain and go to his former student&#39;s house. The student became a master of music and showed him a piece of music he wrote, which was sorrowful to the tragedy of the Jews, and he also accepted the song frankly in embarrassment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The protagonist in &quot;Crees&#39;s Bending Time&quot; is the closest to Magris. He made a Kafka lecture to have dinner in a city named Krems. At the dinner, some people mentioned the goddess of his youth. Coincidentally, he later contacted her. &quot;Now&quot; has changed &quot;before&quot;, and time becomes bent, leaving only &quot;he &quot;&#39;s thoughts on the god of godlings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Awards&quot; is an old writer to participate in a literary awards ceremony. There is a kind of puppet and relief of the passage of years. &quot;Outside Day&quot; is also an old man who goes to the crew to see the actor of his young age. Everything is different from the previous story, and the old man gets a kiss that he missed when he was a teenager. The five life clips are all by the theme of &quot;old age&quot;, which makes people see the scene of the dusk of the city reflected in life: the sunset is full of relief. Magris accurately outlines some life fragments in a short text. In the past and present at the same time, death became infinitely soft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to Magris, there is a world -class best -selling female writer Susana Tamaro. 》. It was also a twilight woman to make a liquidation of the past era by letters. In addition, there is a recent writer who has been introduced to the country, Jenfrando Caligaric, who has a certain connection with Riyaster. He was born in Asmara in Elitia, Africa, and his family was the &quot;worldist&quot; of Riyaste&#39;s past, and he had a trace of mixed nation in the city. He lived and worked in Milan and Rome. In 1974, he wrote a praise of &quot;Summer Summer&quot;. In the style, there was a trace of youth that could not be erased, and it still exudes endless charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又一中管干部被点名搞“七个有之” | 时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260846]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-18 09:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;IMG Alt = &quot;November 13, 2023, the website Xiong Xue, the deputy mayor of the city, was fired from the law and was expelled from the party.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;近些年，扎克伯格、比尔&lt;span>;·&lt;/span>;盖茨、谷歌创始人等科技圈大佬纷纷向抗衰老领域投入巨资，这些做法引发了各界争议，资本成为研究人类“长生不老”的关键力量饱受道德和舆论的诟病。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;资本终究是逐利的，他们看中的是抗衰老背后的大蛋糕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;数据显示，2015-2021年，全球抗衰老市场规模增长765亿美元。特别在中国消费升级、健康需求深化的情况下，中国延缓衰老的需求日益增长，抗衰老行业持续扩容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随着抗衰老市场规模逐渐扩大，抗衰老产品和医美项目层出不穷，也在潜移默化地影响人们对衰老的认知。对于变老，大多数人担心的是皮肤问题，比如“肤色暗沉暗黄”“毛孔粗大”“眼周老化”是大众普遍存在的困扰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;值得关注的是，衰老不只是中老年人的困扰，抗衰老之风正刮向Z世代的社交圈。在广告的话语框架和社交媒体的种草风波下，越来越多的年轻人也产生了抗老焦虑。而给这群精神受损的年轻人提供情绪价值的，是越来越活跃在种草平台上的各种家用美容仪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“把院线美容效果带回家”。从医美机构独有精密仪器到家用小型化的便捷仪器，家用美容仪深受消费者的喜爱，一些品牌还打出“科技美容”的新概念，即用美容仪器+护肤品结合的方式，吸引了不少年轻人产生消费行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有研究报告显示，42％用户每季度在护肤上花销超过1000元。在经济实力和抗老需求的双重考虑下，35-39岁人群为了颜值买单的意愿最强，21％的人每季度护肤花销超过3000元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，面对几千块的家用美容仪，很多人还是会犹豫其是智商税，什么才是值得购买的抗衰老产品屡屡引发Hot discussion. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;小许是我以前的同事，他晓得我喜欢看书。 I also sent it a few times before, each time a few big books.我不好意思再让他送了，便婉言谢绝了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我这个人有两大爱好，一是散步，一是读书。 The walking makes me refreshing, and reading makes me live. I didn&#39;t take a walk for a day, and I felt uncomfortable; I didn&#39;t read a book for a day, and I had a taste of life on this day. Reading a few pages a day has long become a habit of life.如果某一天没有摸书，睡觉都觉着不香。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前些年，我读的书多半靠儿子从大学图书馆借。儿子的大学是在本地读的，这于我有一大好处，就是可以拿大学图书馆当自己的私人图书馆。这全沾了儿子的光。现在儿子大学毕业，已走上了工作岗位，我也就失去了那种便利的读书条件。儿子离校后，书源一下子就断了，我不得不在家翻箱倒柜，打起藏书的主意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可家中的藏书实在是太有限，满足不了我的需求，闹起书荒来。无书可读的日子，觉得特别漫长，似有漫无边际之感。小许就在这时来电，要送书，我心里一边窃喜，一边觉得不能老是欠人家的情。现在书价不菲，小许也只是个工薪阶层，哪能老是让人家破费？关系再铁，也得有分寸呀。于是我就想到，要是有地方借书就好了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实不是没有借书处，市里的图书馆是可以借的，但有点遗憾，那地方离家不近，来回有十多里路。如此，也就很自然地想到，如果家附近能借到书不是很好吗？譬如社区办的图书室等。可我找不到这样的地方，问人了，也说没听说过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儿子开玩笑说，以后我们买房就买在图书馆附近。这种玩笑即便能成真，那也是远水不解近渴。都说要打造书香社会，可连借书都困难，拿什么来更好地打造？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我承认现在读纸质书的人是越来越少了。可即便如此，该有的公共服务还得有，不能少。我们常说要对困难群体进行兜底式救助，读书也要有兜底式救助，因为总有人买不起过多的书，也总有人面对不菲的书价，掂量再三，而不得不放下，即便爱不释手，也只能忍痛割爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让阅读走进我们的日常，成为生活的一个重要的组成部分，从而提升个体素养与整个社会的人口素质，这是打造书香社会的根本要义所在。不说别的，仅冲着这，我们也需要有能让人就近借阅的场所。这样的场所不需要大，能为人们借阅提供便利即可。至少一个社区居委要有一个这样的场所，大的社区要根据人口分布决定场所数量，而且为节省费用，书籍可以在不同的场所间进行定期流转，从而实现书籍利用最大化，最大程度上满足爱读书人的需求。我不知道这样的愿望能否在现实中得到落实而成真。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为安徽省安庆市市民）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末App“hi，南周”栏目期待您的来稿。投稿邮箱：nfzmreaders@163.com）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雪国芭蕉——松尾芭蕉“奥之细道”行迹（五）丨最深之水]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260812]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/17/fXpujkHdDpeuAavi8nL2NRJEO5JawNmDWrcTl3NZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/fXpujkHdDpeuAavi8nL2NRJEO5JawNmDWrcTl 3NZ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258619&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Matsuo Basho Monument at Inari Shrine in Niigata Prefecture, left picture taken in April 2023 month, the picture on the right was taken in September 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After walking several points on Matsuo Basho’s “Oku no Homichi” in the fall of 2019, Then came three years of COVID. It&#39;s like a big dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early April and early September 2023, in early spring and early autumn, I went to Niigata Prefecture in northern Japan twice, the Echigo country that often appears in ancient Japanese literature. Echigo Kingdom, one of the ancient &lt;span>;Reiji Kingdom&lt;/span>; in Japan, faces the &lt;span>;Sea of ​​Japan&lt;/span>; and is long and narrow from north to south. &lt;span>;Meiji&lt;/span>; Four years later, the feudal domain was abolished and a prefecture was established, named Niigata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Niigata in April, the car was driving among the continuous farmland. The brown rice fields in early spring have just been plowed and are waiting for a new round of sowing. The September trip is already in my plan, so I started imagining the scene of autumn. For large areas of solid color scenes, yellow is the most suitable, and the combination with the blue sky is pure and gorgeous. In the Chengdu Plain where I live, there is a spectacular scene every day in March. The spread of rapeseed flowers is spectacular, and the atmosphere of early spring is quite exciting. Chengdu people who stay at home will basically go out for spring outings at this time, not to let down nature or themselves. Fortunately, I visited Niigata again in early September and enjoyed the sight of golden rice fields and blue sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many swans in Niigata’s deserted fields in April. They are pecking at the grain that falls in the soil. After being fed and fattened, they will fly back to Siberia. It migrates like this every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at these beautiful big white birds from a distance. Has Basho seen them? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Probably not. Matsuo Basho and his disciple Soryo Kawai arrived in Echigo in the summer of 1689. Echigo is a stop on the &quot;Oku no Hosomido&quot;. The entire &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot; journey is a total of 2,400 kilometers of hiking. Starting from Edo, go north, then turn west. It is said that the most magnificent journey is the monk Kukai’s tour of the eighty-eight temples in Shikoku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the trip to Japan in the spring of 2023, the excitement and yearning were mixed with a different state of mind from the trips in previous years. During the three years of the epidemic, except for a few short trips within the country, I have not traveled abroad. Three years of isolation has had a psychological effect on me, leaving me with a faint uneasiness, but I don’t know where this uneasiness comes from. When applied to the body, the hands and feet feel sluggish and sluggish. Having been separated from the same rhythm for three years, the effect is really powerful. The body is heavy and the state of mind is also sinking. I asked myself, what would happen if I never went out again? It seems to be possible. For middle-aged people, three years makes them look older. This is probably an important reason. By September, after a trip to Japan in April, a self-driving trip to Yunnan in May, and several short trips, I felt that my mind and body were beginning to adapt to the journey again, which was very gratifying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My friend Ding Yuan settled in the village of &lt;span>;Niigata Prefecture&lt;/span>; and ran a B&amp;B called &quot;Four Seasons Inn&quot; with her husband, Mr. Nakamura Tatsuo. The couple also ran a local hotel. Various contents of travel. Regarding Basho, what Ding Yuan helped me find out is that Basho and Zeng Liang stayed in Murakami for two nights and three days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Basho accommodation in Murakami can be checked and determined based on local literature, but it has lost its former appearance and has become a salmon restaurant, so the curtain at the door is very interesting. This is a two-story Japanese-style house on Murakami Street. Three Japanese-style curtains are hung side by side at the door. They are written in black on a white background and &quot;Izutsuya&quot; is written in the middle. This is the name of the restaurant. The one on the right is written &quot;Murakami&quot;. &quot;Salmon Cuisine&quot; and a book on the left reads &quot;Basho&#39;s Staying Place&quot;. There is a wooden sign at the door stating, &quot;In June of the second year of Genroku (1689), Basho and Zeng Liang arrived at Murakami during their journey on the &#39;Ok no Homichi&#39;. They stayed here for two nights and three days. , it was called &#39;Sukuzaemon&#39; at the time.&quot; In order to show that the brand was not the store&#39;s own words, the signature was &quot;Mura City Education Committee.&quot; Murakami&#39;s salmon industry is very famous. Every year, many salmon migrate here, and the output and quality are of high quality. Therefore, Murakami has a considerable number of salmon restaurants and processing workshops for curing and drying salmon. I asked Nakamura, is &quot;Izutsuya&quot; the most famous salmon shop in Murakami? Nakamura smiled and said, that&#39;s not necessarily true. It&#39;s because of the influence of bananas, but most people don&#39;t care about this, and only you cultural people care about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/MQzAIBoCpFBy1l4BFMplWcHVyGjQuJFUl4plJrQa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/MQzAIBoCpFBy1l4BFMplWcHVyGjQuJFUl4plJrQa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258620&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho and his disciple Kawai Sora went to the accommodation in the village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basho wrote in &quot;The Thirty-Five Echigo Road&quot; in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; , &quot;As soon as we passed the Mouse Pass, we entered the territory of Echigo from Dewa, and then we rushed to Shizhen Pass in Etchu. We walked for nine days in total. During this period, sometimes the heat was unbearable, and sometimes the cold rain poured down on us, which made us physically and mentally exhausted. Even getting sick was really miserable. So I didn’t record much of my journey.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because Basho was ill during Echigo, there are very few records about Echigo in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. Based on the results that Ding Yuan helped me check, I followed the traces in Murakami in early spring and early autumn. However, it is no longer possible to determine the location of this trace. We can only search for it based on the location of the Basho Sentence Monument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jizo-do Hall in Kamikata Town has the Basho sentence monument &quot;けふはかり人も年よれ&amp;nbsp;First Time Rain&quot;. It can be translated as: Only today do you know that you are old, this is the first shower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inari Shrine has a Basho motto stone, &quot;Cloud folds 々人をやすむる月见かな&quot;. The general meaning I understand is that the shadow of the cloud covers the moon, and the shadow of the moon covers the person. The latter is a sentence from Basho&#39;s seven-part collection &quot;Spring Day&quot;, written in 1685. Basho visited Murakami in August 1689. He probably left no works due to poor health. Next to the Bajiao Monument Monument, there is a haiku poet Su Xian&#39;s Monument Stone. The handwriting is blurry. The general idea I read is: Under the moonlight, the shore of the water is covered with pine leaves like umbrellas (I don&#39;t know if it is correct or not). According to the introduction on the standing plaque next to it, these two stone sentences were erected in October 1843, during the 150th anniversary of Basho and the 17th anniversary of Susen. The introduction also specifically said that there are two important remains of Basho in Murakami, one is the Inari Shrine where this place is located, and the other is the Iwafune Shrine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Iwafune Shrine built on the seaside is much larger in scale and momentum than the Inari Shrine. It has a red torii gate and a white torii gate. In front of the red torii gate, there is a Basho sentence stone, which is engraved with the sentence &quot;On the seventh day of Hanasaki, Tsurumi will see Tsuruga&quot;, which can be understood as &quot;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in seven days, and only Tsurumi can see such a beautiful scenery.&quot; The Basho stone in front of the white torii gate is engraved with &quot;Bunzuki や六日も常の夜には思ず&quot;, which means that the night of Bunzuki (July), when I am anxiously waiting for the letter, is also different from the ordinary night. The former Basho haiku has nothing to do with &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, and the latter line is taken from a line written in the Hokuriku section of &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April, the day before Basho’s tour in &lt;span>;Niigata Prefecture&lt;/span>;, we went to Kameoka Monju-in, the Daishoji Temple in Yamagata Prefecture. In the drizzle, there was still residual snow on the mountain col in the distance and on the roofs nearby. When I was going down the mountain, I suddenly found a Basho sentence monument standing on the roadside, which read &quot;春の夜は桜に明けてしまひけり&quot; (Spring night, cherry blossoms are in full bloom). Tateishiji Temple (Mountain Temple) in Yamagata Prefecture is an important place to visit on the &quot;Oku no Hosōdo&quot; tour of Master Basho and his apprentice. I visited in 2019. I don’t know if they have been to the Great Holy Temple, and it is not mentioned in the book. Someone may have studied the details of these travels, and the results of these studies must be carefully explored to know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to read a lot of haiku in Chinese translation, but over the years I slowly started to read the original haiku. It is true that poetry cannot be translated. Because my Japanese foundation is still shallow, and it also involves issues of ancient and modern Japanese, I can only read these haiku at a loss. But maybe it was in this confusion, after leaking some clear information, that I finally understood the extremely concise and complex semantics of haiku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of Basho&#39;s activities in this area of ​​​​Murakami is Otohoji Temple. During my two trips to Murakami in early spring and early autumn, I went to Otohoji Temple twice. The cherry blossom scenery in early spring is obviously much more beautiful than the scenery in early autumn before the red leaves appear. It is said to be Murakami, but Otohoji Temple is actually located in Tainai City next to Murakami. This temple was built in the 8th century AD under the order of Emperor Shomu who was in office at the time. The temple covers a vast area of ​​more than 80,000 square meters. There is a &quot;three-story pagoda&quot; built in 1620 in the temple, which is designated as a national important cultural property of Japan. This temple is the only ancient temple in Shinji that is included in &quot;The Story of Konsai&quot;, and it is also the temple where Matsuo Basho once visited when he wandered the &quot;Oku no Hosho Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/vg13uYiV1rkOS05OOYFWHKCIRA8y6dKAOdlxPhPL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/17/vg13uYiV1rkOS05OOYFWHKCIRA8y6dKAOdlxPhPL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258621&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho Monument in Otohoji Temple. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the topic, let me say a few words. It was almost noon after visiting Otohoji Temple in early autumn. Mr. Nakamura said that there was a steamed bun shop next to it that was very delicious and he hadn’t eaten there in a long time. We decided to leave it at that for lunch. When I arrived at the door, I looked at the description and found that it was founded in the first year of culture, which was 1804, and has a history of more than 200 years. The shop is really small, with a few stools and two or three tables. When the steamed buns arrived, they turned out to be red bean paste buns. Later, I looked up information and learned that in Japan, the so-called steamed buns are bean paste buns, and the outer shell can vary. There are white steamed buns made of commonly used flour, brown tea steamed buns made of wheat flour, and sweet potato flour, yam flour, and japonica rice flour. There are sweet potato steamed buns and wine steamed buns made from fermented rice flour, etc., but they are filled with red bean paste. Yiboji Steamed Buns are delicious, and I am even more impressed that such a snack shop has a history of more than 200 years. In Japan, I often come across various small shops that are hundreds of years old. I once ate at a ramen shop in Kyoto. When I came to the door after eating, I was shocked to see the signboard. It has a history of more than 400 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I posted photos of my visit to Yibao Temple in WeChat Moments, and a friend asked: Is it the Yibao Temple in &quot;The Story of the Past&quot;? It seems that its name first came from &quot;The Story of the Past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Story of the Past&quot; is a collection of folklore stories from the late Heian period in Japan, with a total of thirty-one volumes and more than a thousand stories. It is divided into Tianzhu (India) (volumes one to five), Cathay (China) (volumes six to ten), and Honchao (Japan) (volumes eleven to thirty-one). The current Chinese version of this Dynasty was edited by Zhou Zuoren. The stories in &quot;The Tale of the Past&quot; are all-encompassing, with Buddhist stories and secular stories mixed together. There are also many stories of gods and supernatural beings. Many creations of later generations come from this book, which is one of the source treasures of Japanese literature. It is similar to Chinese books such as San Yan Er Pai and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Because each volume contains the word &quot;present and past&quot; at the beginning, it is called &quot;The Story of Present and Past&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among Japanese writers, Ryunosuke Akutagawa made full use of &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot;. It is said that about one-fifth of the material in the historical novels he created came from &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot;, including &quot;Rason&quot; Door&quot; and &quot;In the Jungle&quot;. Ryunosuke Akutagawa called &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot; a &quot;human comedy&quot; in ancient Japan. He said that &quot;The Story of Konsai Monogatari&quot; is full of &quot;wild beauty&quot; and is &quot;a kind of beauty that has nothing to do with elegance and luxury.&quot; Many of the common Onmyodo and Onmyoji content in Japanese animations also come from &quot;Kanagi Monogatari&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spacious garden of Uhoji Temple, there is a Basho Sentence Monument, a round stone monument, the handwriting has been blurred. There is a wooden sign next to the stele, which records the content of this stele: &quot;In the second year of Genroku (1689), Matsuo Basho paid homage to the Ukiyo no Kita no Mountain Sakura Basho&quot; (The cherry blossoms of Kitayama, this floating world scenery makes I envy). Surrounding the Basho Sentence Monument are many echoing sentences from &lt;span>;Niigata&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;local&lt;/span>; haiku celebrities at that time. Otohoji Temple has been a famous place for cherry blossom viewing since ancient times. Basho admired the beauty of the northern cherry blossoms here, even though it was not during the cherry blossom season when he visited. Looking at Sakura Leaves, he also expressed his envious mood in his imagination. Two of the echoing haiku of other haiku writers were singled out and written in the description of the stele. They were probably the most famous haiku poets in the area at that time. One of them is not jade, &quot;Mitsukoshi Road や一の Temple の花ざかり&quot;, Mitsukoshi The road and Yi&#39;s Temple are filled with flowers. One song is by Yasuda Izabo, &quot;Different gods and Buddhas&quot;. Different gods and Buddhas all have the beauty of cherry blossoms. They are all sentences praising cherry blossoms. In Japan, the word flower, if not specifically mentioned, is cherry blossom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Niigata in early April, the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in previous years, but the spring of 2023 is coming fiercely, and when we arrived, the cherry blossoms were already a little overdue. In the garden of Otohoji Temple, on the round stone monument of Basho, there are several branches of cherry blossoms hanging down, on the eve of their withering. Behind the stele is a small hill, and on the steps are several red curtains from the temple, with the words &quot;Namo Guanyin Bodhisattva&quot; enshrined. The curtains fluttered gently in the sunshine and breeze. This sentiment and scene complement each other perfectly with the haikus tablet with unclear handwriting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Othoji Temple, like other Niigata landscapes, has very few tourists. I stood on the terrace outside the main hall, watching the yin and yang scene cut by the sun with the Buddha statues in the garden below. I have done this twice. Although the weather seems to be the same, there are obvious differences in the dividing lines between sunlight and shadow in early spring and early autumn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I visited Otohoji Temple again in September and suddenly discovered Kobo Daishi (Kukai) here. I didn’t notice it at all on that trip in April. There is a stone statue of Kobo Daishi Gozun here, which is a common standard shape of Kukai wearing a hat and leaning on a staff during his journey. This stone statue of Kukai is a bit cute, shaped into a pudgy little boy. I turned to the back of the base of the stone statue to read the description. The handwriting was a bit blurry, but I could clearly see the words &quot;Pursuing the eighty-eight sacred sites of Shikoku...to commemorate...&quot; and other words. It is estimated that someone went there before and erected a statue in Otohoji Temple after returning to Niigata. Benji was the monk Kukai&#39;s practice route. It later gradually became the most famous hiking route in the world, with a total length of more than 1,400 kilometers and 88 temples in Shikoku. Currently, more than half a million people from all over the world walk this road every year. This is also a strange fate for us. After seeing Kukai at Otohoji Temple, my friend Dr. Tan Weidong and I left Niigata the next day, flew to Osaka for a short stay, and then headed to Shikoku to start our plan Three years of preparation for the trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[格力电器：董明珠“绯闻”是造谣，已向公安机关报案]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260839]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 17, Gree Electric responded to a reporter from Nanduwan Financial News: &quot;Regarding the recent efforts of many self-media To obtain traffic, maliciously edit relevant videos, and use vulgar and filthy words to insult and slander company executives, Gree Electric has reported the case to the public security organs, which have accepted and filed the case.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanduwan Financial News reporter learned that recently There are rumors on social platforms that Dong Mingzhu, chairman and president of Gree Electric Appliances, is in love with Wang Ziru, the &quot;channel reform project leader&quot; of Gree Electric Appliances.

Wang Ziru appeared as the host many times, and together with Dong Mingzhu, they won 703 million yuan in sales. That year, Dong Mingzhu&#39;s 13 live broadcasts totaled 47.6 billion yuan, accounting for nearly 30% of Gree Electric&#39;s total revenue in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2021, Gree Electric confirmed the news of Wang Ziru joining Gree Electric. At that time, industry insiders said that Wang Ziru’s department was affiliated with Gree’s President Office and Cultural Training and Communication Center. During the same period, Wang Ziru resigned from his position at ZEALER, the media he founded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are rumors that Wang Ziru’s rank in Gree is equivalent to that of vice president, with an annual salary of more than 3 million yuan. However, judging from Gree Electric’s financial reports in the past two years, Wang Ziru has never appeared in the executive compensation table middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After joining Gree Electric, Wang Ziru rarely appeared on public platforms.格力电器也未透露他的具体工作内容。 But from some public reports, he is currently responsible for Gree channel reform project. In late May this year, Wang Ziru, who had been with Gree for two years but had not yet appeared, appeared publicly in Nanchang for the first time as the &quot;channel reform project leader&quot; and spoke at the 2023 Gree Electric (Jiangxi) new marketing model presentation conference. In October and November, Gree Electric Shandong and Hebei Sales Company also issued documents, and Wang Ziru gave a speech at the new marketing model conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that at the beginning of this year, news appeared on social platforms that Gree Electric Chairman and President Dong Mingzhu was in love with his company’s post-85s male executive. The news originated from the big V Gong A screenshot posted by Wen Xiang on the Internet. In February this year, Dong Mingzhu took the initiative to mention and denounced in an interview with reporters from Nanduwan Financial News and other media: &quot;Vulgar, obscene, and boring! It is not an exaggeration to use these words to describe it.&quot; She clearly denied the love scandal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March this year, big V Gong Wenxiang apologized to Dong Mingzhu, chairman and president of Gree Electric Appliances, for his previous remarks in the Southern Metropolis Daily.

In 1980, lead singer John Lennon was shot and killed. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 30, 1969, on the rooftop of Apple Records headquarters at 3 Savile Row, England , the Beatles held a 42-minute impromptu concert. It was almost at the last moment that the idea was settled - they discussed it and then fell silent until John Lennon said, &quot;...let&#39;s do it!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Noon Around 12:30, the four people arrived on the rooftop. As word spread, people began to gather in the surrounding streets and on the rooftops of nearby buildings. That day, Lennon wore a fur coat, and Ringo put on his wife&#39;s red coat. In the biting cold wind of January, the members sang a total of five songs in a loop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert finally came to an end with the melody of &quot;Get&amp;nbsp;Back&quot;. Lennon said humorously to the audience: &quot;On behalf of the band and ourselves, I want to say thank you. I hope we have passed the audition.&quot; However, the public at the time may not have expected that this would be the last of the Beatles. A public performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, 2023, after a span of 45 years, a new Beatles collaboration called &quot;Now And Then&quot; finally came to the public. After the familiar &quot;one, two, three&quot; timer, the accompaniment sounded, and Lennon&#39;s voice slowly flowed out:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;I know it&#39;s true / It&#39;s all because of you / And if I make it through / It&#39;s all because of you&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;……&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lennon in the MV The faces of George and George were still young, wearing bright costumes from that time, playing in the same space as Paul and Ringo. Different from their youthful and fresh appearance, the wrinkles on Paul and Ringo&#39;s faces are clearly visible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It was incredibly touching to hear that they were still working together after all these years,” Lennon’s son Sean said. “It was my dad and Paul and George. , the last song we made together with Ringo.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;We&#39;ve been waiting almost a quarter of a century&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now And Then&quot; The story begins in 1978. Lennon recorded this vocal demo with accompaniment while playing the piano in his apartment in New York. By that time, he had focused on his family and had all but put his music career on hold, not touring or fulfilling any major label obligations. However, in his son Sean&#39;s memory, Lennon would always play music at home and record and make demos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, 14 years after Lennon’s death, during a chat with the Beatles, Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono said that she still had some of Lennon’s audio tapes. She gave them to the rest of the Beatles. &quot;If the three of us were to do something, it would be fun, but obviously not as fun as when John was here,&quot; George said. &quot;We really have to cherish hearing John&#39;s voice. I&#39;m sure he would really enjoy being with us.&quot; A chance to be together again.&quot; Now, that chance has come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We can use Lennon&#39;s music and try to make a record. Since his death, this is the closest we have been to him.&quot; Ringo said. Facing Lennon&#39;s demo tape, Paul also thought, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we do this?&quot; But whenever he thought so, he would always interrupt himself, assuming that if he had the opportunity to ask Lennon - &quot;Hey , Lennon, do you want us to finish your song?&quot; - What would Lennon&#39;s answer be, and he believed that Lennon would say, &quot;Of course!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the song The production was not as smooth as expected. At that time, there was no technology that could separate the vocals from the accompaniment. In a way, Lennon&#39;s voice was actually hidden. Whenever they tried to make Lennon&#39;s voice clearer, the piano accompaniment grew louder, and the effect actually became worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They felt frustrated, &quot;We were kind of losing time and momentum,&quot; Paul said, as if they should abandon the song. &quot;Things cannot progress, and the fact that Lennon is no longer becomes more and more clear before our eyes.&quot; Ringo said. Just like that, &quot;Now&amp;nbsp;And Then&quot; was shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the year 2022. Previously, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; director Peter Jackson&#39;s team developed an artificial intelligence-based technology that can separate specific vocals from accompaniment sounds and repair them. This technology was proven successful in the 2021 documentary &quot;Get Back&quot; produced by Peter Jackson for the Beatles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the help of technology, Lennon&#39;s voice came out of the player again, &quot;as clear as crystal.&quot; &quot;We&#39;ve been waiting almost a quarter of a century for this moment to be able to make Now And Then again,&quot; Paul said. He called Ringo and told him he wanted to continue working on the song, and Ringo readily agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Lennon&#39;s piano accompaniment, Paul also added his own bass part, and Ringo also added his own drum beats. They retained George&#39;s guitar playing from 1995, &quot;which is a tribute to George.&quot; Paul said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A string section was also added with help from Giles Martin, son of the late Beatles producer George Martin. When recording this part, in order to keep it secret, they did not tell the string orchestra that it was a new Beatles song, but pretended it was Paul&#39;s own new single. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“All those memories came flooding back and, oh my God, how lucky I was to have these people in my life… Still making The Beatles in 2023 ’s music, wow!” Paul exclaimed, “‘Now And Then’ should be our last song.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Think of me from time to time, old friend”&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;In February 1964, the Beatles performed in the United States for the first time. As they took off, more than 4,000 fans from Heathrow Airport waved goodbye; when they landed, another group of about 3,000 people greeted them when they landed. On the 9th of that year, the Beatles performed live on the Ed Sullivan Show, attracting about 73 million viewers, which accounted for about 34% of the U.S. population. The popularity of British rock and roll swept the United States with unprecedented intensity. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those were almost the most prosperous years of the Beatles. However, separation and death came to them prematurely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September of the same year as the Beatles&#39; last public performance together, Lennon informed his bandmates during a meeting with Ringo, Paul and their manager Alan Klein They, he was going to quit the Beatles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, due to business, creative, emotional and many other reasons, friction and differences had become increasingly serious, and it seemed that it was only a matter of time before they disbanded. During that meeting, George was absent, and Crane convinced the other band members to keep quiet about the breakup because some important business matters were still ongoing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 10 of the following year, Paul publicly announced his withdrawal from the Beatles, which was also regarded as a symbolic event of the dissolution of the Beatles. At that time, exactly ten years after their establishment, an American media person even claimed that it was &quot;a milestone in the decline of the British Empire.&quot; Asked whether his departure was temporary or permanent, Paul responded, &quot;I really don&#39;t know.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years later, in a media interview, Paul denied that he had caused the band to break up. Due to Klein&#39;s request, they were kept secret about the band&#39;s breakup and had to pretend for several months that everything was normal. He simply &quot;had enough of hiding&quot; and, eventually, &quot;let the cat out of the bag.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following time, even though the Beatles have developed separately, fans still have lingering thoughts in their hearts, hoping that one day they will reunite. However, Lennon&#39;s death directly shattered this hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 8, 1980, after Lennon finished his work for the day, he returned to his residence with his wife Yoko Ono. The two got out of the car and walked to the building entrance of Dakota Apartments. At this moment, 25-year-old Mark David Chapman appeared and shot Lennon five times. Lennon&#39;s heart stopped forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;For everyone who hoped the Beatles would continue to exist, the murder was something else.
