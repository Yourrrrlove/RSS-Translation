According to Myanmar&#39;s &quot;Kokang Information Network&quot;, the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army issued a statement on the same day claiming responsibility for the armed attack and that the operation was to &quot;clear out the electronic fraud militia.&quot; At about 4 a.m. local time on the 27th, the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army launched attacks on military deployment areas, police posts, toll stations and other strongholds in Qingshui River, Gunong, Lashio and other places in Shan State. At about 5 o&#39;clock, many strategic strongholds including Qingshuihe and Gunong were occupied by the Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, when the war broke out, at a regular press conference of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spokesperson Mao Ning said regarding the military conflict that broke out between the Myanmar military and the Myanmar Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA): &quot; China pays close attention to the relevant conflicts and calls on relevant parties to cease fire and end the war as soon as possible, insist on resolving differences through dialogue and consultation through peaceful means, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure the security and stability of the China-Myanmar border.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In addition to the Myanmar Kokang National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA) also participated in attacks against Myanmar government forces. According to information from the Kokang Allied Forces, the three anti-government armed forces have a total participation of more than 15,000 troops, and the fighting is mainly concentrated in northern Shan State. This is the largest battle that has broken out in the region since the Kokang War in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the fighting site is close to the China-Myanmar border, there has been a wave of refugees at the border ports. Relevant departments of the Chinese government have begun to provide shelter and assistance to incoming refugees fleeing the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But how did the war break out? What impact will it have on the future situation of the region? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/igdn0q9Q3pCnq5i7gjYGwF7ElsJnrCTscTGLsPLA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/igdn0q9Q3pCnq5i7gjYGwF7ElsJnrCTscTGLsPLA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256884&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 27, 2023, in Shan State, Myanmar, Major General Peng Deqi (fourth from left) of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army commanded the operation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The battle for survival under the political war&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although Myanmar is a close neighbor of China, the two sides share more than 2,100 kilometers of border, and Myanmar is the largest country in terms of land area and population among the Southeast Asian countries bordering China. However, for most Chinese, Myanmar is still a relatively unfamiliar country, and its presence is quite limited. There are far fewer Chinese people traveling to Myanmar than to neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam or Cambodia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past two years, Myanmar has gained notoriety in our country&#39;s public opinion due to telecom fraud and &quot;Gayaozi&quot; (illegal organ harvesting and trade). With the dissemination of relevant social media information and film and television works, more and more Chinese people have learned that the northern region of Myanmar adjacent to Yunnan is an area where telecommunications fraud and criminal gang activities are rampant, and the local government is helpless and even complicit in this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day when the conflict in northern Myanmar broke out, the Kokang Alliance Army&#39;s social media immediately released a statement titled &quot;Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army, and Arakan Army &quot;10.27&quot; Action Statement.&quot; mentioned, &quot;We will eradicate telecommunications fraud, fraud dens and their protective umbrellas across the country, including the China-Myanmar border areas. The three coalition forces decided to jointly carry out this military operation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement After the release, the propaganda of these three ethnic and local armed forces continued to contain content about destroying telecom fraud gangs and saving trapped compatriots. Among them, the Kokang Allied Forces even released a pre-war mobilization video of a unit of the Allied Forces on the short video social platform. The brigade commander who issued the mobilization order said in a solemn tone: Our mission is to eradicate the electronic fraud group, eliminate drugs, and rescue our compatriots. no confidence! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the soldiers in uniform shouted in unison: Yes! have! have! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are not just a bunch of people who shout loud slogans. When it comes to fighting, the Kokang Allied Forces have always been good at attacking. As early as the Kokang War in 2015, the Allied Forces launched an attack under the eyes of the Myanmar government forces. Not only did the vanguard troops enter Lao Cai, the capital of the Kokang region, on the day the war started, but they also later sniped and killed a Myanmar Army deputy from a distance behind enemy lines. brigadier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the last moment of the Kokang War that year, the Kokang Allied Forces defended the Nantianmen Highlands at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters in the north of Lao Cai for two months despite the artillery fire and aircraft bombings of the Burmese army. In the end, the Burmese army launched a general offensive. , none of the more than 20 defenders who held on to the end surrendered and all died in the battle. Their fighting will shocked even the opponent Burmese army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict on October 27, the Kokang Allied Forces performed even more rapidly. Within just a few days of the war, they quickly occupied the Qingshui River area adjacent to Lao Cai and an important port with China. , captured more than 60 Burmese army strongholds, successfully relied on light infantry to destroy 6 armored vehicles, and completely wiped out the Burmese airborne special forces who came to provide parachute support. Under the rapid offensive of the Allied Forces, a battalion of Myanmar government officers and soldiers organized and surrendered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, which cooperated with the Kokang Allied Forces, fought on the outside. The Ta’ang Army not only attacked Denni Town, but also successfully destroyed the nearby Nanda River Bridge to prevent the Burmese army from using the road to reinforce the Kokang. area. The Arakan Army and the Ta&#39;ang Army attacked the Lashio area and once shelled the most important Lashio Airport in northern Myanmar, causing the grounding of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the current situation, the Burmese military strongholds outside Lao Cai, the capital of Kokang, have basically been cleared. The attack and defense of Lao Cai will probably begin soon. Once the Kokang Allied Forces successfully regain control of Lao Cai Right, then this battle can basically be declared a victory. Compared with the Kokang war in 2015, the current Kokang Allied Forces are closer to their goal, which is to retake Lao Cai and regain control of the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the political narrative of the ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar, they are the positive heroes, and there are also evil villains accordingly. The villains this time are the four Guogan families. The four major families are the Bai family represented by Bai Chengcheng, the Wei family of Wei Chaoren, the Ming family of Ming Xuechang, and the Liu family of Liu Abao. The representatives of these four families are all powerful figures in the Kokang area and are the mortal enemies of the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of the anti-telecom fraud narrative, the four major families are well-deserved as the villains. The companies of these four families have been operating telecom fraud businesses under the name of entrepreneurial parks for many years. , thus gaining a lot of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real international politics or regional disputes, the image of justice is part of the application of power. War is a continuation of politics, and politics often requires the blessing of morality. Destroying telecom fraud to save compatriots is not necessarily just talk. For the Kokang Allied Forces, as long as they successfully recover Kokang and completely eliminate the disgusting industry of telecom fraud, it is not a problem. After all, this is not their source of income. However, if it is said that the Kokang Allied Forces are only going to war to eradicate telecommunications fraud, that is not consistent with the facts. After all, this is not the first war between the Kokang Allied Forces and the four major Kokang families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early on August 8, 2009, before northern Myanmar became a den of electronic fraud, Bai Suocheng, one of the later leaders of the four major families and deputy commander of the Kokang Alliance Army at the time, joined forces with the Myanmar army and other Three major families launched a coup and drove Peng Jiasheng, the first leader of the Kokang Alliance Army, out of the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, after six years of dormancy, the Kokang Allied Forces launched a counterattack against the government forces in the Kokang region during the Spring Festival. At that time, the Kokang Allied Forces launched the attack in the name of returning home for the New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, not only was the last war not successful militarily, but it also did not have a high enough voice politically. It was even easily regarded by bystanders as a battle between warlords and interest groups. This time, the Kokang Allied Forces have grown for more than eight years. Their military, political, and propaganda capabilities are far better than before, and the results are likely to be very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regardless of whether it is counter-terrorism or not, for the Kokang Allied Forces, being able to fight back their hometown of Kokang and regain control of the old street is the basis for their survival. The leader of the previous generation, Peng Jiasheng, died of illness in February 2022. The current Kokang Allied Forces, under the leadership of the current commander Peng Deren (Peng Jiasheng’s eldest son), has left his homeland to fight guerrillas for many years. But this is not a long-term solution. Without the support of their hometown and a solid base, it will be difficult for the team to develop and grow. Therefore, the military conflict that broke out on October 27, 2023, is equivalent to a battle for survival for the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/njM3JUYhKJyfESN1197AS2088mFAwDbyciHIGs5A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/njM3JUYhKJyfESN1197AS2088mFAwDbyciHIGs5A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 4, 2023, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Chairman of the National Governing Council of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing attended the military parade&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Looking at the Kokang from across Myanmar&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of those familiar with the background of the war in northern Myanmar, the Kokang Allied Forces this time It is expected to be invincible on the battlefield, because as early as 2021, an enemy far more deadly than the ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar appeared in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 2021, Myanmar political leader Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested by the Myanmar military at her home and was eventually sentenced to 33 years in prison. For Aung San Suu Kyi, who was already 78 years old at the time, this was tantamount to a life sentence. On the day Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested, large-scale street protests broke out across Myanmar. In the end, large-scale clashes broke out between demonstrators and military police. Many Western countries condemned the Myanmar military government and announced the restoration of comprehensive sanctions on Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), was also banned by the military government. This series of actions basically announced the complete break between the Myanmar military government and the National League for Democracy. This caused the core political elites of the NLD and their supporters to completely cut off the possibility of parliamentary politics. The military government&#39;s violent suppression of demonstrations also caused Aung San Suu Kyi&#39;s supporters believed that the only way to fight against the military government was through force, so they announced the establishment of the National Unity Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Burmese abbreviation NUG). Its political proposition is to overthrow the military government through force and regain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NUG can be regarded as the NLD&#39;s government-in-exile, which announced the establishment of a military organization in 2021: the People&#39;s Defense Forces (PDF in Burmese). On September 7, 2021, NUG announced the launch of a &quot;people&#39;s defense war&quot; against the military government and called on citizens across Myanmar to resist the military government. For the Myanmar military government, this is undoubtedly a greater threat than the local ethnic armed forces in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since independence after World War II, Myanmar’s civil war has never stopped, but the armed forces of NUG PDF are different from the enemies faced by the previous Myanmar government forces. In past civil wars, the main enemies the Myanmar Army faced were ethnic minority armed forces in border areas, such as northern Myanmar and the Golden Triangle. Such armed forces may be powerful, such as the United Wa State Army, which has heavy equipment including anti-aircraft missiles and armed helicopters, or the Kachin Independence Army, which has sophisticated tactics and well-trained training. However, the characteristic of this type of army is that it is concentrated in areas where its ethnic groups are concentrated, and their political demands are only to maintain the independence and territory of their own ethnic groups. Therefore, the fighting between the Myanmar government army and these local ethnic armed forces is mainly concentrated in the northern region of Myanmar, which is the so-called Upper Myanmar. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Myanmar, also known as Lower Myanmar, is mainly dominated by the Bamar people. The Bamar people account for up to 68% of the population of Myanmar and are the absolute majority of the population. It is difficult for local armed forces of ethnic groups in northern Myanmar to penetrate Entered Burma to fight. Politically, ethnic local armed forces have no such demands. The core members of the NUG are themselves Bamar political elites, and their main area of ​​activity happens to be in Lower Myanmar. Especially after the NUG established the armed forces PDF, the core members were sent to the Kachin and other ethnic local armed regimes to learn how to fight, and at the same time, they used Its underground network in lower Burmese society continues to carry out propaganda and mobilization. A large number of soldiers and officers with combat experience were absorbed into PDF. In recent years, the Myanmar government military academies have not only had difficulty recruiting students, but there have even been incidents of graduates taking their equipment and defecting to PDF. So far, at least 16,000 Myanmar military and police personnel have defected and joined PDF. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to poaching and gathering intelligence, PDF began to engage in guerrilla warfare with the Burmese army in lower Myanmar, and its organized combat units even appeared near Myanmar&#39;s capital, Naypyitaw, and the largest city, Yangon. In May 2023, the NUG announced the establishment of about 300 battalions and columns, banned the government agencies of the military junta in 250 towns and villages in Lower Myanmar, and established its own regime. In June 2023, NUG announced the formation of the 5101st Battalion, which was actually established in the Yangon area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the PDF has not had any decent results since its establishment, and has not successfully annihilated any Burmese army troops, its direct threat to the political and economic center of Burma in Lower Burma has forced the Burmese government forces to allocate Spend a lot of resources to defend against PDF sneak attacks. The NUG&#39;s intelligence and mobilization capabilities have also greatly weakened the Myanmar military government&#39;s ability to control Lower Myanmar. The reason why the PDF is considered more deadly than any ethnic local armed forces is because their military goal is not to occupy territory or support themselves with troops, but to completely destroy the Myanmar military government and regain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we look back at the Kokang conflict in 2015, we will find that the Myanmar government army could easily mobilize several brigades from Lower Myanmar to assist Kokang, while the air force could take off directly from surrounding airports to concentrate its forces. Attack the Kokang Allied Forces&#39; positions. However, after the conflict broke out this time, the intensity and equipment level of government forces in mobilizing reinforcements were far lower than last time, and even air support was quite limited. The fundamental reason is that the mobile forces at the hands of the Myanmar military government are already stretched thin. If a large number of troops are deployed to support Kokang, the PDFs around Yangon and Naypyitaw will definitely take advantage of the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4lWn6pGSgtdzDnCKmw06nWYn9rgCT1PcPrrxBIvb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4lWn6pGSgtdzDnCKmw06nWYn9rgCT1PcPrrxBIvb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 8, 2023, in Shan State, Myanmar, the Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army conducted military training&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why is courage so important? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For the Kokang Allied Forces, Kokang is of course crucial, because that is the only goal of this army at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the four major families of Kokang, Kokang is their political capital and a treasure trove of wealth. Losing Kokang means losing everything that two generations have worked hard for for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the military government, Kokang is also crucial. The reason why the leader of the military government, General Min Aung Hlaing, stands out among many generals is because he successfully occupied Kokang and expelled Peng Jiasheng’s troops in 2009, making him He gained unprecedented prestige in the military and became the number one figure among the new generation of generals. Although Kokang is only the first special zone in Shan State with a permanent population of 140,000 and an area of ​​only 2,000 square kilometers, if it fails, the chain effect will be fatal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, from a political point of view, the Myanmar government forces will not give up Kokang easily, and will naturally try their best to support the local armed forces in Kokang to prevent the Kokang Allied Forces from succeeding in their counterattack. Therefore, although the Kokang Allied Forces made good progress in the early stage, it was still difficult to launch an actual offensive to retake Lao Cai. The price they are willing to pay to aid Kokang is the key to whether the Myanmar military government and the four major families can hold on to Kokang. If the level of military investment in the last Kokang conflict can be maintained, it may still be difficult for the Kokang Allied Forces to retake Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“花西子事件”后，再谈美妆国货的初心与始终丨日化行业科创力榜单解读]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259879]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 12:45:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Huaxizi’s “79 Yuan Eyebrow Pen” has caused heated discussions, and domestic beauty products have become the focus.

In 2022, its online channels will account for less than 40% of total revenue, while cosmetics companies such as Bettany, Proya and Shuiyang Shares will account for more than 80% during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emphasis on offline channels may be closely related to the high market share of Shanghai Jahwa’s personal care and home cleaning brand. Compared with marketing, the old brand seems to be more willing to invest in product research and development than most new brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Jahwa’s R&amp;D investment in 2022 will be approximately 180 million yuan, ranking second in the industry after Beitani. Its research and development directions cover a wide range of areas, including medical research co-creation, traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine, cell biology, safety and efficacy assessment equipment, packaging design, AI customization and beauty instrument platforms. In the annual reports of other companies, the content of AI is usually related to sales channels, but in Shanghai Jahwa, AI is truly related to products and services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Shanghai Jahwa’s transformation and upgrading is the blessing of digital intelligence and biotechnology to its main business; the fourth-ranked old domestic product Mingchen Health is launching a dual business model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fiscal year 2022, Mingchen Health invested 110 million yuan in research and development, and also invested in daily chemical products and game business. Of the 23 R&amp;D investment projects disclosed during the same period, nearly half were game R&amp;D; R&amp;D personnel increased by nearly 80% year-on-year to 520, mainly due to new additions to the game business segment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mingchen Health developed the game business through acquisitions in 2020. In 2021, the revenue of the game business and the daily chemical business will account for 37%. In 2022, the ratio of the two will be very close, and the game business will account for 30%. 47%. The 2023 semi-annual report shows that the game business revenue accounts for more than 70%. Next year it will most likely be classified into the software and information services industry. However, this is also a transformation of traditional daily chemical companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 16 daily chemical companies, only 5 including Betteni, Proya, Mingchen Health, Pepperl+Jie, and Blue Moon Group achieved year-on-year revenue growth in fiscal 2022. In fact, the revenue of Mingchen Health&#39;s daily chemical products also declined year-on-year, but thanks to the doubling of game business revenue, the overall revenue increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gross profit margin of Mingchen’s health game business will reach 73.55% in 2022, while the gross profit margin of the daily chemical business will be only 33.75%. In a period of industry involution, decisively exploring new businesses is a new path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingdao Golden King, the largest source of revenue in 2022 will no longer be cosmetics, but new material candles, aromatherapy and handicrafts. Diversified development is another option. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Is high R&amp;D investment worth it? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>; Putting aside these transformations and career changes, focusing on the daily chemical industry itself, is high R&amp;D investment a necessary choice? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business operations, R&amp;D investment is a cost account of the enterprise. Compared with industries with strong technological attributes such as software services and consumer electronics, the benefits that R&amp;D can bring to daily chemical companies are not immediate. At the same time, R&amp;D investment is not high, and there are many brands that have achieved substantial revenue through marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the annual reports of listed daily chemical companies, all of them have sales expenses higher than R&amp;D expenses. For example, Proya’s sales expenses are as high as 2.7 billion yuan, which is 21 times its R&amp;D investment. &lt;span>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;We cannot deny the importance of brand marketing for daily chemical products, but additional high R&amp;D investment has become an industry consensus in recent years. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;16 daily chemical companies also gave their answers using numbers. In fiscal year 2022, a total of 11 companies experienced a year-on-year decline in operating income, accounting for nearly 70%. However, among the 15 companies that disclosed R&amp;D investment, only 6 reduced R&amp;D investment, accounting for 40%. how so? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, R&amp;D is the basis for brand premium. In the &quot;79-yuan Huaxizi eyebrow pencil&quot; incident, someone calculated that its price per gram was even higher than gold. Of course, Huaxizi is not the only one with high prices. Many domestic products have quietly raised their prices in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although compared with big European and American brands, the prices of domestic cosmetics still have room to rise, but behind this incident is the fact that the &quot;hard work&quot; of domestic brand marketing cannot support their price increases. The reason why consumers don’t buy the “79 yuan eyebrow pencil” is ultimately because they question the value of the product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The value of consumer goods usually includes brand value and functional value. The formation of brand value requires the accumulation of time, but functional value can be obtained by latecomers through research and development. For domestic brands whose brand value has not yet been formed, strengthening research and development is not only to create the functional value of the product, but also is conducive to the formation of its brand image. Winona is an example of &quot;focusing on research and development&quot; as the direction of brand development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Secondly, R&amp;D is the only way to create new growth points. &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;This is especially true in the cosmetics industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, channels have always been king in China’s beauty and skin care industry. The focus of competition for market share ranges from offline stores to traditional e-commerce to social e-commerce. Thanks to the development of social media, the degree of information asymmetry between consumers and businesses has been greatly reduced. Consumers have begun to pay more attention to the efficacy of products. It has become a trend to buy skin care products based on their ingredients. The beauty and skin care industry has entered a stage driven by product efficacy. new era. Launching functional skin care products and creating a matrix of functional products have become a new battlefield for cosmetics companies to compete for market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The efficacy of beauty products, especially skin care products, is closely related to product raw materials and formulas, and the discovery and invention of raw materials and formulas are undoubtedly inseparable from R&amp;D investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, as functional skin care has become a new selling point, coupled with the popularity of medical beauty, biopharmaceutical companies with inherent advantages in formula research and development and targeted &quot;medicine&quot; have also begun to join the &quot;involution&quot; of the beauty industry . &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;Biotechnology, cross-border competition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some people may have noticed that holding Mibel, Huaxi Biotech &lt;span>; (688363.SH)&lt;/span>;, which owns cosmetics brands such as Quadi and Runbaiyan, did not appear on the list. Bloomage Biotechnology is classified into the biotechnology industry under the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. It does not participate in the daily chemical industry rankings, but it is an important competitor of companies in the daily chemical industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bloomage Biotech, founded in 2000, has entered the skin care industry since 2016 and has ranked first in the hyaluronic acid business in the industry. In 2022, its functional skin care products achieved revenue of 4.607 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 38.80%, accounting for 72.45% of the company&#39;s main business revenue. This revenue is even higher than the total revenue of Shuiyang Co., Ltd., the parent company of Yunifang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/a20f11734e761e45cf14adcd5b0c615d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 559px; height: auto !important;&quot; width=&quot;559&quot; height=&quot;781&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/a20f11734e761e45cf14adcd5b0c615d.jpeg&quot; data- key=&quot;256889&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;559&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;781&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to this, there are giant creatures &lt;span>; (02367.HK)&lt;/p>; span>;, one of its main businesses is functional skin care products. Its brands include Kefumei, Kelijin, etc. Its revenue in fiscal year 2022 reached 2.364 billion yuan, of which functional skin care products accounted for more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the daily chemical industry is also actively moving closer to biotechnology. Marubi Co., Ltd. proposed a research and development plan based on recombinant collagen in the next ten years in 2022. It plans to successively launch recombinant collagen products with Class II medical device certification, recombinant collagen water-light injection products with Class III medical device certification, and Class III medical devices. Certified collagen-filling products and artificial corneas based on recombinant collagen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;>;In fact, the biotechnology and daily chemical industries are going in both directions. The intersection of medicine and beauty is getting closer and closer, and beauty and skin care products are moving closer to biotechnology from formulas and ingredients to technology to packaging. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Technologies such as fermentation engineering and molecular biology enable the extraction and development of new active ingredients; technologies such as nanotechnology and micro-emulsification technology are used to overcome the problem of difficulty in skin absorption; degradable packaging materials play an important role in environmental protection policies promoted to the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Integrate product research and development with biotechnology in an all-round way, integrating industry, academia and research. In the fields of precision skin care, functional skin care and other fields, beauty and skin care brands have cultivated their own competitiveness by deeply cultivating biotechnology, and new brands are also seizing the opportunity. Technological changes are coming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the development history of international beauty giants such as L&#39;Oreal, Estee Lauder, and Shiseido, their origins and the establishment of moats are all closely related to chemistry and biomedicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when consumption is downgrading and national trends are prevalent, domestic beauty and cosmetics companies that have always focused on &quot;high quality and low price&quot; are facing important competition points to narrow the gap with big European and American brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To seize this &quot;overwhelming wealth&quot;, domestic beauty products must examine and learn from the original research and development intentions of European and American brands, and must not use high marketing as a basis to increase prices at will. After all, the company is not in a In the advertising industry, what makes consumers perceive value is not the gorgeous packaging and advertising endorsements, but the genuine effects that the products bring to consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[她研究在美中国本科留学生，发现高远志向下的挣扎和迷茫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259847]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[剁碎新鲜白菜凑厨余垃圾，涉事企业：正在整改]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259867]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小学老师因不堪非教育负担而自杀：当减轻乃至消除老师的非教育任务负担]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259877]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The suicide of a primary school teacher attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv, a female teacher at Jianxing Road Primary School in Guancheng District, Zhengzhou City, left a suicide note with the completion time marked at 23:44 on October 26. The suicide note said: Mom, I&#39;m sorry, I really can&#39;t hold it on anymore... I feel like I can&#39;t breathe. I never thought that being a primary school teacher would be so difficult... School work, school activities, and leadership inspections make us graduates who directly become class teachers without training feel like we are in a cage, and the cage is shrinking little by little. We go to work every day with our last breath in mind. When can teachers only do the job of teaching and educating people? How can unhappy teachers teach positive and optimistic children? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv is only 23 years old this year. He was admitted to the school in August to teach and serve as a class teacher. He has a &quot;normally cheerful personality&quot; and is in the best years of his life. What a tragedy for her family who loved her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this incident has sounded a wake-up call for us. We must care and pay attention to our family members, especially their mental state and values. We should relax as a family regularly, have heart-to-heart conversations, and tell each other’s confusions. and weakness: If some problems can be solved, then help solve them; if some problems cannot be solved, then at least relieve the pressure. The &quot;normally cheerful personality&quot; may be true, or it may be that he forced himself to perform in order not to worry his family and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;体制内的老师被许多人视为“铁饭碗”，有编制、社会地位也不错，但反过来可能成为束缚人的藩篱：许多人考得了教师编制，发现其实自己并不喜欢或不适合这个工作，也不敢辞职另谋高就，往往是担心家人或外人不理解，觉得自己不珍惜这来之不易的机会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鞋子合脚与否，只有自己知道。在这里，奉劝大家，无论自己从事何种职业，当尊重自己的直觉感受，不必太在意别人的眼光。该换赛道就换赛道，应该把生命用在有意义、值得的事情上；死命强撑下去，只会导致越来越大的精神内耗，消磨与泯灭自己的生命力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更进一步，此事也不可避免引向一个疑问：教师不是每天只要上几节课，每年还有寒暑两次共三个月的长假吗，考上教师编制不就“上岸”可以不用那么努力甚至躺平吗，怎么会这么忙、这么累呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从技术上看，这可谓智能手机与即时通讯工具普及带来的暗面。各种微信家校群与钉钉群，让学校与老师的意志，无远弗届地抵达每一个家庭、每一个父母。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚开始，家校群的功能，只是学校与老师向家长转递各种教育类任务，要家长帮助孩子预习、给孩子检查作业等，这样可迫使家长投入时间与资源到孩子的学习中去。在某种程度上，老师是家校群的领导，自己的孩子在学校与老师手里，有几个家长敢公开不配合？家长之间也有竞争，以取悦老师或至少不开罪老师。这一做法对老师的好处是：老师与学校还是有某种KPI绩效，家长的投入有助于其达成KPI，所以学校与老师有这样做的激励。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而这一手好使，慢慢地就会为某些部门所知，并总结出套路“小手牵大手”，就是通过教育系统-学校-老师的链条层层下压，让家长配合完成各种非教育任务，因为这些部门也有自己的KPI。随着时间的推移，发现这一手好使的部门越来越多，各种各样的非教育任务通过这一链条下达到家长手里，并挤占了学校与老师越来越多的时间，家长固然是不快，学校与老师也感觉不好受了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上述意义上，学校通过家校群已经成为村委会、居委会之外的第三基层治理机构，各部门通过学校-老师的传导环节将权力的触须深入到每一个家庭，并且干预的频度与烈度远远超过村委会与居委会。大家不妨回忆一下，一年之中，你与村委会或居委会能打几回交道？很多人恐怕一回都没有。但只要你有孩子在上小学或中学，为了孩子，你常常得完成通过学校-老师传达给你的非教育任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除此之外，其他政府部门还会借调老师去线下做各种各样的非教育工作。毕竟，老师是体制内公职人员，多少吃当地财政饭，所以比较容易调度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《三联生活周刊》曾刊发过一篇文章《“挤破头”拥有教师编制，他们后悔了》，文章采访了一位90后小学老师张小徽，她说：自己当小学主课老师和班主任时，只有三成工作是教书任务，其他七成，都是社会任务。另一位采访对象表示：作为班主任，不仅要上课，还要安排班级活动、班会课，对接当地社区、医院或者消防局、交通局等政府机构，甚至会在凌晨两点被校领导叫起来，去做志愿者，这些繁重的任务，让她感觉身心疲惫，这跟她选择做教师的初衷背道而驰，于是选择了辞职。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，要减轻乃至消除学校与老师所面临的各种非教育任务负担，有釜底抽薪之策。一是强制解散各种家校群，除非学生在学校闯祸或受到伤害了，学校与老师不得联系家长。这样，家长所承受各种教育与非教育负担就可以一下子消解了，有利于家校关系的正常化与和谐；学校与老师也可能免除各种线上的非教育任务。二是明令其他政府部门不得调用或免费调用老师当临时工。总之，双管齐下，从线上线下一起给老师减非教育负担，老师庶几可以专心于教书育人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[加沙的地道恐怕挡不住以色列的进攻丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259856]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/Erv2zTeF7MZqh7v93zNuSduQSLAT2P9rV1UjDIR9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Erv2zTeF7MZqh7v93zNuSduQSLAT2 P9rV1UjDIR9. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256468&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 28, 2023, at the Israeli-Gaza border, the Israeli army fired artillery shells into the Gaza Strip &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has lasted for three weeks has entered a new stage, and Israel has begun to continuously launch attacks on the Gaza region Launch a ground attack. Major General Hagari of the Israel Defense Forces told the media that the Israeli ground forces are &quot;expanding the scope of their activities&quot; and &quot;taking vigorous actions... to achieve war goals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces, a group of Merkava tanks can be seen running through the flat, open sand of Gaza, attacking distant buildings with their main guns. Hamas also confirmed that it was engaged in ground combat with the Israel Defense Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as predicted in my previous column, Israel’s ground operations will not involve large-scale penetration and encirclement, but will continue to slowly encroach from the edge with very cautious actions. Obviously, Israel is very aware that Hamas&#39;s army has established a very strong underground network inside Gaza. It will be a defense system full of death traps, just like the Japanese army prepared for the US Marines in the Battle of Iwo Jima. Those death potholes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To directly attack such an area, Israel may pay heavy casualties, which is of course the result Hamas hopes for. Does Israel have a way to deal with this authentic meat grinder that has been operating for many years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, compared with the era of the Battle of Iwo Jima, technological advancements have allowed today&#39;s military to use some new technological means to detect the underground world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is thermal imaging technology, which has been widely used in tunnel detection. Although the tunnel itself does not emit infrared signals, ventilation equipment must be installed in large tunnels to prevent people inside from being suffocated. At present, Israel has cut off the power supply to Gaza. Such ventilation equipment can only rely on its own generators to maintain operation. These generators and the vents of underground passages will be an identifiable thermal imaging signal. During peacetime, Hamas can still cover thermal imaging signals through some buildings and temporary facilities. However, once war breaks out, Israel will continue to destroy those ground buildings, forcing the exposure of heat sources such as vents and power generation equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another common tunnel detection method is synthetic aperture radar. This type of radar has the ability to detect underground metal objects at a certain depth, and can even detect the depth and position of underground tunnels. In 2021, the U.S. Army announced a new technology that can generate three-dimensional images of underground bunkers by simply comparing the images generated by synthetic aperture radar twice through an algorithm. Platforms including satellites, dedicated ground surveillance aircraft and drones can be equipped with synthetic aperture radar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also an advanced technology that has received high hopes in recent years, namely hyperspectral imaging reconnaissance. Hyperspectral detection equipment is an imaging method that can distinguish extremely subtle changes on the surface of objects. Different soil media, water flows and even air fluctuations can be imaged in front of hyperspectral imaging equipment. This method has been widely used in minerals and water resources. aviation wide area detection. In the military, this imaging technology can also be used to discover the opponent&#39;s bunkers, mines and hidden military forces. In recent years, hyperspectral imaging cameras have been integrated into drones and satellites. Israel has also done considerable research in this area and is at the leading level in the industry in several research directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that an almost science-fiction technology was also used in this conflict, that is, muon imaging technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1936, humans discovered the existence of a type of ray called muons in the universe, which can penetrate various materials including hard granite and marble. In recent years, with the advancement of particle mechanics, humans have discovered that the penetration properties of muons can be used to image the interior of objects. The principle is the same as X-ray photography. Nowadays, muon photography technology is widely used in engineering, geological observation and archaeological activities, such as detecting the direction of magma inside volcanoes or observing the internal structure of pyramids. Even after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, muon cameras were also used Find out what&#39;s going on inside the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, muon imaging technology has rarely been used for military purposes in the past. The main reason is that this technology requires sensors to be deployed in at least two directions of the object being detected, otherwise imaging cannot be performed. Military facilities are often underground, and aerial reconnaissance alone cannot meet imaging conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the tunnels in the Gaza Strip are qualified for the use of muon imaging technology, because this is a small area, and Israel almost surrounds the Gaza area from three sides, allowing muon photography to be deployed in multiple directions. As for the conditions of the equipment, since this technology has been widely used in other fields, it can basically be used immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more technical reconnaissance methods on the battlefield, the better. In addition to obtaining means, the ability to comprehensively analyze and utilize reconnaissance results is also crucial. With the advancement of human science and technology, although underground bunkers have a certain degree of concealment, they are no longer impenetrable. With all technical means overwhelming them, tunnel combat alone may not be able to withstand the opponent&#39;s attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 12:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方通报网传抢中药事件 :村民误认为收割完毕遂进场捡拾]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259865]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 11:32:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Agricultural and Rural Affairs Bureau of Zhoukou Huaiyang District issued a situation report on November 1:&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the afternoon of October 31, Qiu, a medicinal planter in Fengtang Township, Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City, Henan Province, was two-thirds of the way through the second harvest of Atractylodes macrocephala.

A netizen named &quot;Taishan McDull Button&quot; posted on multiple platforms to show off that he was raising three large Canary dogs in a community in Lixia District, located in the center of Jinan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenshots of the man in question&#39;s social media show that in August 2021, he posted a post with a picture saying, &quot;The dog scared the pregnant woman. I also beat the pregnant woman and she stayed at the police station until 11 o&#39;clock&quot;; In January 2022, he posted another article saying, &quot;To commemorate the first snowfall in 2022, the brother and sister bit the Shiba Inu in the community to pieces.&quot; In February 2022, his accompanying picture showed that the dog he raised Large dogs eat under the &quot;Civilized Dog Raising, Scientific Dog Raising&quot; banner set up at the Wenhua East Road Police Station of the Lixia Branch of the Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since October 2023, the man&#39;s social media has turned to showing off his wealth and power, and has continuously posted &quot;(Three dogs) go out in luxury cars, stay in star hotels, and go out to eat.&quot; hotel&quot;, &quot;a day&#39;s foster care fee is higher than your salary as an office worker&quot; and other content to show off their wealth. On October 24, the man involved posted a video of a policeman knocking on the door with tools, with the text saying, &quot;You check yours and I&#39;ll take care of mine. If you have the ability, you can tear down my door and come in to arrest me.&quot; On October 25, the man involved released the surveillance video again and sarcastically said, &quot;I really worked hard to catch the dog, hahahahaha.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interaction with netizens, the man in question said, &quot;I go out every day, and I can sneak away as I please.&quot; The image of &quot;abundant&quot; and &quot;monstrous power&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident spread online, on the evening of October 30, the Lixia District Public Security Bureau of Jinan issued a notice stating that a man who had recently been rumored on the Internet to &quot;show off raising prohibited dogs&quot; had been administratively detained. &quot;Beating pregnant women&quot; and &quot;you check yours and I&#39;ll keep mine&quot; are all false information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two administrative penalty decisions issued by Jinan police also showed that the man’s behavior constituted illegal dog breeding. He surrendered on October 28 and was fined a total of 3,900 yuan; the man’s release The video &quot;The police don&#39;t dare to arrest me even when they come to my door&quot; is a stolen photo of the police investigating and punishing other people&#39;s illegal dog-raising, and then plagiarized it and put it on his own account to boast that he &quot;lacks respect for the law and openly challenges the bottom line of the law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this case shows that the man involved has been doing this for many years and is divided into two parts: offline and online. The current report has not fully answered netizens&#39; questions, and there are still some areas left to be analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing to ask is, is the &quot;power and power&quot; that the man in question flaunted true? Judging from the social media content of the man in question, he clearly has the image of a wealthy young man who is either rich or noble. The pictures distributed also imply that he has a certain &quot;background&quot; and is an existence that others &quot;cannot mess with&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man in question has repeatedly posted content about his participation in activities within the system, and has also shown his status as &quot;military first.&quot; The Jinan police’s administrative penalty decision also showed that the man involved was affiliated with the Material Management Office of a military region hospital. If the man in question really has some kind of &quot;identity within the system,&quot; his employer should express its condemnation and cut him off. And if the identities the man in question brags about are fabricated, then what he says and does is also suspected of committing a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Military hospital staff are national staff in a broad sense. According to Article 279 of the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, whoever pretends to be a staff member of a state agency and commits fraud, thereby constituting the crime of fraud, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance, or deprivation of political rights; if the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years. imprisonment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, according to the &quot;Red Star News&quot; report, the man in question has kept these three large dogs for many years. The property management, police, and community have come to communicate with them many times, but to no avail. This detail shows that the man in question did not keep large dogs illegally for a day or two, which seriously interfered with the lives of surrounding neighbors, but it was something that people could do nothing about. Combined with his arrogant words and deeds online, the man in question has been suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, which &quot;seriously affects the work, life, production, and business of others.&quot; This is a plot worthy of further investigation by the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police report showed that the man involved was dissatisfied with the regulations related to dog breeding, so he turned to provoke the public, and it took ten days to be brought to justice. I would like to ask, if the man in question did not &quot;blatantly challenge the bottom line of the law,&quot; do the surrounding neighbors still have to endure it? If you think about it further, if the man in question keeps a low profile online but remains arrogant offline, can he continue to be lawless? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only are dogs not civil subjects in the legal sense, but even their social attributes in the abstract sense are completely determined by the dog owner’s dog-raising behavior. The illegal behavior of the man in question was not just raising a large prohibited dog without a leash or muzzle, but also magnified the social harm of illegal dog ownership with his arrogant and domineering words and deeds. In addition to administrative penalties, public authorities should also conduct in-depth investigations and investigate the suspects for the crime of cheating and provoking troubles. While cracking down on illegal dog-raising, &quot;dogs fighting against human power&quot; should not be tolerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“我可以不恋爱，但我的CP一定要结婚”，为什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259814]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the spring of 2021, Xu Guanwen, born in 1998, began a new and unfamiliar research. At that time, he was still a graduate student at the School of Society and Demography at Renmin University of China. A course on qualitative research methods led him to set his sights on a costume drama called &quot;The Order of Mountains and Rivers&quot;. The relationship between the two protagonists in the play leaves room for the audience to imagine intimate emotions, attracting a large number of &quot;CP fans&quot; to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East Asian cultural circle, the trend of &quot;consuming CP&quot; has been around for a long time. It first appeared in the ACGN (animation, comics, games, novels) circle and refers to pairing (Coupling) between two characters, referred to as &quot;CP&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, Xu Guanwen paid attention to this cultural form twice. The first time was in high school. My deskmate selected two male characters from the Japanese manga &quot;Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&quot; - Aomine Daiki and Kise Ryota, and wrote a CP &quot;fanfic&quot; for them. &quot;Aomine Daiki&#39;s character is aggressive, while Kise Ryota is more elegant and has a wild side inside. Their roles complement each other to a certain extent, and there are certain areas that can be explored.&quot; Although the article written by the same deskmate is only a fragment It&#39;s a sitcom, but Xu Guanwen can feel a &quot;strong emotional connection&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time was when he was an undergraduate student in sociology. He was chatting with his graduate student and found that the other party was doing research on &quot;Whether Danmei literature has an impact on real gay men&quot;. He realized that, Popular culture will be related to real-life emotional practices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, thinking of the two intersections with CP culture, Xu Guanwen was once again aroused his &quot;long-standing curiosity&quot;. He started with friends around him and conducted snowball interviews with 55 CP fans, including 53 women and 2 men. Most of the interviewers were surprised at first: Why would a boy who doesn’t take CP want to learn about this issue? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the few male CP fans is a fan of the female idol team AKB48. He thinks the members are beautiful and beautiful, so he takes up the team’s CP; the other is a gay man who lives in daily life. It is difficult to find a partner and intimate relationship that meets their expectations, so they look for male CPs in Japanese dramas to project their emotional needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to make the topic selection more focused, the interviews of two male CP fans were not included in the analysis. At the beginning of 2023, this paper titled &quot;&quot;CP-eating&quot;: Creative Emotional Experience of Young Female Fans&quot; was published in the &quot;Women&#39;s Studies Series&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was originally a routine survey, but in October 2023, the paper suddenly became popular. This paper, which is full of words such as &quot;childhood sweetheart&quot; and &quot;soul mate&quot;, was forwarded and liked on social media, attracting attention and ridicule from &quot;addict experts&quot;: &quot;The paper the professor asked me to read is my first name.&quot; No matter how long I put it off, I read the paper on CP addiction with gusto, and even cried while reading it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Search for the keyword &quot;CP&quot; on CNKI and sort by the number of downloads, &quot;&quot;CP&quot;: Creative Emotional Experience of Young Female Fans&quot; ranks first in the relevant literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An interviewer tried to give an answer as to why he is keen on taking CP: &quot;What I expect to see in CP is a kind of spiritual communication and soul resonance.&quot; In real life, marriage is Contracts, contractual relationships, and love are complex luxuries. In a world that is complex and open to multiple interpretations, CP is &quot;a relatively beautiful thing constructed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/IvZpDtwHvl2xSXb2GfD8IBDuhzTTM5Wwh2X6yfJY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/IvZpDtwHvl2xSXb2GfD8IBDuhzTTM5Wwh2X6yfJY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256605&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Different CP combinations often appear among the members of idol groups. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Some emotional needs are not satisfied in reality&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen does not take CP and calls himself an &quot;outsider&quot;. His in-depth understanding of CP culture is limited to 55 interviewers. When studying the craze of “eating CP” on the Internet, he paid more attention to the emotional mechanism behind it. When collecting information and designing the interview outline, the question he wanted to discuss with these CP fans was: What is their imagination of this kind of love? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, his master&#39;s thesis is about to be started. He was inspired by French sociologist Eva Iroth&#39;s &quot;Love, Why Does It Hurt?&quot; 》Inspired by this, I want to do cultural research on love. Eva Iroth discusses in the book: People are changing partners more and more frequently and faster, and there is a set of changes in emotional concepts behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xu Guanwen&#39;s view, &quot;romantic love&quot; seems to be imported from China. &quot;During the Republic of China, it was an ideological tool to criticize feudalism and encourage women to escape from the feudal patriarchal system. Lu Xun wrote &quot;What Happened After Nora Left&quot; and found that women did escape from the patriarchal system, but fell into the small family system. In the family, we are still restricted by the male-dominated family concept.&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In the 1970s and 1980s, we were exposed to a new round of Western literary and artistic works, such as &quot;Titanic&quot;, and everyone began to accept it again ( Freedom of marriage and love).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen feels that since the concept of &quot;romantic love&quot; was introduced to China, it has assumed the role of rebelling against the current order, often running counter to economic rational decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following this line of thinking, he decided to include the love concepts of contemporary Chinese youth groups into his research. I looked around, but found that I couldn&#39;t find a suitable research object. By chance, he saw a topic: &quot;I don&#39;t have to fall in love, but my partner must get married.&quot; The most direct question jumped out: Why are they so happy to have a love relationship with their partner? Why do they like to watch others fall in love, but don’t fall in love themselves? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found his old friend Q as his first interview subject. The two met in a corner of the cafeteria and chatted for three hours in a pleasant atmosphere. The CP circle pays attention to &quot;enclosure and self-admiration&quot;, which refers to entertaining oneself in one&#39;s own small circle. Even if the CPs are the same A and B, if the order is reversed (such as the &quot;AB&quot; party and the &quot;BA&quot; party), it is possible We can&#39;t go together. Q rarely has the opportunity to chat with his peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CP that Q drank was a pair of male and female CPs in a certain boy group. Xu Guanwen initially thought that Q&#39;s boyfriend liked childish boys, but after in-depth conversation, he discovered that this was not the case. Q&#39;s boyfriend in real life was burly. The reason why Q likes this couple is that they don&#39;t deliberately maintain a sense of boundaries like adult men, but interact closely like children. &quot;That&#39;s the state of interpersonal interaction that she prefers. It&#39;s simple enough and the emotions are obvious enough.&quot; Xu Guanwen analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The encounter between a CP fan and CP may be an accident. She chose to learn more about it, possibly because there are certain qualities in CP that attracted her. She got emotional feedback at that moment, Therefore, she is positive and happy at the moment. As she gradually learns more about CP, the underlying things slowly emerge. What really induces this kind of emotional feedback is that certain emotional needs are not met in reality. .&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after chasing for several years, the couple finally &quot;be&quot; (bad ending, tragic ending). As the two grew older, Q watched the latest variety shows and found that their interaction became unnatural. &quot;The sense of boundary is very obvious. Even if you don&#39;t realize it, your body&#39;s reaction is very obvious.&quot; Q couldn&#39;t let go of it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interviewees had different reasons for taking CP. Some people are frustrated by love in real life and heal their wounds in the relatively ideal and flawless CP world; some people feel stressed in real life and escape to the CP world to vent their emotions. There are also people who have a spectator mentality. In real life, love or marriage always makes people worry about gains and losses, and taking CP can make people objectively look at the emotional direction of a CP couple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are still times when taking CP is just &quot;interesting&quot;. There are various unexpected combinations of protagonists from characters to actors, from reality to virtuality, from contemporary times to history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On video websites, Jia Ling was paired up with various male stars and edited into CP videos. Daiyu and Voldemort are also favored by netizens and are paired up as contrasting characters. Xu Guanwen interviewed a girl who was a fan of Voltaire and Rousseau. The outside world often feels that these two people have different opinions and are lifelong enemies. This girl feels that there is room for further interpretation behind the historicized relationship. &quot;The antonym of enemy is friend. Are there other possibilities (for the relationship between the two)? For example, falling in love and killing each other.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/02/Ibo0RTSbVtuQnLkTBpD8F4EdP3EjktaCh8wRcytR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1797&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/02/Ibo0RTSbVtuQnLkTBpD8F4EdP3EjktaCh8wRcytR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256606&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The two protagonists of the costume drama &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; It has become the target of many fans to &quot;eat CP&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;You can live without love, but you cannot live without love&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;When many people take CP, they first feel the impromptu and plump happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen analyzed that behind this kind of immediate happiness, there is not only aesthetic satisfaction, but also the satisfaction of the demand gap of the current emotional state. Of course, some people put their own expectations for intimate relationships into it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(This expectation) has been very concretely presented in CP. With continuous immersion, the concrete image changes from fuzzy to three-dimensional, so that happiness can continue. Because you can continue to explore , form your own understanding, and experience happiness in the process of exploration.&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After interviewing 55 CP fans, Xu Guanwen found that the CP emotions that many people actively explore overflow the framework of conventional social life. One of Xu Guanwen&#39;s interviewers drank the CP of two male members of a Korean boy band, but he did not define the intimate relationship between the two as &quot;romantic love&quot;, but the Japanese word &quot;bond&quot;, which expresses a kind of &quot;friend or above&quot;. The emotion of &quot;love is not full&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The couple grew up together, and were both under 20 years old when the team was formed. This interviewer grew up in a Tongzilou, a group of children who spent their childhood playing around, and shared a similar background to her CP. &quot;She said that she took advantage of this couple because she and her (young) friend were separated by two places and could not meet each other. The kind of family-like connection she expected was seen in CP.&quot; Xu Guanwen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen paid attention to the comments on social media and found that many people were moved by the interviewer&#39;s words: &quot;You can live without love, but you cannot live without love.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just like Henry Jenkins As said, the popularity of CP culture itself has a reflection on heterosexual romantic narratives. CP fans are no longer satisfied with the old romantic narratives, but hope to discover unique emotional connections.&quot; Xu Guanwen wrote in the paper . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a male, Xu Guanwen also discovered some gender differences in his research: when female CP fans romanticize male and female CPs, they often regard holding hands, hugging, etc. as evidence of the intimacy between the two. . Xu Guanwen believes that this is typical female thinking. In fact, boys and girls have different sense of boundaries when expressing closeness to the same sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Differentiated emotional models present a complex and complex ecological landscape in the CP world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You will see that CP culture itself is like a small society, with a very avant-garde side and a very conservative side.” Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters, “In Danmei CP fan works, maybe There will be some very avant-garde explorations of gender. The conservative side may be that I only consume heterosexual CP and follow the biggest mainstream (society).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CP world is like a diverse and diverse world. There is a free emotional market, and whether this market can affect emotional practice in reality, Xu Guanwen&#39;s investigation failed to give an answer. &quot;The reality I face, and how much freedom I have to make my own (emotional) practices, varies from person to person.&quot; Xu Guanwen said, &quot;But in general, it is happy first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“刘忠林”案代理律师被控三宗罪，一审获刑16年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259844]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/mrRGzBS9fSCrOw1lSmD0jdnd5PFaXElNGDvrONZ2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;742&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/mrRGzBS9fSCrOw1lSmD0jdnd5PFaXElNGDvrONZ2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;吉林市丰满区法院对修保作出了有罪判决。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在吉林省吉林市法律界颇具知名度的修保可能想不到，他也有为自己“喊冤”的一天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;修保曾是律所主任、吉林市律协会长、吉林省律协副会长，担任过省级人大代表，一度被推选为感动中国候选人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;值得一提的是，修保还是刘忠林案再审期间的辩护人。刘忠林曾因故意杀人罪被判死缓，遭关押25年3个月，是公开报道中被羁押时间最长的蒙冤者，2018年4月，吉林省高级人民法院再审改判刘忠林无罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，修保因代理过的两起案件，被判犯有介绍贿赂、行贿和诈骗三宗罪，一审获刑16年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修保不服，于2023年7月17日向吉林市中院提起上诉。据南方周末记者了解，修保案案卷已在2023年9月18日从吉林市检察院返回到吉林市中院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照刑诉法相关规定，二审法院应当在决定开庭审理后及时通知检察院查阅案卷。检察院应当在一个月以内查阅完毕。检察院阅卷时间不计入审理期限。第二审人民法院受理上诉、抗诉案件，应当在两个月以内审结。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这意味着，该案的审限为2023年11月18日。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;代理厅官受贿案被指居间行贿&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;68岁的修保，在失去人身自由前，曾有诸多光环。 &lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公开资料显示，他1988年起从事律师工作，后创办吉林保民律师事务所并担任主任。修保获得过“全国法律援助先进个人”“全国优秀律师”等多项荣誉，2011年被推选为感动中国候选人。在吉林省律师界，他是第一位省人大代表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修保的个人事迹也频频见诸报端，其被媒体称为“平民律师”和“工人的律师”。据人民网2019年报道，修保曾长期帮助下岗职工和弱势群体维权，免费代理被感染艾滋病农民等困难群众的诉讼案件400余件，先后为3万余名下岗职工及弱势群体依法讨回近2亿元的赔偿（补偿）款和社保退休金，纠正冤假错案几十起，使13位蒙冤入狱的百姓得到无罪释放，其中就包括刘忠林。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘忠林获释3年后，2022年1月24日，因涉嫌犯介绍贿赂罪和行贿罪，修保被吉林市代管的桦甸市监察委员会采取留置措施，随后又因涉嫌犯诈骗罪，被吉林省磐石市公安局刑事拘留。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修保被查，与此前代理的吉林省一厅官受贿案相关。 2017年9月，吉林省投资集团有限公司董事长、通化市委原书记刘保威被查，后于2018年10月，被吉林市检察院以涉嫌受贿罪提起公诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这期间，修保担任刘保威的代理律师，也因此被指介绍行贿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吉林市丰满区法院一审判决书（【2023】吉0211刑初10号）显示，吉林市丰满区检察院认为，2018年4月，修保为利用时任吉林市中院副院长冯其胜的职务之便，让刘保威家属联系冯其胜妻子谭雪梅，并支付“好处费”60 万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一审判决书中，冯其胜承认自己担任刘保威案审判长期间，修保为使案件得以轻判，居间介绍刘保威亲属送给谭雪梅好处费60万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯其胜因严重违纪违法，2022年7月被开除公职，其涉嫌犯罪问题移送检察机关依法审查起诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者从有关方面了解到，冯其胜在2022年12月被通化市东昌区法院判处受贿罪，获刑11年。其妻谭雪梅受贿593万，被吉林市丰满区法院判处有期徒刑3年，缓刑4年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯、谭二人案发后，修保亦受牵连。 2022年12月29日，吉林市丰满区检察院对修保提起公诉，经吉林市中院指定管辖，丰满区法院于2023年1 月11日立案受理，同年3月30日公开开庭审理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月6日，丰满区法院作出一审判决，修保在此案中的行为被认定为行贿罪和介绍贿赂罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但修保一方坚称无罪。修保的代理律师认为，在案证据无法认定刘保威家属向谭雪梅行贿60万元，修保不存在行贿动机，对谭雪梅没有请托事项，达不到定罪的证明标准。修保其子修志玉表示，修保和冯其胜公开场合常因案件问题争执，私下并不熟，“而谭雪梅本身也是执业律师”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“钱散人归”的诈骗罪&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一审判决中，修保还被判犯有诈骗罪，这与修保代理的另一起贪污受贿案有关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吉林市丰满区检察院认为，修保于2019年1月至6月，受罗某委托担任其丈夫姚某林涉嫌贪污一案辩护人，修保虚构姚某林判处缓刑需要向司法机关办案人员支付好处费的事实，随后罗某向其朋友曹某转账，后曹某分3次当面向修保交付现金160万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据一审判决书，丰满区法院认为，修保在吉林市看守所会见姚某林时，让他写一张纸条给罗某，内容是告诉罗某“别心疼钱，钱是给法检办案人员的好处”，纸条上写明“钱散人归”，“到了该花钱的时间了，估计可能要花200（万）-400（万），具体情况你们定”。后修保找到曹某，谎称要疏通关系让罗某拿钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但审理姚某林贪污案的审判长和审判员均作证，在姚某林案中，修保并没有向法院办案人员行贿，对姚某林的定罪量刑符合法律法规。修保也在供述中承认自己在姚某林案中收了90万元的律师代理费，但否认编造疏通关系的理由来收取罗某160万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在曹某的证言中，曹某表示，罗某先后向自己汇款160 万元后，他又先后向自己的司机汇款130万元，取现后连同手里的30万元交给修保。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丰满区法院认为，修保以非法占有为目的，虚构能通过疏通关系让姚某林的犯罪得到从轻处罚的事实，骗取被害人罗某财物,数额特别巨大之行为，构成诈骗罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修保的辩护律师认为，在案证据无法证明修保取得160万元的事实，修保不存在虚构事实行为，不存在隐瞒真相行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“其次，就算他收了这160万元，顶多属于违反律师职业道德，修保在接受委托后，作为律师会见、阅卷和开庭等工作都完成了，并且委托人对于案件结果也很满意，所以不构成诈骗罪。”修保的辩护律师告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，据其子修志玉了解，姚某林和罗某也未向修保追讨这160万元，亦未向公安机关报案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，法院判处修保犯诈骗罪，判处有期徒刑十二年，并处罚金人民币20万元。此外，法院还以修保犯行贿罪，判处有期徒刑三年，并处罚金人民币20万元；犯介绍贿赂罪，判处有期徒刑二年，并处罚金人民币10万元；决定执行有期徒刑十六年，并处罚金人民币50元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;一审宣判后，修保向吉林市中院提出上诉，目前，案件已进入二审程序。 2023年11月1日，南方周末记者就该案二审是否开庭审理多次联系吉林市中院，未获回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修志玉表示，希望二审能开庭审理，“只要判决结果是公开公正的，并且大家了解案情后都觉得我父亲罪有应得的话，我想他也会释怀”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
