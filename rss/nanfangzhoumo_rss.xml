After a change of dynasty, if the new dynasty wants to prove its legitimacy, the history books will throw dirty water on it. The identity of the &quot;tyrant&quot; has been recognized, and folk literature and art like to use him to tell erotic and violent stories - after all, deep in human nature, there is such a hobby, but it is not appropriate to place this hobby on a good person, so the &quot;tyrant&quot; &quot;It&#39;s always good to make it very pornographic and violent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fate of popular emperors in literary and artistic works such as Shang Zhou and Sui Yang Emperor is probably always like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, peel off the outer layer of skin, what is the inner layer exposed? Let’s take Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty as an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty first came to the throne, he inherited a powerful empire that had not been seen for hundreds of years after the fall of the Han Dynasty, and it was also a huge powder keg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, long-term divisions have been unified in a very short period of time, and some people are dissatisfied with the current regime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, his father, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, had some important institutional reforms and policy practices, which were very beneficial from the national level, but felt uncomfortable at the social level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the household registration management in the Sui Dynasty was particularly good. According to official population statistics, the population has increased from 29 million to 46 million in less than 30 years. These 17 million people are definitely not just the result of everyone trying their best to have children when the world is at peace, but the population that was originally hidden has all been plundered. From the perspective of the imperial court, the country had extremely abundant manpower and material resources at its disposal. However, if you look at the perspective of ordinary people at that time, these people did not have to pay taxes or serve in the military. Now all these burdens have been placed on them, and they are not necessarily happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these people are all in disarray, there is nothing they can do even if they are dissatisfied. But Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty also made another major reform, which was to change the three-level local administration of state-prefecture-county to the second-level state-county administration, and abolish the county level. As a result, tens of thousands of people, from county chiefs to ordinary officials, were about to be laid off. From a national level, this is reducing staff and increasing efficiency. But with so many officials losing their vested interests, they will definitely be furious. If the Sui Dynasty returned all the savings to the people, then the people should be very happy to see these people lose their official positions. But the problem is that the Sui Dynasty concentrated all the profits in the court, and the people of the Sui Dynasty did not get any benefits from this reform that could have benefited them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two reforms, together with other new policies, resulted in a great increase in the income of the Sui Dynasty and a decrease in expenditure. Therefore, many scholars have noticed that when it comes to ancient dynasties, it is said that In terms of &quot;national wealth&quot;, it is unmatched by the Sui Dynasty. But at the same time, this also means that as long as someone wants to rebel, there will immediately be tens of thousands of unemployed officials with administrative organizational skills, and tens of millions of dissatisfied people who can take advantage of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty was completely unaware of the existence of this problem. He was from a good background, had a smooth life since childhood, and was really smart. He had no ability to empathize with the pain of ordinary people. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only saw that there were so many resources in the court now, so he wanted to do big things, so he dug the Grand Canal and conquered Liaodong three times, which were all extreme tests of social endurance. It was not that Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty did not feel that his throne was threatened, but it was not from this huge powder keg, but from the Guanlong Group that the Sui Dynasty relied on for its success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming emperor, Emperor Sui Yang was particularly successful in commanding the war in the south. His ability to win over the southern nobles far exceeded that of the older generation of famous generals and ministers of the Guanlong Group. This gave him the illusion that I have new forces available, and you are nothing special. This intensified the division of the ruling group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the excluded Guanlong dignitaries at the top, the laid-off officials at the middle level, and the ordinary people at the grassroots level who are overwhelmed by heavy labor and taxes will have full anger from top to bottom. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Sui Yang was indeed not the nymphomaniac or sadist in literary works, but when faced with the challenge, he seemed completely unqualified as a politician. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You are too willful when things are going well. I don’t want you to think so. I want you to think that you can’t do things and never give up even if you hit a wall. But when it comes to adversity, they lack resilience and willpower, and their willpower collapses immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world was in chaos. When Emperor Sui Yang arrived in Jiangdu, he actually no longer expected to recapture the north. But his troops were all from the north, and they were afraid of not going back, so they were discussing rebellion. A palace maid heard the news and told Queen Xiao. Empress Xiao is still very smart, so you can speak for yourself. As soon as the result was mentioned, Emperor Sui Yang became furious. Are you qualified to say this? Just kill this palace maid. Later, there were more and more news that the army was going to rebel. Queen Xiao told the people in the palace that there was no need to talk to His Majesty. Why add to his worries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in terms of the combat effectiveness of Emperor Sui Yang&#39;s army at that time, it was still very powerful, but at the last moment of his life, Emperor Sui Yang had given up treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summary is that as a political figure, Emperor Sui Yang:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, he was unable to reconcile complex political and social contradictions;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Failed to build a core team that was loyal to itself and capable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, there was no awareness of changing course when the situation started to go unfavorable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, there was no persistence when the situation was very unfavorable. will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the things he did, such as building the Grand Canal, you might as well look at it this way: When discussing long-term history, even if a person is an emperor, his influence may not be that important. The study of factors such as finance and taxation, technology diffusion, productivity, economic and social structure is enough to explain the problem, and it might as well not involve character evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To evaluate a character, you need to look at the history of a short period of time. A short period of time in the historical sense is a lifetime for ordinary people. The great social collapse of the late Sui Dynasty triggered by Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty caused the death and displacement of tens of millions of people. This is real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, traditional history books and literary works often apply too much paint to characters. This problem does exist. But if you think the truth is revealed by turning traditional records over, you might as well save it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩余华英获死刑，受害家庭：“几十年的辛酸，终于清楚了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256948]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:16:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251151&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, Yu Huaying was charged with child trafficking. Sentenced to death. (Guiyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, the Guiyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court publicly pronounced the verdict on the crime of child abduction and trafficking against the defendant Yu Huaying. Yu Huaying was sentenced to death for child abduction, deprived of political rights for life, and confiscated all personal property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video shot by the media, Yang Niuhua read the verdict to the parents looking for relatives at the door of the court, hoping that they could all see hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua was abducted and trafficked by Yu Huaying when she was 5 years old. She successfully found her relatives 25 years later. In 2022, Yang Niuhua reported the case to the police and provided clues, and the child abduction and trafficking case of Yu Huaying was officially filed. (For details, please see the relevant report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/253854?source=134&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: abducted 11 children and also sold her own son&lt;/a a>;》)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The trial by Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court found that the defendant Yu Huaying collaborated with Gong Mouliang (deceased) from 1993 to 1996 for profit Illegal interests circulated in Guizhou Province, Chongqing City and other places, looking for suitable children to abduct and traffic. After they succeeded, the two took the abducted children to Handan City, Hebei Province, and through the introduction of Wang Moufu and Yang Moulan, they found a buyer for the sale. , profiting from this, during which a total of 11 children were abducted. The Guiyang Intermediate Court held that the defendant Yu Huaying had repeatedly abducted and trafficked children in order to obtain illegal profits. His behavior constituted the crime of child abduction. The crime was particularly serious and extremely harmful to society and should be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying appealed in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I hope she will die, but I don’t want her to die”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although it was only a first-instance verdict, Cai Huiying, a family member of the victim who attended the sentencing, Feeling devastated, she told her relatives on the phone: &quot;We have finally figured it out after decades of hardship and fatigue. We finally understand.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;After Cai Huiying walked out of the court, she started calling her family. The first one is the abducted party - his younger brother Cai Zhansheng. Cai Shengsheng was 6 years old when he was abducted in Zunyi and disappeared with his brother. A few months later, the elder brother came back alone without seeing his younger brother. It was not until the end of 2022, after the Yu Huaying case was filed, that Cai Shengsheng went home through DNA comparison. Thirty years later, Cai Zhansheng can no longer remember many details, but he still remembers Yu Huaying with high cheekbones and a long face. Cai Huiying said that her brother was also very happy to learn that Yu Huaying was sentenced to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying called her parents for the second time. After his younger brother was lost, his father insisted on going out to look for his relatives for more than 20 years, traveling to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Henan, Jiangxi and other places. Wherever there was news, my father immediately went out to verify it. He went out with hope again and again, but his hope was shattered again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, my father should hate Yu Huaying very much. But two months ago, when my father learned that the prosecutor recommended the death penalty for Yu Huaying in the first trial, &quot;the first sentence he said was that I hope she (Yu Huaying) dies, but I don&#39;t want her to die.&quot; Cai&#39;s father hopes that Yu Huaying will be sentenced to death because she has brought endless harm and pain to his family; he does not want her to die, but he wants to give her some time to tell the story of the children who have been abducted and trafficked over the years, so that more parents can Find the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying replied to her father: &quot;This is our common idea, but can she do it?&quot; Cai Huiying once attended the first trial. At that time, Yu Hua Ying expressed that he was &quot;unclear&quot; and &quot;cannot remember&quot; many of the circumstances of the crime. Only when talking about his son and daughter, Yu Huaying burst into tears and choked with sobs. This made Cai Huiying quite angry, and she clenched her fists from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying abducted 11 children, involving 8 families. This time the court pronounced its verdict, and relatives from five families came to listen. One mother had two sons abducted, another mother had a son and a daughter abducted, and yet another mother had a son abducted. When Cai Huiying saw the mother who came from Zunyi, after Yu Huaying was sentenced to death, she stood up with excitement and seemed to want to beat her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During lunch, Cai Huiying chatted with several mothers about their respective situations: the children of five families were recovered one after another after Yang Niuhua reported the crime. However, the relationship between the biological family and the foster family is quite complex. Some abducted children find it difficult to cope with the situation, fail to accept family recognition, and rarely come back for reunions. &quot;But we are all grateful to Niuhua, because she reported the crime and we were able to find our relatives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The regret of broken family ties has appeared in many victim families. In Dazu, Chongqing, Bai Ticai, whose son was abducted by Yu Huaying, was completely unaware of the court verdict. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the child had never seen him since the spring of 2020 when he recognized his relatives, and the two had lost contact. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/7486ba21cd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1706&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/7486ba21cd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251152&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, parents looking for relatives gathered outside the gate of Guiyang Intermediate Hospital. (Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Encourage parents looking for relatives to &quot;don&#39;t give up&quot;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;On September 18, outside the gate of Guiyang Intermediate Court, there were still three floors inside and three floors outside surrounded by parents who came to look for relatives, just as they did during the court hearing in July. Everyone held a family-searching information board in front of their chests, on which the information about the abducted children was printed in the most conspicuous yellow letters on a red background. The children were still young when they were abducted, and the printed photos show them when they were one or two years old, and most of them are blurry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the court hearing in July, Southern Weekend reporters saw An Shiming, who came to search for his son. He came to the court door early holding a family search information board to broadcast live. This time when the verdict was announced, he once again came early with some parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Cai Huiying arrived before 8 o&#39;clock, more parents saw this search than at the first trial. She stood far away and did not dare to walk into the crowd. &quot;I felt that as soon as I stood there and heard what they said, I naturally couldn&#39;t control the emotion.&quot; For parents who are still looking for relatives, Cai Huiying feels that what she can say is feeble: &quot;Have more courage and continue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua Dare to speak to parents looking for relatives. In a live media broadcast after the trial, she once again encouraged parents looking for their children not to give up. She mentioned her own example: the first time she took blood to find her relatives was in 2012, but there has been no news in the past ten years. But in 2021, in just over a month, she miraculously found her home through the short video platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After finding a home, Yang Niuhua lived in Hebei, Yu Huaying was in Chongqing, and the trafficking case occurred in Guizhou. The three places were far apart. It seemed that it was very difficult to find human traffickers. Disaster. But now, Yu Huaying has been punished by law. &quot;Really never give up,&quot; Yang Niuhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before and after every court session, Yang Niuhua’s schedule is tight and busy. On the one hand, families looking for relatives hope to take this opportunity to spread the information about finding relatives, and find her to live broadcast and record videos together; on the other hand, media interviews continue, and Yang Niuhua repeatedly recounts her experience of being abducted and the hardships of growing up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sister Sang Ying felt a little distressed when she saw Yang Niuhua always rushing ahead. Both sisters were actually victims. After Yang Niuhua was abducted in 1995, her parents were extremely sad and died in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Sangying lost her home and was forced to go out to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电诈受害者的银行卡困境:报案后要被冻结多久]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/2ea2e16682.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/2ea2e16682. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 10, 2023, the Beijing police were promoting anti-email fraud. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a week of being defrauded of more than 30,000 yuan, Shenzhen citizen Li Zheng kept asking the police, The bank proved that she was sober and would no longer transfer money to the scammer. On the day she was defrauded, all the debit cards and credit cards in her name were taken protective stop-payment measures by the police and could not be used. The reason was to prevent her from being defrauded again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called protective stop payment means that in order to protect the victim from further losses, the payment function of the bank card is stopped. Only transfers can be made, but transfers and cash withdrawals cannot be made. The customer service of Li Zheng&#39;s bank card bank informed him that the one-month payment stop measure for bank accounts that are likely to be defrauded again is consistent across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protective stop payment suddenly made Li Zheng unable to use her bank card to buy groceries, take a car, or even pay school fees for her children. She felt extremely inconvenienced. She found that she was not the only one trying to lift the protective stop payment. There were victims across the country who encountered the same problem. Many of them were still burdened with mortgages and were so anxious that they didn&#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The card was frozen after taking the initiative to report the crime&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 7, 2023, Li Zheng was on the noisy street when she received a fraud call. The other party asked her to confirm that her social account was in the security center. The &quot;million protection insurance&quot; is not free. Li Zheng hurried to do things and didn&#39;t want to pay attention to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person on the other end of the phone said it would only take a few minutes, just follow the instructions to confirm. Li Zheng listened to the other party&#39;s voice on the road, and responded intermittently. He downloaded a &quot;bank APP&quot; according to the other party&#39;s request, entered different business numbers and order numbers back and forth, and tried to see whether the transfer was successful, starting from 7 yuan to 8 yuan. Small transfers ranging from RMB 20,000 to large transfers of more than 20,000 yuan. After turning the corner and walking into a secluded place, she suddenly realized that she had been cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng immediately hung up on the scammer and dialed 110 to call the police. At this time, she had transferred more than 30,000 yuan to the scammer, and she didn&#39;t know whether she could get it back. The Futian Police Station of the Futian Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau quickly received the call and called her to wait where she was for the time being. A police car would be sent to pick her up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police from the police station took her for questioning and taking notes. Li Zheng said that at that time, the police only froze the suspect&#39;s account and did not mention that they would implement a protective stop payment on his bank card. The police also uploaded the report details to the national anti-fraud APP, and you can also see relevant information when you log in later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock that night, police officers from the Nanshan Branch Merchants Police Station where Li Zheng lived came to her door, asked her if she had been defrauded, and spread anti-fraud knowledge to her. Li Zheng thought that the handling of the fraud case had come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when she was about to pay with her mobile phone the next day, she discovered that the two debit cards and one credit card in her name could no longer be used. After consulting the account bank, she learned that it was a protective stop payment operated by the anti-fraud police and was frozen for one month according to regulations. If she wanted to lift it, she could consult the Nanshan Branch Anti-Fraud Center. However, Li Zheng found that the call was not easy to get through, so he complained through the national anti-fraud hotline 96110. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Li Zheng received police calls from Futian Police Station, Shenzhen Public Security Bureau, and Futian Branch. The answers they received were all &quot;In order to protect you from being deceived again, your bank card needs to be frozen for one month.&quot; Li Zheng did not agree with this. She took the initiative to report the crime when she realized that she had been deceived, and she also suffered property losses. &quot;How could it be possible to transfer money to the scammer again?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believed that the stop-payment measure had caused her many problems. It is inconvenient that bank cards are needed for food and clothing at home and for company transactions. Now everything is &quot;immobilized&quot;. However, the credit card still needs to be repaid and may face the risk of overdue payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, at Li Zheng’s strong request, the police accompanied her to withdraw more than 7,000 yuan from two cards. Despite this, she believes that it is still difficult to maintain daily life because the debit card cannot be transferred and the credit card cannot be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the Anti-Fraud Center of the Nanshan Branch to inquire. The staff of the Anti-Fraud Center stated that the bank card under Li Zheng’s name was indeed in a “protective stop payment” status and would stop payment within 48 hours. The payment will continue to circulate until one month. How to cancel it can be consulted with the Nanshan Branch. But before that, Li Zheng had communicated with the Nanshan Branch Investment Police Station many times, but the payment stop could not be lifted. Futian branch police told Southern Weekend reporters that what Li Zheng encountered was an ordinary telecommunications fraud case. The matter of lifting the protective stop payment has been communicated and coordinated with the Nanshan branch. More details of the case cannot be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Zheng rushed between two police stations, she discovered that the situation she encountered was not an isolated case. There were many victims of electronic fraud at the scene who came to complain about frozen bank cards. On the Internet, there are also victims on various social media asking how to lift the protective stop payment. Their ID addresses include Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, etc.: &quot;The stop payment on the 21st of last month has not been lifted yet. Do you know how to deal with it? &quot;I still have bank mortgages affected&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The original intention is to prevent &quot;obsession&quot;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Guo Zhi, a lawyer at Beijing Yingke (Shenzhen) Law Firm Hao has been paying attention to card unfreezing cases for a long time and provides legal consultation on unfreezing cards. According to his understanding, the protective stop payment originally originated from the &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, on October 10, 2020, the State Council convened an inter-ministerial joint meeting to combat new illegal crimes in telecommunications networks and decided to launch a nationwide &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation from that date. The main purpose is to deal with a major root cause of the continued high incidence of telecom network fraud - the out-of-control management of phone cards and bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Guo Zhihao said that after the &quot;card disconnection&quot; campaign began, the number of bank cards frozen due to the inflow of unknown funds increased. He received hundreds of inquiries about unfreezing cards a week, among which protection Inquiries about sexual cessation of payment also appear occasionally, but the overall proportion is low. From 2020 to 2022, among the 100 cases inquiring about unfreezing cards, only one or two were protective stop payments; since 2023, the number of consultations on such cases has increased, with four or five out of 100 cases. Regarding the protective stop payment, Guo Zhihao suggested that if the client does not need to use the bank card urgently, there is no need to find a lawyer to represent him, because most of them will be automatically lifted after one month, and &quot;the tossing and tossing is only a week or two in advance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason for the increase in the number of stop-payment inquiries, Guo Zhihao did not find any new public documents in 2023. It should only be implementation adjustments in individual regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that since June 2023, public security agencies in many places across the country have issued the &quot;Notice on Carrying out Anti-Fraud Dissuasion and Protective Emergency Stop of Payments&quot;, in which the time and method of lifting the payment stop are specified. Different expressions: The Yuanzhou Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province mentioned in an announcement on June 7: “If you have transferred money to the account involved in fraud, the branch will immediately implement a protective stop payment on your account, 48 It can be lifted on your own after an hour.&quot;; The Public Security Bureau of Xining City, Qinghai Province reminded in an announcement in August: &quot;If the bank account under your name only accepts payments but does not pay, please go to the nearest public security agency as soon as possible to explain the situation and request to lift the suspension. Pay and restore the normal use of the bank card.&quot; Guo Zhihao believes that the original intention of stopping payments in various places is the same, to prevent victims from being obsessed with transferring money to fraudulent accounts again, but there are no clear regulations on implementation standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted a victim who had been &quot;obsessed&quot; during the interview. Chen Qiang, a 27-year-old doctoral student in Guangzhou, was deeply involved in an investment and stock fraud group in July. It was a well-designed scam. When opening an account, the other party could verify it via video. The transfer provided was a third-party public account, and the company existed and was operating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was convinced and transferred &quot;investment&quot; to the account for three consecutive days. On July 19, the anti-fraud police took him to the police station and told him that he was transferring money to an &quot;early warning account.&quot; Chen Qiang didn&#39;t believe it at all. &quot;I can&#39;t be cheated.&quot; The police repeatedly &quot;educated&quot; him for two hours and asked him about his behavior. The account adopts a 48-hour emergency payment stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was doubtful and told the scammer the information that he had been tipped to be deceived. The scammer first sent him a private message, telling him that he had also been called to the police station because of the company&#39;s bank account risk. The &quot;agency&quot; was currently investigating and it would not affect investment safety. The next day, the &quot;agency&quot; issued a processing notice. After several operations, Chen Qiang believed in the liar again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the emergency stop payment, Chen Qiang continued to transfer money to the scammer. It was not until a few days later that the scammer induced him to invest all his money. Chen Qiang suddenly realized that his more than 50,000 yuan had been locked and could not be withdrawn. . Chen Qiang admitted that it took him several days to get out of the scam, and the 48-hour emergency stop payment did play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case is not rare. Wang Xueni, who lives in Zhejiang, was not aware of the problem when she was defrauded on August 11. It was not until the public security organs discovered that the fraudster&#39;s bank account had received transfers from her, prompting her that she was experiencing telecommunications network fraud. On the same day, she went to the police station to be questioned by the police, and all bank cards began to stop payment for 32 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another victim in Guangzhou, Lin Qingqing, was prompted by the police to report the crime to the local police station and take notes. However, Lin Qingqing said that the process of lifting the payment stop went smoothly. After filling out the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; at the Anti-Fraud Center, police from the police station near her residence came to verify and conduct anti-fraud propaganda. Soon her bank card was unfrozen. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted by Lin Qingqing on her social account, in addition to basic information, the form also requires filling in &quot;whether you have met with the police to dissuade you&quot;; The purpose of the stopped payment bank card after the stop payment is lifted. The transaction details must indicate to whom the transfer is to be made, and the reasons for the transfer should be attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the process of lifting the payment stop is not smooth for many netizens. On Zhihu, a netizen with an IP address in Jiangxi said that the local police had stopped payment, and after the lifting, over-the-counter transactions were still restricted. A netizen in Jiangsu said that it would take 40 days to lift the local payment stop, and he had to go there in person; some people were very panicked. He said that he was about to repay the loan, and he didn’t know when the stop payment measure would be lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1707&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted online by Lin Qingqing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Post-disaster reconstruction&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang describes his life after being cheated It is &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot;. He had been attending school all these years and what little savings he had was wiped out in this fraud. &quot;After being deceived, I would even hesitate to eat beef noodles for 15 yuan.&quot; Chen Qiang said, and what is even more suffocating is that such days are expected to continue for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, he reflected on his greed and arrogance, and felt ridiculous about his performance when he first entered the police station, &quot;(his) attitude was very bad.&quot; After he came to his senses, he called the police who took the notes at the time and asked if there was any possibility of recovery. The other party told him that it was difficult to recover overseas fraud, not to mention that it had been too long since the transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Chen Qiang hopes that &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot; will go smoothly. Seven days after he stopped transferring money and got out of the scam completely, he received a call from the public security bureau in his hometown, informing him that all bank card payments would be suspended for one month. &quot;After finally being defrauded, I looked away, but my card was blocked.&quot; Chen Qiang said he didn&#39;t know how long the payment stop would last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xueni also mentioned the anxiety after her bank card was stopped. She called the police and the bank where she opened her account many times to ask when the payment stop would be lifted, but the other party only said &quot;wait a little longer.&quot; Before the accident, she had borrowed a micro loan, and after the payment stopped, she could only borrow money to repay. Before she knew the exact time to unfreeze, she was very worried about not being able to repay the money she borrowed from friends. Wang Xueni did not tell her family that she had been cheated, and she had no money to use after the payment was stopped, so it was easy for her to reveal her secret. Because of this, she couldn&#39;t eat or sleep well. &quot;A protective stop payment is actually a punishment for the person who was defrauded. Let yourself remember this lesson.&quot; Wang Xueni said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng does not agree with the term &quot;lesson&quot;. She believes that she is a victim and being deceived is already a huge lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, there are many posts seeking relief from payment stoppages. Zhu Jingxian from Zhejiang was defrauded of 630,000 yuan due to her husband&#39;s negligence. After reporting the crime, her bank card was frozen for 48 hours. However, 25 days after the incident, the bank card was still protected from payment, and at the same time, various street police stations were called to inquire about the situation of being defrauded. After 35 days, his bank card was still unresolved. After explaining the situation to the Public Security Bureau, he had to wait another 48 hours for a reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng understands the netizen who posted the message. She believes that the specific situation should be analyzed in detail. Victims who have awakened can lift the payment stop early, rather than applying a blanket approach. On September 13, police from the China Merchants Police Station unfrozen all the credit cards in Li Zheng&#39;s name and temporarily unfrozen a savings card so that she could repay the company loan first. Li Zheng said that on September 14, the person in charge of the Futian Police Station informed him that the police station had internal discussions on the case and believed that there was a problem of insufficient exchange of information within the police, and that the police should be considerate of citizens&#39; demands and help solve the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Guo Zhihao, all names in the text are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx .net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt; /div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大科学装置“夸父”首次亮相]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256934]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The sun is the source of life&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sun is a symbol of light&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, humans want to create a &quot;sun&quot; on the earth&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let energy be inexhaustible, water clear and sky blue, and life sustainable&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xinhua News Agency reporter&#39;s exclusive visit&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;China’s large scientific installation &quot;CRAFT&quot; under construction&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at this research platform&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to develop an &quot;engine&quot; for the future &quot;artificial sun&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/a963d796ae46fc31456463f2c9833a29.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot; 634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/a963d796ae46fc31456463f2c9833a29.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rendering of the &quot;Kuafu&quot; park (Photo courtesy of the Institute of Plasma Physics, Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scientific name of &quot;Kuafu&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fusion Reactor Host Key System Comprehensive Research Facility (CRAFT)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is a major national science and technology infrastructure project established during the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;December 2018 Approved to start construction in May&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is expected to be fully completed by the end of 2025&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18 /72f3a1a844b0a5a10a625b33b41fcbe0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;562&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/72f3a1a844b0a5a10a625b33b41fcbe0.png&quot; data -key=&quot;251114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The actual construction scene of the &quot;Kuafu&quot; park taken on September 11.

At this time, the demon Mephisto comes and lures him to sign an agreement: to satisfy everything he had during his lifetime. Asked to take his soul until his death. This is also a bet between Mephisto and God. In pursuit of truth, Faust went through many hardships and traveled all the paths that humans have pursued. He often failed and sank, but he did not give up and finally gained salvation. Li Mo likes this work very much and has read it many times. He feels that Faust and Mephisto are the two sides of human beings. &quot;As people grow up, the soul seems to be less and less important. I wrote that sentence in my signature, hoping that all the people I know will think of this when they see it: If it is not so important, it will be in you. If you don’t even explore it, how about selling your soul? After Faust experienced everything, he found that the soul is the most important. This is the meaning of Mephisto.

There are many similar details in the play. Did you change these? Why do we need to change this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The model in the original book has been discontinued. A lot of the modifications were made in the hope that it would become closer to the present. I predict that people will be sensitive to these things. For example, the Le Labo balm that Xu Ziquan used on the plane at the beginning of the play was not mentioned in the original work. That is one of my personal favorites. I find it very convenient and can take it with me on the plane at any time. Later I learned that that one had also been discontinued, but it was still in production when I was writing the script. I want to change the TV series to be closer to some of my life (actual situations), and the wine used in it is also the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How the props are presented is part of the expression. This is not about selling goods.

Because the play is over, I hope to give the audience a sense of closure, a ceremonial explanation. He proposed, not got married. I don&#39;t think they got married. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a big difference between proposing and getting married. Proposing means my determination and intention. I want to be with you forever. I didn’t say we’d grow old together, but I wanted to build our own world with you. I know that we may encounter many difficulties after entering marriage, but I believe that you and I have the ability to live our lives the way we want. This is the determination I want to say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Idealism and materialism are not contradictory. I thought so in my heart. I want to take some actions to prove it. When I have the financial resources, I will buy a diamond ring to express my love to my lover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I put such a scene in the ending just to tell the audience that Xu Ziquan is a sincere person. Many viewers thought he was handsome, his butt was perky, he owned a car and a house, and he was a financial man... so they concluded that this (proposal) was not true, that this love was a fairy tale, and that he could not like a third-year lawyer so much. ——It looks like that. But love is not a business. There is no reason to fall in love with someone. I just love you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time of the final proposal, Xu Ziquan&#39;s view of love had changed. He was willing to build &quot;our world&quot; with Tang Ying, and was willing to turn one person&#39;s life into &quot;our two lives.&quot; , I think this is the value and meaning of marriage proposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am willing to advocate the positive expression of I love you and my willingness in my plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this also your view on love? This positive expression and belief? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I keep exploring what love is before I can believe in it. I believe love begins when I meet my wife. A large part of Xu Ziquan is my projection. He didn&#39;t think there was such a person in the world who could support me, who could see the worst in me and still love me, who could tolerate me and understand me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tang Ying is the one who talks about love and understands love. Xu Ziquan understands teasing and skills. He knows how to make people like him. I like the scene in the bathroom the most. When Xu Ziquan was very bad, Tang Ying did not criticize him for being bad, but told him: You should tell me that you are not in a good state, you should share with me, and you should tell him that you are not in good condition. Show me your good side, don&#39;t worry, I can catch it, I think you are the best, you don&#39;t even know how good you are. This is a moment that I have experienced in my life, which makes me feel that I am loved, wrapped and supported by others. She made me feel that even though I was in such a bad state, I had such mood swings, my career was at a low point, and I couldn&#39;t see the future, she still didn&#39;t despise me, didn&#39;t measure me based on these, and didn&#39;t condemn me. She told me: I love you, you don’t even know how good you are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That moment made me understand what love is. It turns out that love is not about asking or giving, but about giving to each other. It means being able to see the worst side of him and still love him. This is the concept of love I want to tell you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/RUmrzlT0NgeYRX9rp0B9x0P0HAmubDRtmCGSdJwj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;The Pretender Apocalypse&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;No results will come if you don’t work hard None&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said you like Han Dongjun (playing Xu Zi Quan), why does this feeling of fatigue touch you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the people in the circle I want to talk about are not worthy of saying they are tired or saying they have worked hard. They earn more money. In the context of the play, it is unacceptable for people who earn more money to suffer miserably. But when he truly comes into contact with the lives of these people and their difficulties, he cannot tell others that he is tired, miserable, or unhappy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You work in CBD, you are so busy, you were admitted to Peking University and Tsinghua University, you graduated from the fourth department of the fifth college, you went to the red circle institute, you went to SDIC, you did it Middle level, this life is already at its peak, what else do you want? What else are you miserable about? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The worst thing about them is that they are not qualified to say they are miserable. There are seniors and juniors above them, and there are competitors beside them. If they make a mistake, they will be overthrown by others. No one can see the current situation of their lives. People think you deserve it, you deserve it. Why do you scream miserably? I can&#39;t even eat, I don&#39;t even scream miserably. You live in fine clothes and food every day, and go to luxurious occasions. Why are you so miserable? So I can&#39;t scream for them in this scene. I can only show their state. This is the feeling of fatigue. He can&#39;t express it. He can only smile and say to people, yes, you are right. This is how I feel about the people I know. Of course I don&#39;t think they are miserable either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I want to talk about this group of people, I have to capture the most unique part of this group of people. For me, this part is that these people are very tired, but they can’t express it. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You filmed &quot;I&#39;m Good in a Foreign Country&quot; and &quot;Three &quot;Joy Has a New Life&quot; and &quot;Pretending to Be Apocalypse&quot; have received good reviews.

I clearly know that this thing can be done well, and I know how to do it well, but I just can&#39;t do it. At times like this, I feel very small in this city. I don’t know what the problem is, I’ve done everything I can, but things are still like this. This is the plight of urbanites that resonates most with me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I want to tell you more, don’t give up in the face of this dilemma. Giving up is a kind of self-protection, because if you don’t have expectations, you won’t be disappointed or hurt. Whether facing work, love or family relationships, they all protect themselves in a way of withdrawal. It&#39;s fine if I&#39;m alone, it&#39;s fine if I don&#39;t go up, it&#39;s fine if I lie down, and I still get paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But even so, we should try. How terrible is failure? How terrible is falling out of love? Sometimes I feel that falling out of love is a very happy thing. I can feel many emotions that I can&#39;t usually feel. What a valuable life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You see, everything I talked about is quite idealistic. The material aspect is also important, but in fact you can live no matter what, and you don’t have to make a lot of money. The main thing is to figure out the standard of living you want, and if you do well in what you do today, it will be great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you feel like you have gotten out of this predicament now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s hard to get out. I still feel powerless. Even if I feel I have done more than before, I still have things to do. Less than. The longer I work, the more powerless I feel. There are very few things that people can control. The director seems to have quite a lot of power and can decide many things, but I can&#39;t decide whether it will rain today or whether there will be a meeting tomorrow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you feel powerless, it means you have not found the right way to get along with the world. Once you find it, you can feel the support the world gives you, rather than you and the world. opposition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When did you begin to feel that the world was giving you help and support?

The reality is that our efforts may not necessarily bring positive returns, and individuals cannot achieve a change in their destiny just by working hard. Have you ever thought about this reality in your expression? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Mo: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I plan to talk to you about this in a later project. It is about a young man born in the 2000s who has been very ambitious since he was a child. , was admitted to a very good university in Beijing, and enrolled in 2019. After three years of the COVID-19 epidemic, I couldn’t find a job after graduation. I am currently writing a script and will film this project next year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think now is an era of change, which is different from before. Everyone must accept the change. Every generation will face changes in the times, such as social fluctuations, wars, and changes, so there is no need to panic. You said that in the face of structural problems, people need to adjust their goals and self-positioning in the face of this era. It does not mean that the times have changed and I will not get the same results as in the previous era if I work hard, so I don&#39;t work hard. Efforts in this era will have results in this era. Without efforts, there will be no results. Working hard is not a choice, working hard is what you should do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe when I finish filming the scene next year, I can bring some discussion to everyone. I want to tell everyone how to be down-to-earth in that scene. But I still want to tell you here, don’t give up. When you are lying down in this era, a group of people who are not lying down will take away the opportunity. This is the case in every era. The opportunities you give up will be taken away by others. If you work hard, you may find opportunities. Facing life positively is not a bad thing in any era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[历经社会毒打为何屹立不倒？因为“男人至死是少年” ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 22:00:36&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;A man is a boy until he dies&quot; is so widely known that my eardrums sometimes Be shaken. For example, most men retain the hobbies of their youth, such as games, toys, sports, and crafts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, &quot;A man remains a boy until he dies&quot; is a comment full of life philosophy. It is simply &quot;measured&quot; by a group of men who have experienced the cruel beatings of society but can always stand up in the world. &quot;Customized&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A foreign talk show actor said in an interview that eating pizza and drinking wine, sitting in front of the TV watching football games, scolding the referee, just spending a happy time alone, never mind What a blessing. When asked if he was tired from watching so many football games in a week, he replied: &quot;Not tired at all, because I am the kind of simple-minded man who can get happiness just by sitting and watching football games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;So, &quot;Will you watch football games with your wife?&quot; His answer was: &quot;No, she has a complicated mind and it is difficult to focus on one thing. Some women feel unhappy every day because of this.&quot; A bit. He complained about his wife. However, one fact is good: differences in preferences between men and women exist objectively, and many times, this difference is also interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A male respondent on Zhihu said that there were a bunch of things in his online shopping list that he wanted to buy but knew were useless, and a wooden stick costing more than ten yuan came second. After getting the stick, he put glue on his hands and brought it to the unit. The female colleague asked him why he bought it. He said he just wanted to buy it, but she didn&#39;t understand. This seems to mean that a dozen yuan is money, and it is not a waste to buy a handful of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asserted: &quot;I&#39;ll just put the stick here. Do you think any man will come over and not play with it?&quot; As a result, six or seven people played with the stick in the afternoon. She couldn&#39;t understand it, so he gave it to her. Her husband sent a photo, and after a while her husband replied: This stick is great! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The respondent lamented that this stick can kill boys from a few years old to several decades old, but as long as a boy sees something he played with when he was a child, he will immediately and seamlessly pick it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also have personal experience of this. I played seal carving when I was thirteen and learned a lot. Although I slacked off a bit when I reached middle age, my hobby of sharpening stones remained. As long as you see the carving knife and the seal stone, you will feel warm in your heart. If you pick up the stone and sharpen it, you will experience the non-utilitarian joy. Not long ago, my parents-in-law listened to my suggestion and built a &quot;grindstone&quot; for me in a chicken coop in the countryside. I often put away my mundane things and concentrate on grinding stones here. While grinding the stone, the chickens are walking and the insects are chirping, and the wind is blowing and the leaves are falling, so I feel at ease. At that moment, this ultimate tranquility with nothing to worry about and no rush for five buckets of rice was charming and magical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, the reason why many men can remain teenagers until they die is that they have always experienced the essence of simple happiness. Not to mention that things worth more than ten yuan can make them happy. Even worthless things, such as a branch or a stone picked up from the Gobi Desert, can make them immersed in it and play with it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the real happiness does not cost money. A good friend who graduated from Peking University told me that he likes physics and mathematics and is very happy every time he looks at it online. One of my old leaders also likes to sit for a while at work after work late at night and play against Go masters on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have noticed the chess players and chess watchers in a small street called Hongmiao near my work. Unless it rains heavily, they all play and watch chess on old tables on the street. As the chess game changes, , sometimes they are nervous and &quot;dare not speak loudly&quot;, sometimes they are cheerful and cheerful. I have been here for more than ten years, so I have carefully noticed that there are always only a few people playing chess and watching chess. Over the years, apart from their older faces, their happy expressions have not changed at all. Is that chess game about money? About reputation? About status? Not really. They are just &quot;stealing half a day&#39;s leisure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writer Wang Zengqi also wrote a story about an old man who was selfless and wonderful at making noodles and fish, praising him as a &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot;. The essence of the so-called &quot;living Zhuangzi&quot; is not &quot;profound&quot;, but the far-reaching and unrestrained imagery. The same goes for those &quot;fishing friends&quot; who sit by the quiet and deserted river all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the vast majority of men cannot remain isolated from the world, and they are burdened by fame and fortune. But after entering middle-aged and old age, many men suddenly realize that since their jobs and ranks are just like that, the heights they can reach in their lifetime are also like that. Let go of what you can’t get, leaving a pure world for yourself to live a better life. Simple and more innocent, wouldn&#39;t it be better? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of consideration is a reflection of simple character. When a man has thought through his personal honor and disgrace, as well as the gains and losses in life, the rest will become much simpler. Therefore, getting pleasure from getting along with yourself has become a daily task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting along with oneself is, in a sense, the most difficult thing. If a person always has unrealistic goals and is always competing with himself, then the quality of his life will be very bad and his personality will be easily torn. Of course, if a person always has unrealistic goals (for his spouse) out of a desire to compare, and urges his spouse to &quot;work hard&quot; to make more money and have power, then the quality of this kind of relationship will be It will be terrible and it will be difficult for the family to get along. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if a person can realize that at a certain stage of life, he is not pursuing what is happiness, and can maintain a normal mind, it will be easy for his own &quot;shadow&quot; to be created by himself. Infected by the natural interest, they can truly integrate together and make themselves stronger and more calm. If family members are more understanding or are such people, the family will be more harmonious and harmonious. This kind of freedom, relaxation, selflessness, and enjoyment are very different from the comparison fueled by consumerism that can easily lead to pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are inevitably disturbed by desires, but people still have to work hard to achieve a balanced relationship with themselves. Childlike innocence is still a very common but supreme state. Its basis is a strong disposition, the true meaning of happiness. In the final analysis, many men&#39;s respect for &quot;simple happiness&quot; represents a group&#39;s objective evaluation of their own value and a neither humble nor arrogant attitude towards &quot;the outside world&quot;. It continues the childlike innocence of individuals and makes secular life a little more tranquil. of interest. This is the secret of a man hidden in &quot;Till he is a boy until his death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刺客模式丨意长意短]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256930]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/IoH3LnypZUwNhU91O62T9wKXgOBVpGdB4mr6Axlw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/IoH3LnypZUwNhU91O62T9 wKXgOBVpGdB4mr6Axlw. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Saint-Lazare Metro Regional Express (RER) station in Paris, France. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When living in the countryside, there is no time to rush to get angry, it is just to rush out to collect when it rains heavily. clothes, or close windows that let in water. But going into the city is different, especially since there are so many anxious moments in Paris, such as catching a car or a flight. At that moment, I usually turn on the &quot;Assassin Mode&quot; and constantly remind myself: Concentrate and go straight to the goal, so as not to delay things. For example, one morning, I made an appointment with a friend from China who was visiting an art museum, and we had breakfast together in her hotel. I went out and found that it was already a little late. I was going to take bus 72 to the Louvre Museum. I saw bus 72 passing in front of me. It was still 500 meters away from the next stop. While the car was waiting at the traffic light, I ran forward in one breath, hoping to catch up before the car reached the next stop. I ran about a hundred meters when the bus driver caught up with me and honked the horn for me to get on the bus. After I got on, everyone in the car looked at me with sympathy. They must be thinking, this woman is really a bit hard-working. I was a little confused for a moment, thanked the master, and swiped my card in a hurry. In fact, I didn’t expect that the harder work would come later. When I took the plane back to China, I realized that every second counts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I first planned to go by car, and everything was arranged in an orderly manner. My friend Mike is an Italian petty bourgeoisie living in Paris (Li Piao is keen on shopping in supermarkets, saving points, and discovering various money-saving strategies). He has never taken me to the airport because he used to drive a diesel car with pollution level 5, which could not be driven except on weekends. Now that he has a new car with pollution level 2, which is ready to go on the road at any time, he enthusiastically said that he would give it to me. And the timing was coincidental, he got off work at five o&#39;clock and we set off at five twenty. My flight is at 9:20, so I leave four hours early. Charles de Gaulle Airport is only 30 kilometers away from where I live, so I should be there in an hour. I thought about it and thought it was appropriate. At five o&#39;clock, I went to a nearby shop and bought a bowl of fish fillet rice bowl. It was topped with a layer of tuna and salmon. It was not soupy and watery. It could be enjoyed before boarding the plane, so there was no need to eat on the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We set off at almost half past five. The atmosphere was relaxed, listening to music, talking and laughing. The first few kilometers were pretty smooth. Once on the ring road, the road was basically like a parking lot. Only motorcycles were speeding in the gaps between cars. Ambulances and police cars passed one by one, and the cars on both sides gave way. I looked out the window and thought about what&#39;s so good about a big city. It&#39;s so chaotic. But I really had plenty of time, so I tried to relax. The radio in the car played the soothing, melancholy and melodious singing of jazz singer Bilie Holiday, which was like a massage for the soul. It was about a woman. Crazy for love, you can move mountains and so on for love. Mike said it would be nice if you were a homeless person living under a bridge and didn&#39;t have to rush back to work. I want that too, but I like soft beds, I love my job, and I have to rush back to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were stuck in traffic on the ring road for an hour and planned to get off, but when we got to the side road, the car stopped there, unable to move forward or backward. On the map, the entire city&#39;s routes were red, and I waited until almost seven o&#39;clock. I looked out the window, and there were cars all around me. I became more and more panicked. I began to imagine the tragic situation of being expelled from school because I couldn&#39;t catch up with class. Even the brisk jazz tunes couldn&#39;t calm my mood. The city outside the window seemed like It&#39;s getting more and more aggressive, and the blue sky and white clouds seem hollow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mike was at a loss, so he took out a ticket from his wallet and said to me: &quot;You get off here and go straight to Line 4. From there you take the bus to North Station and then take the RER express.&quot; , Line B to Charles de Gaulle, it takes an hour to get to the airport. This area is very chaotic, be careful with your wallet and mobile phone. Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was not ready, but I got off the bus bravely , if there were any mistakes in the middle and I couldn&#39;t make it within an hour, I would have missed my flight. But if I sit in the car and wait, I will definitely miss my flight. I grabbed my luggage from the trunk (I was glad I had four wheels) and sped down the bike path like an antelope being chased by a lion on the grassland. I turned on &quot;assassin mode&quot; while running, with the goal of getting to the airport within an hour. I am glad that I wear sneakers and have good physical strength like a retired athlete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The beginning went well. I was standing in the subway station, hesitating where to get off. An old lady said loudly: &quot;It&#39;s the same on both sides.&quot; As soon as I got underground, there was a subway waiting with its door open. Before going up, I confirmed with a gentle man whether I was going to the North Station. I looked at the stop sign carefully, worried that I would miss it. But when I got to the North Railway Station, things became complicated. There were many trains, RER lines and subway lines. I couldn&#39;t find the B line at once. I followed the signs but ended up in the wrong place. Fortunately, I asked before getting on the train. You didn&#39;t get on the wrong bus. I was walking around like a headless fly when I saw an officer on duty who was on the phone. I rushed over and asked him where to sit at Charles de Gaulle Airport. He must have been shocked by the fact that I was sweating profusely. While he was talking on the phone, he quickly led me to the car. Coincidentally, the car I was going to take arrived at this time, so I might have a better chance of catching the plane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then there were forty anxious minutes. Each stop seemed extremely long, and people got on and off the bus leisurely at each stop. I thought that only flash floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and subway failures could prevent me from going to the airport at this time. I was very anxious and kept looking at my phone and looking at the two women sitting next to me who looked calm. They also had huge luggage, but they must have more time. I sighed that I was still sitting on a deck chair by the river yesterday afternoon, eating raw ham and cheese, drinking beer, and today I was about to go through such a test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport, twenty minutes before it closed for boarding passes. I followed the crowd and rushed to the counter. A handsome black man opened his hand and said to me: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll make it in time. Just relax.&quot; I handed him my passport, thinking that I must look very good. It&#39;s so embarrassing, it&#39;s like a bandit crossing the border. The passengers next to me were also complaining about the heavy traffic jam today, seeming to explain my late arrival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sent my luggage, queued at the security check, and sent a voice message to my Italian friend about what happened today. The girl in front of me turned out to be Italian, so she said to me: &quot;You should be in front of me. If it were me, I would be extremely anxious.&quot; We are truly sisters from all over the world. She said that she had worked at L&#39;Oréal Paris for three years and was now going to Shanghai to stay for three years. Her plane was behind me. I thanked her and moved in front of her without any ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I arrived at the boarding gate, I found that the sweat on my body had turned cold, my T-shirt was completely soaked, and the yellow fish pattern printed on it had turned brown. I suddenly felt very worried. I saw a retail store next to me, so I spent twenty euros on a souvenir T-shirt for my trip. I went to the bathroom to put it on and dried my hair to make sure everything was safe. At this time, there is no longer any queue at the boarding gate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m in line to board the plane.&quot; I called Mike to reassure him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I just came home too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Thank you for the airport light rail ticket today, thank you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t You delivered it. I&#39;m eating the fish fillet rice bowl you forgot on the seat. It&#39;s not bad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a good appetite.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I wish you a safe journey. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, I walked out of Chongqing Airport wearing a slightly tacky T-shirt with a huge Eiffel Tower printed on the chest, like a tourist who had just checked in. I have to say that catching the plane this time has given me a lot of confidence to face the future while feeling lucky. I remembered a scripture: There is a time for everything, a time for everything under the heaven...A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to abandon; a time to tear, and a time to mend; a time to be silent, and a time to speak...I feel that everything is There is a certainty that sometimes you miss your flight and sometimes you catch up: when necessary, turn on the &quot;assassin mode&quot;, stay vigilant&lt;strong>;and&lt;/strong>; move forward bravely, and there is always a chance of catching up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[导游变身导买，这样的旅游团还能走多远？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256920]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, I signed up for two tour groups, namely Three Gorges and Wulong. The orders were placed on the same travel platform. The customer service is very patient, the procedures are very standardized, and electronic contracts, travel notices, insurance purchases, etc. are all available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenery on both sides of the Three Gorges is beautiful. On the cruise ship, you can watch the rising sun in the morning and the bright moon and stars in the evening. You can hold a sleeve of breeze and watch the river flowing eastward. It is really a good place to express your love for the mountains and rivers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gap between the Tiankeng and the ground in Wulong is even more amazing. The Tiankeng is really as if God accidentally dropped a huge boulder, creating a huge crater on the ground. It is majestic, strange, dangerous and... It&#39;s quiet; the crack in the ground is like a narrow crack in the depths of the earth. The rock walls on both sides are steep, with springs and waterfalls splashing above, and streams flowing below. It&#39;s endlessly ethereal and breathtaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the beauty of these two journeys only ends here, because traveling also requires eating, sleeping, and a tour guide, which does not feel so wonderful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the tour guide first. Tour guides have long implemented the local accompanying system. They change tour guides at each place. When they arrive at the scenic spot, they change to another commentator. Along the way, there are many tour guides. One face is not familiar yet, and another face is changed immediately. It’s a revolving door. Similar. This is very unfriendly to me who is face blind, but that&#39;s it - there&#39;s nothing I can do about it - after not traveling far for three years, I was surprised to find that the guide system has always been the same, but now the tour guide&#39;s style has changed again , have turned into guides and bought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we swam at the Three Gorges Dam, on the way to the dock, the tour guide started selling beef, small fish products and sesame food in the car. She said that the quality of these products was guaranteed and the prices were reasonable. She wanted to buy them. Earn money for interest classes for my daughter. The driver cooperated and drove slowly, and then simply stopped on the side of the road. About one-third of the tourists bought the products she put in the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the middle of the trip to the Three Gorges, we got on a small boat and traveled to Shennu Creek. In addition to the boatman, there is also a tour guide named Amei on the boat. Shennu Creek is very beautiful, and the guide’s introduction was pretty good at the beginning. However, after only being “good” for a while, she introduced her hometown and various specialties from her hometown, which are “purely natural, pollution-free, and have special effects on the human body.” Efficacy&quot;. As I expected, on the return trip, she started selling the local specialties that had been placed on the cruise ship. During the entire return journey, I heard the tour guide shouting in the headset: &quot;Please support our hometown.&quot; &quot;How many packs do you want?&quot; The mood of watching the scenery was ruined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving in Chongqing, the tour guide did not help me buy any real items. What she sold was a night tour in Chongqing, three places, 70 yuan. When the car arrived in the city, she got off the bus with the tourists participating in the night tour and asked us to go to the hotel to check in. Then the tourists got into a quarrel at the hotel front desk over who checked in first and who last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wulong Tour also took us to a Miao Village Scenic Spot. In this scenic spot, the most impressive thing was that the tour guide of the scenic spot constantly promoted their silver products. In his mouth, these silver products are unparalleled in the world. The only thing left is that it has a full range of health care effects, blah blah blah. As a result, no one bought it, so he ignored us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about food. Most of the two tour groups include meals. Except for the three meals on the cruise ship, which are normal, the rest is hard to describe. The meal price is 40 yuan per person, eight dishes and one soup. These eight dishes include meaty ones such as very fatty pork belly, stir-fried chicken offal with onions, etc., and vegetarian ones such as cold skin, potatoes, pumpkins, etc. The soup is a veritable soup. I only saw three pieces of radish in one radish soup... &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As for the accommodation, each person is only guaranteed to have a bed to sleep on. As for whether the lights are on, whether the bath water is at a suitable temperature, and whether the door lock is broken, tourists are left to their own devices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traveling, you don’t make a guide, don’t plan a route, don’t bother to think about the car, meals, hotel, etc., but leave it all to the travel agency and become a hands-off shopkeeper yourself. I think it’s very strange. Economical and convenient model. Your travel agency makes money, and I, the tourist, enjoy the beautiful mountains, rivers and good mood. Both parties get what they want, how wonderful! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what I wonder is, why is the tourism industry running in the opposite direction? You see, the tour guide will almost reach into your pocket and take out the money. The group meal costing 400 yuan per table can be reduced to 40 yuan. The cheaper the room, the better, no matter what facilities it has. Don’t they think they are seeking a dead end and pushing tourists away? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after the epidemic, the market demand for tourism is huge. If the tourism industry seizes this trend, rectifies its business practices, provides high-quality services, changes its image, and builds reputation, it should be able to attract many tourists. under their command. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a pity, they are going further and further on the road of deceiving tourists. I don’t know how far this kind of tour group can go. At least, I don’t dare to join the tour group again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a retired teacher in Jiaxing, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The reporter learned from the China Bicycle Association on the 17th that my country, as the world&#39;s largest bicycle manufacturer and exporter, currently has more than 200 million bicycles in society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Wenyu, vice chairman and secretary-general of the China Cycling Association, said that based on a survey of travel data in eight cities including Beijing, Changsha, and Chengdu, about 30 out of every 100 trips taken by urban residents across the country are made by bicycles. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; has been completed, and &quot;two-wheel travel&quot; occurring around rail stations across the country accounts for more than 20% of the total travel volume. &quot;Two-wheel travel&quot; reduces carbon emissions by about 10,000 tons across the country every day. Based on a fuel consumption of 8 liters per 100 kilometers, this is equivalent to saving about 6.6 million liters of gasoline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to promote product structure optimization. Guo Wenyu said that the current output of lightweight and intelligent electric-assisted bicycles has increased significantly. In the past two years, the domestic sales growth rate of electric-assisted bicycles has exceeded 20%, and electric-assisted bicycles with intelligent functions are favored by young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bicycle industry continues to advance digitally and intelligently. Guo Wenyu said that currently on the production side, welding robots, painting robots, assembly line feeding robots, etc. have a wider range of applications, and more than 20% of industry companies have carried out production line automation upgrades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the consumer side of the bicycle industry, relying on technical support such as big data and the Internet of Things, new products and new models such as shared bicycles and centralized charging and swapping have emerged. Chu Yiqun, vice president of Haro Group, said that as a leading company in shared travel, Haro&#39;s number of registered users and orders have increased steadily in the past few years. &quot;Using high-level cycling products and services to continue to popularize low-carbon travel and healthy living, shared bicycle companies have a duty-free responsibility.&quot; Chu Yiqun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学者谈县域教育：要给没有能力进城的学生一定的教育发展空间]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256753]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBPeNQWX2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/b7Le3Gk6KsMQUogjkOpyho34RgSaUA8lBP eNQWX2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 2, 2021, in a rural primary school in Tengchong, Baoshan, Yunnan, preparations Sleeping students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2017, Lei Wanghong, who was still studying for a doctorate in administration at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, was working on Looking for a topic for her doctoral thesis, she set her sights on grassroots education for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This decision came from a &quot;shock&quot;. She graduated from a rural school in Jianghan Plain and studied all the way to get a doctorate. However, when she returned to her hometown, she heard that the school was no longer what it used to be. Students were fighting and the enrollment rate was declining. The junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and wiped in the back of the classroom. tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Lei Wanghong visited county schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Henan and other regions, and she found that this phenomenon was not a special case. She noticed that some drastic changes were taking place at the end of basic education, and these changes at the end were silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the wave of urbanization in education, rural students are pouring into counties, and what is left in villages and towns are often children who cannot afford to go to cities to study. Some of them do not like to study, are disobedient to discipline, and are almost self-indulgent. Giving up, the teacher also has a headache, and both parties are in confusion with no way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Wanghong believes that for county-level governments, the main goal of education urbanization is regional development, that is, by attracting rural students to study in cities and driving rural people to buy houses and consume in cities, thereby promoting land The closed fiscal cycle ultimately promotes regional economic development. However, from a practical point of view, the introduction of education into cities has not greatly stimulated local economic development as expected, but has resulted in some students being left behind in villages and towns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She found that counties in central and western provinces and eastern provinces have different development paths in the process of promoting urbanization of education: public and private education are more balanced in the eastern region, while private education in the central and western regions is relatively stronger. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there such regional differences? Educational urbanization has experienced at least ten years of development. How effective is it? Under this wave, what should the remaining children do? Lei Wanghong is now a lecturer at the School of Public Administration of Central South University. She was interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters on related issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The economic foundation determines the development path of county education&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you pay attention to county education issues at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>; Once when I returned to my hometown, a neighbor kid told me that my junior high school teacher was beaten by a student and was wiping tears behind the classroom. When I was studying, she was very majestic, and I respected her very much. This contrast was shocking. In addition, the situation in my hometown has not been very good for higher education in recent years, and there has been a fierce discussion in society about the uneven distribution of educational resources. At that time, our team had been studying grassroots governance, and no one had studied grassroots education issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After May 2017, I went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and Guizhou and other places to investigate different villages, townships and counties. The education situation of various school stages in the space, and understanding the development of government education, students&#39; family situations, and school social evaluation, the overall research perspective of county education gradually emerged. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eastern and central and western regions, in county education What problems do each face during development? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The eastern region has sufficient educational resources and capable parents. They generally form better home-school cooperation with schools, but competition in education It is very fierce. For example, the Hangzhou Family Committee election was reported in the news before. In order to give their children more performance opportunities, parents will engage in fierce PK. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important problem in the central and western regions is intergenerational separation. Parents will also follow the trend and adopt some self-help behaviors, such as &quot;accompanying students&quot;. The phenomenon of accompanying students in Gansu, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Hubei is very universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you found any similarities in the education situation in different regions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One similarity is the urbanization of education. To put it simply, the improvement of the quality of schools in the city will attract students to study in the city, which in turn will encourage more families to buy houses in the city, thereby revitalizing land finance and regional development. But there are some differences between the eastern region and the central and western regions. The former&#39;s education urbanization is more of a natural urbanization. Parents move to cities to work, live and take their children to receive education because there are job opportunities in the city. The latter&#39;s education urbanization is driven by local governments, because rural areas The supply of school education is too poor, and local governments have invested more resources in urban schools, thus forcing people to send their children to urban schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, I went to a developed county in Zhejiang for research. Basically, all the local village primary schools were withdrawn and concentrated on running schools in towns and villages. Township schools are well-equipped and beautifully built, and their teachers are of high standard, many of whom are admitted from other places. However, due to the urbanization of education, rural children have gone to cities to study, and those who are left behind are children with poor family conditions who do not like to study and are not easy to manage, which is a headache for teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I found that this phenomenon is very common. The end of the eastern region is at the township level, and the end of the central and western regions is at the village level. Being at such an end, unable to provide students with enough educational hope, teachers are also in pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The development logic of education urbanization in the eastern and central and western regions is the same ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Due to different economic bases, the eastern region and the central and western regions have very different spatial distribution. The eastern region has a developed economy and strong education supply capacity, and the quality of public education in various urban and rural areas of the county can be guaranteed. The eastern region has developed industries and large employment opportunities. Parents go to the cities to find jobs, and their children also go to the cities to study. Families can buy houses and live in the cities. Its urbanization is a natural urbanization in which education and production are synchronized. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of counties in the central and western regions have not yet established local finances that allow local governments to obtain sufficient financial resources. They are unable to ensure the balanced development of urban and rural education and provide employment for local migrant workers returning home. There is also very little space. Young people from peasant families can only go to the eastern cities to work and earn money. Because they cannot afford the high cost of education in developed areas, the children can only stay in their hometowns to go to school and be taken care of by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1706&quot; height= &quot;1278&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/8QOQd9HsiUr95IHAq4YeB54ACIHt10KrQATDgpbG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250888&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 2023, Lei Wanghong and his team conducted research in a certain county. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public education needs to respond to social needs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since at least ten years ago, there have been many views that urbanization of education is a &quot;green engine&quot;. You What is the entry point for research on educational urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, I was mainly stimulated by two things. First, many people in the academic community regard urbanization of education as a positive behavior. However, during the actual research process, I found that there are many problems in urbanization of education. Everyone’s educational anxiety is very serious, and many families bear an excessive educational burden. Education, medical care, and housing have become the new &quot;three mountains.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that I was deeply inspired after reading the doctoral thesis &quot;Children of Urbanization&quot; by Professor Xiong Yihan of Fudan University. The phenomenon we are concerned about is very similar - can rural children share the blue sky of education with urban children after entering the city? In fact, rural children are easily marginalized when they move to cities. For example, teachers in the city will mention that rural children have stereotypes such as being unhygienic and unruly. The campus culture of urban schools will make rural children feel inferior to a certain extent; rural children rarely have access to class power. structure, because teachers are more likely to accept children who are influenced by urban culture and form effective communication and interaction with them. When I held discussions with urban and rural students, I also found that urban students have stronger expressive skills and are good at showing themselves, while rural students are introverted. When they want to speak, they will inadvertently look at urban students for fear of saying something wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To promote the urbanization of education, local governments must build new schools in counties and open Between public and private schools, which option do most counties prefer? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The government is more willing to build public schools. Because private schools have difficulties in management, they can charge fees independently, use enrollment policies flexibly, and attract high-quality students through benefits. After the results of the high school and high school entrance exams are released, these students become the &quot;living signs&quot; of the school&#39;s publicity. Teachers will further gather in private schools, putting local public schools in a weak position and affecting the local education ecology to a certain extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in fact, the central and western regions will still choose to introduce it Private school, why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because the local finances of some counties in the central and western regions are not enough to support the development of public education. On the one hand, the local government has the task of attracting investment, and on the other hand, it has to ensure the supply of education and is under multiple pressures. Private schools in some areas are introduced through investment promotion. The local government has not only completed the corresponding investment quotas, but also alleviated the pressure on local degree supply. At the same time, the outstanding students cultivated by private schools can also be counted as the educational achievements of local governments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do parents prefer private schools? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The main reason is that many public schools have not responded to parents’ educational demands. This year I went to a township junior high school in a central province for research and found that the student cafeteria was not equipped with tables and chairs, and students squatted at the top of the stairs to eat. Some schools arrange for students to live in houses that were built 20 or 30 years ago, and the walls of the dormitories fall off from time to time. In 2021, I met a driver during my research. He said that both of his children were studying in private schools, which cost 60,000 yuan a year. The couple&#39;s salary was only enough to cover the expenses of the children, and their life was very stressful. I asked him if he would be willing to go to a public school if it could provide relatively good room and board services, but it would cost an extra thousand yuan per semester. He said he would definitely do it. This is also the sentiment of most parents. Only when the government finds a way to truly respond to the demands of the people will students slowly return to private schools. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/eXR0y4KyX2vVuA7IczOqzh7qbbrpC1EV7FohbnJB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 11, 2020, a newly built primary school was put into operation in Suining County, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Respect the laws of natural flow&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After research, what problems have you found that urbanization in education may bring about? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first is debt risk. Some local governments use education as the starting point to promote education to revitalize the city and invest a large amount of money in a short period of time. New schools were built, leading to serious debt. Recently I heard that a county in a central province is spending huge sums of money to build a school. Many counties in the survey have huge debts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the maintenance cost of schools is very high. Some local governments build schools to the highest standards ahead of schedule, leaving a large amount of space idle, resulting in very high school operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, farmers have a heavy education burden. When building primary and secondary schools in some places, they only focus on pure education issues and do not consider the overall social division of labor. Some newly built schools in urban areas are not equipped with dormitories and canteens. Rural parents who send their children to the city still need to rent or buy a house in the city to accompany them to school. They cannot Parents who take care of their children leave their children to child care institutions. For example, the child care institutions in Guangxi are particularly developed now. The child care institutions not only take care of students&#39; lives, but also take care of after-school learning. Whether it is renting or buying a house to accompany students to study, or hosting, it has greatly increased the financial burden of education on farmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is the adaptation problem of rural students just mentioned. A new dual structure of urban and rural education has essentially been formed in urban schools. The family background and family knowledge ability of rural students may not necessarily support them in the city. receive a fair education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since there are so many problems, why are the grassroots in the central and western provinces still there? Promote education urbanization? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In addition to facilitating management, the county government is also trying to activate local land finance through education urbanization. By vigorously developing education in county towns, farmers can move to cities to buy houses. Local governments can promote the return of capital, population agglomeration, and the formation of a chain to activate the county economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are these efforts effective? I saw that in the three central and western counties you visited for your doctoral thesis, housing prices did not rise in the end. Why is this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, farmers are not very motivated to buy houses in cities. In 2014, the house price in a county in Gansu was 4,000 yuan/square meter. But when I went to the county for research in 2017, house prices were still hovering around 4,000 yuan. Even so, the house still couldn&#39;t be sold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the development of county education lies in the county economy. The fundamental reason why farmers are not enthusiastic about buying houses in cities is that the cities lack an industrial foundation that can support them to maintain their family life. If migrant workers can only work as construction workers, waiters, etc. in the county, their income level is not enough to support them to buy a house and settle down in the county. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is educational urbanization a local development path worthy of recognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lei Wanghong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The urbanization of education is an inevitable trend, but there are differences in speed. What we are criticizing is the phenomenon of using education as the starting point to promote urban development through education. Educational urbanization must be promoted at a reasonable speed. On the one hand, the natural flow laws must be respected. People who have the ability to go to the city and want to go to the city must respect their choices. At the same time, we must also see the impact of human factors promoting education urbanization. Problems such as incoming debt, high maintenance costs, and difficulty for students to adapt. At the current stage, a more appropriate way is to build good township schools and give students who cannot afford to go to the city a certain space for educational development. Children who study in this space can hope to enter high school and college, which will improve the mobility of the entire social class. Only by maintaining smooth flow can there be hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打破出身论？上海民办高校毕业生可报考选调生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256922]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9eMe4ayu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1123&quot; height=&quot;748&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/lF7PAVJ2SvAM8WPULb51S2fKME0OfGlO9 eMe4ayu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251072&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 20, 2022, Wuhan, candidates took the 2022 Hubei Provincial Selection Examination . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Graduates from private colleges and universities who were once exclusively admitted to prestigious public schools can also apply. On September 1, 2023, the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee issued an announcement for the selection of outstanding university graduates in 2024. Students from 7 private universities in the city were included in the selection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Selected students are fresh graduates recruited by the organization department on the basis of merit from colleges and universities. They are divided into targeted and non-targeted. There are special requirements for recruitment such as political profile, scholarships, and student cadre experience. Among them, the requirements for targeted selection are more stringent and are mainly targeted at key domestic universities or key majors in some universities, while the minimum requirements for non-directional selection are generally from ordinary public undergraduate colleges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the landscape of tune selection is changing. According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, in addition to Shanghai, some graduates from private colleges and universities in Hunan and Fujian are also eligible to apply for selection. In addition, in 10 provinces including Sichuan, Shanxi, and Guangdong, the application scope has also been expanded to foreign (overseas) universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the scale of selected students is also expanding, which is related to local employment stabilization policies. In July 2023, among the employment stabilization measures released by the Shanghai Employment Leading Group, it was mentioned that the scale of selection should be gradually expanded and the selection and recruitment of outstanding recent university graduates should be &quot;continuously implemented.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most important thing is not to judge heroes by their school background.” A person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The scope is expanded and the threshold is also raised&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the aforementioned announcement issued by the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, students from four types of universities can apply for transfer: Peking University 44 colleges and universities without restriction on majors, 30 colleges and universities with restricted majors such as Central University of Finance and Economics, 29 universities in the city including East China University of Political Science and Law, and new pilot colleges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Private universities are included in the third category of &quot;29 local universities&quot;, with a total of 7 universities, namely Shanghai Sanda College, Shanghai Institute of Visual Arts, Shanghai International Studies University Xianda College of Economics and Humanities, Shanghai Jianqiao College, Shanghai Normal University Tianhua College, Shanghai Xingwei College, Shanghai Lida College. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these schools were upgraded from junior colleges to undergraduates. Among them, Shanghai Lida College was the latest to upgrade and did not start recruiting undergraduates until 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting graduates from private colleges and universities did not start in 2023. Southern Weekend reporters found that this policy has been implemented as early as 2021. Previously, Shanghai only recruited graduates from 15 universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University of China, of which nine were from the city&#39;s 985 and 211 universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from 2021, Shanghai will relax restrictions on universities and include 30 local universities on the list, including the aforementioned 7 private universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an important way to supplement grassroots party and government leading cadres, the selection and transfer system has been to select the best from the best since its inception. In 1965, the Ministry of Education assigned some college graduates to work in rural areas, and the selective transfer system began. In the late 1970s, this system was gradually implemented in various provinces, and the selection targets were mainly undergraduate graduates with strong party spirit and excellent academic performance in universities. In order to solve the problem of the lack of highly educated talents among grassroots cadres, in 2009, Chongqing launched the first targeted selection system for Qingbei and other 985 universities, kicking off the targeted selection to famous universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the current targeted recruitment announcements issued by some provinces also specifically indicate that the recruitment scope does not include independent colleges and private universities. However, some provinces have expanded the scope of selective transfer to private schools. From a national perspective, graduates from some private universities in Fujian and Hunan can also apply for selective transfer. Fujian once adopted the method of quota allocation, allocating the points for selection to private universities in the province such as Yang&#39;en University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope has expanded and the application threshold has also increased. Taking Shanghai as an example, not all graduates from colleges and universities on the list are eligible to apply. In addition to age and academic performance requirements, they must also meet at least one &quot;other condition&quot;, including being a member of the Communist Party of China (including probationary members) and serving as a member of the Communist Party of China for more than one year. Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the school or department and other related positions, and won the honorary title or scholarship of outstanding or three good students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the above-mentioned third category of local universities including private schools, they need to meet the conditions of receiving a national scholarship or a Shanghai scholarship, and serving as the secretary of the youth league committee of the school or department for more than one year and other related positions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hunan Province’s 2023 student selection examination, there will no longer be a distinction between ordinary and targeted selection, and there will no longer be a limit on the positions that graduates of “double first-class” and non-”double first-class” schools can apply for, but candidates All must meet the requirements for (preparatory) party members and student cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overseas universities are included in the selection scope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that this time, the Shanghai selection is the first time that the top 50 universities in the world are included in the fourth category of pilot universities. For overseas college graduates, the score line will be separately determined by the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, as of September 2023, there are 10 provinces that have made it clear that they will recruit graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of schools defined by most provinces is based on the top 100 QS World University Rankings, and candidates are required to have a master&#39;s degree or a doctorate degree or above. Some provinces have restrictions on undergraduate qualifications. For example, Hebei Province requires candidates to obtain a degree from a domestic undergraduate university that is included in the selection scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regulations vary from place to place as to whether international students are members of the Communist Party of China or whether they have received scholarships. For example, Guangdong and Shanxi have no mandatory requirements and only indicate in the announcement that those who meet the requirements will be given priority for transfer. Beijing requires international students to meet one of the following three conditions: Chinese Communist Party (preparatory) party members, three good students and other honorary titles (obtained during the highest academic qualifications) ), with experience in joining the military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the difficulty of work in organizational departments, it may be more difficult to include graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities in the selection scope. In December 2022, some netizens left a message on the leadership message board of People&#39;s Daily Online, suggesting that Fujian include outstanding graduates from foreign schools in the selection examination. The Organization Department of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee replied, &quot;Because it is impossible to go to the school to conduct in-depth on-site inspections of the candidates and make inspection conclusions, overseas universities have not been included in the selection scope.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the selection of foreign (overseas) candidates, Sichuan recruits a large number of college graduates, and it is also the first province to take advantage of this. As early as 2015, the province issued separate relevant policies for graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities, and recruited a total of 24 graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities in the first batch, including 5 Ph.D. In 2023, among the targeted selected students in Sichuan, the number of graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities will reach 82, which is three times the number in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, among the first batch of 24 graduates from foreign (overseas) colleges and universities recruited by Sichuan in 2015, 4 have currently reached full-time majors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Only one or two a year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why is the scope of selected students constantly expanding? &quot;The reason why private colleges and universities are included is that, in addition to taking care of the tendency of the city&#39;s colleges and universities, the most important thing is not to judge heroes based on their school background.&quot; A person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee told the Southern Weekend reporter that candidates reported by colleges and universities will be included in the merit review. They are assigned to responsible cadres and weighted assessments are conducted based on the students&#39; basic conditions, such as awards and other indicators, and are &quot;not linked to the school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as early as May 21, 2018, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium on motivating cadres to take on new responsibilities and new actions in the new era and strengthening and improving the selection and transfer of students. It mentioned that &quot;highlighting political standards, appropriate Expand the scale and select accurately by classification and classification.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the expansion of the scope of selected students in various places also has the consideration of stabilizing employment. In the aforementioned &quot;Several Measures to Optimize and Adjust Employment Stabilization Policies to Promote Development and Benefit People&#39;s Livelihood&quot; issued by the Shanghai Employment Leading Group in July 2023, it was proposed to &quot;gradually expand the scale of selection and transfer.&quot; In 2023, Chongqing announced that the number of non-directed transfers will reach 600, an increase of 50% compared with 400 the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the scope is expanded, will more graduates from private colleges and universities enter the selection sequence? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff at the employment offices of Shanghai Jianqiao College and Shanghai Sanda College told Southern Weekend reporters that “no one has been admitted to Shanghai’s selective transfer program in recent years.” A staff member from the Xianda School of Humanities and Economics at Shanghai International Studies University revealed, “There are only one or two a year.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff of Shanghai Sanda College believes that although it is possible to take the exam, &quot;it is really difficult, and scholarships, class cadres (and other requirements) must be met.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned person close to the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee said that during the examination process, the overall expressive ability of students from prestigious universities was better than that of ordinary private universities. &quot;The final admission results are in a normal distribution. Graduates from Qingbei and Renmin University More, other universities have less.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
