She is the kind of international artist favored by galleries and academic institutions. The creator is also the darling of fashion brands and the collection market. Her works involve painting, installation, performance, and fashion cross-border... In her twenties, not long after leaving the Central American School, she was named &quot;Outstanding Youth Under 30&quot; by Forbes Asia &quot;, and in the past two years, he has won the &quot;Young Artist of the Year&quot; from The Best of Best in 2022 and the &quot;Outstanding Creator of the Year&quot; from the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal in 2022-2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be an intense year for Sun Yidian. She returned to school and studied for a doctorate in literature and art at Tsinghua University. She has continued domestic group exhibitions and overseas exhibitions. In April, she held a solo exhibition in Berlin. Portrait&quot; opens, followed by the solo exhibition &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in Paris on October 17th (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;&lt;/span>; ). Her iconic plastic dolls come from Western pop culture, but also contain Eastern codes. They have formed a unique accent in the old building of the landmark Place Fontaine in Paris: foreign viewers will smell the familiarity of the illustrations. A subtle touch of exoticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ph.D. supervisor Wang Minan once suggested that she complete her doctoral studies in a dual-thread approach: painting during the day and studying at night. But in fact, it is difficult to operate. &quot;Painting is still very brain-burning. After painting for a whole day, it is really difficult to read academic works at night.&quot; So she divided the time into different intervals: before the exhibition, she would retreat and paint intensively. , and then start the academic mode after all the paintings have been shipped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255432&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2018, &quot;A twinkle&quot;, Shanghai, BANK Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Five Ren Studio in Beijing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September, Wu Hongce In the &quot;Crossing Boundaries - Possibilities and Echoes&quot; exhibition at the Yuz Museum, Sun Yizhen met again with her previous work &quot;Pink Dinosaur with Blue Wings&quot;, which was her work around 2017. The entire &quot;man-made object&quot; &quot;The representative work shortly after the series started, &quot;I have never seen it again after the exhibition.&quot; When I met face to face in the exhibition hall five years later, &quot;it was exactly the same as seeing a long-lost friend or child. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You will recall the scene when you painted it, and even recall every stroke you drew. That moment was 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and when you drew that stroke, the sun happened to shine. The place where you put down the pen, yes, suddenly, that memory was retrieved from your subconscious...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The memories all came back in an instant, and a painting opened the door to the past for her. A wormhole, not only about that painting, but also a whole set of life wrapped up in that painting: At that time, she was still in graduate school, and she shared a studio in Feijia Village with her friends at the time. There was an artificial pond there. In summer, the pond is crowded with lotus leaves and lotus flowers, and people living around it are all engaged in art. The next door neighbor is a dancer and a photographer. They visit each other all day long, go fishing in the pond, and eat big pot rice: stewed turtle, spicy crayfish... …spent many lively nights, like a utopia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is an elegy for collective life, which died out almost simultaneously with the student days. &quot;Now I have no collective life, only work is left.&quot; On the wall of the studio with small sketches, you can see the work Traces of madness: The exhibition schedule is accurate to every day, and is made into a list and posted in a conspicuous place; in an inconspicuous place, a whole row of &quot;45&quot; is densely written in pencil, and many of the &quot;45&quot; have been crossed out. ——This is the way good student Sun Yidian forces herself to focus on painting. She believes that every 45 minutes is a period of concentration. This is how the school&#39;s classes are set up. After every 45 minutes of serious painting, she will She crossed it out and allowed herself a small recess: she once liked using highly saturated fluorescent colors, which overloaded her eyes after long hours of homework and staring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255434&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Crossing Boundaries: Possibilities and Echoes&quot; exhibition view, Yuz Museum, Shanghai, 2023&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Alessandro Wang, Yuz Museum/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yidian’s fifth studio in Beijing, and it is also the one she considers “the most luxurious”. The so-called luxury means that it has heating and air conditioning, and has a high roof, ceiling windows, which bring in stable natural light, and large-open doors to facilitate the transportation of large-scale works. The second and third floors are storage rooms and bedrooms. There is a shelf large enough to store her past works, and a bed where she can lie down when she stays up late to paint - this is all an easel artist desires. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other studios before can only be described as crude and homeless. She would count them on her fingers: the first studio was in Ark Court, a residential building next to Central Academy of Fine Arts. The space and light were cramped, and it was impossible to display large paintings. The size of the painting was slightly larger, and the relationship between colors was inconsistent. The depth is just not right. The second one was in Feijia Village. It was a happy time, but it was demolished and a group of artists were driven away as if they were being expelled. The third studio was near the turkey factory. One summer there was a sudden flood and most of her paintings were soaked. So she fled there and moved to the mainland. The fourth studio has no heating in winter and no air conditioning in summer. She spent three winters in this ice cave, painting with her feet on a small electric carpet. Her hands became cold and stiff after a while, so she could only put them under her buttocks to warm them up before continuing to paint. Her mother came to see her from Wenzhou and felt the extremely cold weather that had never been seen in the south. At night, the surroundings of the studio were pitch black and there were no street lights. She couldn&#39;t help shouting: Daughter! What kind of sin have you suffered here? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;738&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Once upon a time&quot; Acrylic on canvas, 205cmx158cm, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A painting can be painted this way, or it can be painted that way&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mother He was probably the first person to provide artistic support to Sun Yidian. When she was a child, her parents enrolled her in many interest classes. She was the child who cried when she saw she was about to play the piano, but she was very active in painting. She started studying painting at the age of 4. When she was in elementary school, her parents let her attend Wenzhou Youth Art School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other provinces in China, this kind of professional art school for primary school students is extremely rare, which corresponds to the strong demand for folk art education in the southeastern coast. These primary school students are cultivated by an almost omnipotent art concept. They have to learn Chinese painting as well as Western painting. Sketching, coloring, and sketching are all necessary basic skills. They have to go to the countryside to sketch, and they have to hand in calligraphy homework every week. &quot;Our primary school has actually trained many people. For example, the Asian Games torch was designed by our seniors, including architects and artists currently active in Zhejiang. If you ask, many of them came from this primary school.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In the art circle, it is very strange to praise a person with &quot;top student&quot;, but Sun Yidian has indeed been a top student all the way. Her elementary school does not relax its requirements for cultural courses just because it majors in art. Many students will later go to ordinary middle schools and comprehensive universities, and not all of them may be bent on becoming art students. Sun Yidian was admitted to Wenzhou Middle School, the best local high school, but at the same time, she also received admission notices from the National High School Affiliated to the National Academy of Arts and the Central American High School Affiliated to the Art Examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Simple Shed&quot; watercolor on paper, 25.3cmx19.1cm, 2009&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She chose the High School Affiliated to Central Academy of Fine Arts because she could go to Beijing and legitimately &quot;leave&quot; Parents stay away.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Sun Yidian, the High School Affiliated to Central Academy of Fine Arts is a free and magical place. She seemed to be suddenly opened up to a whole new world and new senses to match it. She is still amazed that she watched so many niche movies and so many esoteric books that were inappropriate for her age when she was in the attached middle school. &quot;There are many big boring movies that I can&#39;t stand now, but I actually watched them wholeheartedly at that time. Many of them In fact, I only know a little about philosophy books, so I just read them hard to pretend to be cool. People around me don’t listen to pop music. They all listen to very literary and niche things to show that they are different.” In the attached middle school, not being mainstream is a kind of mainstream. These hard-to-eat nutrients have unknowingly become part of her background. “The biggest inspiration for my art is that I am willing to try anything and be interested in everything. After a person is suddenly opened up at that age, he realizes , It turns out that a painting can be done this way or that way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She still keeps a collection of sketches from when she was in the attached middle school. At that time, she had to submit a large number of sketches every week, and the teacher would write on the handed-in homework. The stamp indicates that it has been read, preventing students from submitting previous works for submission. In order to catch up on the huge amount of homework, they would go to Beijing Railway Station to stay up all night and paint the passengers who stayed at the station overnight. Foreigners from all over the world come in all shapes and sizes, and they don&#39;t move even after falling asleep due to fatigue. They are ready-made models at your fingertips. When she returned home during the summer vacation, while her mother was taking a bath, she was doing sketches of human figures. Her mother calmly let her do the painting without any hesitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from the High School Affiliated to the Central Academy of Fine Arts, she was recommended to the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Her college entrance examination scores in cultural subjects were surprisingly high among art students. After graduating from Central America, he was directly recommended to graduate school at Central America. Sun Yidian said that she is the kind of person with strong self-motivation, and her academic career is just &quot;going with the flow&quot;. It was also out of self-consciousness that after working as an artist for several years, she went to Tsinghua University to study for a Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;801&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ken&quot; acrylic on wood, 45.5cmx38cm, 2019&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Natural objects and man-made objects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian is well-known and has the best market performance The series is &quot;artificial objects&quot;, and most of the pictures are inflatable or plastic toys, but she also has a secret &quot;natural objects&quot; series, which she started to create when she was 16 years old, a series oriented &quot;from the deep&quot;, including flowers and fruits. , mountains, rivers, and trees have all become the objects of her gaze and representation. But the &quot;natural objects&quot; have never been exhibited. Sun Yidian hangs them on the wall of his studio, like a private archive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Man-made objects&quot; are dazzling floats above the water, and &quot;natural objects&quot; are like anchors underwater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people came to my studio and liked the &#39;Natural Objects&#39; series. Last time a sister came over and said that this group of small paintings made her cry.&quot; She incorporated a lot of elements into this series. For media experiments, I like to use some children’s handmade materials, such as a kind of baby foam beads called “pearl mud”, which can be used for shaping and is also a common raw material in toy factories. Later, I discovered a Japanese paper pulp clay that has excellent modeling power and durability, and can create a spatial effect similar to a bas-relief on the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Let Me Hug&quot; Acrylic on canvas, 200cmx133cm, 2015&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Artificial Objects&quot; series made her famous in one fell swoop. The smooth, plump, grotesque and falsely sweet toys she draws have won her a steady stream of attention and collectors, and their prices have skyrocketed. As a child in Wenzhou, her childhood memories are all kinds of man-made objects. &quot;When I was a kid, when we said we were going to play at a classmate&#39;s house, what we actually meant was: go play in your family&#39;s factory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost every household has a factory, including a shoe factory. , glasses factory, plastic products factory, lighter factory... Occasionally there are toy factories. There are not many toy factories, but the visual impact on a child is huge. These small commodity factories all retain a simple production layout. The factory building often has several bedrooms attached. The home is also the same as the factory. After the reform and opening up, materials, and the production brought about by materials, sprouted up everywhere in Wenzhou like bamboo shoots after a rain. What’s interesting is that her international collectors are also very sympathetic to these things she painted. They told Sun Yidian: The era when the artificial objects you painted suddenly exploded in abundance, maybe the 1990s in China. But in Europe and the United States, it was our 1960s. It is precisely because of this that they feel the same complex flavor of nostalgia and reflection in Sun Yidian&#39;s paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of commonality is not uncommon in Sun Yidian’s paintings, like a hidden cultural code. She paints huge idols. Their appearance and facial features are common in Western pop culture. However, the curved eyebrows and single eyelids come from traditional Chinese painting. The angle of the lips, which seems to be smiling but not smiling, is her classic image based on Buddhist sculptures. drawn. This image appears on the exhibition wall, facing the viewer in a overlooking manner. Regardless of whether the viewer is an Easterner or a Westerner, they will be slightly stunned and realize that something seems wrong in a sense of déjà vu. The &quot;Porcelain Mother&quot; she painted is a small white porcelain statue with hands clasped together, standing silently among the roots of the trees. This is a common porcelain Madonna ornament in Western families, but strangely, it also Much like the Dehua white porcelain Guanyin worshiped in Chinese homes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian said that in her hometown, the belief system is complex. When she was a child, her family worshiped Buddha and worshiped Guanyin all year round. However, when she came to her uncle&#39;s house, he believed in Catholicism and kept a statue of the Virgin Mary in his home. As a child, she often felt confused. In her eyes, there was no essential difference between the kind and compassionate female faces. The localization of handicrafts has deepened this aesthetic mutual reference. A priest often came and went from her uncle&#39;s house. Apart from his detached and indifferent expression, she could not see any difference between the priest and ordinary neighbors. The same goes for the local church, which is European in form but with a strong Chinese decoration style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is keen to examine these common clues in different cultures out of curiosity about images. She painted Medusa and looked through Caravaggio and other classic paintings in the album. The snakes on Medusa&#39;s head were all live snakes. The artist had to focus on painting the twisting and entangled violence, lifelike, that is culture. Classic output to her symbols. In her private memory, Medusa only saw the logo on her mother&#39;s Versace bag when she was a child. She was surprised at that time. Why use the head of a strange woman as a label? In order to draw her own Medusa, she bought a bunch of rubber and plastic coiled snakes online as a reference. Their ferocity and beauty were just a bluff - &quot;I just wanted to draw them all as fake snakes, realistic fake ones.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her workbench is filled with these artificial toys, which have also become the prototypes in her paintings: original Barbie, pirated Barbie, Ken with his head ripped off, naked Ken... The first time she drew Ken with only a head, she shocked everyone and triggered a big discussion including hot words such as &quot;feminism&quot;, &quot;female revenge&quot;, &quot;consumer men&quot;, and &quot;female reverse gaze&quot;, but she Frankly speaking, I painted my friend as Ken just for visual reasons, which is like playing house on the canvas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/88ewe2kyK2hNwTUJjLor3sygbg00B5xHTLl3i9k8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;956&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/88ewe2kyK2hNwTUJjLor3sygbg00B5xHTLl3i9k8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255447&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Evening&quot; wood board composite material, 20cmx20cm, 2016&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The world is seven centimeters shorter&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian has always been interested in gender issues All are there. When she was in college, she asked acquaintances in her hometown to let her go to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital to observe women giving birth. It was the largest obstetrics and gynecology hospital in Wenzhou and the place where she was born. She saw groups of women rolling and moaning on the delivery bed. Their faces were blurred, and all their female characteristics were hidden. What mattered was the huge bulge in the middle of the body and the birth canal that was about to burst, as if that was their only thing at the moment. Biological attributes, their common identity and destiny. She turned this feeling into a series of works, titled &quot;Coming Soon.&quot; That year, she was 22 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot;coming&quot; may be new life, or the adult life she is about to enter. But for Sun Yidian, &quot;coming soon&quot; is more like a moment in nature, &quot;In my hometown, there are many thunderstorms in the south, the kind of heavy rainstorms that suddenly fall, and the sky is so dark that the day seems like night, The raindrops were huge, pouring, and then there was lightning and thunder. I have many such memories when I was a child. I stood under the window of my house and looked at the heavy rain outside. The sky suddenly lightened up, and then there was a burst of thunder from the distance. . My &#39;coming soon&#39; is the moment when the lightning has flashed and the thunder has not yet come. I am nervous and scared, but I am also looking forward to that moment coming.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She did not explain her scene, no matter how It’s up to the viewers to draw their own interpretations, whether it’s gender issues, pop culture issues, material issues, consumerism issues... She is at ease with everything. Just like her painting &quot;Porcelain Mother&quot;, those who believe in Guanyin see Guanyin and the Mother of God. What the viewer sees is the Virgin. She believes that any viewing will first reflect the viewer’s cultural memory and information reserve, rather than the creator’s intention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As her doctoral thesis was about to be started, Wang Minan suggested that she write about consumerism. The implication was that it was related to the topic she drew, and it would be easier for her to gain insights when writing. She also thought it was reasonable. She is just worried that her logical ability is not strong - the academic construction of writing a paper and the picture composition that she is so familiar with are completely different things. Teacher Wang sometimes asks her from the perspective of &quot;consumption&quot;: I heard that one of your paintings has sold for millions? She was so frightened that she only waved her hands: Teacher, teacher, let’s never talk about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UfQY7vrtFQzxgrxEuiFVap805CGeMwvUOhSpJIQB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UfQY7vrtFQzxgrxEuiFVap805CGeMwvUOhSpJIQB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255446&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Porcelain Mother&quot; Acrylic on wood, 54cm x 45cm, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Ailing said that you must become famous as early as possible. Sun Yidian agreed with both hands, but her reasons were different from Zhang Ailing. What she worries about is not that success comes too late and the taste is not sweet enough, but she believes that becoming famous at a young age can give people a valuable sense of relaxation and allow them to do art more calmly and comfortably. Those artists who have been tortured by fate for too long and have struggled to overcome all kinds of struggles are sometimes inevitably distorted by the desire for success and the pressure of survival, leading to deformed movements and making incredible choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Only the income from selling paintings in my first exhibition was meaningful to me, because it meant that I could support myself and become an independent artist. Before that, I had always followed My parents were vaccinated and asked to be mentally prepared that I might not have a job after graduation and would have to go home to grow old. That money gave me great freedom. The happiness from money ended here. After that, I sold Any high price offered is just a number to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She naturally realized that as long as the female artists of her generation made some progress in their careers, they would inevitably work for all women. speak out. &quot;When a female artist becomes famous at a young age, it is easy for others to say: Is it because of your appearance? Is there someone behind you who is helping you raise the price?&quot; Is it impossible for women to achieve success based on their strength alone? Is it hard to acknowledge the excellence of women? Sun Yidian&#39;s way of fighting back is to use more comprehensive self-strength to shut them up. This is the self-confidence she built up as a top student from childhood to college, and it is also one of the motivations for her to return to school to study for a Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many sketches nailed to the wall of her studio, there are several sketches of powerful high-heeled shoes. The toes of the scarlet high-heeled shoes are joined together and formed into one with the heels on separate sides. The shape of the female pelvis. Sun Yizhen always remembers a poem by a Taiwanese male poet that he read when he was a girl. He wrote about the feelings of girls when they wear high heels - &quot;The world is seven centimeters shorter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian is 1.72 meters tall. He wears 7cm artificial high heels and is taller than many men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a world seven centimeters shorter, she continued to move forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the artist, BANK Gallery and Galerie Schipper Berlin/Paris/Seoul, Yuz Museum)&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“潇湘”作为地名传进日本，竟然是因为一位禅宗大画家的加持？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259334]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, I had a gathering with two old friends. During the dinner, I accidentally talked about the misfortune of Nie Er, the composer of &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; The place of drowning - the coast of Shonan in Fujisawa Prefecture, Japan. Wang Zhongyi, the editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s China&quot; magazine, asked me about the relationship between Shonan and Naito Hunan and Hunan Province. I knew what was going on but didn&#39;t know why. I was questioned on the spot. So, after returning home and doing some homework, I came up with this fake &quot;place name test&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;891&quot; height= &quot;1185&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese Sinologist Naito Konan (1866-1934). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the latter first. The relationship between Naito Hunan and Hunan Province is simple, so simple that there is no half-cent relationship. Naito&#39;s halo as a sinologist is so dazzling that when Chinese people talk about this legendary figure, they often make associations: the &quot;Hunan&quot; in Naito&#39;s name must have been &quot;taken&quot; from Hunan Province, and is intentionally or unintentionally reminiscent of When it comes to the &quot;theory of cultural center movement&quot; and the &quot;theory of changes in the Tang and Song Dynasties&quot;, it seems that if you don&#39;t even &quot;roll&quot; your name, you can&#39;t be called a great scholar. However, Japanese intellectuals are mostly limited by the concept of regionalism and take it for granted. Since he is a leader of the Kyoto School, the name &quot;Hunan&quot; must come from Hunan City in Shiga Prefecture adjacent to Kyoto Prefecture, but this lake is not Dongting Lake, but Lake Biwa. In fact, neither of these two arguments is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Naito Hunan&#39;s name is Tiger Jiro, whose courtesy name is Bingqing and whose nickname is Hunan. In 1866, he was born in Mamauchi Village, Mutsu Province (now Mamauchi, Towada, Shikaku City, Akita Prefecture). Shikaku is located at the northernmost tip of Akita Prefecture, separated from Aomori Prefecture by the boundary lake &quot;Lake Towada&quot;. &quot;Hunan&quot; means the south of Lake Towada. Lake Towada is a double volcanic lake formed by the eruption of the Towada volcano. It has beautiful scenery and is a famous lake in the Tohoku region. It is listed as a &quot;National Cultural Property&quot; as a special scenic spot. In the National Diet Building in the center of Tokyo, huge oil paintings depicting the four seasons of the Japanese archipelago hang on the walls surrounding the central hall. Among them, the summer work is &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; painted by Tanaka Giichi. In this way, due to the influence of Naito&#39;s Hunan and Kyoto schools, Hunan Province, which was originally out of reach, was forced to be disconnected. Even Hunan City, Shiga Prefecture, which had nothing to do with it, was attached to some kind of connection with Naito, and Naito Lake Towada, my hometown where I grew up, is not mentioned by the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height= &quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255550&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The oil painting &quot;Lake Towada and Oirase&quot; hanging in the central hall of the Japanese Diet Building. Oirase is a river flowing from Lake Towada. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the former. There is actually no definite conclusion about the connection between Shonan and Hunan Province. Although the interpretation of &quot;Southern Hunan&quot; in &quot;Guangciyuan&quot; (fifth edition) refers to it, it is not clear: ① The name of the scenic spot south of the Xiangjiang River that flows into Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, China. ② The &quot;Sōnan&quot; in the southern part of the ancient Sagami Kingdom was appended to ① and written as &quot;Shonan&quot; as the name for the coastal area of ​​Sagami Bay. That area includes Hayama, Zushi, Kamakura, Chigasaki and other areas. There are many bathing beaches in the summer, making it a summer resort for Keihin. The winter is relatively warm. It is widely developed as residential land. For example, &quot;Shonan Electric Railway&quot; is the general name of the old national railways that connect Tokyo and Numazu (Shizuoka Prefecture) over a medium distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this explanation, we understand that without Hunan in China, there would be no Shonan in Japan. The next question is: when and how did this spatial &quot;link&quot; occur? In Japan, the expression &quot;Shonan&quot; was first seen in the dictionary &quot;Wa Ming Le Ju Chao&quot; (referred to as &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot; or &quot;Wa Ming Chao&quot;) in the middle of the Heian period. The etymology is Shonan County, Changsha State. According to the explanation of &quot;Zizhi Tongjian Dictionary&quot; (Jilin People&#39;s Publishing House, 1994): Xiangnan County was &quot;established in the Western Han Dynasty, and its administrative location is southwest of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province. It was changed to the Marquis of Xiangnan in the Eastern Han Dynasty. In the Three Kingdoms, Wu restored it to Xiangnan County. The Southern Dynasties Waste all.” However, &quot;Shonan&quot; in &quot;Japanese Names&quot; is still a simple ancient Chinese place name and is not equivalent to &quot;Shonan&quot; in Japan today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various evidence shows that the real &quot;crossing of the border&quot; in southern Hunan is related to Zen Buddhism. Mr. Ge Zhaoguang mentioned in &quot;The History of Chinese Zen Thought&quot; that Southern Zen is divided into two branches geographically, and the second branch is the &quot;Zen master group centered on Jingzhou and Hengyue&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, Fa Nao and Fa Ren of Jingzhou Emperor Temple, Fa Jing and Zhiyuan of Changsha Temple, Fa Cong of Xiangyang Jingkong Temple, Lushan Fa Chong wait. Of course, the most important thing is Huisi (515-577) who first went to Daesu Mountain in Gwangju and then to Hengyue, and opened the later Tiantai line. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tiantai Sect is the sect that has had a decisive influence on Japanese Buddhism and Zen Buddhism. In 804 AD, Zen Master Saicho went to the Tang Dynasty to study Dharma as an envoy to the Tang Dynasty. After returning to China the following year, he taught Dharma at the Enryaku Temple on Mount Hiei (also known as Mount Tiantai), and then founded the Tendai Sect of Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Muxi Fachang, a painting monk from the late Song Dynasty to the early Yuan Dynasty (Fachang is the Buddhist name, his birth and death dates are unknown), practiced Zen under the famous monk Wu Zhun when he was young, and later became the founder of Liutong Temple in West Lake. At the end of the Kamakura period (14th century), his paintings flowed into Japan in batches following the exchanges between Chinese and Japanese Zen masters, and they were immediately enthusiastically sought after by the upper class. The technique of using ink halos and a large amount of white space to express the beauty of the universe is superb and sophisticated. It is the &quot;symbol of the literati&#39;s longing for an utopia of natural mountains and rivers&quot; in the eyes of the Japanese (Japanese scholar Yuji Yamashita said), and it has also profoundly influenced Japan. of southern painting. The great Japanese painting masters of the Momoyama period, Hasegawa Tōhoku, Omotaya Sotatsu and others, all sought the foundation of ink painting techniques from Makiki&#39;s paintings; there are also many works that imitated Makiki in the Kano School of art. Muxi&#39;s paintings are the objects of collection by Japanese ministers, daimyo and wealthy businessmen. They are national treasures among national treasures. For example, in the &quot;Catalog of Imperial Paintings&quot;, a record of the painting treasures collected by the Ashikaga family of the Muromachi shogunate, of the total 280 pieces in the collection, Makixi&#39;s works accounted for 30%, as many as 103 pieces. In Japanese documents from the mid-14th century, if only &quot;monk&quot; is written, it is an honorific title for Muxi. Muxi&#39;s paintings are almost extinct in China (only the National Palace Museum and the National Palace Museum in Taipei hold one each). It is said that 134 paintings exist in Japan, all of which are stored in the treasure collections of the Cabinet Office for Culture and the country&#39;s first-class art museums. The &quot;ceiling&quot; of Mu Xi&#39;s work is generally recognized as &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. Seven of the eight volumes are in Japan. The location of the remaining volume, &quot;Yamaichi Seiran&quot;, is still unknown and a copy is preserved in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;3197&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fishing Village Sunset&quot; from Muxi Fachang&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;Xiaoxiang&quot;, the definition of &quot;Cihai&quot; is: ①Another name for the Xiangjiang River, because the water of the Xiangjiang River is clear Well-earned reputation. &quot;The Book of Mountains and Seas·Zhongshan Jing&quot;: &quot;The abyss of the Xiaoxiang River.&quot; &quot;The Book of Xiangzhong&quot;: &quot;The clear light of the Xiangchuan River is five or six feet long, which is the name of Xiaoxiang.&quot; Or it may specifically refer to the section after the middle reaches of the Xiangjiang River meets the Xiaoshui River. That is one of the &quot;Three Hunans&quot;. ②Refers generally to the Hunan region. Zheng Gu&#39;s poem &quot;Farewell to Friends on Huaishang&quot;: &quot;Several bagpipes left the pavilion at night, you went to Xiaoxiang and I went to Qin.&quot; ③The name of the ancient town. It was placed in the Five Dynasties in the northwest of Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. It is named because it is the confluence of Xiaoxiang River and Xiangkou Pass; it is also called Xiaoxiang Pass or Xiangkou Pass. Accordingly, as the name suggests, the &quot;Eight Scenic Spots of Xiaoxiang&quot; refer to the eight scenic spots from the north along the Xiangjiang River to Dongting Lake after the Xiangjiang River merges into the Xiaoshui River. Since the Northern Song Dynasty, some painters have used it as a theme to create works, expressing their feelings for the landscape. The &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; has almost become an artistic paradigm. Famous ones include the scroll of the same name by Song Di, which was later written down by Shen Kuo in &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, including Fan Return from Yuanpu, Falling Geese on Pingsha, Evening Bell of Yansi Temple, Qinglan in Mountain City, Dusk Snow in River Sky, Autumn Moon in Dongting, Sunset in Fishing Village, Xiaoxiang Night Talk - the name of &quot;Eight Scenes&quot;, has since &quot;out of the circle&quot;. However, compared with the works of Song Di and others, the Japanese clearly prefer Mu Xi. As for the reason, the philosopher Han Bingzhe believes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Mu Xi&#39;s &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; inspired by Zen Buddhism is also &quot; The picture of &quot;empty&quot;, the pen and ink are simple and subtle, there is nothingness, the artistic conception is mysterious, a few scenes are hidden in the infinite white space, the careful brushwork makes the objects float between reality and virtuality, black and white, and there is no way to express it. meaning. Objects and images are integrated and dependent on each other, reflecting each other instead of driving away or dividing each other. Sora seems to have become a friendly intermediary. Water lives, mountains flow, heaven and earth unite. The emptiness and silence do not obliterate the still life in the painting, but reflect the elegance of the still life. (&quot;Zen Philosophy&quot;, page 35)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, from the Kamakura period to the Edo period, from the Ashikaga Shogun family (Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Yoshimasa) to Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, from the Tokugawa Shogun family (Tokugawa Ieyasu, Yoshimune) to Matsudaira Fumo and Murata Shuguang, Muxi&#39;s &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; has been circulated among these figures, and its value can no longer be evaluated in terms of money. The Japanese really love the &quot;Eight Scenes of Xiaoxiang&quot; so much that they can&#39;t wait to move them to Japan. Sure enough, later the Japanese &quot;discovered&quot; the &quot;Eight Views of Kanazawa&quot; in the area of ​​Rokuura Village in Musashi Kunakurajo County (today&#39;s Kanazawa Eight Views Station of the Keihin Express Railway) - the whole is a &quot;Hako Garden&quot; version of the &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot; . The wonderful thing is that every scenic spot corresponds to the original scenery of Xiaoxiang, and it was adapted into Ukiyo-e paintings by Utagawa Hiroshige, including &quot;The Return of the Sailing Ship&quot;, &quot;The Falling Geese&quot;, &quot;The Evening Bell&quot;, &quot;Susaki Haru&quot; &quot;Arashi&quot;, &quot;Uchigawa Evening Snow&quot;, &quot;Seto Autumn Moon&quot;, &quot;Noshima Sunset&quot; and &quot;Koizumi Night Voice&quot;, a total of eight paintings. In the 7th year of Yuanlu (1694), Zen Master Donggao Xinyue, who fled to Japan from the Ming Dynasty, wrote a Chinese poem for each of the &quot;Eight Scenes of Kanze&quot;. With the endorsement of the seven-character quatrains of the Chinese great scholar, Kanze was like Xiaoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that in the early Edo period, the monk Sawuan began to call the Enoshima area &quot;Shonan&quot;. During the same period, Chongxue, a descendant of the Chinese who immigrated to Japan from China during the Muromachi period and an expectorant medicine merchant in Odawara, built a stone tablet at the Oiso nunnery, on which he engraved the seven words &quot;The end of the Qing Dynasty in southern Hunan&quot;. This monument still exists today and is regarded as the beginning of place names in southern Hunan.而近代之前，汉学始终是日本的显学，故出于某种文人趣味也好，或说附庸风雅也好，用“湘南”作雅号的禅僧、诗人所在多有，如禅僧湘南淙、诗人大久保湘南等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;湘南电车通车后，被称为“湘南”的区域进一步扩大，连三浦半岛都被归入其区划。明治29年（1896）5月，德富苏峰为双亲在逗子海滨购置一栋别墅，然后把照料二老的任务交给弟弟德富芦花，自己便踏上了周游世界之旅。彼时，芦花正身心交瘁，对放浪生活感到厌倦，决定暂去父母的别墅隐居，同时考虑未来的进路。他在致胞兄的信中写道：“东京的空气，对我来说太冷了。我想在湘南住些日子。”彼时的湘南，已成为上流人士的住宅区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也是差不多同一时期，夏目漱石和铃木大拙各自在位于北镰仓的圆觉寺跟随禅师释宗演参禅。漱石参禅是为自我疗愈，而大拙则为了学法。时空交错，二人的目的既不相同，也未相遇。从镰仓幕府时代起，因幕府统治者得宗家族的庇护，禅宗得以在此地生息、发育，历经五个世纪的发展，及至漱石和大拙禅修时，已蔚为大观，镰仓这座古刹林立、禅意十足的古城，也成了如假包换的禅宗“麦加”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就这样，从牧谿法常的《潇湘八景图》到“金泽八景”，从泽庵和尚到亡命东渡的中国禅师，可以说，正是因了禅宗的加持，这个以江之岛为中心、沿相模湾向东西延展的狭长的海岸地带，才从古地名的“相南”变成了今天世人眼中的“湘南”，自带一种迥然不同于其他地域的浪漫风情。譬如，住在首都圈的人，周末开一辆挂“湘南”车牌的车，跑在134号国道上，哪怕只是一台再普通不过的轻型机动车，也不失为一件拉风的事，车牌的“含金量”甚至碾压东京都内高级住宅区“品川”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（原题“何处是湘南”，现标题为编者所拟）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学术期刊为何能收那么贵的版面费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259320]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an accounting journal in Hubei Province, &quot;Accounting Newsletter&quot;, issued a notice stating that authors who raise families with three children No publishing fee. This was originally a very niche academic journal, and the notice itself could reach a relatively small number of people, but it quickly aroused heated discussion on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reasons for the heated discussion can be attributed to the following aspects: firstly, the page fee of six to seven thousand yuan for an article is not cheap; secondly, the positioning of this journal, which was led by the Hubei Provincial Accountant Sponsored by the Society and directed by the Hubei Provincial Federation of Social Science and Technology, charging high page fees feels more like a commercial practice; the last is this preferential measure, which is very high-profile, but in fact the number of beneficiaries may be very few and can almost be ignored. , it feels more like a promotion. It’s not surprising that the combination of several factors has made it a hot spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I have always known that there is a page fee for publishing papers in academic journals, it is somewhat surprising that the fee for an article is so high. According to its official website, there are 31 articles in the latest issue of the catalog. This journal is published bimonthly. Based on the page fee of 6,000 per article, their monthly income can reach 372,000 yuan, which is 4,464,000 yuan a year. The annual income of a journal is nearly 5 million, which is definitely a good business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the important reasons is that the world has been undergoing a &quot;Great Leap Forward in Higher Education&quot; in recent decades, and the accompanying &quot;paper inflation&quot; behind it. Because China has a large population base and rapid economic development, problems in this area are particularly prominent. It&#39;s just that most of the people involved are &quot;literary people&quot; and are more or less &quot;beneficiaries&quot;. Even if they see the problem, they will not easily pierce this layer of window paper. After all, seeing through but not telling off is also a well-known survival wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the academic qualification inflation is the expansion of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. Major universities attach great importance to the number of papers, and basically require graduate students to publish a corresponding number of papers before graduation. Usually, the better the school, the higher the requirements for the level of papers. Every year, students apply to postpone graduation because they have not completed the publication of their thesis. Thesis publication is a necessity for the research community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the expansion of undergraduate and graduate enrollment will inevitably be accompanied by an expansion of the number of teachers. Throughout the education system, there is a tradition of assessing the number of published papers. There are rigid regulations that require publication of papers when promoting teachers&#39; professional titles, applying for scientific research projects, or applying for various scientific research funds. And it’s not just universities that require essays, even primary and secondary schools now have requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the education system, but also hospitals and even some units that are not scientific research institutions will use the number of published papers as an important indicator for promotion. One of the considerations is probably because it seems fair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another consideration is a certain sense of &quot;academic worship&quot;, or &quot;science worship&quot;, as if publishing a paper is making a contribution to scientific scholarship. In fact, for a long time, many places and universities in our country have been pursuing and promoting the &quot;only patents and number of papers theory&quot;. The number of papers and patents has always been the focus of their propaganda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early August this year, the research institute of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan released a report. The report shows that China’s total number of papers accounts for 24.6% of the global share, 8.5 percentage points higher than the second-placed United States. In terms of the number of citations used to measure the quality of papers, China’s global proportions of “attention papers” and “top papers” were 28.9% and 29.3% respectively, ranking first in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We don’t need to belittle ourselves and regard this kind of data ranking as worthless. Objectively speaking, on the one hand, this data shows that China’s scientific research and academic influence is gradually expanding, which is a good thing. But on the other hand, we must also see the contrast between this quantity and reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We often say that &quot;quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes&quot;, but when the number of papers and patents is distorted by the wrong incentive system, quantitative changes may not lead to high-quality qualitative changes. On the contrary, it is more likely to lead to low-level, low-level duplication, and also produce some bizarre &quot;academic research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a few years ago, an academic journal published &quot;It is expected to improve the efficiency of building a clean government culture by targeting intestinal flora to regulate the body&#39;s material needs and desires.&quot; There are many more articles of this kind, which are completely unabashedly &quot;pseudo-academic&quot; and just to make up for the numbers. Under the improper incentive system, publishing papers has become a necessity for many people, and it is a very large &quot;market&quot;. The demand is strong but the supply is limited. There are only so many publications and so many pages, so it basically forms a &quot;seller&#39;s market&quot;, and it is not surprising that the page fees are high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With high prices and huge profits, more people will definitely participate, so this forms an &quot;essay industry chain.&quot; There are writers, there are agents, there are people who are responsible for paying, and there are people who are responsible for publishing. You can basically find various channels as long as you pay. Of course, this &quot;market&quot; is not completely spontaneous, but is caused by a deformed incentive system. Moreover, under this deformity, corruption is likely to breed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Wu Dongfeng, the former editor-in-chief of Qiusuo magazine of the Hunan Academy of Social Sciences, was placed under investigation for serious disciplinary violations. The problem lies precisely in the publication fee. Later, the court determined that Wu Dongfeng had charged nearly 10 million yuan in &quot;page fee&quot; for his paper. The &quot;page fee&quot; for publishing an article in &quot;Qiusuo&quot; magazine can reach up to more than 50,000 yuan, and there are intermediaries responsible for blending these matters. At that time, this case caused great shock in the academic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to such corruption cases and problems, the &quot;paper industry&quot; has another problem, and that is the &quot;siphon effect.&quot; People in this &quot;industrial chain&quot; were supposed to create wealth, but instead they became &quot;paper brokers&quot;, helping others publish worthless articles to make profits. And some page fees are reimbursed at public expense. Except for those articles that are truly valuable, I am afraid that most of the junk articles are essentially &quot;conspiring to divide the spoils&quot; among many people. Some of them may be dividing taxpayers&#39; money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to change the status quo, I am afraid it is not a headache for the doctor. Not to ask why the page fee is so high, but to ask why so many worthless journals and articles can still live so well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[那些在互联网买“情绪”的年轻人，拜托醒醒吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259422]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;957&quot; height=&quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/27/a7605c3b1df672a8ea3cc792da571f45.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people may have heard the melody of &quot;love trading&quot;, but they don&#39;t know that there is also a business of &quot;emotional trading&quot; now. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Emotional Tree Hole&quot;, &quot;Good Luck Spray&quot;, &quot;Scolding to Awaken Love Brain&quot;, &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot;...

After being simplified to &quot;emo&quot;, emo also has colors such as impulsiveness, sensitivity, and melancholy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo, which is now a popular vocabulary, continues this core and emotional color, representing the decadent, frustrated, speechless and puzzled mood of young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo has become a popular word not only because of the principle of &quot;language economics&quot; - this short word accurately summarizes the mentality of young people, and it is not just popular. The &quot;herding effect&quot; in the spread of vocabulary - you use it for other people and I use it for you. What&#39;s more, emo is indeed a universal emotion of the times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Emo is a new variant of the previously popular words such as &quot;Buddhist&quot;, &quot;mourning&quot; and &quot;lying flat&quot;. It is related to some new changes of the times. For example, in the post-epidemic era, the global economy is recovering slowly and the economic downturn has put young people under greater work pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many people feel very tired under the &quot;involution&quot;; in the busy urban life, many young people do not have much time to socialize and stay in rental houses after work Here, they will inevitably feel lonely and cold as &quot;empty-nest youths&quot;... In addition to these universal dilemmas, young people also have different and specific confusions in their own lives, which more or less affect their emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In short, young people can emo about everything. I can&#39;t find a job, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m under great pressure at work, I&#39;m emo; I have a conflict with my partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m single and have no partner, I&#39;m emo; I&#39;m not ready for the exam, I&#39;m emo; my plan was rejected by Party A, I&#39;m emo...&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with words such as mourning and lying down, emo has a hint of self-deprecation of joy in suffering. It is not so negative and pessimistic, but after complaining about &quot;I am really emo&quot; , will still clean up the mess of life and move on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The comfort of &quot;emotional value&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After emo, you still have to embrace life. Therefore, young people will work hard to calm down their emotions faster and satisfy their emotional needs. They will seek &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, what is emotional value? Simply put, emotional value = positive emotion (benefit) - negative emotion (cost). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Whether a thing or a person has emotional value lies in its ability to bring positive emotional power to people, such as making people feel happy, secure, calm, and warm. , healing... In other words, emotional value is the ability to have a positive impact on our emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be companionship, sharing, listening, encouragement... In the end, it becomes a kind of comfort for emo emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On social media, young people also often use words closely related to emotional value, such as &quot;emotional stability&quot;, which has become the first criterion for many young people to choose a partner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;An emotionally stable partner can always handle things calmly and calmly, without losing control, without blaming each other, and without blaming each other, but working hard to solve problems. A partner who is emotionally stable will naturally bring strong emotional value to others - you will be wrapped in a sense of security, and no matter how chaotic the world is, there will be someone walking hand in hand with you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With this background, we can understand why many young people buy emotions on the Internet. What they essentially buy is &quot;emotional value.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If a person has no motivation to study, just join the &quot;virtual study room&quot;, and everyone will study together to have more atmosphere; if you want an illusion of good luck, buy &quot;Good &quot;Yuck Koi&quot;; if you want to get rid of loneliness and gain a sense of companionship, you can place an order for &quot;Virtual Mosquito&quot;, where a seller will role-play a mosquito and &quot;buzz&quot; you from time to time; buy it after a breakup A &quot;scolding to wake up your love brain&quot; is not so much about scolding you as it is about accompanying you, talking to you, and listening to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255731 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not want to buy Just buy it&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is human nature that people like people and things that can provide high emotional value. Keen merchants have also seized this business opportunity - young people need emotional value, and I will sell emotional value. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The question is, can you really buy emotional value if you want to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If emotional value was such an easy thing to obtain, it wouldn’t be so scarce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As mentioned above, emotional value is a kind of &quot;ability&quot;. It must really hit your emo point, bring you strength, comfort and help you. You transcend that depression. This is not something you can achieve by typing in a dialog box and the other party saying a few words of chicken soup for the soul; it is not something you can achieve by buying a &quot;Good Luck Koi&quot; or &quot;Einstein&#39;s Brain&quot; and you will be blessed with divine help. Falling from the sky; it’s not the other party “inciting emotions”, you will be emotionally liberated...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, those &quot;sell&quot; products on the Internet for a few cents or a few dollars &quot;Emotion&quot; is just a gimmick. The sellers do not have the quality and ability to provide emotional value. They are even more routine and perfunctory than the customer service of some merchants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What young people buy is only a few minutes of freshness, which brings a few minutes of fun to the emo mood. Once the freshness is over, the emo is still the emo, and the problem has not been solved. If so, it&#39;s still not resolved. It&#39;s OK to think of &quot;emotional trading&quot; as a joke, but if you take it seriously, you may be deceived and make you more emo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the final analysis, if there is no one or thing to rely on, then the only one who can bring positive emotional value to yourself is yourself. If you haven&#39;t studied for a long time and feel that you have fallen, you will feel emo, and you think that joining the &quot;virtual study room&quot; will give you motivation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, such heteronomy is in vain. If you have more self-discipline and complete the goals you set every day, you will feel real happiness the moment you complete it - the better. Self-discipline brings freedom; if you don’t work hard at ordinary times, you will feel emo before the exam. You think buying a &quot;good luck koi&quot; will bring you good luck, but you still won’t during the exam. If you study hard and concentrate on preparing for the exam, you will Your hard work will be reflected in the exam, and what you gain is a real sense of solidity and accomplishment...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the value of emotions cannot be bought just because you want to buy them. Buying emotions is a pleasure. Yes, but getting out of emo cannot rely solely on spiritual victory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《芭蕾舞复仇曲》：韩影越来越套路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259234]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;Among the new generation of Korean actresses, all Zhong Rui is an alternative existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She made her fortune in Li Cangdong&#39;s &quot;Burning&quot;. She stood out from thousands of auditions and performed a large-scale role in her first screen role. The cunning and alienation on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s face, her inadvertent dodge, and a hint of cowardice constitute her rich facial aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her new work &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, she once again demonstrates this highly recognizable performance style. This is her second collaboration with emerging director Li Chongxian. The first time the two worked together was in the 2020 crime suspense film &quot;The Call&quot;, which caused heated discussions among movie fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ballet In &quot;Revenge Song&quot;, although Jeon Jong-seo is not as crazy as in &quot;Telephone&quot;, the girl she plays, Ok-joo, is also a mistress who is not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhu once worked as a bodyguard in a security company, specializing in protecting high-level important personnel. Her superb skills and sharp mind were fully demonstrated in the opening supermarket robbery scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps for a long time Maintaining a high degree of vigilance, Yuzhu had no interest in life and was full of frustration all day long until she met her old classmate Minxi. The latter&#39;s natural affinity frees Yuzhu from the boring quagmire of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to show the contrast in atmosphere, the film specially uses colorful soft light to capture the relaxed and graceful friendship between the two girls when showing Minxi taking Yuzhu to celebrate her birthday, taking headshots and relaxing on the beach. . This is in contrast to the large number of night scenes and indoor scenes throughout the film, which basically use high contrast and low-key lighting to create dangerous and uneasy situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point of the story , appeared when Minxi suddenly committed suicide, leaving a last word hoping that Yuzhu would help her take revenge. After Yuzhu followed the clues and found a man named &quot;Chef Cui&quot;, she discovered that Minxi&#39;s suicide had a lot to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The many &quot;SM&quot; props in Chef Cui&#39;s home, as well as the large number of classified USB flash drives in the cabinet, all show that in the process of &quot;hunting for beauty&quot;, he often uses perverted methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;444&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Minxi , after being targeted by Chef Cui, he was drugged and raped while being filmed on video. Chef Cui did this not only to satisfy his abnormal desires, but also to threaten girls like Minxi through videos and force them to &quot;accept customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This crime chain is not the work of Chef Cui alone. He also has a pharmacist who regularly cooperates with him, so he can succeed every time with drugs such as &quot;obedient water&quot;; his subordinates also run a peach store. Hotels specialize in soliciting prostitutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6d74c7ae51907124c4f2612d454f78b0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6d74c7ae51907124c4f2612d454f78b0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255247&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the most disappointing thing What people are afraid of is the power behind Chef Cui. Furthermore, Chef Cui, who looks vicious on the surface, is just a small leader of a gang organization, and behind this is a huge black industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;585&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255249&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; comes from The &quot;Room N&quot; case caused a lot of controversy in South Korea in the past few years. The prisoner in the case, Zhao Zhubin, established a paid &quot;room&quot; on an online platform and used the threatened girls as bargaining chips to profit from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s just that this film introduces gangster forces and makes sexual crimes bottomless, in order to amplify this despair and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some time ago, &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, which was adapted from real events, brought to the table the rarely mentioned child abduction and sex trafficking. Although the quality of the film is not good, its discussion of this topic is worthy of recognition. It allows us to see a criminal phenomenon that is deep underground and widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, as Yuzhu deepens her investigation into Chef Cui and the organization behind him, she also only avenges her best friend at the beginning, but gradually transforms into avenging the victimized woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, The killing scenes and action scenes have become the second highlight of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jeon Jong-seo cannot rely on physical confrontation and impact to create visual stimulation like Stallone and Jason Statham, nor can he use real kung fu techniques like Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Show off a pleasing figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The action design of &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; absorbs the style of the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, that is, it gives full play to the advantages of &quot;gun-shaped&quot; action movies, allowing hot weapons and fists and kicks to be used alternately. Ammunition can create explosive scenes, and the head-on confrontation of fists, feet, knives and axes can highlight the thrilling effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at the climax In the scene, Yuzhu used two pistols to fight against the entire gang, which was most obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this alone cannot make up for Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s complement in action scenes, so lens language and editing techniques have become necessary auxiliary means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quick swinging technique, the movement of the camera synchronized with the direction of the punch, and the extensive use of close-up and close-up shots, coupled with the fast and sharp editing style, make the entire movie have a clear rhythm every time it enters the action section. Accelerate and the atmosphere becomes wanton and arrogant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director Li Chongxian is familiar with action films such as Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;The Fuse&quot;, Indonesia&#39;s &quot;The Raid&quot; and South Korea&#39;s &quot;Crime City&quot;, so he can create these action scenes with ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the tilted and unbalanced camera images and the neon aesthetics with great color contrast make &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; closer to the style of Hollywood crime films in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general In other words, the crime theme of exploiting women&#39;s bodies, good fighting scenes, and Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s character arc that is sometimes conservative and restrained, sometimes sensitive and angry, make this film have a sense of entertainment that is above the pass mark. However, when we finish watching &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, we can still detect its frivolity and frivolity based on big data algorithms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the character Ok-joo&#39;s emotions continue to deepen in the process of revenge, this delicate inner change relies more on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s outstanding performance. Why did she become a bodyguard? Why are you so depressed in life? The film never explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255255&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for her being Min Xi is infected and her heart gradually melts, but it is like going through the motions, and the filming is stereotyped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most puzzling thing is the pretentiousness of the underworld gang, which is strong on the outside but capable on the inside. The boss, who is full of gangster traditions, did not see anything done after he lectured Chef Cui. He neither saw through Chef Cui’s lies nor demonstrated his strategizing of the organization. Only in the contrasting section of &quot;die from talking too much&quot; does it play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; provides a framework for female revenge, especially in terms of revenge for best friends. It is exactly the same as the summer hit &quot;The Vanishing She&quot;. But when it comes to the specific levels of criminal psychology, social ecology, etc., it seems to be discouraged. It is not like Luo Hongzhen&#39;s &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, which separates the dirty, angry and restless characters&#39; psychology and shows you in detail. Instead, it provides a visual pleasure for immediate consumption and caters to the public&#39;s emotional fast food. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable result of Netflix and other streaming media entering the Korean market. It has brought big data arithmetic and more routine formulas, and this may also become a trend in the next few years. , a signal of an overall decline in the quality of Korean films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深圳欢乐谷过山车追尾，有游客称前一天已遇故障]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259498]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:19:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project promotion picture.

A staff member on the line said he was unclear about the situation, but said that the current queue time in the emergency department would be It&#39;s very long. &quot;There are more people waiting in the emergency department now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley, &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has a five-star thrill level. It is a catapult roller coaster built with a huge investment of 200 million and is the tallest and longest catapult roller coaster in Asia, with a total length of 550 meters. &quot;Speed ​​up in 2 seconds, galloping at 135 kilometers per hour, falling vertically from 60 meters, heart-poundingly crazy for 90 seconds, 4G maximum acceleration, the experience of going to the sky, going to the ground, and going into the sea is thrilling to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is It is a relatively popular event, and there were a lot of people queuing up today.&quot; Zhao Xin recalled that she had been queuing for nearly two hours. If nothing had happened, it would have been her turn to get on the next bus. Finally, she left around 19:00 At the scene, &quot;When my friend went over to play, he found that the project had been closed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, the day before the incident, Chen Yuangang played &quot;Snow Land&quot; with his friends. Eagle&quot; project. She told Southern Weekend reporters that there was a problem with the system at that time: &quot;The Snow Eagle made a loud sound when it ejected, but I didn&#39;t hear it at the time, and then I found that the car had returned to the starting position. After a while, , the roller coaster ejected again, and returned to the starting position after a normal run.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yuan recalled that the vehicle system activated the emergency protection device at that time, and tourists on the roller coaster were unable to get off. &quot;The staff used the microphone to inform the remaining people in line that there was a problem with the system and needed to be repaired, so they could not continue playing. They also issued speed passes to the remaining people in line.&quot; Chen Yuan said that everyone stayed on the stalled roller coaster again. After about ten minutes, the staff adjusted and the emergency braking mode was released and we were able to get out of the car. &quot;About two hours after the emergency repairs, Happy Valley notified Snow Eagle to resume operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maintenance is done every day&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shenzhen Happy Valley has been open since 1998 and is a new generation of large-scale theme park of OCT Group. Among them, the catapult roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project was officially opened in July 2012. Its vehicle structure includes two trains (orange car and green car), each train has 6 carriages, and each carriage can accommodate 4 people. There are 24 people in the whole car and 48 people in the two cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, a rear-end collision involving an aerial sightseeing train occurred in Happy Valley. On November 1, 2018, while two &quot;Happy Main Line&quot; sightseeing trains were running over the Overseas Chinese Town tourist resort, the front train stopped due to a system failure, causing a slight rear-end collision with the rear train. There were about 20 passengers on the two trains, causing 2 People get hurt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the China Bidding and Bidding Public Service Platform, on March 21, 2023, Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company issued a bidding announcement for the overhaul service project of the Shenzhen Happy Valley Snowy Eagle Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bidding announcement shows that the overhaul service project of Shenzhen Happy Valley&#39;s &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project includes professional evaluation of the overall operation situation, carrying out Snowy Eagle&#39;s service status evaluation, safety and reliability evaluation, large-scale Repairs, condition monitoring systems and other work will be carried out, and it will pass statutory inspections, regulatory filings, etc. The planned construction period is from April 20, 2023 to June 30, 2023. Finally, on April 25, 2023, Shenzhen Runchang Amusement Culture Group Co., Ltd. won the bid with an amount of 7.09 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have not done major repairs, we only do daily maintenance.” A person in charge of the bidding project told Southern Weekend reporters, “The daily conditions are normal and there are no problems. Maintenance is done every day. Weekly maintenance is done every week, monthly maintenance is done every month, and maintenance is done every year. It is impossible to say that there is any rust.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked about the cause of the accident, the person in charge said : &quot;Our company has a unified response to this aspect, and everything is now waiting for investigation and technical analysis.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(should be At the request of the interviewee, the interviewees in the article are all pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“美容腐败”Vs从“表哥”到低调腐败：性别偏好影响腐败模式丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259326]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, according to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission, a former member of the Party Group and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Yanqing District Committee of the CPPCC Chen Guifen was expelled from the party and public office, and the suspected criminal issues will be transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. The notice specifically mentioned that Chen Guifen &quot;violated regulations in accepting gifts and arrangements for beauty activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, expressions such as &quot;accepting beauty activities&quot; and &quot;addicted to beauty&quot; have appeared many times in official review reports on dismissed female officials. Chen Guifen&#39;s defeat this time has further brought the new term &quot;beauty corruption&quot; to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot; refers to cases of corruption and bribery that occur due to accepting beauty activities. Among the typical cases reported in recent years, the high amount of money involved and the bizarre corruption projects of &quot;beauty corruption&quot; have been breathtaking.前有鞍山市国税局原局长刘光明的“50万臀部整形费”，后有满洲里市原市长许爱莲“15万元一支的美容针”，以及北方工业大学原副校长沈志莉“单次消费69万”的惊人数字。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由“美容腐败”这一名词不难推断，某些类型的腐败确实与性别有关系。由于男女偏好的不一样，行贿者会有针对性地投其所好，这是不难理解的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;权力的“任性”会像生命一样找到出口，满足滥权者的个体欲望。现金房产，金银珠宝，名车名表，古董字画，总有一款适合落马官员，也是男女官员腐败的共性。但男性官员与女性官员在贪腐形式上存在爱好上的差别，也是一个看得见的现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早些年，男性展示成功的炫耀性风气对官场也有影响，出现过不少根据照片全民抓腐败的事件。有鉴于此，近年以来，男性官员的腐败多呈现“低调”“隐性”的特征，这是汲取了某些落马“表哥”“皮带哥”的“教训”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前在腐败形式上，男性官员“间接性”“迷惑性”特征越发明显，如“设立离岸账户”“退休离职之后再受贿”“影子公司”“期权腐败”等手段层出不穷。古已有之的“雅贿”也并未完全走入历史，借助古董字画的高端行贿受贿形式，仍常见于落马男性官员的贪腐细节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，男性官员也在着意隐藏自身的财富，一切以低调为上，不再像往常那样因为公开形象而被轻易抓包。在腐败细节上，男性官员也极力掩饰，尽量不留下可追踪的信息，比如孙力军收受的代号“小海鲜”的“30万美元礼盒”，以及海南省委前常委、海口前市委书记张琦“家中堆满13.5吨金条”的隐秘手法。男性官员往往还能借助自己特殊的兴趣爱好，满足贪欲的同时隐藏腐败事实：重庆市市场监督管理局原党组副书记、副局长杨宏伟则有“球书记”美名，热衷在工作时间打篮球，以打球掩护自己私相授受的贪腐行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不难看出，打球等都是更常见于男性群体的爱好，而从近年某些落马的女性官员来看，权力与爱美之心结合的腐败也不少见，从名贵饰品、服装包包到奢侈品消费，再到所谓“美容腐败”。诚如北京市卫生局工会原主席白宏的腐败纪实，“周围人群的赞美声和嫉妒声，使白宏沉浸在成功女性的快感中”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行贿者代为支付美容费用，或是送上高价美容会员卡，都能构成对女性官员行贿受贿，甚至发展出新颖的洗钱手段。现实生活中“普通人天价美容”的情况都并非罕见，而一旦女性官员的爱美之心得到权力欲的加持，那么由此催生的腐败行为就更如滔天洪水。 “权力让人永葆青春”在女性官员身上不仅是一句象征语，更是可以借助美容消费实现的写实之语。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;并非官员才腐败，在关键岗位上的人员照样可以腐败，且腐败还有年轻化的倾向，年轻人的腐败往往更大胆，更不计后果。滁州市不动产登记中心的“95后”科员张雨杰，挪用公款近7000万元，其中几万元都买了游戏卡，案发之后这张卡竟被拍卖到了8000多万。他的爱好是打游戏。在2016年的“江苏扬州4名年轻女财会贪污”案中，仅仅是高邮市农委原现金会计柏玲挪用公款就达1051万，其中800余万元用于美容消费，案发时她仅有29岁，贪污如此巨款却只是为了美容消费，实在令人咋舌。她们的偏好是爱美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国公职人员政务处分法》第34条规定，“接受、提供可能影响公正行使公权力的宴请、旅游、健身、娱乐等活动安排情节较重的予以警告、记过或者记大过，情节严重的予以降级或者撤职。”美容腐败，就形式而言属于比较隐蔽的“娱乐等活动”，而其涉案金额又往往符合两高《关于办理贪污贿赂刑事案件适用法律若干问题的解释》里“数额特别巨大”的标准，称得上灰色地带的隐性腐败。因此，整治美容腐败还需从腐败的源头着手，抑制权力任性的空间，这一点是不分男女、没有性别的。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月25日，国家数据局正式挂牌。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历经七个多月筹备，2023年10月25日上午，在一众筹备组成员和其他部委代表的见证下，国家数据局正式揭牌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至此，第九次国务院机构改革中新组建的两个部门均已完成挂牌。此前，新组建的国家金融监督管理总局已于2023年5月18日完成挂牌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新一轮国务院机构改革方案显示，国家数据局由国家发改委管理，具体负责协调推进数据基础制度建设，统筹数据资源整合共享和开发利用，统筹推进数字中国、数字经济、数字社会规划和建设等。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;发掘数据蓝海&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;国家数据局宣布组建前，数据的重要性便已被多次强调。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月，《数字中国建设整体布局规划》印发，更早之前，2022年底，中共中央、国务院出台《关于构建数据基础制度更好发挥数据要素作用的意见》。两份文件均写进加快数字经济发展的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家发改委价格监测中心副主任王建冬的表述则更为直接。2023年4月接受媒体专访时，他曾提出，到“十四五”期末，中国数据要素流通市场规模将达到万亿元规模，是一个巨大的蓝海。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现有数据已经印证了这一说法。国家网信办发布的《数字中国发展报告（2022年）》显示，2022年中国数据数字经济规模达到50.2万亿元，总量居世界第二位，占GDP比重提升至41.5%，并继续保持着10%的高位增长速度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在北京交通大学信息管理理论与技术国际研究中心教授张向宏看来，目前中国公共数据、企业数据和个人数据的开发程度还较低，利用水平也不高，存在开发动力不足、利用活力不够的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正因如此，统一数据资源管理、激活数据效能成为国家数据局被寄予的厚望。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前接受南方周末记者采访时，竞天公诚律师事务所合伙人、数据法律专家袁立志提到，2023年1月，在一场数据要素流通主题的研讨会后，国家发改委工作人员就曾同他一起，就数据要素流通的实操问题进行沟通。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;两名领导提前亮相&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;有着明确发展目标，国家数据局在人事安排方面也有体现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月18日，国家数据局首任局长刘烈宏在第三届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛数字经济高级别论坛上首次公开亮相。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简历显示，刘烈宏生于1968年，长期在工业电子信息机构任职。1990年参加工作起，刘烈宏当过助理工程师、工程师。2004年11月，刘烈宏通过公开招聘，任中国电子科技集团副总经理，后任中国电子信息产业发展研究院院长兼北京赛迪信息产业集团公司总裁，中国电子信息产业集团有限公司董事、总经理，中国电子科技集团有限公司董事、总经理等职。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年7月，刘烈宏从企业进入政界，被任命为中央网信办副主任，任职期间力推移动行业发展和5G网络应用。2021年8月任中国联通集团董事长后，他还曾推动中国联通向数字化先锋转型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与积极拥抱数字化的刘烈宏一样，10月11日被任命的国家数据局副局长沈竹林，此前也在数字经济、电子信息和大数据推广方面有着丰富经验。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公开信息显示，沈竹林长期在国家发改委工作，曾任国家发改委高技术产业司副巡视员、高技术司副司长、创新和高技术发展司司长等职。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年，沈竹林曾在中央网信办召开的一场座谈会上提出，要真正把数据资源作为一个重要的经济资源来看待，真正为数据的开放和共享采取一些措施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了局领导人选“专业对口”，国家数据局对基础人才的要求同样比较明确。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月15日公布的《中央机关及其直属机构2024年度考试录用公务员招考简章》显示，本轮招考，国家数据局共开放5个单位的12个招聘名额，要求应聘者至少有3年的基层工作年限，以及电子科学与技术、信息与通信工程、计算机科学与技术、应用经济学等专业的硕士及以上的学历。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照招聘要求，这些人才将会参与数据治理和发展政策研究，数据领域、数字经济国际合作，数据基础制度和政策研究，拟定数字经济有关发展战略、规划和政策等工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;人事动向&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;【李尚福、秦刚被免去国务委员职务】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences.</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被渴慕的军训丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259426]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.infzm.com/contents/258988&quot; title=&quot;How is hard-core military training accomplished&quot;>;How is hard-core military training accomplished&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interview with Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;) and Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) as a person in charge of military training, I wanted to understand the difficulties of organizing hard-core military training, but I always failed to do so. The two schools borrowed simulated weapons and combat vehicles without much trouble. The tactical training seemed to come naturally. The local garrison area and military training and education base are willing to open their doors to the school and can deliver realistic equipment and a sufficient number of active or retired military personnel to the new students participating in the training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in addition to these objective factors, I feel that there is a strong spiritual power that allows the hard-core military training in these two universities in Guangxi to be implemented smoothly. In the minds of students participating in special warfare training, military training is not an obligation that is forced to be completed, but a life experience that is desired. One kind of person looks forward to the sense of relief when everything ends from the first day of military training; the other kind of person hopes to pursue the intrinsic value of military training and is eager to continue it even after the military training ends. I think that when I participated in military training as a student, I belonged to the former; but many training students in Guilin universities fell into the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Shen Hong was interviewed, he was a little shy. Huang Yilong, chairman of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association, often said that Shen Hong was an outstanding representative of the Red Army&#39;s demining gunners. Upon hearing such compliments, Shen Hong would either bury his head in the ground or look at the street lights in the distance, deliberately hiding his smile from me. Different from the occasional erratic expression, even if the person had already stepped out of the queue, for more than 20 minutes, Shen Hong&#39;s simulated gun was fixed on his chest in a standard gun-holding posture from beginning to end, without moving at all. Two weeks of freshmen military training and two weeks of daily association training seemed to have carved his rock-solid movements into a habit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the hardships of special warfare training, Shen Hong always downplays: &quot;There are bruises on elbows, knees, legs, and feet, but they will be over with some medicine.&quot; &quot;While leaping forward, I suddenly heard something The body cannot react to the enemy&#39;s instructions on the left and right, so I keep practicing this movement and practice harder. I will do it wrong at first, but after practicing for three or four days, I can reach the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these, the &quot;soldier&quot; Identity has more appeal to Shen Hong. He was born in Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Guangxi. He is a freshman this year and has been following war movies and spy dramas for more than ten years. Recalling the time he spent watching TV with his father, Shen Hong&#39;s tone raised a few notches, &quot;Chinese soldiers are very handsome.&quot; The first time he knew that his father, a farmer, had been a soldier was because he saw his marching kettle. &quot;That&#39;s a unique kettle in the army.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shen Hong is convinced that if he meets the recruitment standards, he will definitely join the army after graduation. For him, this military training is not only a required course according to the syllabus, but also a serious preparatory exercise before officially joining the army. What attracted him to join the tactical company was not only the rich firearms training, but also the &quot;soldier&#39;s pride&quot; that comes with pressure. In Shen Hong&#39;s eyes, his teammates are also &quot;people with a strong sense of family and country, who speak directly and boldly.&quot; &quot;I like to be friends with people who can tell their true feelings.&quot; He also longs for the future life in the military camp: if he is bitten by ants during training on the grass, a comrade will happily hand him a dose of ointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, it was already dark when the Guihang military training performance ended. The special operations team members who had no chance to ride in the armored vehicle during the performance climbed into the armored vehicle one by one in groups of eight or nine. They sat in a small circle on the roof of the car, arms around each other, singing songs as the chariot moved forward. Everyone&#39;s face was covered with tired camouflage makeup, but the singing was still loud. They were like battle-hardened soldiers returning in triumph. Marching to the center of the playground, the armored vehicle suddenly stopped, and the team members staggered, as if they were waking up from a dream. But when they climbed down from the car, they saw other team members sitting cross-legged under the street lamp in the distance, noisy and lively, so they ran over. The WeChat messages, photos, and words of their comrades remained forever in the camouflage-colored dream. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
