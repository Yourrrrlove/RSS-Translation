The queue can sometimes stretch to the river. In September, free tickets for online reservations for the Wuzhen Theater Festival Youth Performance Competition (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Youth Competition&quot;&lt;/span>;) will be available at the beginning of the ticket sales It was robbed. This is one of the most important units of the Wuzhen Theater Festival every year, and it is also the only competition unit. Among the works of 18 groups of young dramatists, the Small Town Award for Best Drama, Best Individual Performance Award, and Special Attention Award will be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a sign in front of the fence outside the Bengwan Theater, indicating that ⅩⅩⅩ spectators can be admitted for this youth game. In the theater, the works of 18 groups of young dramatists were performed in turn; a screen was temporarily hung on a stone wall outside the theater for audiences who were unable to enter to watch the live broadcast. Under the scorching sun, there were always five or six rows of enthusiastic audiences sitting on the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2013, the Wuzhen Theater Festival has been running for 10 years, and the Youth Competition has also been running for 10 years. Bengwan Theater is named after the earliest place name here. Huang Lei thinks it is good, &quot;There are many clams in Bengwan, and each clam may hide a wonderful pearl.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wuzhen Theater Festival One of the initiators, actor Huang Lei, who has taught at the Beijing Film Academy for many years, has &quot;deep gratitude&quot; and &quot;profound reflection on the shortcomings&quot; of traditional art education. He brought some ideas that could not be implemented in school to the Wuzhen Theater Festival. This year, two days before the opening of the 10th Wuzhen Theater Festival, in a handwritten letter to the youth competition, Huang Lei wrote, &quot;In the beginning, when the Wuzhen Theater Festival was just a small idea, young people were already fans of this festival. The protagonist, the origin and goal of everything is for the young people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Youth Competition is open to young people who are interested in engaging in the theater industry. The rules are very simple: each of the three founders of the Wuzhen Theater Festival will bring a prop to form the group. The annual proposition - use these 3 props to rehearse an original play with no more than 5 people in 20-30 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May this year, Huang Lei, Lai Shengchuan, and Meng Jinghui, the founders of the Wuzhen Theater Festival, proposed the topic for the youth competition: world-famous paintings, train tickets, horses. &quot;The fundamental purpose of the three props is not to test how you use the props, but to test how you use the environment, find effective stage fulcrums, and maximize the energy density of the play per unit time.&quot; Youth competition judge Li Bo said. In August, more than 500 works were submitted; in September, 18 groups of shortlisted works were announced; in mid-October, the group lottery for performances at the Wuzhen Theater Festival was released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stage of Bengwan Theater is small and the layout is simple: ceiling light and curtain. The audience formed a semicircle, surrounding the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The small stage of Qingsai has produced many theater people over the years. In 2013, &quot;Baba Mama&quot; directed by Chen Minghao won the first prize. This year he is well-known to the public for his performance in &quot;The Long Season&quot;; in 2015, Wu Bi won the Best Drama Award for &quot;Stillness&quot;. This year he is also a judge of the Youth Competition , is also an actor in Lai Shengchuan&#39;s new drama &quot;Long Alley&quot;. Wu Bi once said that Wuzhen was the biggest turning point in his career. &quot;You can have no cost and nothing, but you can do what you want to do and give everyone a stage for so many people to watch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/M6Z6ezjdpK9vyrDYsgTZsLoWe4HSqc0pmODUU6Bw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;686&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/M6Z6ezjdpK9vyrDYsgTZsLoWe4HSqc0pmODUU6Bw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259261&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wuzhen Theater Festival Youth Competition Unit Judge Li Bo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bo participated in the first three Youth Competitions as a contestant, and his works all entered the top three. From the fourth time, he became one of the judges of the Youth Competition, responsible for selecting 18 groups of shortlisted works from hundreds of works; and then selected from the 18 groups. There will be 6 sets of final works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was in his early 20s, Li Bo studied in the Performance Department of Beijing Film Academy and enjoyed freedom and romance in the ivory tower. Later he became a university teacher. &quot;I always felt that I had no goals and no outlet, so I was very confused.&quot; Participate The Wuzhen Theater Festival has directional significance for him. He said that it is a way for more people to understand his theatrical concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the 10 days in Wuzhen, I spent a lot of time at the Bengwan Theater. From these youth plays, I can see the disappearance of love between men and women, the love between mother and daughter, and father and son. The hidden pain caused by the bondage, and the individual&#39;s reflection on the tearing of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of &quot;Fifth Floor, Ninth Floor&quot;, which won the Best Drama Award, is set in a malfunctioning elevator. For half an hour, a boy on the fifth floor and a girl on the ninth floor reflect on their intimate relationship. , one feels that he is trapped by his boyfriend, and the other may be trapped by his girlfriend. They all wanted to run away and take imaginary train tickets to the north to see the auroras. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/YTBsOeV8Us98w43JUFXAKA3juucRsaCWN6MX13mP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/YTBsOeV8Us98w43JUFXAKA3juucRsaCWN6MX13mP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259258&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills of &quot;Fifth Floor and Ninth Floor&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Provided by Wuzhen Theater Festival Organizing Committee/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Clam and Pearl&quot; won the Special Attention Award and the Best Individual Performance Award. The protagonist is a very controlling mother. With the help of a psychologist, she reveals the trauma of being violated as a girl. At the end, the daughter takes a photo of her mother, and the mother looks back and turns into a picture of &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Me and Liu Hongmei at the Station&quot;, which also won the Special Attention Award, has only one actor from beginning to end. &quot;I&quot; left the big city and returned to his hometown to become a staff member of the amusement park carousel project. We met several times. &quot;She&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;grandma who has lived her whole life in her hometown&lt;/span>;), when she was 15 years old, she wanted to secretly go swimming in the river; when she was in her twenties, She wanted to go to Beijing and Shanghai, and she cried anxiously when she lost her train ticket; she was 82 years old, thin, silent, and old, and time passed quickly on her; in the end, &quot;I&quot; took the 6-year-old &quot;she&quot; everywhere Carousel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fU6jjhR6Sz0KwolNzteM4YohY6FGSerkhP5iORe0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fU6jjhR6Sz0KwolNzteM4YohY6FGSerkhP5iORe0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Still photo of &quot;Liu Hongmei and I were at the Station&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Provided by Wuzhen Theater Festival Organizing Committee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;One night during the drama festival, Li Bo queued up to watch Meng Jinghui&#39;s new play at the Zhenshui Carving Hall, and heard an audience member complain about a certain Qingsai play. Li Bo found it quite interesting. This just reflects the diversification of the youth competition standards. &quot;It is true that the audience has mixed reviews of that play, but it is the only one-man show performed in this way on the youth competition stage in the past 10 years. We must encourage it, maybe in the future It will form a unique style. Young people should do a lot of exploration in their plays. If the plays are done very neatly, then it is Teacher Lai, right?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/Uzl3RRMgJu8UzwrzdxTezjUAsrdeAxd7cscXsI7f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/22/Uzl3RRMgJu8UzwrzdxTezjUAsrdeAxd7cscXsI7f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259259&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This Youth Championship Finals The crew of the shortlisted work &quot;Open the Unopenable Window&quot; took their final bow&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Zhang Yuxin/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the finalists were announced and After the theater festival, Li Bo was interviewed twice by Southern People Weekly. The following is Li Bo&#39;s dictation:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Qingsai is a school that allows you to have cute flaws&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;On October 26, we discussed the 6 shortlisted plays, and we wanted to take an official photo of the judges discussing the finalists. We all sat upright, holding the play review list. Later, someone came up with a point. Director Cheng Er was the first to stand up and said, no, this stage is so rare, this play must use the language of drama. Later, they all stood up and argued: what is reverence for the stage, what is the language of drama, how to perform in a small theater, how to use the three props, what to do if the performance times out...&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are more than 500 works registered, and we have to take care of a variety of themes, styles, and expressions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qing Sai is a school that allows you to have cute flaws. However, the dramas that were shortlisted for their flaws at the time were almost out of shape on the youth competition stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a play, the registration deadline is August 20th, I think they recorded it on August 19th , it’s too late if we don’t record it again. The video was taken at a piano store, and the first shot is still shaking. What they were performing was a light comedy, and the actors had to be absolutely relaxed. They probably acted as if they were not shortlisted. They came across a lot of spiritual and advanced comedy lines on the scene, so the ear guide team brought this up to the scene. . I was having a meeting out of town and was really bored, so I just put on headphones and watched the video. They were presented in a relaxed and playful way, and I was particularly happy to see them. The actor forgot his lyrics and laughed loudly, and so did I. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The finalists were announced later. The organizing committee called, signed a confirmation letter, designed a poster, and went to Wuzhen. Arrange three public rehearsals, an interview, a few more rehearsals, and then three rounds of performances. They began to realize that this was a competition and became nervous. When people are nervous, they become unfree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The official Weibo announced the finalists, and there was a message saying that each of these six plays Solid, congratulations to them. This evaluation is the greatest encouragement for our work. Some plays may look good and rich, but they are too fluttery and tasteless at first glance; some may look steady, but the whole presentation has a poise that is rare for young people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This year is the highest overall level I have seen in the 7 years I have been a judge. This year, we can really choose 6 out of the 6 finalists. In the end, we are making a choice. It happened that I came across a play that I liked very much, but some judges didn&#39;t like it very much, so the two of us kept arguing, but this was academic and not personal. When I work in an office, I tend to answer &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;yes, you are right&quot;, but this problem does not exist at the Wuzhen Theater Festival. Teacher Lai and I also argued about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This year’s props are a horse, world-famous paintings, and train tickets. In addition to performance and text, the most important thing is to see how the three elements are used, because this game is supported by three elements. When we judge, if the performance of the two plays is similar, we will look at the props. Each of the three teachers was given a prop to prevent them from adapting old works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The use of props particularly tests the professionalism of a crew. For example, we were fighting without a winner, and a knife suddenly appeared, and everyone wanted to grab it. This knife caused a turning point in the drama and changed the direction of the drama. This is a relatively common usage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As for the props, I only mention it. This is the simplest; it also plays a role in the turning point of the play. Key role? Or is it an image and symbol that lingers in your mind throughout the play? These are three completely different levels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The most difficult props this year are world-famous paintings, because we Chinese rarely have the experience of going to art exhibitions . Some of the plays are parodies of &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;, some have her family treating her works as world-famous paintings, and some have actors imitating &quot;The Scream&quot;, all of which are quite cute. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Liu Hongmei and I were at the Station&quot;, all of us judges passed the finals. I think its entry into the finals is inseparable from the use of props. The image of horses is present throughout. When we learn acting, whether props serve as the fulcrum of the stage or are key items that promote the development of the plot, they must appear on the stage, but they did not appear in this play. The script mentioned the carousel game. &quot;I&quot; walked around the stage like a merry-go-round and met &quot;my&quot; grandma. Every time I walked around, &quot;I&quot; saw Liu Hongmei in different stages. It all happened. Different things are related to Liu Hongmei&#39;s fate. Finally &quot;I&quot; returned to work and drove the merry-go-round for other children. So fresh, so natural. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fn6iCX3PjfK5PEwyTNT8zLsIN7JTjdJqDHwyIQ9o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/fn6iCX3PjfK5PEwyTNT8zLsIN7JTjdJqDHwyIQ9o.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259260&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The performance of &quot;Then Tide, Sun, Moon&quot; has ended&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Zhang Yuxin/picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Don’t be cool or showy, just focus on the story&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;I also said at the reading meeting that day that you can get chicken soup with 140 characters on Weibo, and you can achieve all your desires in one minute on TikTok. Why would someone waste two hours of their life in the theater to go to the theater? First of all, this play must have warmth. Second, the things you talk about in your play are things you don’t often see on Douyin, Kuaishou and Weibo. You need to lead the audience to pay attention to people in life that we have never paid attention to. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Up to now, I have selected one play in the previous youth competitions, and I think it is the best It is &quot;Gama&quot; in 2016 (Reporter&#39;s note: The title of the Youth Competition that year was A Drop of Blood, a Suitcase, and a Shooting Star. The protagonists of &quot;Gama&quot; are a mother and daughter. For many years, my mother has been unable to let go of leaving home to practice medicine. , the father who became a living Buddha, the living Buddha is dead, and the mother firmly believes that the living Buddha can be reincarnated and return home within 49 days, and hopes that her daughter Karma will be pregnant; but the child that Karma was pregnant with was the reincarnation of Kelsanghua, and the child also died. The mother The two women planned to go on their own pilgrimages and finally reconciled on the way to the sacred lake). Two graduate students from the Shanghai Theater Academy made it the only time in the history of the youth competition that the best individual performance award and the grand prize were all given to a team. When performing beliefs on the stage, they usually tend to be complicated, but that play was very simple, with one chair and two girls. One of the girls played two roles (the grandmother who never forgets her husband, and the reincarnated granddaughter of Kelsanghua). ), so simple yet so clear. After they kowtowed, they looked into the distance and saw a cold light coming over them. Wow, it was a lake. Tibetan music sounded, and it felt like we were in the snowy plateau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From the first to the present, all the dramas that have won the grand prize are small and big. Talk about life down to earth. If you pick up a random person from Xizha, they can understand it even if they are over 10 years old or under 90 years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The stage of the youth competition is very close to the audience. Really, it is the most important thing. Is the core of your drama told to us through a small incident, or is it a fake philosophical event? I especially don&#39;t like to tell us something in a pretentious manner, or forcefully instill something. Including the judges&#39; votes, the results of this kind of drama are not good. Young people&#39;s dramas don&#39;t need to be so complicated. Let&#39;s discuss To be or not to be. I&#39;m sorry, you really don&#39;t have that skill. Sometimes what you think and what you perform are two different things. I still hope that the story can be told clearly: it has the story&#39;s ups and downs, characters, conflicts, and themes. Even if there is no intention, it is very rare. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Look at Liu Tianqi&#39;s &quot;Chicken and Rabbit in the Same Cage&quot; (Reporter&#39;s Note: Youth Competition Best Drama Award Award-winning work) How simple, the son went to prison to visit his father, and the two had a conversation. There is a big world in a small play. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I still think that young people don’t need to be cool or showy, they should be down-to-earth and focus their energy In terms of story, how to structure and unfold the story; the performance must be restrained. I especially hate the kind of badass performances that can be seen in short videos, but many people may be affected and feel that our scenes must be &quot;acting&quot;. I told the contestants in the youth competition that it is the most difficult to act in a scene where the inner world is turbulent and the outer surface is as calm as water. When Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, or Al Pacino encountered something that shattered his faith, was any one of them howling? His emotions are a reservoir, and as much as he wants can come out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We also need to learn this on the stage. The performance must be subtle, restrained, and forbearing. Don&#39;t let the audience&#39;s shouts and applause make the play fly away and take over the show. Some plays were very popular, but we felt that they were a bit pleasing to the audience. After performing it once, we knew which baggage was in which place, but the second time we performed it with all our strength, without even control or rhythm. &quot;Liu Hongmei and I were at the Station&quot; is particularly stable and does not cater to the audience. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is not easy to perform a one-man show. One person has to interpret many people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We watched the registration video and there were a lot of one-man shows. A lot of it is like what we did when we were in school - a person encounters a dilemma within a unit of time, and through the struggle between people and the natural environment, the problem is pushed to a certain climax. But we should show new and real things to the audiences who come to Wuzhen. We have selected three one-man shows this time, such as &quot;Liu Hongmei and I were at the Station&quot;, which are not one-man shows in the traditional sense. They are more often talking and revealing, in a particularly dull state, but the inner feelings are There is content. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think the Bengwan Theater and Qingsai Theater in Wuzhen are an experimental field for young Chinese dramatists. As long as you have the ability, you can put your own experiments on the stage. The audience is tolerant, and so are our judges. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/mzOLwjXxuTifmIoAYAslcXEBXGJc6iobwlg9OBsw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/mzOLwjXxuTifmIoAYAslcXEBXGJc6iobwlg9OBsw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259262&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Outside the Bengwan Theater, posters of all the works of this youth competition are pasted on the gray stone wall&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(South People Weekly reporter Zhang Yuxin/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;If we don’t do drama, of course we can understand&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;When I was 33, 34, and 35 years old, I participated in the Youth Championship as a player. It was very unforgettable and worthwhile. In the first year, I did the only comedy among the 12 plays; in the second year, I did the only physical drama, without lines; in the third year, I did the only montage drama, relying on light to explain the performance. Now I am still a teacher, but I definitely can’t rule out things like those three years. People’s experiences are getting richer and their courage is getting smaller and smaller. Especially when working in a university, your imagination is not so wild. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the first year of the Youth Voting Competition, we waited in line at school until two or three o&#39;clock every night. The students were lined up to give up, saying that the standards of these judges must be high and they would not be shortlisted. I said, after being a teacher for so many years, I have also done scientific research and participated in awards. A competition that does not charge an entry fee must be a good competition. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I teach at a second public school, and students are recruited from the same school as Nortel Chinese Drama. There is a gap. The &quot;survival rate&quot; of my first class of students competing together is very high. One is in Happy Twist, one is in Dalian Repertory Theater, and one is now a delivery anchor. He is doing very well. I have seen his Live broadcast, his live broadcast skills are linked to his performance. He can hang up and smash up. Rather than watching his live broadcast, it is better to say that he is watching him perform a play. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I also rehearsed plays in college and Wuzhen plays. Sometimes one brain can be divided into two types ideas. All universities in China are actually the same, and university education has university characteristics. Therefore, when young people get the props from the Wuzhen Theater Festival, they may be very excited because they finally have the opportunity to make a comedy, tragedy or absurd play that they really like and have a sense of life. Let me put it in a very unpleasant light, Wuzhen&#39;s drama does not mean that after you perform in Wuzhen, you can perform it every day. If you win a grand prize in just 10 days, the chance of it being performed (continued) is very small. Some of the plays are very immature, but because the scenes are grand enough, they continue to be performed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I still encourage young people to go to drama festivals to watch plays and compete. Drama lovers from all over the country come together in one place to talk about drama. This kind of preciousness is something that will linger in your mind for the rest of your life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The goal of the Wuzhen Theater Festival is very clear. By capturing 5% of the people, this theater festival can manage. There is no way for us to have a chain of support like some film festivals, providing money to film, screen, and go online. Drama is still a niche, and the number of screens across the country is definitely much greater than the number of theaters. But we just want to give them a shot in the arm. Every year in the audience of the Wuzhen Youth Championship, there are contestants who were shortlisted in previous years. Those who did not vote this year, or who did not win, return to Wuzhen to watch the show. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Everyone has his or her own life choices. Of course we can understand if we don’t do drama, because It&#39;s good to be alive. If you&#39;re going to make a drama, make it a good one. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[考研人数八年来首降：高校招生计划扩张时代正在走向尾声丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261349]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 22, 2023, the official website of the Ministry of Education announced matters related to the 2024 National Master’s Degree Admissions Examination. According to statistics, the number of applicants for the national master&#39;s degree examination in 2024 is 4.38 million, a decrease of 360,000 or about 7.6% from the 4.74 million applicants for the postgraduate examination in 2023. This is also the first time in eight years that the number of applicants for the postgraduate examination has increased compared with the previous year. fall back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why has the number of postgraduate entrance examinations declined? The outside world has summarized some possible reasons: some graduates turned to the public entrance examination, striving to get an iron job in one step, and withdrew from the postgraduate entrance examination track; some graduates no longer regard the postgraduate entrance examination as a choice, thinking that it is just a matter of paper. A postgraduate diploma may not necessarily lead to a good job, so it is better to enter the job market in advance to save opportunity costs; the postgraduate recruitment policies of major universities have changed. &quot;The number of places for professional masters has increased and the number of places for academic masters has decreased&quot;, which has reduced the cost-effectiveness of postgraduate studies, and some prices Sensitive candidates give up in the face of high tuition fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that these reasons all stem from the rational choices of candidates as &quot;economic people&quot;: studying has increasingly become an investment, and the consumption attribute of higher education is also strengthening. If the candidates believe that studying for graduate school cannot improve the competitiveness of the job market and cannot bring good economic returns in the future, then the candidates will rationally consider &quot;whether studying for graduate school is worth it&quot;, thereby reducing the &quot;supply&quot; of the higher education market. There is a rumor going viral that a famous postgraduate entrance examination teacher successfully predicted the decline in the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination. In fact, this also shows that his &quot;preaching&quot; over the years has achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a statistical point of view, the change in candidates&#39; attitudes has also taken several years, which is essentially a &quot;reverse incentive&quot; brought about by changes in the job market. Statistics on the number of applicants for postgraduate entrance examinations over the years show that this number declined in 2014 and 2015, but has shown an upward trend since 2015, reaching a peak in 2023. The year-on-year expansion of postgraduate enrollment and the increase in the number of graduates have made the job market supply unable to keep up with the employment demand of graduates. This imbalance in supply and demand has naturally been transmitted to the upstream higher education market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be admitted that in reality, only a small proportion of people go to graduate school to satisfy their personal enthusiasm for knowledge or for scientific research. Most students go to graduate school for employment, which can be subdivided. Further studies to postpone employment, and &quot;gold-plated graduate school&quot; for better employment. Unfortunately, both of these options are facing great challenges amid a weak job market. Of course, students are not fools and will also adjust their life strategies according to social reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key factors that affect the supply and demand of the job market are the economic cycle and industrial structure. The feedback from the job market also determines the cost-effectiveness of graduate school. None of the three parties, students, employers, or universities, can answer the question of “is graduate school worth it” alone? In the face of sluggish demand in the job market, both employers and candidates have begun to take action to answer this question: companies have reduced the scale of school recruitment, while candidates have seen a decline in the number of applicants. What is worth asking is, how will universities respond? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this century, the number of postgraduate students enrolled in China has increased year by year, from 220,000 in 2003 to more than 1 million in 2020, and now accounts for about 10% of undergraduate graduates that year. Major universities have expanded their enrollment of master&#39;s degree students so rapidly over the years. On the one hand, they are of course adapting to the growing needs of the job market. On the other hand, they can also apply for more funds for themselves, charge more tuition fees, and improve various evaluation indicators. In short, it is to strive for more benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the &quot;reverse incentives&quot; in the job market, the sluggish fertility rate is destined to continue to reduce the number of postgraduate entrance examinations in the future, and the phenomenon of &quot;the merger of primary and secondary schools&quot; will sooner or later spread to higher education. field, this will be a more decisive factor in the future than &quot;candidates choose not to take the exam&quot;. In other words, the decline in the number of people taking postgraduate entrance examinations is an irreversible trend. In the future, colleges and universities may face a new enrollment gap of one million levels every year and have to face the severe situation of &quot;competition for existing students&quot;. This is a serious issue that colleges and universities need to deal with urgently. challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reducing enrollment for master&#39;s degrees and expanding enrollment for associate&#39;s master&#39;s degrees&quot; and &quot;extending the academic system for associate&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees&quot; are the response plans that some colleges and universities have come up with. In this way, they can not only maintain the original enrollment scale, but also increase enrollment. Collect tuition fees. But the question is, when colleges and universities make a fuss about the academic system and quota of associate and master&#39;s degrees, can they really &quot;ensure the quality of training and improve employment competitiveness&quot;, or can they just &quot;charge one more year of tuition&quot; or even &quot;delay one year&quot;? &quot;Employment&quot; itself is quite debatable and deserves reflection. Some candidates&#39; doubts about the cost-effectiveness of master&#39;s degrees may be one of the reasons for the decrease in the number of postgraduate students this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the principles of organizational behavior, &quot;organizations will work hard to create jobs for themselves, and employees of organizations will work hard to create jobs for each other.&quot; Since an organization has been established, it will do everything possible to maintain its existence, especially The public sector eats up financial resources. Public universities have long relied on taxpayers&#39; money to operate and do not need to directly face market competition. Naturally, they will find ways to maintain their existing graduate spots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, changes in supply and demand in the job market and the impact of declining fertility rates will be transmitted sooner or later. The arrival of the enrollment gap has become an irreversible trend. The decline in the number of postgraduate entrance examinations this year is a timely warning to major universities. Comply with the needs of the job market, comprehensively consider social needs, adjust the recruitment plan for graduate students, and better serve the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从不被理解到亚运项目，中国电子竞技20年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261341]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On November 18, 2003, e-sports was listed as the 99th sports competition event by the State Sports General Administration.

He was referring to the interview with Southern People Weekly in 2019, when he had just graduated from the Central Academy of Drama. In the past few years, his acting career had become more mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has appeared in more types of film and television works and discovered more diverse artistic skills, including participating in reality shows, releasing music albums, and expressing his thoughts more freely in interviews, showing a more relaxed attitude. On the one hand, &quot;I used to think this was not good, that was not good, but now I feel more confident.&quot; But he still habitually looks at himself and cares about his external presentation, just like when he was watching a movie on set Playback in the viewfinder, scrolling through audience comments on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The radar of self-examination is always on. Zhang Xincheng will often make corrections or additions to a sentence after finishing it. &quot;When making a movie, you will feel that you are dedicating yourself to art. ... The art here is a false proposition. It is not art in a broad sense, but the art you think you are. When you dedicate yourself to it, you will feel very ritualistic. &quot;Every time the team we work with work hard, everyone is immersed in it, there are no bystanders. Of course, there will be a creator trap for insiders, and they may go to the other extreme, but the process is wonderful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Family education and schooling experience have shaped Zhang Xincheng’s serious and rigorous character. In middle school, he was taught to be a top student. &quot;My mother always told me not to do anything inappropriate, so I stuck to the rules most of the time.&quot; After entering the Chinese Opera, he was taught to be a good actor. He will use an academic attitude to talk about performance, how to speak lines accurately and naturally, and how to design habitual actions to distinguish characters. His rationality and prudence even allow him to design the flaws of characters, because perfect people do not exist. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Xincheng feels that he is not a very self-motivated person in nature. He is lazy and procrastinates. He is also not a person who uses rationality to choose the optimal solution. He is more willing to follow his inner thoughts of escape. After working, like all young people who are just beginning to try to be independent, he slowly freed himself from the shackles of previous disciplines and &quot;opened up&quot; himself through the profession of actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng, who views himself &quot;rationally&quot;, is more &quot;emotional&quot; in his choice of scripts. He still tends to choose tragic characters that he is more interested in, such as Cheng Yizhi in &quot;The Light&quot;, who is born like Weed, who has been tortured, has seen all the darkness and filth in the world; Pei Zhi in &quot;The Basics of Genius&quot; has been making a choice between sacrificing for his family and pursuing himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has gained an ancient Greek tragic aesthetic in these characters, &quot;Life itself is dull, but the life in the drama has ups and downs. There may be a car accident, and the life will be broken; there may be a meeting To the death of loved ones. But pain is directly proportional to happiness. During the filming process, the more pain and torture I experienced, the more happiness I felt in retrospect.&quot; In the unusual tragic experience, the perceptual switch was turned on. Open it, &quot;I can feel the emotions of the world more and start to receive signals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Equal time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s like building blocks high and then knocking them all down again. From learning to be a Since he was an actor, Zhang Xincheng has been training himself to shape characters, designing and reviewing at the same time. When filming &quot;Basic Method of Genius&quot;, he felt that these external formal things were &quot;finished&quot; and no longer needed to be done deliberately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I suddenly noticed that when I say a line, I don’t just say it to rhythm and handle it well, but to put this sentence into the opponent’s heart. Every expression and line I make, It is stimulating the opponent. All the design is not important. I feel emotional in my heart, and it naturally says it. &quot;When filming&quot; The Fire of the Dark &quot;, Zhang Xincheng played in Mandarin with dialect colors. Launch, but nothing wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The process of building, reversing and reconstruction is not peaceful, accompanied by long -term anxiety. Zhang Xincheng&#39;s debut was smooth. During school, he began to pick up, and a crew connected a crew. But he felt that he didn&#39;t have particularly distinctive characteristics, and he couldn&#39;t find one for himself. &quot;I seem to be difficult to do.&quot; Go to the reality show, and should have tried to highlight himself, but he is still habitually habitually Hard back to the ground; follow the heart when choosing the script. When the result is not satisfactory, it is inevitable to fall into myself. &quot;Isn&#39;t that ability?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Zhang Xincheng can say it frankly this year, &quot;I can&#39;t do these&quot;, I can accept all my choices frankly. &quot;I want to understand that time is equal. You haven&#39;t done that for that four months, but you did something else and got it. It&#39;s different. Just like opening a box, you can only choose one box and you can&#39;t see other boxes. You lose other boxes, but you get this one. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; After getting the sense of failure and utilitarianism, when looking back, he finally changed the passing of self -judgment to 90 points. &quot;If life lives for a result, it seems that time will become shorter. If the process is started It seems that there is a lot of things that happened again, just do everything in the process. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Zhang Xincheng knows what the its own career is: becoming a very reputable actor, not just an excellent acting skills, just an excellent acting skills, just an excellent acting skills are excellent acting skills It has commercial value and is respected, and is alone. He also misses the starting point of his career. At the age of not knowing what the filming is, he has endless energy every day. After filming, he will play with the people in the crew, holding clothes, props, and field services. &quot;I don&#39;t think I think I was stupid at that time and felt very valuable. People spent a long time to receive education and change the habit of childhood, but it would be difficult to return to the time when I was free. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Real true Paradox &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Person Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What adjectives do you use to describe yourself? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; lazy, thinking escape, and optimistic. I used to think that I was pessimistic because I often saw things badly, but I found that there may be a layer of optimism under pessimism. I thought that I would still be better, and I would still believe in some hope. Although I prefer tragedy, it is precisely because of a more optimistic kernel that I like tragedy because dare to watch. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kai style_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What do you think your most vivid character is Everyone mentioned the characteristics you think of, or do you think you have such a characteristic? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I don&#39;t think I have such a character What are your personal characteristics.

Everyone says that you have to do this and that, make you highlight yourself, and let everyone remember you. I think that will put a lot of pressure on me.

I think this is not a real self. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When acting is different, because you are not yourself, you are free. When we were young, we played a game called &quot;Grand Theft Car&quot;, racing and shooting in it. In reality, no one would do this because of moral constraints, but in the game, it is not that everyone is eager to do sin. Just say that you are the most free when you are not yourself. You play the role, you do him, but everyone doesn&#39;t think you are him, you are not &quot;you&quot;, but you are &quot;you&quot;, but the reality show must be the better &quot;you&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You often share your life on social media, what do you like to shoot, what do you like What is it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; According to my previous character, I don&#39;t like records, why do we just go forward? Now I will stop and take a few photos, and I don&#39;t know what I ’m taking it. It seems that there is a camera that is permanently preserved. I especially don&#39;t like to delete any record. So many memory is just for a certain moment in life, and I suddenly want to see it. I don&#39;t want this thing to lose. I feel like catching the time. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I like to take black and white photos, high contrast black and white, followed by photos with strong color tones. It is a flaw that it is not too restored to reality, but it is also a beauty and a sense of story.

Recently, some new energy vehicle owners have reported that charging fees at public charging piles have increased since the second half of the year. Does this situation exist? With this question in mind, reporters conducted investigations in many places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Drivers of operating vehicles are more sensitive to changes in charging fees for new energy vehicles. Master Wei is an online ride-hailing driver in Zhengzhou, Henan, because he goes to public charging stations to charge once or twice a day. His mobile phone clearly records the cost of each charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259659&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Zhengzhou Net Ride-hailing driver Wei Zhenhua: My charging fee has obviously increased. It used to be 1,200 yuan a month, but now it is as high as 1,500 yuan. It has indeed increased a lot. Especially after August, it rose by about 20 to 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charging fee at public charging piles consists of two parts: electricity price and service fee. Electricity prices have been mainly formed by the market, with &quot;level in and level out&quot; and charging pile operators are not allowed to increase prices. Prices vary in different seasons and during peak, wave, and flat periods every day. The service fee is determined by each charging pile operating company based on market conditions. During the interview, the reporter found that charging fees at public piles have increased not only in Zhengzhou but also in many cities in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new energy Co., Ltd. Henan regional director Yu Haitao: We charging companies have raised the service fee for primary charging. It has been raised by about 1 jiao to 1 jiao and 2 cents compared to the beginning of the year. So overall, everyone feels the increase in charging prices. The amplitude is relatively large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surveys show that the service fees of some charging companies have even increased by around 50%. So, why do they want to adjust the price? Some charging pile operating companies told reporters that the high cost of early investment in charging pile construction and the long-term strategy of &quot;grabbing the market&quot; for low-price operations have put them under greater operating pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An electronics company in Henan Wei Hongyu, Operations Director of Technology Co., Ltd.: The main reason for this increase is that as our operations deepen, we find that there is even a risk of inversion in the service fee income of charging stations compared to our station construction costs and our operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial reports of some charging operation companies show that although the company&#39;s operating income is rising every year, it is negative profits every year. At the same time, in order to attract more users, operators tend to build high-power charging piles. However, the basic cost of high-power charging piles is relatively high. Some also need to build additional corresponding distribution boxes, and maintenance costs will naturally increase. . Therefore, raising service fees has become the current solution to recover costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The cost of using new energy vehicles still has a greater advantage than that of gasoline vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Through interviews and surveys, the reporter found that in some cities, the rising charging costs of electric vehicles do exist. So this situation Does it happen in all cities across the country? Are the cost advantages of buying an electric car still there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During interviews and surveys in many places, reporters found that the rise in charging costs for new energy vehicles only occurred in some cities, and charging costs in most cities across the country fell into a stable range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing New Energy Car owner: There is not much increase. I have charged at several nearby charging stations. There is not much change. It is basically the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen new energy vehicle owners: The electricity price at this time is 1.27 yuan per unit. The overall cost is not particularly high and it is quite affordable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance show that from January to October this year, the number of public charging piles in my country was 728,000, and the number in October was 63,000, a year-on-year increase of 50.3%. The increase in the number of charging piles not only meets the rapid development of new energy vehicles, but also makes competition among charging pile operating companies more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A smart phone in Beijing Chen Dong, the person in charge of Technology Co., Ltd.: The overall charging price is still relatively low now, because the competition in the industry is fierce. We have more than 40 charging stations in Beijing. Winter is the peak charging season, and the overall cost has not been adjusted upwards. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that fluctuations in charging fees in most cities are the result of market supply and demand adjustments, and the quality of increases or decreases cannot be judged absolutely. Most cities have now abolished the maximum price limit on service fees, and each operator can determine the level of charging service fees based on market competition. At the same time, in the face of the issue raised by some netizens that the cost of using new energy vehicles is almost equal to that of gasoline vehicles, experts also gave reporters a calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the federation: For example, for every 100 kilometers of our oil truck, the industry requires about 10 liters of oil. We estimate that it will be calculated at about 8 yuan, which is 80 yuan. Let&#39;s look at the tram again. On average, it requires about 15 kilowatt hours of electricity per 100 kilometers. The overall consumption of each kilowatt hour of electricity plus service fees is about 1.5 yuan. So the entire 15 kilowatt hours of electricity is about 22.5 yuan. Even if it is 25 yuan, we Comparing 25 yuan with 80 yuan, it should be said that there is still a huge gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Various regions have launched new measures to shape the healthy development of new energy vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In order to ensure a good charging experience for new energy vehicle owners, various regions have successively introduced new policies such as time-of-use electricity prices for charging facilities. The implementation of relevant measures will not only guide car owners to use electricity rationally, but will also be more conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September this year, Shandong began to implement a new time-of-use electricity price policy for residents&#39; charging, which subdivided the peak and valley periods and added deep valley and peak periods. During the deep valley period, the electricity price was 0.222 yuan per kilowatt hour, which is the same as The price difference during peak hours is 0.666 yuan per kilowatt hour. By widening the price difference, users are guided to avoid charging during peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259663&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jimo District, Qingdao New energy vehicle owners: Now the electricity price in Shengu for charging at noon is only more than 2 cents per degree. If you go home and have a meal, the electricity will be fully charged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Shandong, but also Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi and other places have successively introduced time-of-use electricity price policies for residents’ electric vehicle charging facilities. During peak and peak hours, charging car owners need to bear more costs, and During off-peak periods, car owners can enjoy lower prices than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen New Energy Car owner: It is the peak period for charging now. The current price is 1.49 degrees. We usually choose to charge at noon or at night, and the price will be more favorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the continued efforts of government policies, some charging operating companies are also actively exploring new trends in future development. On the one hand, it is necessary to add new momentum to corporate operations, and on the other hand, the charging experience of car owners must also be considered. In order to &quot;stand out&quot; in the market competition, they choose to provide more comprehensive services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new person in Shenzhen Chen Huanyu, operations director of the energy company: Our service fee is only about a little more than a triangle, which is 5% higher than the service fee of surrounding operators. Our advantage is that the supporting facilities are relatively complete, which solves the driver&#39;s dining problem. To solve the problem of rest, we also have a comprehensive service area with quick car repairs, quick washes, and a comprehensive online car-hailing service platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, charging operation companies have also strengthened the level of interconnection and interoperability. In Hainan, the reporter saw that the supervision and operation service platform linked different operators together.

The access rate of the province&#39;s public charging pile platform reaches 100%.

Waking up early and staying late has become the norm. Getting up at 4 a.m. to go to the airport and returning home at 1:30 a.m. after finishing the day&#39;s activities is not an exception. Not staying out overnight is partly to take care of my young daughter’s emotions, but also to satisfy her pursuit of efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She rarely used it to catch up on sleep when flying, but still raced against time to read and think. Since 2013, she has continued to travel to campuses of all ages, TV studios, events, lectures, forums, and dining tables used for live broadcasts and writing, sharing her deep dives in the Western Pacific with the &quot;Jiaolong&quot; Scientific expedition and the experience of participating in the 34th Antarctic Scientific Expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, she only gave lectures as a scientist as a researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Over the past ten years, she has gradually been dubbed a science popularization expert because of her tireless science popularization and vivid and humorous narration. title. In the past two years, she has won important honors such as Top Ten Science Communication Figures in China, Chief Science Communication Expert, and Female Science Popularization Expert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, she spared a few hours, ate a sandwich at noon, and rushed home to prepare for the live broadcast at 4 p.m. Not long ago, she went to attend classes at universities and party schools. The topic she taught was the core of leadership from the perspective of biological evolution, from natural science to humanities and then to philosophy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;This is her usual style&lt;/span>;), recalling her hearty smile and said, &quot;There was no urine in the whole process&quot;; then she was also invited to participate in a TED speech, the theme was &quot;If your major is a transfer, you What will happen in the future?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experienced the transition from engineering to science (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Undergraduate survey technology and engineering, postgraduate geological engineering, doctoral geology&lt;/p>; span>;), Tang Limei decided to switch his research field to marine geology after listening to a lecture by chance while studying for his PhD. He realized early on that life has no limits and is full of unexpected and unplanned nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With ten years of accumulation in science popularization, she will bring a new book &quot;Exploring the Deep Sea with the &quot;Dragon&quot;&quot; at the end of 2023 to show people a new face of a science popularization writer. The book will introduce the basic knowledge of the ocean (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what is the sea, what is the ocean, how to form&lt;/span>;), the five major oceans of the world (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Newly included in the Southern Ocean in 2021&lt;/span>;)&#39;s cutting-edge knowledge, personal experience in deep-sea exploration, and the development history of the country&#39;s manned deep submersibles, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took less than half a year to write the book. She was busier than before. She didn&#39;t even have time to wash her face after getting up every morning. She said that her days now consist of only three things: work, exercise, and reading and thinking. She has been able to maintain her body shape for nearly 20 years after getting up early for a run. During the interview, she was wearing the team uniform she wore during the Antarctic scientific expedition in 2017, and it still fit her perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, there are very few pastimes, and I hardly watch movies. Everything I do must &quot;generate value and meaning.&quot; She would refuse without hesitation if asked to travel to the beach. Only when it became a matter of spending time with her children and family would she be willing to do so. &quot;I can&#39;t go out to play by myself, but I&#39;m willing to do it with others. It&#39;s valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled more than ten years ago when life was not so full. , I still have plenty of time to watch &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot;, and during the period when I went to the Pacific to &quot;isolate&quot;, I watched it intermittently nearly 20 times in total. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be so busy then. I would definitely choose to read a book now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until 2022 that she turned the content of the TV series into a class, and then she finally let go of the time wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ocean Open Class&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture content revolves around &quot;Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;Scientific trivia in the Biography&quot;, &quot;For example, there is an episode where the emperor went to An Lingrong&#39;s place to celebrate her birthday. He was very tired of eating, so he happened to get him some light pastries. Why do we eat dessert after a meal? It&#39;s because we The perception of sweetness is at the tip of the tongue, and the perception of bitterness is at the back of the tongue, and then there are other areas in the middle, such as spicy food. Therefore, we can still eat something sweet after a meal because we can feel sweetness at the tip of the tongue at the earliest. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is also braised pork, which is the Maillard reaction. Isn&#39;t the Maillard color popular this year? Maillard is actually caramel color, which is what it turns into after the sugar is burned. Color, what happens between it and braised pork is the Maillard reaction. Why do we need to add sugar? When you make braised pork, you can educate your children about science. These knowledge points are closely related to life; and why do we have oleander powder? Poisonous? I explained its formula, and then what is the most poisonous part of it? Tree trunks, leaves and flowers are all poisonous. Finally, why are these women fighting in the play? These are the backward ideas of feudal society. Let’s talk about it finally. The awakening of women in our new era includes humanistic methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that subject segmentation is actually unscientific because &quot;all knowledge is interlinked&quot; and is often lacking in the dissemination of knowledge. Not even one. She likes the title of &quot;Science Communication Figure&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s quite appropriate. Just like preaching, science is also a cognitive system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looks at everything around her with a comprehensive view of the universe and cherishes it. Curious, &quot;Actually, everything is learning. You may have thought it was entertainment before, but with a learning mentality, if you really understand the background, culture or meaning of TV series, movies and other cultural works, it is actually learning.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In her spare time during the Antarctic scientific expedition, Tang Limei also watched a few sporadic movies, including the literary film &quot;Sunset Trilogy&quot; series, which she also watched repeatedly. What attracts her is not the romantic encounter between the male and female protagonists, but the social topics that the two communicate and discuss from sunset to sunrise. &quot;In fact, the most attractive thing about it is its topic. It is not that two people are in love, they discuss They are all the destruction of society by developed countries, the infringement of weak countries, the garbage we produce now, the underlying logic of society, etc.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has also watched some of &quot;Celebrating More Than Years&quot; and she likes it. With time-travel elements, I am also planning to write some science fiction novels next, &quot;For example, two fishes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;because we humans evolved from fish (&lt;/span>;), a story of pure love that has gone through five mass extinctions, nine evolutions, and then traveled through several lives. In this long evolution, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is set in the universe. It may be based on the hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that she is in the conceptual stage, she is already very excited. &quot;It should be particularly enjoyable if I write it later. In fact, this is a process of creation. The meaning of life lies in creation. Only when you create something you love, will you feel happy and in a flow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, she participated in a training session at the Youth League School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a member of the Youth Lecturers Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since then, she has frequently given lectures in colleges and universities. She noticed that the new generation of young people are increasingly concerned about spiritual values. &quot;Public welfare must be the trend in the future. There will definitely be more and more people engaged in charity and volunteer services among the post-2000 generation, because it may be difficult for them to make a rapid economic leap from their work, so they will look for other ways. To realize your own value, engage more in charity and manual work, that is, to help others and feel happiness from the process of serving others.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will be more and more of these industries, like my daughter, What can you say to make her feel happy? It’s not that her mother went to her school and gave a speech. Everyone regarded me as an idol and worshiped me. This was a pressure for her; her happiness was similar to that once I took her to a friend&#39;s birthday party, and after she gave the butterfly she made with a twist stick to someone else, she felt sincerely happy because of the other person&#39;s gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first book has not yet been released, and it is non-stop. Tang Limei has already begun to imagine her future &quot;writing ambitions&quot;. &quot;If I publish one book every year, I can probably write 20 more in my life. I hope one or two of them will be popular science classics for teenagers.&quot; Through these words again and again. and written words. What she is committed to disseminating is not only scientific knowledge, but also &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; She hopes that her slightly tortuous but persevering experience can inspire young people and make those young faces in the audience understand, &quot;Everyone should have their own way out and live well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[吴慷仁，给自己拍拍手吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP6xETrXHQmgA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP 6xETrXHQmgA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259646&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren (Visual China) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Newcomer Wu Kangren&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren is standing in the middle of the lobby of a hotel in Xiamen, dancing and talking with people.

What I have to do at the moment is the most important, such as going out to buy things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Wu Kangren has starred in many word-of-mouth movies.

In Xiamen, young people shouted to him: &quot;Gao Jiayue, praise, praise, praise!&quot; &quot;Gao Jiayue is his character in the new drama &quot;Lifetime&quot;, and his catchphrase is &quot;Zan Zan Zan&quot;.

It has won awards at many international film festivals. Wu Kangren won this year&#39;s First Youth Award Best Actor at the Film Festival.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He received the First trophy in Xiamen, took a group photo, and then held it halfway. He was also the Best Actor in this year&#39;s First Film Festival media selection. When he heard that there were also trophies for the venue selection, he shook with joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He cherishes every recognition he gets, whether it is an award or the favor of his seniors. This is why he often plays guest roles. : To repay a favor. He made a cameo appearance as a pervert who sexually harassed a female subordinate in the TV series &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, but he couldn&#39;t find an actor for this disgusting role. Out of gratitude for the producer of the show who had taken care of him in the past, Wu Kangren took over the role. The original male lead of &quot;Copycat&quot; missed the appointment due to schedule, and the crew was at a standstill. They were in urgent need of a replacement who could be accepted by Netflix. It was Wu Kangren again. In order not to affect the follow-up film appointments, he rushed to work for 16 days in a row. He only sleeps two or three hours a day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He thanked Chen Huiling, the director of &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; many times. &quot;(To the director) jokingly said that there was no opportunity to perform in &quot;Next Stop&quot; at that time, maybe now I was still serving plates in restaurants and stuff like that, but I actually meant it. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Wu Kangren starred in the idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; as Hua Takuya, the second male lead who silently protected the heroine for many years and finally let go. He created a chapter in the history of Taiwanese idol dramas Classic: With tears in his eyes, he suppressed the sadness rushing out of his chest, and said to the heroine with a smile: &quot;Why, I was the one who met you first, but you still chose to lead him six years ago and six years later. hand. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height =&quot;1024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Next Stop, Happiness (2009) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I watched it for the first time He was surprised when he was acting, how could someone crying be so touching. I asked director Chen Huiling, and the director said it was because he was acting with his life. &quot;said screenwriter Lu Shiyuan. Wu Kangren later became the leading actor in her works &quot;The Exit Office&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us and Evil&quot;. Both of these dramas brought Wu Kangren nominations for Best Actor at the Golden Bell Awards.&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Wu Kangren, who had just quit his job as a bartender, emerged with &quot;Hua Tuoye&quot;. At the age of 27, he encountered his favorite job: acting. &quot;After acting reaches a certain stage, it is no longer for me. A way to make money for a living. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; was the last peak of Taiwanese idol dramas. Since then, Taiwanese dramas, which have been popular in Asia for ten years, have been declining. What is mutually responsible for the decline of Taiwanese dramas is that mainland TV dramas and Korean dramas gradually occupied Taiwanese TV stations, and Taiwanese dramas that lost their audience also lost the funds of the TV stations. It was also at that time that the backbone of Taiwanese dramas and future stars, such as Ethan Ruan, Zhao Youting, Chen Bolin, Ariel Ariel, Chen Qiaoen, etc., all turned to the mainland Development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newcomer Wu Kangren stayed in Taiwan and worked hard to act in his own way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Like a foreign worker&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starring &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was won by Wu Kangren.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What he saw was the synopsis of the venture capital period.

One day he was staring at his cat and suddenly felt that filming in Taiwan was out of his comfort zone, and he wanted to change places. He thought of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, so he called the director and asked if you were still filming and if you didn&#39;t plan to find me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The director also told me honestly: they do have other candidates. . But I feel that I am very sincere and can go to Malaysia a month earlier and the (remuneration) can be cheaper. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wu Kangren, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is a rare opportunity. Nowadays, professional dramas are popular in Taiwan. He has portrayed etiquette masters, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. He has also tried many unconventional characters, For example, mamasang, habitual thieves who steal women&#39;s underwear, etc. This is how he trains himself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTeBkAo528W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTe BkAo528W. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is different. The people in the film have no career difficulties. They seem unconventional and marginal, but they actually exist in Malaysia. It tells the story of a pair of undocumented foreign workers. The brothers are living an ignoble existence in an old community in Fudu where foreign workers gather. The elder brother Abang (played by Wu Kangren) was born mute, and he works hard and accepts his fate. The younger brother Adi (played by Chen Zeyao) is unwilling to bow to fate. He only wants to make money and takes his brother with him. Leave this disgusting place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Lilin is the producer of the movies &quot;Decibel Life&quot; and &quot;Lost Andy&quot;. When he was filming for &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, he observed that there were many problems in the Pudu community of Kuala Lumpur. Foreign workers, lonely elderly people, transgender people, etc. Three years later, he decided to shoot his first film with some unidentified people as the protagonists in the market of Fudu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Since &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, I have wanted to be close to these people, and I feel very strongly about them. &quot;Wang Lilin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie, from the director to the leading actors, followed the principle of &quot;really listening, seeing, and feeling.&quot; After Wu Kangren and Chen Zeyao worked in the market and learned sign language for about a month, the movie was released in Filming in Fudu has officially started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudu has a smell. The market where you work has the smell of fish, chicken and sweet fruits, and the enclosed building where you live has the smell of food, soap, sweat and Urine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, there is a close-up scene of washing hands. Wu Kangren carefully rubs each fingernail. &quot;This is indeed an action I do every day at the end of the day, because the smell on my hands is so rich. &quot;Wu Kangren said, &quot;When I smoked, I smelled the smell of offal on my fingertips, so I thought, hey, I should wash it again. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script gives branches, but the flesh and blood of the film depends on the actors themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang makes a living by killing chickens and moving goods, so Wu Kangren killed chickens that were 20 days old— —Although the director initially did not plan to shoot a scene of killing a chicken. Eggs can be found by poking the butt of a chicken, and foreign workers often eat the eggs raw. They wanted to give them to Wu Kangren several times, and Wu Kangren repeatedly said, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Although the raw eggs were not eaten, Wu Kangren brought this detail into the movie: Abang, who came home from work, carried a bag of eggs and shared them with his neighbor and his daughter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to let I am truly like a foreign worker in a rich city. Not only can I work, but I have also become black, thin and slovenly. &quot;When I first went there, I was like this now. I weighed more than 70 kilograms in vain. Don&#39;t spill the soup on me. appearance. &quot; He recalled, &quot;But when you really step into that market, you will find that everyone looks at you very differently, and you are out of place. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He imitated the state of foreign workers, unkempt, with sweat and animal blood on his body, and the look in his eyes was tired after repeating the action of killing chickens two hundred times a day. They collected money and handed over He had no energy to have more interactions with people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was killing chickens while approaching Fudu. He smoked, ate, and chatted with the foreign workers, looking at the expired passports they carried with them, and listening to their He talked about having a girlfriend or quarreling with his wife. He observed rats and said that he had never seen rats that looked like they had been trained. They ran past in groups, clanking and clanking, and dispersed like Moses parting the sea when they saw people. Together again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he felt that there were no more eyes sizing him up, he knew that he could play Abang.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From May to August 2022, Wu Kangren completed filming continuously In &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and the Hong Kong movie &quot;May I Live Forever&quot;, after four months of starvation, a 1.78 meter man lost weight to 53 kilograms. He did not want to say how much weight he had lost, after all, &quot;if the film was not filmed well , Everyone thinks that you are just thin, what&#39;s not a big deal. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/hr6yc0q5ty8zpqtmsFemejmyfhtcgmvbb XT .jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/hr6yc0q55ty8zpqtmsfemejmyf Htcgmvbxt.jpg &quot;data-key = &quot;259640&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; I hope that people will last long (2023) &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the film enters the end, Abang does not eat or drink in prison, and begged to die. Wu Kangren also fasts to make himself slumped. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; He said it was easy to fast, just to say that the skin was broken, white and smooth. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In the past few years, Wu Kangren&#39;s weight change curve of the weight and thinness of the show is a series of &quot;W&quot;, in 30 kg When the gap between the gap. When the original &quot;termites&quot; (2016) were lowered, he was a bit optimistic. Thinking of the physical change first, he could observe the change of psychology. The unexpected effect. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Before being an actor, he bleed and sweat on the construction site and got paid, so he firmly believed that he would return to the cup on the back kitchen. The same is clean, and then it even turned into his belief: I, Wu Kangren, I saw it for you on the face, as in private. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is also the same. No one knows what this acting can be obtained, but he wants to know; he tried, so he knew the power of appearance changes. &quot;I am quite glad to do this and have a lot of help to me.&quot; He said, &quot;This is irreplaceable, it is self -practice.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; dumb &lt;/strong>; &lt;/ H4>; &lt;p>; When &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; killed the youth, the crew sent Wu Kangren a cake, and he started crying when he saw the cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I can finally eat!&quot; He said that he was crying with tears, &quot;I went to eat chicken the next day!&quot; Once again, Wu Kuangren couldn&#39;t easily solve it with a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Before Abang&#39;s death penalty, the prison arranged him to meet with the mage to make a final talk. In this play, the director completely played &quot;True Listening and True True&quot;: there are only the word &quot;complaints&quot; in Wu Kuangren&#39;s script, without lines; the mage is a real monk, who has opened a photo of the Mage for more than 30 years for the death prisoner. There is no script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wu Kangren and the director have dedicated more than thirty times to try to clarify why Abang has such a strong reaction to release himself in such a situation. &quot;We can imagine that he finally has a forceful display, but I didn&#39;t understand where this power base was before.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ Image/23/11/25/pnousbga6pnrlpqfuxmeoj692wqpfd4yaarsu6is.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/cms/ Medias/Image/23/11/ 25/PNOUSBGA6PNRLPQFUXMEOJ692WQPFD4YAARSU6IS.JPG &quot;Data-key =&quot; 259641 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span s s Tyle = &quot;color: # AAA; &quot;>; &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Due to the long preparation cycle and shooting in the order of time, the actor has enough time to integrate into the role, so when Wu Kuangren heard Master Kaishi said&quot; live well &quot; Suddenly, Abon was sorrowful. &quot;It&#39;s the hardest for him to live well. We seemingly simple things are extravagant for them. So we must start from this sentence.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Abang and Adi cannot rent The house often wakes up from the dream late at night and evades the inspection; you cannot open an account in the bank, and work money in a rusty biscuit box; you can&#39;t buy a motorcycle if you can&#39;t get a driver&#39;s license, you can only take a bus or walk everywhere. Without their identities, they can only do workers in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Abang once touched love, but that was fleeting; he thought that he could be overturned by fate with his brother in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But they also have a happy moment. Abon, Adi and the transgender sister Money depended on each other -in Malaysia, the transgender people are another sense without identity -they eat together and dance together. The three people knocked on their heads on the dining table, and they were so painful and laughing. This is Wu Kangren&#39;s favorite play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得最珍贵的就是生活中的笑容。整个戏，他们笑容很少，那些生活的理所当然对他们来说太过严苛。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终， In the face of Kai Shi Master, Abang complained: I am always thinking, why I was born, I had no home, and I didn&#39;t even have a parent. I could only look at it from a distance. I am jealous of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I want to be the same. But I can&#39;t! Why do this? I want to speak, I want to be loved, but I have nothing. You call me not to give up, continue to live. I can&#39;t. I must always be careful, alert, hide, and escape. This is unfair, what I did wrong. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>;&quot; My life is terrible, I want to change my life, but Impossible. I have no future. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; These complaints are completed in sign language and expression. Those echoes that were carefully observed around, the echo of the wrist iron chain on the table, and the tears that had been turned in the eye socket for a long time, all of them made this silent complaint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Don&#39;t preach to me, I have no identity.&quot; Abang pointed to the code on his prison uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Master Kaishi suddenly held Abang&#39;s hand. Abang calmed down, tears fell, and he sobbing a difficult syllable: &quot;I want to die, I want to die, I think ...&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He looked around and found that no one could understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Abang is dumb, which is a coupling of fate. &quot;A group of people without identity, like dumb, will not change even if they speak.&quot; Wu Kangren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Zeyao, who played his brother, later saw this silent complaint on the screen, and was shocked and hurt. &quot;It turned out that Abang thought so, it turned out that he had always felt like a shadow. I couldn&#39;t help you with you Say too much inner feelings, because my heart is really painful. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Brother&#39;s farewell to that scene, Chen Zeyao instinctively expressed his emotions to his brother in sign language. &quot;I&#39;m crying, and forgot to mystery. Later, I found that everyone can feel it without talking about the lines.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Abang, next time, I said next time, I would like to protect you.&quot; Adi said. Twenty years ago, the stray Abon and Adi met on the street and became brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Wang Lilin, the &quot;Fugu Youth&quot; presenting today has achieved his expectations. &quot;I want to talk about people&#39;s emotions in the context of Fudu foreign workers. In such a cruel and oppressed society, the precious warmth and goodwill between people.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; What are the expectations of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;? &quot;We asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Don&#39;t lose money, they are so hard to shoot a film.&quot; He answered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next day, Wu Kangren sent a social media: &quot;We did a great thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/ CMS/MEDIAS/Image/23/11/25/1MJ220voe9o4Tyiqivik3kr0r0ye1alckh7wtsqflg.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 686 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/25/1mj220voe9o4tyqivik3kr0ye1alckh7wtsqflg.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259642 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Wu Kuangren&#39;s personal social media account/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Clap &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In 2016, Wu Kuangren relied on&quot; A Blue &quot; The corner of &quot;Guo Yan&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Actor. This is one of his most successful characters. He is mixed with the cynical sense of youth and vicissitudes of the life and death of war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; His award -winning speech seems to be pleading: pleading for actors more resources, and begging for TV stations to develop more different types of dramas. &quot;They (actors) are waiting, as before, waiting for me to choose me like Cao Ruiyuan&#39;s eyes, we need a little more resources to help us. Maybe we are not the most talented, but we can always be the most.

After 2019, the episodes represented by &quot;The distance between us to evil&quot; and concerned about social issues marked that the Taiwanese drama basically spent the low valley period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the above -mentioned Taiwanese dramas, Wu Kuangren all picked up the beam. From idol dramas to realism, his acting career has overlap with the ups and downs and changes in the 15 years of platform dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In terms of honesty, I would become famous because Taiwan was very lacking (filming) at that time. Taiwanese actors were not much at my age.&quot; He said in an interview with &quot;Taiwan Scales&quot; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When entering the industry, he believes that he is not good in appearance and qualifications, but &quot;effort is more important than talent.&quot; When he was doing wine insurance, he would not speak English. After finishing work in the early morning, he went to the Eslite Bookstore, which was opened overnight. Many years later, the media went to interview the owner of the bar, and the other party used &quot;life to hang life&quot; to describe Wu Kangren: to work hard for one thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has experienced a negative stage. He knew what he was doing, he paid 200 %, and he was strict with himself, and asked the people around him to work as hard as him. &quot;I used to be quite aggressive at work, so there will be rumors that Wu Kangren is difficult to engage. I only slowly realized in the past two years. This is a team work.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; But because Wu Kuangren always emphasizes efforts, It is often said that they are not talented, and few people talk about his talent as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He has beautiful eyes, and his eyebrows are affectionate, so he is good at performing the explosive moment of complex emotions; he is long than observation, and he describes many details of the old districts of Fudu. Although he is daily and serious, standing on the stage and in front of the camera, he has a lot of words and humor, and his expression and physical movements are rich. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He is confident that he can persist in acting, yearn for a good actor like Li Xuejian, but not optimistic about the actor&#39;s career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t think I have always had a play, I want to contact a lot of possibilities earlier and faster. It may not be possible to perform a film in the future, and strive to strive for fate.&quot; He thought for a while, &quot;You won&#39;t see&quot; Fugu Youth &quot;in five years. I have entered the industry for 15 years, and I saw&quot; Fudu Youth &quot;.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This is then It was why he tried a variety of unconventional characters after 2015. He wanted to know how much possibilities he had, and how to improve the performance. He went to the training class to practice vocal skills; he filmed 5 plays in 2022, and he was very solid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Perhaps because there is no agent, the film resources that Wu Kangren can come into contact with is limited. He has expressed his love for mainland art films several times, and admits that he has respected to the mainland to act in the mainland. &quot;Before you go, you have to prepare for it, not to make money.&quot; Without the agent, Wu Kangren&#39;s work decision was made by himself. After gone through a panic, he is now used to this way of working: he knows what is important, and he only needs to play a good show. He can take care of himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He yearn for Hong Kong actors in the golden age of Hong Kong films, such as Liang Jiahui, Liang Chaowei, and Andy Lau. &quot;Each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas and leaves his own position.&quot; >; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1fpdk7zj6bsxs9jb3qbmfyu7ayjgorhx.jpg&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960 &quot;Height =&quot; 1440 &quot;data-SRC = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1fpdk7zj6bsxs9jb3qbmfyu7ayjgorhx.jpg =&quot; 259647 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; Co &quot;Co Lor: #999; Text- Align: center; &quot;>; The year of life (2023) &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The title of&quot; Life &quot;is Gao Jiayue&#39;s life summary.

The first part was to welded the box naked eyes. After the work, it was white, thinking that he was going to be blind. Since then, he has worked more than 50 workers, shuttled between the 20 -story scaffolding without a helmet and a safe net, and washed dishes in a variety of restaurants to entertain guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Twenty years later, Wu Kangren was asked what he wanted to say to himself, and he replied: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;15 -year -old Wu Kuangren, what you were afraid of at that time, Nothing happened, because you didn&#39;t learn bad, and now you take good care of your mother.

At that time, due to the Anti -Japanese War, Teng Chong had a rubble in the city, and there was almost no standing house in the city. The central elementary school we read is the temple. Previously, the Japanese used it as the headquarters. Because of the strong architecture, it was stored. There were still many bullet holes on the wall pillars inside. I studied in the sixth grade school to repair the sports field, and I also dug a lot of bullet shells and bayonets for three -eighth rifle.

At that time, I read Lin Hansda&#39;s &quot;New Zhou Story of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty&quot;, &quot;New Editor of the Han Story&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;The Tai Shi who is not afraid of death&quot;, etc., and has a strong interest in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; History of Yunnan University? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; My father is a technician engaged in water conservancy projects, participating in the construction Road, ditch, and reservoirs often tell me that New China has been established. The motherland needs to be industrialized. You have to go to the study of engineering and work for modernization. My mother is a middle school teacher. In 1957, many liberal arts teachers were wronged by Tengchong No. 1 Middle School. My mother said that she could not learn arts and it was easy to make mistakes. Therefore, I always wanted to study science and engineering. Later, my mother also advocated that I was studying medicine because it was useful at any time. In high school, we were good in all subjects, but it was more prominent in liberal arts. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1962, I was in high school. After graduating from the last semester, the school divided us into three groups according to our subjects. The other group is medical and agricultural department, and the other is liberal arts. My family decided to choose a science and engineering department, but in the specific division, I was assigned to the liberal arts group under the arrangement of the class teacher, Chinese teacher, and historical teacher. At that time, I went to Baoshan, Yunnan to take the college entrance examination, and issued a volunteer book before the exam. Everyone can fill in five volunteers, and I have filled the historical departments of Peking University, Renmin University of China, Nanjing University, Fudan and Yunda, and was later accepted to Yunda. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Is the history department &quot;five years&quot;? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Our historical department has only one major in history, recruiting 32 people. Only one -half of the previous session, one third of the previous session. The curriculum arrangements are basic courses in the first, second, and third grades, such as ancient literature, politics, foreign languages, Chinese and foreign history, etc. The fourth grade is divided into &quot;specialization (group)&quot;. When I was studying, there were three specialized groups: Chinese national history, ancient Chinese economy history, and modern Chinese economic history. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At that time, he did not study well at the time. Since 1958, there have been more labor education in universities. The central government has formulated sixty articles in Gao Education, emphasizing teaching. At that time, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the student had to take a labor class in a school year, which was five weeks, and it could not exceed five weeks. But in fact, the labor of each school year is more than five weeks. At that time, there were three farms in Yunnan University, breeding rice, buds, wheat, vegetables, and Apple Parks, pig farms. In addition, there are many public welfare labor, such as planting trees on the mountain. When farmers are busy, they support the spring plowing and autumn harvest. Later, Kunming repairing the train station and calling us to help. By 1961, after investigating the Ministry of Higher Education, I felt that students had to do labor and go to school. In less than 4 years, they were less than much to learn. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Mr.? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Lin Chaomin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; When I was in college, Mr. Fang undertook the compilation of the southwest part of the national task of China. He only brought graduate students. The national history is a high -grade professional course. The fourth grade is only taught by Mr. You Zhong and Mr. Mu Qin. On April 20, 1963, Mr. Fang gave a speech at the school &quot;On the overallness of the development of Chinese history&quot;. I first met him for the first time, but because he was a Lijiang, the Naxi people, the accent was very heavy, and he didn&#39;t understand much. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But I was impressed after reading the article. In September 1966, I was studying in the senior year because the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; stopped class. The school began to criticize a large criticism and criticize reactionary academic authority. At that time, Yunda established a large critical team. There was a Chinese group and a historical group below. The historical group mainly criticized the &quot;three big mountains&quot; of the historical department. Jiang Yingliang, who represents &quot;bureaucratic capitalism, once served as the county head in the car, is now Jinghong), and the third is Yang Yan, the&quot; representative &quot;imperialist (representative of Lyon University in France). I have five or six classmates in the historical group. We have 20 borrowing cards in the critical team, and we can enter the library to check the books and read books. At this time, I found all Mr. Fang&#39;s discussion and read it again. His &quot;Inspection of Western Yunnan&quot; told him to go to Aya Mountain in Lincang to do field inspections. Very good, I didn&#39;t find any problems. I didn&#39;t write an article that criticized Mr. Fang. Instead, he has learned the social history of the frontier, the ethnic minority customs and customs, and feel that his &quot;On the Plateralness of the Development of Chinese History&quot; is a good article to maintain the unity of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Fang Guoyu (first from the left) in guiding Lin Chaoyong (second from left), in the study of Professor Fang Guoyu in March 1973.

The course has a large demand for employment. All students from modern history have been distributed to the General Political Department of the PLA. In addition, there are many people who go to the Ministry of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (now the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). At that time, Yunda&#39;s national history was the first in the country. The Ministry of Philosophy and Social Sciences studied the history of the Dai people, the history of Yi, the history of the Bai, and the history of the Naxi ethnic group. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It should be aore to graduate in July 1967, but until October 1968, our group of college students except agriculture and medicine. Outside of majors, all were arranged to go to the farm for re -education and labor exercise. The distribution did not begin in April 1970. At that time, it was stipulated that college students should achieve &quot;four faces&quot;, facing grassroots, rural areas, industrial and mining, and facing the frontiers. During the distribution, no one was willing to go to Xishuangbanna. I have read Mr. Fang&#39;s &quot;Inspection of the West of Yunnan&quot;, Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s &quot;Economic Life of Economic Life&quot; and &quot;Culture of Life Culture&quot;. Actively sign up to Xishuangbanna. In May 1970, when I arrived at Erhai County, Xishuangbanna, I was assigned to the Erhai Tea Factory as a worker. In 1972, Erhai No.1 Middle School founded a high school and needed high school teachers, but the factory did not let it go.

I read Houwai&#39;s &quot;The History of Chinese Thought&quot;, Zhao Jibin&#39;s &quot;New Exploration of the Analects of Confucius&quot;, Guo Moruo&#39;s &quot;Ten Critical Books&quot;, etc. I took notes. When I went to Erhai, I brought a &quot;Four Books&quot;. I wrote an article about Confucius&#39; thoughts in my spare time. Professor Li Yan in the department asked him to enlighten him. He handed the article to an expert in ancient Chinese thought, Professor Zhang Deguang, and Mr. Zhang recommended it to Ren Jiyu. Mr. Ren gave me a letter saying that in the remote place in Xishuangbanna, I could insist on studying Confucius, and it was not easy to write such an article, but he also proposed that my article was not enough to criticize Confucius. Mr. Ren also sent me a copy of his editor -in -chief of the History of Chinese Philosophy. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In 1972, Mr. Ren wrote to me and told me to recruit 10 graduate students in the history of Chinese philosophy.

However, Zhang Tiesheng had a white volume incident. Mr. Ren wrote to tell me that the postgraduate enrollment work stopped. In the future, the recruitment and research students must also implement the method of recommending workers, peasants and soldiers.

A lot of changes, I live in the Dai, Ladu, Brown, and Hani people. I found that I did not know their history. Later, I became a middle school teacher. Some students asked me about the question of ethnic minorities. At this time, I remembered the research of Mr. Fang Guoyu and Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s ethnic minorities.

The article treats some scholars at home and abroad as a single Han history, excluding the history of the non -Han ethnic minorities in the absurd remarks of the history of the Chinese ethnic minorities, pointing out that the development of Chinese history is always a whole, history and reality, Central Plains and the Central Plains and the Central Plains The frontier, Han and ethnic minorities, and the Chinese nation are all the whole. Chinese history refers to the history of living people living on this land, which should include all their history, and cannot &quot;change the telescopic&quot;. Chinese history has its own integrity. In the whole, no matter how many regimes occur or no matter how the politics is unified, it has not ruptured the overall. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Later, I assisted Mr. Fang to teach the local history of Yunnan. He reiterated this view in the introduction of the Lecture of &quot;Yunnan Local History&quot;. At the 70th anniversary of Yunnan University in 1983, he also instructed me to write an article called &quot;Several Issues Related to Dali 37 Alliance Oaths&quot;, which also talked about the unified problem of Chinese history through this monument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Some historians may still hold some other views on the unified historical outlook.

There was no border problem in China before. Only the relationship between Huaxia and Siyi was that Huaxia and Siyi &quot;the five parties&quot; and &quot;the world unified, Huayi Infernal Affairs&quot; was a whole from central to local. Even in the division period, regardless of the Han noodles and ethnic minorities, they pursue the &quot;unity of the world&quot; and regard the dynasties they have established as the orthodox of China. Economic, political, and cultural structure. Because of the long -term common life of all nations, it has long formed a complementary and unified production lifestyle, breeding the Chinese civilization with very inclusive and absorbing, making the Chinese nation form a strong internal agglomeration based on &quot;commonality&quot;. Even during the division period, this production lifestyle has not changed, the political system has not changed, the overall consciousness has not changed, and the culture has been continuing. This is the national view of the &quot;unification&quot; and the overall consciousness of the Chinese nation in the national view and national view. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Modern border research has begun to rise because of the east of Western colonialism. The first is the &quot;frontier&quot; in politics. Many places in history are divided into a process of development. For example, Yunnan was Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty. In the tenth year of Zhenyuan (794), the Yunnan Activity Division was established. It is a local regime. Dali is also a local regime of autonomy. In 1253, Mongolia was settled in Dali. In 1274, the Yuan Dynasty established a province in Yunnan. The Yuan Dynasty also established a Burmese province, and later was placed under the management of Yunnan Province. It is a toast land in Yunnan Province. After the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, in 1961, the border between China and Myanmar was officially determined. China erected the first monument of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the border of Tengchong. It means that we formally respect the boundary of international law, which is the frontier in international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; and the culture of the culture, such as the culture of the Chinese Dai people and the culture of northern Myanmar. At this time, although there is a political boundary, But in fact, everyone&#39;s culture and history are the community of destiny. Therefore, from the country, the overall nature of the Chinese nation should be regarded as a community from abroad. In China, we maintain China&#39;s overallness and national unity. Internationally, we build a community of human destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral dissertation entitled&quot; The Anti -Bei Tingdu Mansion and the Western Border of the Tang Dynasty &quot;, taken in 1985.

At that time, there were historical teachers. pit&quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Students&#39; thoughts are not very stable, so I put forward a point of view that history seems useless, but useless is useful. I told the students that the classroom tables, chairs, benches, doors and windows, and electric lights are useful, but this space is not available, but without this space, tables, chairs, benches, and electric lights have nowhere to place them. History is human time and space. I can&#39;t see it, I can&#39;t touch it, but it can&#39;t be separated at all times, and it is useful anytime, anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Later In 5 days, I filled out the application form every night and stated at the review meeting that Yunnan University is a frontier university, and many aspects are not as good as Peking University and Fudan. National unity is irreplaceable by other schools. The characteristics of Yunda History are the frontiers and ethnic groups, and no school cannot be replaced. In this way, in 1987, Yun Da became one of the 10 bases. The base class has brought new opportunities to Yunda. The state invests 300,000 construction funds for the base class each year, and more than half of students can be used to pay for study.

The Education Commission of Yunnan Province, the Education Commission said that the ethnic academy was run by the National Academy. One province should not have two ethnic ministries, but in the end, it was not completed. Later, I rewritten the report to apply for the establishment of an anthropology. In 1987, the State Education Commission approved Yunda to open a human major. We are the second anthropology major in national universities. The first one is Xiamen University, and the first one is the Department of Anthropology. In 1988, we recruited the first batch of undergraduates. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; After the Antharmaceutic specialty in 1988, I started planning to apply for sociology. In July 1939, Wu Wenzao founded the Department of Sociology at Yunda. By 1954, the Department of Sociology was revoked. At that time, the director of the department was Mr. Yang Yan. In 1984 and 1986, I visited Mr. Yang twice in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. I brought his opinions back to the school and reported to the leaders. Although I was ignored, I kept in my heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In October 1990, I visited the United States to study. I know that social work majors are a professional in society. Social development will bring many problems. Social workers come to deal with solutions. No matter the poor and the rich have social problems. After returning to China, I went to some universities to learn about social work. A characteristic of their social work is to help vulnerable groups, help poor people, unemployed, disabled people, etc. I told the school when I came back. Social work major. At that time, most people at the School Academic Affairs Office did not know what social work was, and I explained over and over again.

We study history, the purpose is to create the future. Develop forward, only when you ask history; can you create the future if you learn from history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; /p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:oraange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // Feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:Aaving&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[徐卓媛：因为喜爱去攀登]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261243]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-26 08:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/JLH4ULKDEV5I0WJZAQUR3AL4838VCTWVTFIMEXL.JPG &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 719 &quot;&quot; height = &quot;960&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm/medias/i MAGE/23/11/22/JLH4ULKDEV5I0WJZAQUR3AL4838VCTWVTFIMEXL. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259209 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Picture by Honor 100 Series Shooting/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In mid -May 2023, after nearly 10 hours of difficult climbing, Changsha girl Xu Zhuoyuan successfully reached Mount Everest. Four years ago, she shouted &quot;I want to board Mount Everest&quot; in a variety show. Four years later, at the age of 16, she fulfilled her promise with practical actions and became the youngest in China who reached the top of Mount Everest from the southern slope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Affected by his father, Xu Zhuoyuan began to contact climbing when he was very young. When she was 4 years old, her parents took her to climb the Simuashan, and unexpectedly found that she had a good adaptation to Gao. At the age of 12, she traveled to Tibet with her father Xu Jianglei. At that time, she regretted that she did not see Everest&#39;s sunrise due to the weather. On the way back, she climbed the Dafeng of Simuashan with her father. &quot;It was the first time that I really climbed a snowy mountain.&quot; Since then, the desire to climb the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mountaineering is the extreme movement of Xiang Yang&#39;s luck. Since the contact with climbing, her emotions have become more stable. P>; This climbing six months ago was Xu Zhuoyuan&#39;s first challenge to Mount Everest. Before the start, she installed her father Xu Jianglei&#39;s gloves to the top of Mount Everest, hoping as &quot;a kind of inheritance.&quot; In 2007, Xu Jianglei reached the top of Mount Everest and became the first person in Hunan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Xu Zhuoyuan remembers that he was approaching the peak, the Charba guide beside him reminded her to reach the top. On the sunrise, my father&#39;s top photos have been impressed. In the photo, he was full of style, and he laughed very brightly in the sun. I can feel his love for the snowy mountains. That photo is still on my house so far Fortunately, the sun came out almost at the moment she reached the summit. Now, the photos of her father are discharged by the photos she reached, and behind her is the rising sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kai style_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot; &quot;&quot; >; At the age of 12, you said &quot;I want to board Mount Everest&quot; in a program.

On the summer when I graduated from a 12 -year -old elementary school, my dad took me into Tibet, but at the time, I didn&#39;t see Rizhao Jinshan because of the weather. Later, my father and I went to climb the Dafeng of Simuashan together. This is the first time I really climbed a snowy mountain. At that time, the mountain was snowing. As a southerner, I felt very novel. Since then, I have very much hope to have the opportunity to climb Everest to watch the sunrise. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; After the target of 12 years old, Dad dad was after the target of 12 years old, Dad&#39;s father, his father, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

Feeling humiliated and excited at the same time, he opened the first page of the computer document and read &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; in enlarged font size. Below it were two lines of small characters, original work: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wants to adapt this novella published in 1988. The perpetrators of the three murders all pointed to madmen, but they could not build a complete chain of evidence to bring him to justice, which made both the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe uneasy. Writer Yu Hua&#39;s parody of detective novels in the avant-garde literature period used violent absurdity as the surface and subversion of tradition as the core. I have sold the copyright several times but have never changed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficult thing is to find a word that points to the philosophy behind all suspenseful stories. In 2021, Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei entered the second year of their adaptation. After overturning the general direction twice, they were determined to find the word. They searched for two days and two nights, wandering around the house until they got something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Bug.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new development. &quot;It is a word born from the progress of information technology. It is a vulnerability problem based on code and the best rational logic. We think it is too accurate. , isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this one is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was August 2021, and Wei Shujun was preparing to shoot a new film in Northeast China &quot;White Crane Spreads Wings&quot;. After work, the crew plays badminton together. However, indoor venues have been closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they are planning to play basketball outdoors instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month ago, his second feature film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; was selected for the Directors&#39; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival; a year ago, his first feature film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was nominated for the Cannes Newcomer Award. As a feature film director, his graduate work &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; won the Cannes Short Film Special Mention Award. He received critical acclaim when he first appeared on the scene. Industry seniors and critics praised his talents and talents, and were curious about the possibilities he brought to the table. sex. Wei Shujun received attention as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the adaptation of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. Bugs do not exist alone. To describe rational loopholes and loss of control, the premise is to explain what rationality is. The argument about rationality is a wide-ranging, academic discussion that is energy-consuming and unnecessary. &quot;We looked in the wrong direction again,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By chance, while scouting locations in Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;The causes of their deaths are not completely connected on a rational level and cannot serve to solve the case. But in the dream, they interlock with each other, as if they are all established, revealing a certain inevitability in a series of accidents, giving people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, dreams became the core sequence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seems to be his consistent creative approach, which values ​​the true feelings of the creative subject and expresses them effectively in the film. Photography director Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We basically create based on our feelings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met for the first time in Shanghai three years ago, and they chatted quite well. . They have many consensuses on the nature and creative concepts of movies, two of which are simple but very important: movies were created to create &quot;realistic illusions&quot; at the beginning, and they should still be so today, and movies may not be the best way to tell stories. It is a medium, but it is a channel for storing and transmitting the creator’s feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, regarding &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot;, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it was restrained, quiet, and elegant, and that many things happened on a humid and rainy day. This was how he felt when reading the novel. Accordingly, Cheng Ma felt that the images should be consistent with the 1990s, when the characters were wandering and out of place, and geographical features such as counties or towns were far away, not close. Cheng Ma suggested shooting on 16mm film, and they hit it off immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, with 45 days left before filming, the crew arrived in Nanfeng, Jiangxi Province, where the filming took place, to make preparations. The actors were busy with their own work. Tong Linkai had to practice splits and back fists. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket to visit the local police and gained 30 pounds to achieve an overworked figure. Zeng Meihuizi was also making herself gain weight in order to look like a孕妇。 The crew cooked together, watched movies, and played badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think the best state of creation is when all the main creators are relaxed. I don’t like that kind of tense, night-and-night (state) like a repair project, which is very tiring. That is to say, although it is You are working, but you still have your own life order, and you still retain your pursuit of beauty and passion for life.&quot; Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often carries a film camera with him - the crew has a total of more than 20 film cameras, and even a darkroom for developing black and white photos - to capture the daily life of the crew. There are more saved in the photo album on his mobile phone. When he opens it and looks through it, he sees friends meeting, travel scenes, rivers, trees, and the sea. “It seems to have some kind of ability to leave time behind, making you think of it as a pleasant time.” In the afternoon, a happy state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relaxation is rare. What is also rare is that, in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun places a particularly high importance on creation. &quot;As a director of his age, he can actually withstand a lot of pressure. We have to shoot smoothly, but many people ask us what to do with the scenes and what to do with the actors&#39; time. For example, a certain role has many scenes, but the actors can only come for 10 days in total. , the usual approach of the crew is to focus on filming all his scenes in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that smooth filming is of great value to his creation, so he will give up scenes that cannot be matched by actors or at inappropriate times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has an almost intuitive ability to control the scene. I always told him, you shine on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his character&#39;s name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s subordinate is Xiao Li, a young man who takes the initiative to report case analysis from time to time. So of course Tong Linkai’s name is Xiao Li. After a few days of filming, Wei Shujun suddenly said, thank you so much &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Thanks&quot; means shit)&lt;/span>;, don&#39;t call me Xiao Li. Just call me Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and revised his lines. The printed police officer ID card of Xiao Li was re-attached. Tong Linkai&#39;s role became Xiao Xie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to be honest, the feeling at the scene was not that wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;Imagine that when you were in school, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 a.m. every morning to study early. On the way from home after breakfast, you felt that you were still waking up. When you got to class, you thought about writing yesterday&#39;s homework. No, I didn’t write it, so I wrote it quickly. After I wrote it, I felt very at ease. I started to think about going to the canteen to buy something to eat during recess, and then I went to the actual class to listen to the teacher. It was the same on the set, everyone was here, Shui After brewing it, we started drinking water. We walked around the scene and the actors were almost done. Then we discussed the scene and confirmed our schedule with the photographer. Everyone prepared individually and then started to prepare for shooting. If something didn’t feel right in the first two days, Adjust it, and it feels good. If you take a few more shots, it will be time for lunch. It really feels like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a slope every day, and you have to climb up a slope. You have to crawl over to get to that position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; was completed accurately and efficiently, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the Cannes Film Festival. Five months later, it won two honors: Best Film and Cinephile Choice at the Pingyao International Film Festival. After another four days, it was released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, there was often chatter in the theater. Wei Shujun used a long dream to allow Ma Zhe to reveal himself in order to resolve his own uneasiness and chaos. The dream was clear, coherent but illogical. After witnessing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on an old cinema seat and saw the director on the big screen holding a ping pong ball with the number 3 printed on it, shouting at him. ——Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this shot where conjecture and prophecy overlap, thousands of ping pong balls roll down from the bottom of the screen and swarm towards Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone was very excited during the shooting. After taking one shot, everyone picked up the thousands of ping pong balls while shouting &quot;One more, another one&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the show, the audience was full of doubts and endless interpretations and comments about the film, forming multiple dreams outside the screen, a kind of &quot;rationality and irrationality, the combination of the viewer and the viewer.&quot; effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s initial uneasiness when reading the novel, his exploration of the creator&#39;s intentions, and his several elusive moments during the adaptation were all conveyed to the audience. We think we have the answer, but in fact we have the illusion of an answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not too obsessed with pursuing the truth in life, because I feel that it is difficult to find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun that the truth is difficult to find, &quot;the so-called The fate of your life is a random existence. You can only see its existence and don’t know the truth behind it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slight existentialist tendency of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is just that Back to &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, or in other words, &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;. Just reiterate one point, &quot;I believe that I &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(creator)&lt;/span>; has determined the sole right of interpretation, and the audience must accept this interpretation Right, this is the biggest paradox.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the movie was released, Wei Shujun sent a message to Yu Hua, saying that it seems that we did not use a movie to write annotations for the novel, but used the movie to write an annotation for the novel. Thoughts after reading. For a while, the two of them were keen to share with each other the audience&#39;s various interpretations of the movie, including a test paper on &quot;Who understands the movie &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; better, Yu Hua or me?&quot; After Yu Hua finished, he showed Wei Shujun his score, which totaled 40 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Zhang Yuxin for your help.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
