That scenery is my hometown in a previous life. This feeling is very strong and real.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1980, this feeling became the creative inspiration of Shinji Tanimura. He wrote his most famous masterpiece &quot;Subaru&quot; (also called &quot;Subaru&quot;) in the future. In China, fans are accustomed to (called &quot;Star&quot;): I closed my eyes, my heart was at a loss, I looked up sadly, my eyes were full of desolation, there was only one road leading to the wilderness... I will travel far, see you again, the Pleiades hang high! ——The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation Taurus and consists of more than 3,000 stars. It is extremely bright in the night sky and is especially dazzling in autumn and winter. The brighter ones form the Pleiades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 1980, this song was included in the album of the same name. On the album cover, a line of light and shadow cuts across the darkness. Half of Tanimura&#39;s body is buried in the darkness, and half of his body stretches out from the light. He nods slightly, eyes fixed forward, and is ready to go. This song has a melancholy tone, bleak lyrics, and sad images, but its perspective is bright. After the song came out, it became very popular in Japan and sold more than 600,000 copies. In 1987, Shinji Tanimura participated in Japan&#39;s annual &quot;Red and White Song Festival&quot; for the first time, singing &quot;Subaru&quot;, and the TV ratings exceeded 63%. Since then, he has participated in the &quot;Red and White Song Gala&quot; for many years and has become a veteran singer in this most representative show at the end of the year in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1980, the ATV TV series &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot; was launched. In early 1981, singer Guan Zhengjie included the Cantonese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his TV original soundtrack album &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot;, with lyrics written by Zheng Guojiang . In 1982, Teresa Teng sang the Japanese and Cantonese versions of &quot;Star&quot; at the Elizabeth Stadium concert in Hong Kong. As a result, this song became popular in southern China and radiated to the north. Singer Shen Xiaocen included the Japanese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his second album. Since then, this song has been covered by singers such as Alan Tam, Xu Xiaofeng, Feng Feifei, Han Baoyi, and Cheng Lin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend told Shinji Tanimura that the picture in his mind seemed to depict Northeast China, so going to China became his dream. &quot;I have always wanted to visit China, but I don&#39;t know why. But I know that as long as I go, I will understand why I want to go to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2004 On November 5, 2019, Shinji Tanimura participated in the &quot;Jewel Heart&quot; Shanghai Concert&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, Tanimura Shinji participated in the &quot;Hand in Hand Beijing&quot; concert held at Beijing Workers&#39; Stadium with Chinese singers. He recalled that as soon as he landed at the Chinese airport, he felt like going home. &quot;Even the earthy smell that hit my face felt very familiar. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert lasted for two days. At this time, pop music was in its infancy in China. The tens of thousands of spectators in the work hall sat in silence, with no applause or cheers. They were used to the warm live atmosphere in Japan. Tani Cun was very uncomfortable with it. He and the members of his rock band Alice tried every means to mobilize the audience. After they sang a rhythmic song, people in the venue stood up and applauded continuously. Shinji Tanimura was very excited: &quot;Everyone feels the same about music, and music has no national boundaries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He sang &quot;Subaru&quot; live. This was the beginning of his singing reaching the ears of Chinese audiences. So far, nearly 50 of his works have been adapted into Chinese songs, including Leslie Cheung&#39;s &quot;Who Resonates&quot; (adapted from &quot;Like a Dream&quot;), Anita Mui&#39;s &quot;Walking Alone&quot; (adapted from &quot;This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;trial&quot;) &quot;), Jacky Cheung&#39;s &quot;The Distant Her&quot; (adapted from &quot;Romantic Railway&quot;), Priscilla Chan&#39;s &quot;Forgetting Sorrow&quot; (adapted from &quot;Autumn Stoppers&quot;)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254294&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2007 On September 20, in Nantong, Jiangsu, at the opening ceremony of the 9th China Asian Arts Festival and the Gala &quot;Under the Same Starry Sky&quot;, Shinji Tanimura sang &quot;Flower&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2001, Shinji Tanimura, who was already successful, came to the Yellow River specifically to try to find similar feelings from his childhood, but found nothing. From this, he became more certain that the scene should be near Heilongjiang in Northeast China. Tanimura said with a smile: &quot;Maybe I was Chinese in my previous life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China suffered from the SARS epidemic. In order to help China fight against SARS, Shinji Tanimura held a &quot;Concert to Support China in Fighting SARS&quot; in Osaka and donated all the 15.34 million yen (approximately US$120,000) raised to the Red Cross Society of China. After SARS ended, he flew to China and held a concert to thank medical workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, Teng Junjie, the chief director of the opening and closing ceremonies, invited Tanimura to perform on stage at the opening ceremony, and Tanimura agreed. For this reason, he canceled several performances in Japan and made compensation. On the evening of April 30, 2010, at the Shanghai World Expo Cultural Center, Asian girls walked out from both sides holding stars in their hands. They complemented the lights of the audience and seemed to stretch out into a galaxy. Shinji Tanimura, China&#39;s overseas promotion ambassador for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, brought the audience to the audience. The familiar classic song &quot;Subaru&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teng Junjie and Tani Cun have been friends for nearly 20 years. He recalled in an interview: &quot;When Abe and Koizumi were in office, (Japan) had trouble getting along with China, he went directly to Koizumi and told him that his attitude towards China must change. Japan must stand with China, and we two Asian countries must Take this responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura is very willing to spend time face-to-face with young Chinese people. In March 2004, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music hired Shinji Tanimura as permanent professor of the Department of Music Engineering and consultant of the Sino-Japanese Music Culture Research Center. This job lasted until 2008. While serving as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shinji Tanimura spent one week every month in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of Tanimura&#39;s class is &quot;How to express music.&quot; Start with the lyrics first. A reporter visited his class. Tanimura entered the classroom, first put half a glass of water on the table, pushed the glass over, and the water came out. He asked the students to write lyrics about it. He left the classroom for 20 minutes and came back to check. The lyrics of a classmate impressed him deeply: When water flows outside, water never knows what its own shape is... &quot;The most important thing is the inner feeling. Only there are people, and I am. If people want to be connected, music is The best medium. Music can best enter people&#39;s hearts, resonate and move, and hearts can meet.&quot; Shinji Tanimura told the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspiration and core of the song &quot;Subaru&quot; became one of the important narratives of Shinji Tanimura&#39;s future life. As written in the song, he has always felt that &quot;starlight leads the way.&quot; When the 32-year-old Tanimura composed this song, he had no idea of ​​its vast magic, which could transcend time and travel through space, and continue to echo throughout his artistic career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, Japan&#39;s economy was developing rapidly, giving people the illusion that as long as they had money, they could buy everything. But this song tells people: truly precious things need to be felt with the heart. Care, tenderness , consideration, love, etc., these invisible things are crucial to us.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 40 years, he has performed and visited various Asian countries and often heard local people singing this song, regardless of gender, young or old. The other person even thought it was the song of his own country. He was once asked: &quot;Do you know this song?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;Subaru&quot; is the key to opening the door to all Asia and can connect everyone together. .&quot; Tanimura said, &quot;There is no doubt that &quot;Subaru&quot; changed my life. This song took me on a magnificent journey.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;589&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254293&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shinji Tanimura and Teresa Teng Singing on the same stage &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Showa &quot;Legendary&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On September 21, 2018, Shinji Tanimura, who was almost 70 years old, held the &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the age of 25, Tanimura&#39;s hairline began to recede, and he began to grow a beard to achieve visual balance on his face. Nearly 45 years have passed, and his works have stayed at a certain point like his hairline, becoming synonymous with his achievements. And his voice is inevitably aging like his hair color. His beard and hair are all white. Even if he sings &quot;Pleiades&quot; with exactly the same arrangement, you can hear the decline in function, but there are gains and losses. At this time, It has the mellowness and sweetness given by age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura Shinji grew up and became famous during the Showa period, and he has obvious Showa characteristics. Shinji Tanimura appears in public and has a decent image. He always had a smile on his face, and his eight teeth were gleaming white. He is diligent, confident, vigorous and friendly, and uses subtle strokes to outline the complexity of the grand narrative. Since his debut, he has held 3,620 concerts in Japan and is still the number one in Japan. He has released 63 albums and 62 singles, with a total sales volume of more than 30 million. He is called the godfather of the Japanese music industry. In the media description, he always promotes Sino-Japanese friendship from the bottom of his heart, cultivates young people with full expectations, and pours his blood into music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps partly due to the language barrier, Chinese reporters said his voice was soft and slow. If you don’t prick up your ears to distinguish it carefully, it may even be masked by the sound of the indoor air conditioner. &quot;People are as quiet as songs.&quot; But if you listen to his works and understand his experience, both the premise and the conclusion of this sentence will be invalid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, Shinji Tanimura was born in Osaka. When he was a child, he was overweight and was nicknamed &quot;Fat Pig&quot; by his classmates. His self-esteem was greatly affected. When he was in elementary school, he heard singer Xiao Linxu singing &quot;Migratory Bird&quot; in a performance. He was attracted by Xiao Linxu&#39;s gesture of strumming the guitar and started learning guitar, deciding to regain his confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, he formed the band Rock Candie with his classmates. Their style was more country folk and their rebellious playing style made the audience feel novel. In 1970, this band held an &quot;American Continent Tour&quot;. They first arrived in Vancouver. Because they were too poor, they had to take a bus across the North American continent all the way to New York. After ten days of tossing, they finally reached their destination. In New York, Shinji Tanimura watched a local rock performance. He shed tears at Janis Joplin&#39;s performance, &quot;It turns out that music still has such a possibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, He formed a new band, Alice, but the band&#39;s American blues style was not accepted by the Japanese audience. Alice had to perform in various places to meet daily expenses and continue her acting career. During her frequent performances, Alice set a record of holding 303 concerts a year. As the band&#39;s popularity expanded in various places, their songs such as &quot;Winter Thunder and Lightning&quot; and &quot;The Pledge of Tears&quot; also gradually became popular. In 1978, they became the first group of Japanese artists to successfully hold a three-day concert at Nippon Budokan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2018, in Beijing, Shinji Tanimura held the &quot;38 Years of Stars&quot; concert &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 1974, Shinji Tanimura&#39;s first solo album &quot;蜜&quot; was released. He wrote the lyrics and music for the entire album. One year later, in December, Tanimura Shinji released his second solo album &quot;Umimako&quot;. In this quiet work, there are many shining works, such as &quot;Port Lights&quot;, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, &quot;Warmth&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;The Road of Sand&quot;... After entering the 1980s, Tanimura produced more and more excellent works. In the 1990s, the theme song &quot;Fengzihuaden&quot; of Toei animation &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; was released, and &quot;Hometown&quot;, a collaboration with singer and actor Yuzo Kayama... are all Widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura’s life is very interesting. After a concert, he once walked into a small bookstore and offered himself to collect money for the store manager while he was having dinner. Fans who come to the bookstore after listening to Tanimura&#39;s concert will receive an oncoming surprise when paying. In Japanese variety shows in the 1990s, he was experienced, relaxed, unencumbered, and spoke humorously. One second he was not ashamed to share his embarrassing story with the host: due to a bad gastrointestinal condition, the stool collapsed in his pants when he farted; the next second he picked up the guitar and taught them his valuable experience in the music industry for many years: the most important thing is the song Express your heart, not whether it can be passed down to the world or how many people will sing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his later years, Tanimura conducted a deeper exploration of musical expression. The subtleties of his singing have been accurate to every modal word. In the song &quot;Woo Hu&quot;, he poured different techniques into each &quot;ah&quot; to achieve the emotions he expected, such as the feelings in his heart that he wanted to suppress but couldn&#39;t. Sigh while staying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Tanimura held a concert &quot;Commemorating the 45th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan - 2017 Shinji Tanimura&#39;s 45th Anniversary of His Performing Career in Shanghai&quot; at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the scene, a beam of chasing light hit the side of the stage and enveloped an empty chair. The prelude of &quot;Restaurant Corner&quot; sounded, and on the other side of the stage, Tanimura picked up the microphone and said: &quot;Next, I will sing a set of narrative love songs for everyone...&quot; &quot;Narrative Love Songs&quot; is his new attempt ——&quot;Explain&quot; the ins and outs of creating the song at the beginning of each song by chatting and heart-to-heart with the audience. In a set of five &quot;narrative love songs&quot;, Tanimura uses the woman&#39;s mood and the man&#39;s perspective to connect the ups and downs of love emotions, just like a love short film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To commemorate the &quot;two 45th anniversaries&quot;, Tanimura released a set of three albums called &quot;Standard&quot;, each with 15 songs, for a total of 45 songs. The first album is representative works selected from the songs he composed; the second album is taken from Alice&#39;s period works; and the third album is Japanese classic songs sung by him. His criteria for selecting tracks to enter this album are: &quot;Children 100 years from now will think that these works are indeed classics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These tracks are also arranged in the order of the ups and downs of life and the ups and downs of emotions. The first part is full of ambition, and in the end there will be a starry reverie like &quot;Pleiades&quot;: &quot;A person&#39;s daily life must be ups and downs, but he will not stick to these emotions and feelings every day. Life and music have something in common . I want to reflect the ups and downs of life into music... Even if the melody on the stage is occasionally sad and disappointing, it must be exciting and upward in the end!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 28, 2018, The &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert in Beijing became Shinji Tanimura&#39;s last public performance in China. On October 8, 2023, Shinji Tanimura died of illness at the age of 74. The funeral was held on October 15, with only close relatives in attendance. On October 16, the news of his death was made public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Comprehensive reports from Global Figures, The Paper, Xinmin Evening News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2023年前8个月基本医保基金收入同比增长9.3%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258746]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Medical Insurance Administration recently released data showing that from January to August 2023, the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance ) total revenue was 2.092333 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the income of the basic medical insurance fund for employees (including maternity insurance) was 1.473806 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 13%; the income of the basic medical insurance fund for urban and rural residents was 618.527 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that from January to August 2023, the total expenditure of the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance) was 1.786477 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 18.3%.

In the history of the Nobel Prize, it is the class with the second most female winners and the second highest proportion. In 2009, there were the most female award winners, with 5 women winning the award, accounting for the highest proportion of 38% (5/13, a total of 13 people won the award that year). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year’s four female winners are Katalin Karikó, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Anne L’Huillier, the Physics Prize ); Narges Mohammadi for the Peace Prize and Claudia Goldin for the Economics Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, the achievement that won the economics prize was the study of gender differences. US economist Claudia Goldin was awarded the prize for her research on key drivers of gender differences in women&#39;s participation in the labor market. The award citation said her research &quot;has advanced our understanding of women&#39;s labor market outcomes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In layman’s terms, Goldin won the award for studying why women’s income is not as good as men’s. This can be seen as the gender difference in labor remuneration between men and women. Gender differences exist in all aspects of social life, and even the winning of Nobel Prizes has huge gender differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Golding not only studies the difference in income between men and women, but even after winning the award, he complained that there were more men than women in the economics prize. She said that &quot;serious inequality still exists&quot; between men and women in the Nobel Prize in Economics. Indeed, Goldin is the third female economist to win the Economics Prize. From 1969 (the Nobel Prize in Economics began to be awarded in 1969) to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded 55 times, with a total of 93 winners, of which women account for only 3.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the Nobel Prize comprehensively from the statistical data on the official website of the Nobel Prize, the gender gap between men and women winning prizes is also quite disparate. From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize was awarded a total of 621 times, with 970 individuals and 30 organizations (groups) winning the prize, and a total of 1,000 people and organizations winning the prize. Among them, 65 are women. Looking at individual proportions, the proportion of women is about 6.7% (65/970). However, if we take into account that Marie Curie won the prize twice (in 1903 for Physics and 1911 for Chemistry), only 64 women won the prize, so the actual proportion is 6.6% (64/970). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the various Nobel Prize categories, due to wars and various reasons, different Nobel Prize categories in history have had different awards and number of winners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded 114 times, with a total of 227 winners, of which 13 were women, accounting for 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Physics Prize was awarded 117 times, with 225 winners, of which 5 were female winners, accounting for 2.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chemistry Prize was awarded 115 times, with 194 winners, of which 8 were female winners, accounting for 4.1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Literature Prize was awarded 116 times, with 120 winners, of which 17 were female winners, accounting for 14.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Peace Prize has been awarded 104 times, with 141 winners, of which 19 were female winners, accounting for 13.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the six awards, the highest proportion of female winners is the Literature Award, which is 14.2%, and the lowest is the Physics Award, where women account for 2.2%. The economics prize that Golding complained about is considered good. Women account for 3.2%, which is not the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is the proportion of female winners so low? Looking at the total number, they only account for 10.3%. In this regard, Goldin analyzed that the reasons why women earn less than men can also be used to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Goldin believes that there are many reasons for the gender pay gap, such as gender discrimination, she coined a term - greed for work to explain it, believing that this is the main reason. Greedy work is when a person works longer hours or has less control over their hours and is paid disproportionately more per hour, effectively penalizing women who need to seek flexible labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this situation also creates a lose-lose situation for both sexes. For men, they give up time with their families, while for women, they often give up their careers. The essence is that many jobs pay much higher hourly rates when working longer hours, being on call, busy schedules, evenings and weekends, or unpredictable hours. However, in most couples who are highly educated, have careers and children, the woman is the on-call professional at home, and the man is the on-call professional at work. Therefore, men earn more than women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason behind this is that women have to have children and take care of the family, so they have less time to work, and of course their income is less than men. If this reason is used to explain why women have only accounted for 10.3% of Nobel Prize winners over the past 100 years, it is also valid. Because women devote less time to work and research than men, this prevents them from achieving higher achievements in different fields and therefore winning Nobel Prizes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever career and work achieve results, one is talent and the other is diligence. There may be different opinions on the proportion of the two, but it cannot be denied that diligence is the most important factor in producing results. factor. &quot;A person who is capable of one thing can benefit himself by a hundred, and a person who is capable of ten can benefit himself by a thousand.&quot; This is the true meaning of it. As long as you engage in a job or profession, and persevere over a long period of time, practice makes perfect and results will come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The importance of professional perseverance can also be seen from the history of the Nobel Prize. As long as women participate in scientific research and work, the chances and number of awards will increase. From 1901 to 1925, 4 women won the award; from 1926 to 1950, 8 women won the award; from 1951 to 1975, 3 women won the award; from 1976 to 2000, 15 women won the award Award-winning, from 2001 to 2023, 35 women won the award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, in the 50 years from 1901 to 1950, 12 women won the award, but in the 22 years from 2001 to 2023, 35 women won the award. This not only shows that the number of female award-winners has increased with the development of the times, but also shows that modern women’s large-scale participation in work and scientific research is an important reason why they can achieve the same results and win awards as men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These explanations and facts are also reflected in Golding&#39;s research. In her latest book, &quot;Career and Family: Women&#39;s Centennial Journey to Equality,&quot; she mentions the impact of multiple factors on women&#39;s careers, such as the history of women&#39;s pursuit of careers and families, coeducation in higher education, and the impact of birth control pills on women&#39;s careers. The impact of women&#39;s career and marriage decisions, women&#39;s married surnames as a social indicator, and the reasons why women make up the majority of undergraduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin analyzes more than two hundred years of data to demonstrate how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates have changed, such as the use of birth control pills, which has provided new insights into women&#39;s career plans. opportunities, giving them more time and opportunity to work and participate in scientific research, so that they can achieve the same results as men, and these results may win the Nobel Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, receiving higher education, participating in work and scientific research are important foundations for women to gradually win more Nobel Prizes and increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[独臂船长徐京坤和他的超级赛船丨封面人物]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258546]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pLrtLJOg8Ig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pL rtLJOg8Ig. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, at Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center, Xu Jingkun sailed a sailboat out to sea&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2021, Xu Jingkun decided to buy a super racing boat to participate in the 2024 Vendée Singles.

In July 2023, he and Five-Star Red Flag appeared on the official website of Vendée Globe for the first time, becoming the first official candidates for the 10th Vendée Globe in 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, he received a confirmation letter from the Coffee Road Organizing Committee. The team passed the 1,200 nautical mile storm test and won the qualification to participate in the 2023 Coffee Road Double Transatlantic Sailing Race. It will be held on October 10 On the 29th, it set sail from the race village of Le Havre, a famous seaport in France. This is the first time a Chinese team has been selected for the world&#39;s top two-person transoceanic competition, and it is also the first Asian team in the history of Coffee Road. Although the Café Road is not one of the five single qualifying events designated by Vendée Globe, it, like other world-renowned high-difficulty championships, can help racing boats accumulate difficult sailing miles. When the team that has obtained Vendée Globe qualification review exceeds the limit When the quota is determined, help the team win in the competition of selecting the best among the best. If the coffee road is successfully completed, Xu Jingkun is expected to seize the ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe and become the first Chinese person to participate in the world&#39;s top offshore sailing competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Hd3xHdzNkoG4N6kRSfJqHQTcMGvEn9wAdP9Oe8rZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Hd3xHdzNkoG4N6kRSfJqHQTcMGvEn9wAdP9Oe8rZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253644&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun’s super racing boat IMOCA60&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; The road ahead is too long”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Buying the IMOCA60 is indeed an important turning point.

The route of the Vendée Globe is not the most economical and safe trade wind route. Instead, it tries its best to incorporate dangerous capes, equatorial windless zones, and stormy waves into the course. Even so, there have been five captains in the history of the Vendée Globe. After reaching the 80-day mark, the fastest record is 74 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes and 46 seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun never thought that one day after the Paralympic sailing team was disbanded, he would go out to sea alone, own a super racing boat, and race against the waves with the captains of the world&#39;s top professional racing boats. In 2021, there are less than 20 hydrofoil super single-hull racing boats in the world. Standing on the boat, he had a strong sense of unreality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IMOCA60 integrates the most cutting-edge monohull sailboat design and shipbuilding technology. The signature design is the swinging keel inserted vertically into the sea and the hydrofoils extending from both sides of the hull. The carbon fiber hydrofoils are light and elegant but strong enough to When standing in the wind, it looks like the wings of a flying fish, helping the ship reduce the friction of the water and achieve faster speeds. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;肖姝瑶刚跟徐京坤在一起的时候，身边朋友很多不理解，但只要一跟他们接触，就会很自然地忘了徐京坤少一只手臂，“我的朋友说他身上没有残缺感。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐京坤总是很自然地露着左胳膊，用它托着手机打电话、在分享会上夹着话筒，“我可以切菜、切肉，我还能包饺子……很多次在海里落水我都是靠它把我搂上来的，特别棒！它跟着我真的出了好多的力气，这是我的标记。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;肖姝瑶相信是航海治愈了徐京坤，“他曾经遭遇无数质疑和指责，一定程度上刺激到了他，让他的起航带着一丝战斗欲。随着航行渐远，他感受到越来越多的关心和帮助、越来越多的善意，变得平和、理性，航行也变得更加纯粹。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐京坤很赞同，“航海彻底改变了我。 ”从16岁进入体校，他在竞争中总是没有安全感，“如果不是因为搞体育你根本都出不去，我就说我一定得在这留下来。 ”他常常有落入无望的忧惧，曾经非常激愤，参加残奥队选拔时，他每天都对自己说，“如果你这一次失败了，你就不用回去了，跳到海里边死掉就行了。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;残奥队解散后，很长时间他都找不到自己的生活目标。他讨厌没有目标感的生活，翟墨船长环球航行归来给了他一个方向，“原来队伍解散了，我还可以自己去航行。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的第一条船和第一次环中国海航行充满了悲情色彩，“一个人住在崂山小船厂里，每天像疯子一样忙碌，与生活脱离，失去了所有联系，甚至好像开始被人遗忘。 ”他用了7个多月的时间修复改造了一条几乎要废弃的船，给它取名“梦想号”。2012年9月18日从青岛启航，“带着壮士一去不复还的那种悲壮心情，甚至也带着一些怨念，为什么我这个人一辈子要这么难？为什么我起航出发父母却不能来到现场？你们不相信，我就拼死一搏！带着这种劲！ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发小“猴子”在岸上高喊着，“京坤！ ”“京坤！ ”“哎呀，他喊的那个凄厉啊，我都不敢回头，心里跟命运赌着气，死了就死了，怎么着？ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/4AwubDVqVgNDKraQShoUGUTLCudu23xeqOlwKoPZ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;这些年当徐京坤完成一个又一个目标，感觉自己能够把握生活之后，忧惧退去，愤怒止息，他越来越舒展，越来越职业。身边的朋友、大哥和赞助商都不太知晓事业起步时期的他，很多人是通过肖姝瑶写他的那本《卑微的梦想家》才了解到那些过往。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我认真读了那本书，非常触动。 ”殷志成是青岛海运职业学校海豚俱乐部的副总经理，接触过很多航海人。“京坤很专注，不会轻易分心，执着于自己的目标，一步一步往前，旁人猛一抬头，会发现他已经达到了难以企及的高度。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“京坤最大的特点是严谨、专业，”诺亚天泽保险经纪公司从2017年徐京坤和肖姝瑶开始双体帆船环球航行时成为他们的合作伙伴，到现在一直为赛队提供保险服务。天泽董事长田丰密切关注着赛船的状况，“咖啡路1200海里资格赛，他们按照规定必须穿越风暴赛段，追着风暴跑下来，赛船完好无损，充分证明他工作做得很细。那么大一条船，每个细节他都亲自维护到位才能有这样的状态，这种职业精神是对自己负责，也是对赞助商、对家人负责。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“其实在海上偶尔我还是会（情绪）爆发。 ”2022年朗姆路单人跨大西洋的时候，他连续穿越3个大风暴，最大风力超过70节，“整个海面鬼哭狼嚎，非常让人恐惧。 ”孤身一人在风浪中，徐京坤冲着大海怒吼，“来吧！怎么样吧！ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他笑了起来，“没有人看到过我那个样子，以前也没跟人说过。很戏剧化，一边叫喊着，一边开着我的船迎向风浪！ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那次还干了一个非常冒险的事，”IMOCA60赛船上有8面帆，每面帆都有一百多公斤重，一趟朗姆路跑下来，大风吹坏了3面帆。“有一面帆直接掉到海里去了，船还在跑，三百多平米的帆兜着几十吨的海水，靠人力是根本拉不上来的。 ”徐京坤拿着一把利刃跳进冰冷的大西洋，“一点点切，把它切成碎片拿回来了。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深海航行最忌讳的就是人船分离，大洋深处，连救援力量都没有能力抵达，“事后想来想去，以后还是不能这样干了。 ”徐京坤说这种行为跟自己理性稳妥的天性严重不符，他甚至都无法解释，“但这都是人在岸上、在正常情况下的想法，紧急时刻，你的想法会不一样。如果不跳进海里，帆可能会把船拖沉，比赛会被迫终止，而我为这个比赛付出了那么多，绝对不甘心就这样放弃。我的船也不只是一条船，它像我的孩子一样，不可能不去救它。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了充满勇气的冒险竞赛，极限航海中也有许多关于人与船、人与人之间的爱的传递。2020旺代环球就曾上演61岁的传奇航海人让·勒·卡姆和几位船长冒死营救船只发生灾难性断裂的船长凯文的故事，极少流泪的徐京坤说，“这些故事很容易触动我的泪点。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;船长们是懂得表达爱的，那些在最凶险的海域守望相助过的水手们，常常会结伴参加咖啡路双人跨大西洋赛。肖姝瑶在“徐京坤环球航海赛队”公众号上除了发布关于徐京坤赛队的消息，还会介绍很多航海英雄和海上传奇，她写了这样一段话——&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“1997年，前一年在旺代环球80节暴风中救下几乎失温的拉菲尔·迪内利的皮特·戈斯，作为伴郎参加完迪内利的婚礼，两人又组合来咖啡路拿了个CLASS2组别冠军，成为离岸航海界的一段美谈。 2012年旺代让·勒·卡姆（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对，就是2020年救人的这位&lt;/span>;）翻船18个小时之后，文森特·里乌赶来救了他一命，两人搭档到咖啡路拿了个IMOCA组别冠军。旺代生死之交的组合来咖啡路&#39;刷&#39;冠军，似乎已经成为传统了。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“阿九是懂航海的！ ”虽然他总爱开玩笑称肖姝瑶为“不靠谱的阿九”，内心里却深知她的宝贵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐京坤由衷赞叹这些海上传奇超越了胜负，“我很喜欢听她给我讲这些人和故事，不过一问她，她就停不住了，我就喊停停停，我要去干活了……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《南方人物周刊》记者9月底在青岛见到徐京坤时，距离咖啡路开赛还有不到一个月的时间，“前段时间太累了，我必须调整。这次回来基本没有安排什么事情。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们一起往奥帆中心走，秋天的风吹过来，他眯着眼睛，“真棒！这是最好的季节！很舒服！ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你左胳膊怎么了？ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;青岛奥帆中心看门大哥的脸晒得黝黑，可能来城市的时间也不长，说话还是乡音。徐京坤和一行人从他面前经过，大哥竟然脱口而出这么一问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“小时候出了点儿事故。 ”徐京坤的语气和神情都非常平静，并且停下脚步，面带微笑地定定望着大哥。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看门大哥坐着不动，抬起脸，眼里满是关切疼爱，带着乡里人的直接和热忱继续发问，“现在生活还好吗？ ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“还好，挺好的。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他给我们指他的“梦想号”曾经停靠的地方，“那里，那条红船的旁边。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;司法机关应让法律有牙齿，对更多同类案例强化问责，也是向各行业商家发出警示：对老人设以种种消费陷阱，甚至利用其身体或精神疾病，诱导加强制其消费，公检法应有力介入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过一两公里就要家人陪同。 2019年，他独自去了家门口的文峰宛平店理发，迄今竟在文峰美容美发宛平店和天钥桥店内“被消费”近50次，妹妹们多年来省吃俭用为他积攒的近60万元看病钱、养老钱被掏了个干干净净。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓认知障碍，据首都医科大学宣武医院主任医师贾建平介绍，认知障碍又称认知缺陷，常分为轻度认知障碍和痴呆两类，患者可同时出现性格、情绪改变、异常行为等表现。一个存在认知和沟通障碍的独身老人，是限制民事行为能力人。民法典第二十二条规定，不能完全辨认自己行为的成年人为限制民事行为能力人，实施民事法律行为由其法定代理人代理或者经其法定代理人同意、追认。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从任阿姨哥哥的反馈来看，门店不仅派“专人”跟着去银行或取现或转账，还“帮”着他们眼中的“笨爷叔”借贷。如此行为，显然是利用老人的认知障碍欺骗或强制其消费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任阿姨还发现，其哥哥不仅在该美容店消费近60万，还存在充值与电子付款记录在时间和金额上均不相符、数万元消费只有手写充值凭证而没有出现在文峰收款记录、收款方显示为外地广告公司、“文峰全身养护金典精油”单次消费达1万元等反常情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果任阿姨陈述属实，该文峰美容店已涉嫌诈骗罪。 《关于公安机关管辖的刑事案件立案追诉标准的规定（二）》规定：合同诈骗案以非法占有为目的，在签订、履行合同过程中，骗取对方当事人财物，数额在二万元以上的，应予立案追诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刑法第二百二十四条关于合同诈骗罪的规定：诈骗公私财物，数额较大的，处三年以下有期徒刑、拘役或者管制，并处或者单处罚金；数额巨大或者有其他严重情节的，处三年以上十年以下有期徒刑，并处罚金；数额特别巨大或者有其他特别严重情节的，处十年以上有期徒刑或者无期徒刑，并处罚金或者没收财产。司法解释《关于办理诈骗刑事案件具体应用法律若干问题的解释》第一条规定：诈骗公私财物价值三千元至一万元以上、三万元至十万元以上、五十万元以上的，应当分别认定为刑法第二百六十六条规定的“数额较大”“数额巨大”“数额特别巨大”。对照刑法及最高法、最高检相关解释，任阿姨哥哥在文峰美容店“被消费”近60万已属“数额特别巨大”，司法机关当立案调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任阿姨哥哥的遭遇并非个案，随着中国逐步进入老龄化社会，老人群体的权益保障备受各界关注。 2016年，全国老龄办、民政部等共同发布的第四次中国城乡老年人生活状况抽样调查结果显示，我国失能、半失能老年人大致4063万人，占老年人口18.3%。其中伴随失智的老人比例也不低。失能、半失能老人往往全部或者部分丧失了生活自理能力，而作为监护人的配偶、子女，受种种原因所限无法时刻伴随身边，也就容易给某些不法者可乘之机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“老吾老以及人之老”本为社会伦理，但某些人却视老人为待宰羔羊。近年来，针对老人群体的不法案例屡屡曝出，2022年4月，平安中国建设协调小组牵头部署全国打击整治养老诈骗专项行动。 6月，最高检公布6件打击整治养老诈骗犯罪典型案例，6件典型案例覆盖了投资养老产业、预定养老公寓、销售收藏品、提供老年人诊疗服务、代办“养老抚恤金”等多种养老诈骗典型手段，涉及集资诈骗罪、非法吸收公众存款罪、诈骗罪、侵犯公民个人信息罪等涉养老诈骗相关罪名。坑害老人的套路有多深，法律所应发挥的问责效力就应有多大。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;事实上，据南都记者调查，近年来公费定向师范生违约的情况屡见不鲜。作为学校公费定向师范生的一名班主任，广州大学粤港澳大湾区社会发展与教育政策研究院常务副院长谢爱磊教授接受南都专访时表示，虽然违约人数的占比并不大，但违约人数有明显的上升趋势，“工作后才违约的情况比较常见”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在他看来，学生违约反映的是个人利益与公共利益的冲突，如果能从政策等层面增加学生个人的获得感，其实可以实现公共利益与个人利益的双赢。为此，他建议相关政府部门应该更多地在“前补偿”的基础上开展“后激励”措施。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;现象：近年多地公布未履约名单工作后违约较多&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;据了解，2020年，广东省教育厅、中共广东省委机构编制委员会办公室、广东省财政厅、广东省人力资源和社会保障厅发布《关于公费定向培养粤东粤西粤北地区中小学教师的实施办法》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中提到，为进一步精准补充乡村教师，优化教师资源配置，提升广东省教师队伍的整体素质，按照“自愿报名、择优录取、公费培养定向从教、限期服务”的原则，每年为粤东粤西粤北地区中小学培养一批高素质的学前教育、特殊教育、小学教育（全科）和义务教育阶段学校音乐、体育、美术等紧缺学科教师，为高中阶段培养专业突出、底蕴深厚的研究生学历层次教师。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这并非汕尾陆丰首次公布违约人员名单。2022年2月，就有4名毕业生未履约，毕业时间为2021年6月；11月，又有2名毕业生未履约，毕业时间为2022年6月。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样在今年9月，广东雷州市教育局发布通报，2人于2023年毕业后因个人原因未履约；另2人于2022年毕业在雷州市服务满1年后因个人原因不再继续履约。10月，潮州潮安也公布违约名单，3人因个人原因未履约，毕业时间为2023年6月。&lt;/p>;

data-key=&quot;254230&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，近年来诸如汕尾海丰、茂名化州、云浮郁南、清远连南等地也都公布过违约名单，既有应届毕业生违约，也有工作后违约的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据调查，公费定向师范生到定向安排的学校（含村小、教学点）任教不少于6年。在规定服务期内，公费定向培养对象不得以升学、调动为由不履行限期服务约定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，违约成本有多大呢？《实施办法》中明确，对服务期内未能履行协议规定的，各地负责按照规定追缴公费定向培养对象退还所享受的培养经费，并按照培养经费总额的30%收缴其违约金，超过1个月缴纳时限的每天按照应缴交费用1‰的比例加收其逾期付款违约金，其违约行为应记入人事档案和社会信用体系，并予以公布。各地收缴的违约退缴资金按照“谁管理、谁使用、谁负责”原则，专项用于支持和补助地方中小学教师队伍建设。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;分析：违约反映的是个人利益与公共利益的冲突&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“据调查研究，公费定向师范生违约人数的占比并不大，但违约人数有明显的上升趋势，因此也引起社会的广泛关注。”谢爱磊告诉记者，违约其实要分为主动违约和被动违约来看。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;被动方面，《实施办法》有相关规定，学生若未能在基本修业年限内获取毕业证书或学位证书的，或因个人原因（除因身体健康、应征入伍外）中断学业等情况出现，“经培养院校研究、计划来源地同意，取消其公费定向培养资格，由所在高校按照国家有关规定负责处理”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主动方面，对于应届毕业生而言，由于对毕业后要去的乡村教师工作范围、现状、环境等不满意，希望追求更高层次的工作单位，也有学生希望升学深造而违约。而对于工作的毕业生而言，主要是发展诉求得不到满足。由于已经积累了足够的经验与资本，毕业生希望流动到更好的工作岗位，且有足够的经济基础支付违约金而违约。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，还有部分已经工作的公费定向师范生无法适应地方的工作实际情况、文化和氛围，未达到履约的工作年限便离开岗位。据调查，有些地方形成主管部门在制定公费定向培养计划需求时，未能科学预测、合理规划、及时调整，导致公费定向师范生毕业后的岗位匹配出现问题，出现“哪里缺老师就派到哪里去”“教师专业与工作岗位不对口、不匹配”等情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“总的来说，违约时间较多集中在毕业后，工作好几年才违约的情况比较常见。”谢爱磊说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为定向班的班主任，谢爱磊也观察到，并非所有学生在入学之初就清楚该项目的实际情况。“包括我带的学生，部分人是父母帮忙做的选择，他们对定向教师这个岗位、将来的工作情况等都不太了解。”他告诉南都记者：“我留意到一些趋势，学生刚入学的时候，很多人更关注违约的成本和责任，但对将来要工作的地方认识不充分。到了大二，学生就开始焦虑，思考回去工作该怎么办、毕业后有没有可能有其他选择等。到了大三，学生就考虑万一回去不适应怎么办、定向6年后会是怎样的情况等。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从社会学的角度来看，违约其中很大的一个原因是学生早期在做选择时并没有认清现实情况，后期的职业认同没有被充分发展起来。从教育经济学的角度来看，违约其实反映的是个人利益与公共利益的冲突，并不能一味指责学生；如果能增加学生个人的获得感，也是可以实现公共利益与个人利益的双赢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为此，自新生入学开始，谢爱磊就定向地开展干预，通过定期一对一交流、开班会课等形式，普及公费定向师范生的权利和义务、教师工作的内涵、将来工作岗位的环境等，并带领学生开展粤东粤西粤北县域学校调查，以此来增强学生的职业和岗位认同感。“据观察，毕业后学生违约主要是离开工作岗位，但很少离开教师职业。如果学校、老师能有意识地干预，学生的专业认同、职业认同、岗位认同都会有更好的结果。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;建议：在“前补偿”的基础上实行“后激励”举措&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;虽然针对违约，政策层面也有一定制约机制。但在谢爱磊看来，惩罚只能说是兜底，但并不能从根本上解决该问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他建议，对于学生而言，在进入公费定向项目之前，需要更充分地思考自己的职业规划，了解乡村教师的工作内容、实际的工作条件。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于培养院校而言，要重点把握好志愿填报前期的关键时间节点，加大宣传力度。学生入学后，院校也要从管理的角度入手，在让学生充分掌握专业技能的同时，持续关注和引导学生的职业、岗位认同感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于地方教育部门而言，要结合教师教育改革发展的实际情况，科学预测区域内基础教育领域紧缺学科教师的补充需求，合理编制每年的公费定向培养计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除此之外，相关政府部门还应该更多地在“前补偿”的基础上开展“后激励”措施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如，政府部门可以根据学校的偏远程度、环境情况等，实施分类分层级的奖励机制。“我有学生利用粤东粤西粤北县中学校教师的数据做了一个调查，发现学校离珠三角经济发达地区越远的老师越想要流动。如果按照这个情况来看，是不是可以有差异化的奖励机制。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，根据履约年限进行奖励，在专业发展、晋升渠道等方面给予更多的机会和优待政策，增强公费定向师范生的工作动力。《实施办法》里就提出，鼓励公费定向培养对象通过自学考试或函授、在职攻读研究生等形式提升学历。谢爱磊还提到，可以联合高层次的师范大学，建立定向师范协同培养中心，为符合条件的毕业生提供高层次的教育硕士学位，在体制机制方面解决他们的后顾之忧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在学生履约完成后，能否获得高质量的流动，也是值得思考的方法之一。”谢爱磊说道。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, many new professions have emerged. In 2019, a &quot;rabbit taster&quot; working for a spicy braised food e-commerce company attracted attention. He tries to eat more than 2,000 rabbit heads every year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China Pictures/Pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn, Wang Fei and her party prepared enough dry food and drove through the Gobi Desert for hundreds of kilometers. , there are heavy mountains ahead, no one can be seen, and there is no signal. They need to constantly observe weather changes, calculate the water and oil stocks, and put some dry food along the way when going to the mine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The road in the mine was extremely narrow, and the wheels pressed against the edge of the cliff. They almost did not dare to take a big breath. Finally reaching an altitude of 4,500 meters, looking around, all kinds of jade materials are scattered on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a microcosm of Wang Fei’s treasure hunting process. She is a gem hunter, a profession full of excitement and thrills every day. Her story was recorded in the book &quot;New Careers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in August 2023, the national urban surveyed unemployment rate was 5.2%, a decrease from the previous month and the same period last year. In April, the national survey unemployment rate for labor force aged 16-24 was 20.4%, and the youth unemployment rate exceeded 20% for the first time. Nowadays, with the downsizing within the system and layoffs in the Internet, more and more young people are no longer bound to a certain &quot;cubic room&quot;, but are beginning to break away from traditional industries and seek emerging careers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the &quot;2021 New Career Guide for Youth&quot; released by Bilibili and DT Finance showed that 12% of young people are already trying new careers part-time, 5.5% are working full-time, and 58.5% want to try but No action has been taken yet. 78% of young people prefer a new career because it “matches their interests and hobbies.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Taobao Unpopular New Career Observation in 2021&quot; takes stock of the top ten unpopular new careers, namely: doll doctor, dream painter, succulent foster nurse, game face pincher, organizer and storage master, cloud maker , cat food taster, armor caster, live broadcast room set designer, mobile phone embalmer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many new occupations are neither large-scale nor stable enough. For example, the cloud makers mentioned above, they simulate the appearance of clouds, from mold making, shaping, polishing to finished products, are stored in transparent cubes, but there are only a few practitioners. This does not prevent some new professionals from turning their love into a career and exploring a special way of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some stories from those in new careers:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16 /kushWlXZWxL9CyRbDFg0KGmvYw6jGQv1hxQrJv1P.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;941&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/kushWlXZWxL9CyRbDFg0KGmvYw6jGQv1 hxQrJv1P.jpg&quot; data -key=&quot;254138&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Henna hand-painted looks somewhat similar to tattoos at first glance, but it is actually hand-painted on the skin with plant pigments. It subsides naturally in about two weeks. After becoming a henna master, Thirteen sometimes encountered strange looks. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Henna Master&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &quot;&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Painted, it doesn’t hurt&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shisan is often mistaken for a tattoo artist. Because she posted henna hand-drawn patterns in her circle of friends, before renting an apartment, her co-tenant mistakenly thought she was a tattoo artist and made excuses to refuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although they are all painted on the human body, henna hand-painting is actually a paste of plant pigments made from henna flowers that is painted on the skin. It is popular in the Middle East and India and is generally only left on the skin. It will subside naturally after about two weeks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s not written, it&#39;s not posted, it&#39;s painted! It doesn&#39;t hurt!&quot; Shisan deliberately hung a conspicuous slogan on the stall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from high school, Shisan moved around in different cities and lost count of how many jobs he had. She tried Henna hand-painting after being introduced by a friend and earned 2,000 yuan in 4 days. When she practiced most crazily, she painted almost all the places on her body that could be painted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Thirteen has been a full-time henna practitioner for five years. Every night at the market in Shenzhen, she immersed herself in painting, her long blue and red hair standing out among the crowd. Within ten minutes, a henna pattern incorporating vines, flowers and other imagery appeared on the back of the customer&#39;s hand. For her, the most difficult thing is to control the amount of paste squeezed out. If the amount is not appropriate, the lines will not be smooth and beautiful enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A client, an office worker who works in foreign trade, requested that Thirteen be painted somewhere that could be covered by his clothes. Her workplace requires formality. After get off work, she can be herself again and show off her body patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A junior high school student was brought in by his mother. His wrists were covered with self-inflicted scratches, hoping to cover them with drawings. Thirteen drew a cartoon pattern for him and said in a relaxed manner: After drawing such a beautiful pattern, I will no longer be able to scratch myself with sharp objects. The boy agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Occasionally, she would encounter strange people and strange looks. A strange man pointed at the &quot;shrimp line&quot; pattern on her neck and called her scary. Fortunately, Thirteen doesn&#39;t care, &quot;I can&#39;t change myself because of their personal aesthetics.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Organizer&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: “It’s a human home, so what?”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Nannan travels around the city every day Every corner of the house is sorted and summarized for different people. She received professional training from a housekeeping company and needed to organize clothes by category and color, or arrange cosmetics on the dressing table by bottle height. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the storage work is tedious and long, the secrets in those private spaces are nerve-wracking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night at 11 o&#39;clock, Li Nannan went to a male anchor&#39;s home to do some storage and found that there were plus-size women&#39;s clothes and wigs in the closet. He speculated that he might be dressing up as a woman for a live broadcast. She said that this &quot;atypical living situation&quot; is very interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some houses are unimaginably messy. Once, Li Nannan dug out a large number of express delivery boxes from the corner of the room, and was about to sort them into categories. As soon as he opened the boxes, many squirming bugs, cockroaches and mice crawled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s all a human home, so what? There&#39;s nothing particularly dangerous. What&#39;s more difficult to deal with is that the client&#39;s unresolved emotions are placed on me. Human situations are not easy to deal with. .&quot; Li Nannan told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes customers would quarrel among themselves while they were sorting things out. Li Nannan was used to it and didn&#39;t feel embarrassed. Occasionally, some anger would burn into her, and customers would pick on her for no apparent reason, and the door-to-door collector would become the punching bag for conflicts in the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, a customer blamed her for putting valuables and worthless items together, blaming her for being unprofessional and uninformed. At this time, Li Nannan adheres to the principle of &quot;silence is golden&quot;, talking less and doing more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this job, Li Nannan has seen all kinds of things in the world. A junior high school student asked her to clean up his study room while his parents were not at home. The boy was always at home alone during that summer vacation. After cleaning up, he asked Li Nannan to stay and play games together. Later, Li Nannan went to play with him a few more times, as if he had seen himself as a teenager. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Simulated Pet Customizer&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Keep it with you&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Worked as a veterinarian for two years Chen Ziting has encountered many helpless situations. Facing the anxious faces of pet owners, she found it difficult to ask them to say their final goodbyes to their pets, and sometimes she even cried together. In the long run, it was difficult for her to bear so much sadness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, she began to make simulated pets out of wool felt, making them into pendants, ornaments or keychains. Some were only made for the head of the pet, and some were made for the whole body, which were all made stitch by stitch. of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two-thirds of the customers who came to customize their pets had passed away. They took photos of their pets while they were still alive and hoped to use the simulated version as a souvenir. Many owners can&#39;t help crying when they see the appearance of their pets when they receive the express delivery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A customer customized a head ornament for her Garfield cat. This cat has been with her since graduation. Later, the kitten developed a skin disease, and the owner specially changed his job for him and moved to a drier city. But during one of her business trips, Garfield suffered a heart attack and died suddenly. She drove back overnight to have him cremated. She found Chen Ziting, hoping to keep it with her in another form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ziting also has a cat, and her pet is &quot;like a family member&quot; to her. She understands the owner&#39;s extreme sadness and reluctance after the pet leaves. She hopes that after the tragedy, &quot;there is still something more that can be done for them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Animal Communicator&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;It&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;s need to be respected&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Animal communicator Luo Xinyan also tried to do something for these sad pet owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is a Taiwanese living in Guangdong, and her main job is to communicate with animals. In Taiwan, this is a relatively mature profession with specialized industry associations and training courses. Communicators believe that they can communicate with the souls of animals through sounds, images, thoughts, and even tastes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before starting communication, Luo Xinyan usually asks the owner to &quot;predict&quot; to the pet, informing them that a communicator will chat with them, and first obtain basic information and recent photos of the pet. She claimed that this would help the pets cooperate, &quot;I know you are coming to me because my mother said so.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the more special ones is the communication with the deceased pet. According to Luo Xinyan, it usually takes 7-14 days after the death of the pet to make an appointment. In her account, the &quot;conversation&quot; with a deceased puppy went like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How are you doing in the animal kingdom (heaven)? What are you doing?&quot; &quot;There is nothing to do. , sometimes it gets a little boring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Do you like the place where the ashes are placed?&quot; &quot;Yes, I also like the color.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An owner&#39;s puppy once died of illness Finally, he anxiously found Luo Xinyan and wanted to know how he was doing after his death and whether he had received the gifts and paper money he had burned. Luo Xinyan said that she explained to the puppy that the pile of soft paper next to it was money given by her father, and she also saw small objects such as balls and dolls. After hearing this, the man of the house excitedly confirmed that he had indeed burned these things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of the puppy, the hostess blamed herself deeply, believing that she had not taken good care of the puppy. Luo Xinyan said that the puppy asked her to convey that it was not their fault that her death was not their fault, so she did not need to worry about it and would live happily in the future. While no one else could hear or verify the authenticity of these conversations, the owners did find relief. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Luo Xinyan, every animal is an individual, &quot;with feelings, love, innocence, and tolerance. They need to be respected.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/q9E8eOoBU0sCHOxb7q3GTwinSZbhy94j0vvXe505.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/q9E8eOoBU0sCHOxb7q3GTwinSZbhy94j0vvXe505.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254140&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Customers seeking doll restoration are mostly reluctant to throw away the dolls that have been with them for many years and treat them as friends. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Doll Restorer&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;It is not a toy, it is my friend&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Some people are reluctant to part with their pets, while others place their emotions on the dolls that have been with them for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Xiaoxi has a white stuffed rabbit that has been with her for seventeen years. It is only as big as a forearm. As she grew from a child to an adult over the course of seventeen years, the little rabbit&#39;s originally dense plush began to fall away, becoming almost bare in some areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She accidentally saw someone on the Internet who specialized in doll restoration and wanted to send it for restoration, but the high price put her off. When Lu Xiaoxi was a child, she learned a little bit of sewing from her grandmother, and then tried to repair it by herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hair on the rabbit&#39;s mouth, hands, and feet was almost all gone, and the areas that needed to be repaired were large. She repaired them on and off for a month before re-planting the hair in these areas. After that, Lu Xiaoxi started taking orders and repairing dolls as a part-time job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some dolls are severely worn and need hair transplantation, some need to be filled with cotton, and some have just cracked lines and need to be mended. Restoring a doll usually takes a week or two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hair transplantation is the most troublesome. If there is only a small amount of hair loss, you can remove the floating hair from the doll, rub it into a small handful, and then press it back with tweezers according to the grid pattern in the doll. If the shedding is too severe, like her rabbit, you have to buy new wool cloth, pull out the hair and replant it. It usually takes two to three hours to transplant a small area, and the hands will be very painful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Xiaoxi likes this new job very much. She feels that dolls carry many memories. Even if the doll is seriously damaged, the owner is reluctant to throw it away. She understands this sentiment very well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A customer once sent a bear that needed repair and included a letter. The letter was written in the tone of a little bear. He said that he had been accompanying his owner for thirteen years and had followed her to many places, hoping to help restore it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They are not toys, they are almost like friends.&quot; Lu Xiaoxi told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/PWA1ql1QbWM9wftp13WP5i6grXgwdrUR7iYcXxSI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/PWA1ql1QbWM9wftp13WP5i6grXgwdrUR7iYcXxSI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254137&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Makeup restorer Liu Cheng charges 20-40 yuan per order, and the price is based on the difficulty of the repair, with a monthly income of tens of thousands of yuan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Makeup Repair Technician&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;Twenty yuan per order, monthly income of tens of thousands&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If the restoration of dolls is out of deep emotion, then the customers who repair cosmetics have more practical purposes. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The workbench of makeup restorer Liu Cheng is like a laboratory, with sterilization cabinets, lipstick molds, powder compaction plates, films, beakers, etc. As a man who knew nothing about makeup not long ago, he is now familiar with the common brands on the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He used to be engaged in real estate, and his entry into the industry was purely accidental. When he had nothing to do during the epidemic, he found that some of his wife&#39;s cosmetics were broken, but it was a pity to throw them away. He tried to repair them several times and the results were good. A few months ago, his wife started taking orders for him online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This job is quite delicate. When Liu Cheng repaired a certain powder earlier, he followed the established steps, but the effect was not very good. Later he discovered that the powder also had a baked texture and different techniques, so the method was certainly not universal. After studying the corresponding texture, it was finally repaired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, makeup repair bloggers are not uncommon, and their business covers a wide range of products, including powder repair, makeup packaging and packaging, lipstick color change, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Liu Cheng&#39;s observation, most of the customers are young college students. Generally speaking, there are women aged 18 to 40, and the market is very huge. Some of the people who patronize makeup restoration are thrifty and frugal, while others do so because the items were given as gifts to relatives and friends and do not want to part with the emotional meaning they carry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Powder powder and lipstick are most often repaired. Powder powder is usually broken and needs to be restored, lipstick may be broken, or the color may be changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Repair is not always smooth. Once to repair lipstick, Liu Cheng reworked it 4 times. In one case, there were still cracks and bubbles after the repair. In another time, the lipstick stuck to the wall of the cup during the melting process. Only a quarter of it was left after repair, so he had to Melted again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Cheng&#39;s repair cost is about 20 yuan per repair, and the more difficult ones cost 30 or 40 yuan. Currently, he can earn more than 10,000 yuan per month. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pet Agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Dedicated Talent Scout&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a pet agent, Shuangshuang&#39;s job is to connect brands and pet models, and to find pets of different species through various channels and to find cooperative models. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One time while shopping in a shopping mall, she saw a girl walking by with a beautiful border collie. They both immediately chased after her, and it took them three floors to catch up, and successfully got the owner&#39;s contact information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its coat color is a rare three-color meteorite among border collie breeds, its eyes are particularly blue, and its body is not large. They both saw it as a good model at a glance. Moreover, it follows its owner obediently in a crowded shopping mall, which shows that it has good stability and is suitable for studio shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that Shuangshuang, the talent scout, has a good eye. On the day of the shooting, this border collie showed a high degree of cooperation. It only took 13 minutes to complete the shooting of seven different angles and postures, while the average mock-up shooting time for ordinary pets is half an hour to an hour. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shuangshuang is unwilling to disclose the specific price of the pet, which is considered a business secret. She introduced the general market situation. The daily appearance fee of a professional pet model is about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, different pets have different values. If they have outstanding appearance, camera-like appearance, high stability and cooperation, the treatment will be higher. The owner&#39;s easy communication and free time are also bonus points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be a good pet agent, Shuangshuang needs to collect as many varieties of pets as possible. The same variety also needs different colors and sizes. It is best to have three or four pets of the same size and color. If there is an accident during the shooting, you can replace them at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the shooting, Shuangshuang will transform into an assistant, following the pet model at any time to take care of, guide and comfort it. Once when I was on location, as soon as I arrived at the shooting location, the model dog started fighting with other dogs passing by. Together with her colleagues, she &quot;pressed down&quot; her own model and asked someone to quickly take the other one away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surrounding your pets every day makes you both feel happy. When she was feeling down, the dog stretched out its paw to touch her, which made her feel healed. &quot;Every moment was touching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pet daycare manager&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“It’s like a child going to kindergarten”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ren Mengyin She likes animals. She has a cat and two dogs, the oldest is eight years old and the youngest is six years old. She has had pets since she was a student, and her time with them has dropped sharply after working. She found that this is also the current situation of most office workers. They leave early and come home late, and their pets can only stay at home by themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She co-opened a dog day care store with her friends, targeting these office workers. During the day, before they go to work, they leave their puppies in the store, &quot;just like children going to kindergarten.&quot; Most parents will apply for one &quot;semester&quot;, which is 30 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the morning, they use the &quot;school bus&quot; to pick up the dogs and send them home in the evening. Dogs usually have breakfast in the store, and they basically bring their own food. The daily &quot;school&quot; schedule is full, such as the afternoon tea session, and different activities are designed. Sometimes they are fed with leaky toys, or snacks are placed on the lawn for them to find and eat on their own. In the evening, Ren Mengyin and her colleagues will take their dogs for a walk by the stream outside the store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as each class has students with different personalities, there are also &quot;i dogs&quot; and &quot;e dogs&quot; among dogs. They will &quot;teach students in accordance with their aptitude.&quot; For &quot;i Dogs&quot; who don&#39;t like to socialize, what attracts them more is the smell, touch and atmosphere. When they first come to daycare, let &quot;i Dogs&quot; slowly observe and adapt to the environment. Some small dogs The dog may find a comfortable place to sun itself.
