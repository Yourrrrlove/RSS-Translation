Photo by Zhang Yongjin&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In northern Guangdong in September, the hot and humid air after the rain is breathless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the roar of engines, unmanned reconnaissance, firepower raids, impact breakthroughs... According to the company&#39;s &quot;roundabout and outflank&quot; tactics, the Second Company quickly took over Set fire points from multiple directions to complete the mission of seizing control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is the second company of a brigade of the 74th Group Army of the Army conducting an offensive and defensive drill. In recent years, the officers and soldiers of this company have participated in various types of offensive and defensive warfare drills and competition exercises for many times. The training footprints have been all over the coast of the South China Sea, the Lingnan jungle, the depths of the desert and the Gobi plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Second Company was born in the flames of the Anti-Japanese War and grew up in the flames of war. It has the title of &quot;Life and Death Together Company&quot; and &quot;Unite and Grow Together&quot;. , fight together, live and die together”. Entering the period of peace-building, the company has been reformed and moved three times, but it has always inherited the spirit of &quot;life and death together&quot; and worked hard to forge the company into &quot;a hard piece of steel.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Life and Death Together&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soldier Wu Shanjie will never forget the scene when company commander Zhang Peijin carried him on the plateau competition field. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2022, the heat in Yunnan was unbearable. At that time, the competition between &quot;good warriors&quot; was in full swing: a ten-kilometer run, bunker construction, reconnaissance, bomb dropping... There were many competitions, and they were very physically demanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At first, Zhang Peijin led six soldiers from his company to participate in the competition and was always far ahead. However, during the last armed three-kilometer run event, Wu Shanjie suddenly suffered from leg cramps and fell to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to regulations, one team member is allowed to fall behind in this project without affecting the overall assessment results. Wu Shanjie, who was in unbearable pain, asked the company commander to put him down so as not to affect the final result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Peijin, who has participated in multiple subject assessments continuously, has already seen his clothes soaked with sweat and his physical strength is close to the limit. Looking at Wu Shanjie who fell to the ground, he gritted his teeth and said, &quot;&#39;Life and Death Company&#39; has no habit of leaving behind its comrades.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Peijin picked up Wu Shanjie on his back and sprinted towards the finish line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the long journey of the last kilometer, Zhang Peijin got tired, so other comrades took over and took turns carrying Wu Shanjie until the end. The second team, which could have achieved better results, only finished fourth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Of course there will be regrets.&quot; Zhang Peijin confessed to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;But compared with the results, it is more important for the comrades to stand side by side and rush to the finish line. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Never abandoning any teammate is a glorious tradition inherited by the Second Company from the smoke-filled war years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the honor room of the Second Company, a sculpture based on the story of a stretcher silently tells the origin of the company&#39;s name and also interprets the meaning of &quot;life and death together.&quot; &quot;The spiritual connotation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 1946, the company was ordered to cover the retreat of the main force. Soldier Zhu Jicai was shot in the leg and injured. Due to the hot weather and lack of medical treatment, his wounds became infected and ulcerated, and he was unable to walk. In order not to drag down the company, Zhu Jicai took the initiative to ask his comrades to put him down and continue marching. But faced with the encircling enemies, his comrades were unwilling to leave him behind. They made a simple stretcher out of branches and vines and carried him while marching and fighting with the red flag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the critical juncture of life and death, the entire company dealt with dozens of times the enemy for more than 80 days. Not a single soldier was left behind. The mission was successfully completed. After the war, the company was ordered to Awarded the honorary title of &quot;Life and Death Together&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Over the past seventy years, the company has participated in more than 120 battles such as the Benxi Defense War, the Tashan Blockade, and the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam. Entering a new era, it has successively completed major tasks such as adjustment of the organizational structure, relocation of defenses, and cross-regional base-based exercises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The company fought in the north and south, its numbers were adjusted several times, and its location was constantly changed, but the glorious tradition of &quot;living and dying together&quot; has never changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the war years, my comrades rushed to the battlefield together. They dared to hand their backs to me, and I was willing to take bullets for them. This is the difference between life and death. Let&#39;s &#39;spirit together.&quot; After serving in the army for 11 years, Zi Guangyong has his own views on company spirit. He said that in peaceful times, this spirit is more reflected in daily training and every detail of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He gave an example. On the training ground, if a comrade was feeling unwell, he would help him carry his gun; during the exercise, if the task was difficult, they would complete it together. &quot;It&#39;s like a football match. You can&#39;t win the game just by playing alone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Officers and soldiers of the &quot;Life and Death Company&quot; review the battle stories of the company&#39;s history.

It’s hard to imagine that when he first came to the army, he couldn’t even speak Mandarin well and “didn’t want to chat with others.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2018, Zeren Tashi enlisted in the army from Ganzi, Sichuan. From the snowy plateau to the southeastern coast, Zeren Tashi clearly felt acclimated to the new environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Worried that others would not understand what he said, and not wanting to worry his family by talking to them, Zeren Tashi, who was already introverted and sensitive, became increasingly withdrawn and depressed. During breaks, he would always go to the basketball court to play alone. When other comrades came over to play, he would quit and give up the court to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Zeren Tashi fell into deep self-doubt, his comrades came. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bing Luojiang came from Guangxi in the same year. He was carefully aware of Zeren Tashi&#39;s emotions and used his own Mandarin as an example, but he was still a &quot;social cow&quot; , encouraging Zeren Tashi. From that time on, the enthusiastic Luo Jiang took Zeren Tashi to chat with his comrades every day to help him actively integrate into collective life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The company also opened &quot;a window&quot; specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Whenever I encounter Chinese characters I don&#39;t know during study, my comrades will explain them to me carefully.&quot; Zeren Tashi said, and the company commander also encouraged He must be brave enough to show himself in front of everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022, during the subject demonstration activity organized by the Second Company, Zeren Tashi gave a sharing lesson to the company, and his confident behavior won the audience. Applause, &quot;There was a great sense of satisfaction at that time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, the Second Company has more than a dozen ethnic minority soldiers from Tibetan, Zhuang, Li, Mulao and other ethnic groups. Some of them are leaving their hometown for the first time, and some are recent college graduates, with different personalities and physical qualities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to make them feel the warmth of home in the company, the company has its own &quot;unique secrets&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Second Company produces a &quot;Knowledge of Soldiers&quot; for each recruit, including various aspects such as physical condition, family situation, interests and hobbies. &quot;In daily life, the backbone of the company cadres will take the initiative to talk to the recruits, understand their actual situation, and help them solve the difficulties in life.&quot; Instructor Wang Gaosheng told Southern Weekend reporters that during the training process, the squad leader will also teach them hand-in-hand. Integrate into the company as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he first joined the Second Company in 2022, Mulao soldier Qin Guoxing had not had time to get familiar with the company, but reality poured cold water on him. He is a graduate student from 211 College and is regarded as the &quot;proud son of heaven&quot; in the eyes of his parents and friends. However, in Erlian, where there are many experts, his business ability is often only at the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tin Guoxing felt frustrated and often tossed and turned at night and couldn&#39;t sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Comrade Wang Lei saw Tan Guoxing like this and decided to help. Wang Lei is a &quot;veteran&quot; with solid and outstanding abilities and qualities. He took the initiative to play the role of a small instructor, training with Tan Guoxing, and teaching skills step by step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now, Qin Guoxing and Wang Lei have become a &quot;pair&quot; with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In daily training, Wang Lei led Qin Guoxing to strengthen physical training, while Qin Guoxing helped Wang Lei answer questions in theoretical study. In helping each other and competing, the two not only improved their performance, but also forged a deep friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Practice more with your brothers and you won&#39;t feel like you are walking alone.&quot; Qin Guoxing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Big things on my mind&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;These are all obtained by our ancestors with blood and sweat. You need to find a way to fill the remaining vacancies. .&quot; On the day of joining the company, the company commander led the recruits to stand in front of the wall of honor, pointing to the wall of honor medals and saying, &quot;If the honor of the company is lost from your hands, it will be a disservice to the revolutionary martyrs of the second company.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;A unit with excellent military training results&quot;, &quot;A top company in basic subject competition training&quot;, &quot;Comprehensive construction of an advanced unit&quot;, &quot;Comprehensive construction of a model company&quot;... Enter the second company In the camp, a &quot;luxurious wall&quot; covered with honorary medals is shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Over the past few decades, the Second Company has been rated as an advanced company in comprehensive construction or an advanced unit of the &quot;Four Irons&quot; for 27 consecutive years, and has won the second-class collective merit 7 times, 18 times of collective third-class merit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Lan Zhihao was still in the first company of the recruits, he had seen this wall through the window. He knew that this must be a heroic and honorary unit, and he was very eager to be assigned to the second company after the recruit training was completed. As a result, his wish came true. He was surprised, happy and full of energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeren Tashi&#39;s mood seems a bit complicated. He is proud to be a member of the &quot;benchmark company&quot; of the entire brigade, but also worried about not being able to keep up. The pace of training. In his words, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m done, and I might be choked in training.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Defending the honor of the heroic company has become a major issue that weighs on the minds of every officer and soldier of the second company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But in the main battle unit with so many strong men, such a goal is easy to say, but to achieve it requires extraordinary hard work and sweat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022, a major training mission was held in Yunnan, and company commander Zhang Peijin led the entire company to participate. In order to win the victory, the Second Company began to make key preparations from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;One month before the exercise, we organized soldier training during the day and worked overtime at night to deduce plans and study tactics.&quot; Zhang Peijin recalled, &quot;The backbone of the company also accompanied us. Stay up late with me, just to increase the chance of winning in the final battle.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Despite adequate preparation, the accident still happened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the live-fire shooting session, Zhang Peijin and artillery technician Xiang Jinwen&#39;s company command vehicle suddenly experienced a transmission failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When changing the target and shooting, I can only hear the sound of the motor inside, but the shell cannot be fired.&quot; Xiang Jinwen made an instant judgment , &quot;It must be a jammed bullet.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Without any hesitation, Xiang Jinwen quickly raised the armored vehicle&#39;s gun, opened the back cover to determine the specific location of the jammed bullet. , and removed the fixing device of the artillery, and took out the shells with bare hands. The entire process, from problem arose to troubleshooting, took just over a minute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the artillery roared and the shells accurately hit the target, Xiang Jinwen&#39;s hanging heart was completely relieved. He said, &quot;This is a super-level performance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the end, the Second Company stood out in the inspection and evaluation and was rated as an &quot;advanced unit against actual troops.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bite the &quot;hard bones&quot; together&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2015 4 In August, the company made personnel adjustments, and Xiang Jinwen was recommended to the Second Company for development because of his &quot;excellent professional quality.&quot; He feels very lucky because the Second Company is the model unit in the division. From the cadres to the recruits, everyone is proud to be here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To date, Xiang Jinwen has stayed in the Second Company for more than eight years, and he has experienced several important milestones of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, in order to adapt to future combat needs, the second company installed brand-new main battle equipment, which has better maneuverability, stronger firepower, and can achieve rapid Intersperse to achieve the effect of surprising and defeating the enemy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;All kinds of new equipment made the entire company excited. However, the ensuing practical difficulties of &quot;lack of teaching plans, lack of standards, and lack of talents&quot; also plagued the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The equipment is highly informatized and coincides with the retirement of many experienced technical backbones. The new equipment has brought us great challenges.&quot; Xiang Jinwen recalled, &quot;Every time the live-fire shooting results were very unsatisfactory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Short-stop shooting requires that the armored vehicle must pause briefly and fire while moving. Aiming and shooting puts forward higher cooperation requirements for the cooperation of the driver, communicator and shooter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;From parking to launching to destroy the target and then to the vehicle moving, the whole process only takes six to eight seconds.&quot; Xiang Jinwen said, &quot;If the cooperation is not good, , it is easy for the vehicle to impact again before the shell is fired.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The time for training in the field is very tight, in order to squeeze out time to bond with teammates. Xiang Jinwen had almost no rest during that period and stayed on the training ground with his comrades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The heat in July and August is unbearable. After being exposed to the sun, the temperature inside the armored vehicle can reach more than 50 degrees. If you stay in the vehicle for a long time, it will not last long. Clothes can be squeezed out of water. Xiang Jinwen described that as soon as he got off the armored vehicle, he felt dizzy and &quot;wanted to vomit but couldn&#39;t.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fortunately, Xiang Jinwen and his team performed at a high level every time they fired live ammunition, and also achieved excellent results in the assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Obviously, the iterative update of equipment brings not only the problem of equipment adaptation, but also the need for matching tactical means and tactics to promote the company&#39;s preparation for war. Transformation and capability upgrading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to form combat effectiveness as soon as possible, the then company commander Wang Xiaolin led the backbone of the company&#39;s cadres to make their own standards and lesson plans, and conduct tactical drills &quot;crossing the river by feeling for the stones.&quot; They stayed at the training ground during the day and in the equipment room at night. They studied hard for more than two months and finally achieved a comprehensive improvement in combat effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;At that time, I stayed up late to study every night, often until one or two in the morning.&quot; Xiang Jinwen still has a vivid memory of staying up late to train. , I didn’t stay in bed early the next morning and continued to get up early to learn new equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the same type of companies, the Second Company was the first to receive inspections and the first to carry out course demonstrations, achieving the brigade&#39;s goal of &quot;forming combat effectiveness that year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the &quot;model company&quot; in the brigade, there are countless cases where the Second Company worked together to overcome difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The company is responsible for researching multiple subjects and researching tactics on a daily basis. However, these tasks are arduous and complex, and there is no way I can complete them with my own strength. .&quot; Whenever he reaches a bottleneck, his comrades will actively crowd around Zhang Peijin. They will work together on the training ground to optimize tactics and tactics during the day, and work overtime at night to sum up experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Peijin said, &quot;I know that I am not fighting alone. I have a group of brothers to help me share the burden.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;In this year&#39;s platoon tactical assessment organized by the brigade, the first platoon of the second company was selected to represent the company in the assessment. After competing with more than a dozen teams on the same stage, the Second Company relied on its advantages in unmanned equipment operation to leave other units far behind and won the first place in the assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In order to prepare for the assessment, we practiced day and night, especially focusing on the use of unmanned equipment at night. Now all main battle equipment operators have mastered the company&#39;s proficiency How to operate and use unmanned equipment.&quot; Platoon leader Liu Chu was very proud, &quot;We have broken down this hard nut together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;(Southern Weekend interns Feng Jiayi, Jiang Lai, Lin Xi, and Zhang Xinyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄防长绍伊古：对话应该以公平对等、互相尊重的原则为基础]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259645]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“地产界胖东来”，藏在河南县城里]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/30/3yjITVsPZdpbDWKMqUtLmROFxXokwM5Z19pD9tM5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/3yjITVsPZdpbDWKMqUtLmROF xXokwM5Z19pD9tM5. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256134&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A real estate developed by Yedu. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Wei Lincong/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when leading real estate companies are experiencing explosive growth, small businesses hidden in Henan counties Real estate companies have attracted the attention of the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are too many people coming to visit, which even affects the normal operation of the company, Henan Yedu Real Estate Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yedu) limits the reception time to once a week, and each visitor is 300 Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This small real estate company rooted in Qingfeng County, Puyang City received more than 300 groups of visitors in 2022. Not only real estate peers, but also various companies such as medical, education, catering, etc. came in droves, calling it &quot;the fattest company in the real estate industry&quot;. Come east&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like the legendary Pang Donglai in the supermarket industry, Yedu also strives to provide products and services that exceed first-tier standards. In the buildings it builds, a gym and a reading room are standard features. The community trash cans are cleaned three times a day, and the sewers in the employee cafeteria are washed twice a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Yedu only started engaging in real estate development in 2010, and only developed 6 properties in 10 years, all located in Qingfeng County. This county in northeastern Henan has a total population of 750,000. The county’s GDP in 2022 is 23.77 billion yuan, which is only about half of Henan Construction Real Estate’s 2021 revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;170 kilometers south of Qingfeng County, Henan Jinsha Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinsha) in Shangqiu City also received a large number of visitors. At the end of October 2023, a real estate consulting agency in Beijing regarded Sands as a benchmark real estate company and organized more than 40 real estate company executives from 12 provinces to visit and exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The size of Jinsha is not large. The company has developed 40 properties in the past 16 years, distributed in 8 counties and cities in Shangqiu. The GDP of this eastern Henan city in 2022 ranks 7th among the 18 cities in Henan, just exceeding 300 billion yuan, less than 1/4 of Zhengzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in a county where the average price is more than 5,000 yuan, real estate in Jinsha has been sold for more than 10,000 yuan. The community property also provides wedding services, free physical examinations, etc. to the owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many senior practitioners in the Henan real estate industry told Southern Weekend reporters that in fact, before 2021, the local real estate circle paid little attention to county real estate companies such as Yedu and Jinsha. “At this stage, everyone is thinking that the future development direction of real estate may be to produce products and services.” One of them said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Luxury homes&quot; in the county&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Yedu delivered its second property in Qingfeng County. This property has a light yellow facade and a European-style door that stands out in the county. It was the previous year that Yedu proposed the concept of &quot;refinement&quot; and the company&#39;s headquarters was built next to this building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of October 2023, Yedu will deliver its seventh project. Sun Chaoyang, a company executive who has been with the company for more than ten years, told Southern Weekend reporters that the company spent four months on the facade in order to make it look better. &quot;The colors and lines were adjusted over and over again, which made several paint suppliers lose their temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a community that has been delivered, the green trees downstairs were trimmed into a spherical shape. A staff member told the Southern Weekend reporter with a Henan accent that this was improved after the company returned from studying in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cleaning staff in the community immediately stopped the broom in their hands when they saw the visitors, smiled and said hello, with makeup still on their young faces. According to work requirements, she has to use a high-pressure water gun to clean every trash can in the community from the inside out three times a day. Yedu&#39;s recruitment requirements for cleaners are under 45 years old, and the monthly salary is more than 5,000 yuan, which is double the county average. According to Anjuke, the average price of properties currently on sale in Yedu is about 5,000 yuan per square meter, which is generally 700 to 800 yuan higher than the price of houses in the same area. Especially in the base camp of Qingfeng County, where the average price of new houses is only about 3,000 yuan, Yedu can be called a &quot;luxury house&quot; in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinsha said in a recent official WeChat push that &quot;7 rare pine trees&quot; were transplanted at the entrance of one of its properties in Xiayi County, Shangqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of home buyers. Sands Real Estate consultants said that the prices of real estate developed by the company are generally higher than those of regional projects, and the average price of high-end projects can reach 15,000/square meter. According to Anjuke data, this price is 10,000 yuan/square meter higher than the average price of new homes in Shangqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The one who shouted the slogan of &quot;refinement&quot; earlier was Yongwei Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yongwei). Yongwei Real Estate was established in Zhengzhou, Henan in 2005. There was a jingle circulating in the Henan real estate circle: &quot;Yongwei has three treasures: good building materials, landscape and properties.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jinsha directly used Yongwei&#39;s jingle. A person in charge of Yongwei told a Southern Weekend reporter that in order to learn from Yongwei, Sands founder Yang Limin even bought a house in a property developed by Yongwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Yanqing, president of Rand Consulting Company, has been engaged in real estate consulting and investment for more than 20 years. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that refinement means controlling quality during the construction process. Assume that there are three seams on the floor, wall, and ceiling. Fine construction must ensure that the three seams are aligned to avoid misaligned seams and damage to the aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that as early as 2013, major real estate companies had proposed the concept of refinement. However, the real estate market has developed rapidly, high leverage and high turnover models have become popular, and scale has replaced quality as a more important indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yongwei has taken a refined route since 2007, with Zhengzhou as its base camp, and has developed a total of 36 projects. Its high-end projects in Beilong Lake, Zhengzhou, have an average price of more than 60,000 yuan per square meter and are well-known local luxury properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the beginning, Yongwei also learned from his peers. Zhang Yingqian, who is responsible for brand marketing at Kangqiao Real Estate, a local real estate company in Zhengzhou, told Southern Weekend reporters that Kangqiao relies on quality to build its reputation. The upstart Yongwei once poached a team of dozens of people from Kangqiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yingqian has been in the industry for more than ten years. She said that at the beginning of development, major real estate companies competed on quality and built benchmark projects at all costs. &quot;From 0 to 1, we mainly rely on products, so we all take the refined route, because we can only obtain the first batch of seed customers through products.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially in the Henan real estate market, because real estate companies With large quantities, competition for quality is even fiercer. Data from the China Real Estate Association shows that the number of real estate companies in Henan will exceed 8,000 in 2022, ranking fourth in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After rapid development, Zhengzhou real estate companies have passed the primitive accumulation stage, while county real estate companies are experiencing a breakthrough from 0 to 1. The quality competition that once occurred in the Zhengzhou market is now being staged again in the county. Zhang Yingqian revealed that in the past two years, Sands has poached marketing, engineering, design and other managers from Kangqiao Real Estate with high salaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lessons from High Leverage&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Spurred by the housing reform policy, Henan’s real estate market also began to take off around 2016. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the sales area of ​​commercial housing in Zhengzhou exceeded 30 million square meters in 2016, more than double the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s just like picking up money.” Wang Zhixing, who is responsible for brand planning in Yedu, told Southern Weekend reporters. At that time, he was working as a sales agent for new houses in Anyang City. He often closed the houses as soon as they were launched. Sales were so hot that he didn&#39;t even need a sales department. He just started selling houses with an advertising slogan. The quality of each property is not compared, but location and price are more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More foreign real estate companies are also entering Henan. Following Evergrande and Country Garden, large-scale real estate companies such as Sunac, Jinke, and Blu-ray successively entered Henan around 2016 to capture land. Local real estate companies are lining up to go public, and CCRE is gradually moving down, covering more than 100 county-level cities in Henan by 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Chaoyang also recalled that the county market was also booming at that time. &quot;As long as you get the land in your hands, you don&#39;t have to pay attention to any products, you can sell it quickly and get money back quickly.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Yedu slowed down its land acquisition. At that time, the company wanted to be &quot;slower and more stable.&quot; , which is related to the setbacks encountered at the beginning of starting a business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yedu first got involved in real estate in 2010. The founder, Cheng Xiaofeng, made his first pot of gold through steel trading. His father worked for Anyang Iron and Steel Group and took him from his hometown of Anyang to Qingfeng County, Puyang next door. a piece of land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Xiaofeng, who was born in 1980, entered the society as a teenager. In his early years, he worked as a chef and drove a truck. After attracting attention in Yedu, he rarely appeared in public. He has stayed in the company for a long time and knows almost every employee. He often tells the story of his entrepreneurial days in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the threshold for investing in real estate in Anyang and Puyang was not high. Wang Zhixing entered the industry in 2011. He remembers that he only had to pay a deposit of 10% of the land price to obtain land. The first project he sold as an agent covered an area of ​​70 acres, and he only paid 2.1 million yuan to start development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Chaoyang said that when developing the first real estate, the company had little own funds and mainly relied on external borrowings from banks and individuals. Due to lack of development experience, the project lost more than 100 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Phoenix Weekly, a private fund-raising collapse occurred in Anyang in 2012. Since the local boom in private lending in 2009, more than 300 high-interest savings companies have been created, and at least more than 20 billion in funds have been involved, flowing into real estate, energy and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A local real estate company executive recalled that Anyang’s fundraising had a great impact on the financial environment of the entire region. Banks began to withdraw loans and personal loans were required to be returned in advance. Yedu was also affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So starting from the second project, Yedu no longer relied on external financing. &quot;I just think I can&#39;t make quick money.&quot; Sun Chaoyang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, under the market conditions at that time, land prices continued to be pushed up. By 2018, one acre of land in Puyang soared to 1.8 million yuan, and Yedu, which only relied on its own funds, had no advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another limitation was that Yedu did not have many employees at the time. County companies have difficulty recruiting people, and their personnel reserves are not enough to support company expansion. It was not until 2020 that Yedu had developed for 10 years and the number of employees had increased to about one hundred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Yedu, Jinsha did not make many moves when the market was booming in the past few years. Practitioners in the Zhengzhou real estate circle know very little about it. One of the senior practitioners concluded that due to capital and personnel constraints, it is difficult for county real estate companies to compete with large real estate companies during their rapid growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Developing against the trend&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is unique about Henan is that the county market still leaves room for survival for local small real estate companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data released by the Henan Provincial Government show that the urbanization rate of Henan&#39;s permanent population in 2022 is 57.07%, which is 8.15 percentage points lower than the national average. Data from the Qingfeng County Bureau of Statistics show that the local urbanization rate in 2022 is only 35.12%&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;National real estate companies also entered the county market during large-scale expansion, which once had an impact on local small real estate companies. Sun Chaoyang introduced that around 2018, Country Garden, Jianye, etc. successively entered Qingfeng County. Under the impact, Yedu’s sales fell by 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with low housing prices and limited profit margins in the county, it is not a key market for large real estate companies. In addition, the company is large and its management radius is difficult to reach the county seat. After several years of development, Country Garden has only developed two properties in Qingfeng County, while Jianye has cooperated with local developers to develop in an asset-light manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For small real estate companies that have taken root in the county, this low-profit market is a place to settle down. Sun Chaoyang believes that the demand for home purchases in the regional market still exists, especially as part of the investment demand has been converted into demand for second home purchases. Through intensive cultivation and improving quality while controlling costs, county real estate companies have made profits from this customer group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2020, under the control of real estate policies such as the &quot;Three Red Lines&quot;, the credit environment has tightened. Coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economic environment, the high-leverage and high-turnover model has been impacted, and large real estate companies that rely on this model to develop have experienced explosive growth. However, small real estate companies in the county have bucked the trend and developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Chaoyang introduced that Yedu began to expand out of Qingfeng County in 2020, opening 11 new properties in three years, and increasing its employees by more than 300 people. During this period, the market was sluggish and land prices in the county fell. Yedu seized the opportunity to acquire more than 500 acres of land at once, saving more than 200 million in land costs compared with the high price period in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ability to buck the trend and acquire land is due to the company’s low debt ratio. Yedu uses its own funds to develop projects and does not use bank loans. The current cash flow is sufficient to ensure the company&#39;s normal operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The boss’s words are that we can stop doing nothing for half a year.” Wang Zhixing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sands, which has also developed rapidly after 2020, also announced on its official WeChat account that the company’s debt ratio has remained at 5%-10% all year round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/u4BoW0srd2cdubOGlD0MGp9PIheyOoeZb7GocKLC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height= &quot;908&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/30/u4BoW0srd2cdubOGlD0MGp9PIheyOoeZb7GocKLC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256135&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yedu transformed the sales department into a life experience center, and learned that Fat Donglai opened a supermarket next to it. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Wei Lincong/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;How much money can you make selling steamed buns?&quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After establishing a foothold in the county, the desire for expansion also appears in small real estate companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the National Day holiday in 2023, Sands went to Zhengzhou to discuss cooperation with major developers, hoping to enter Zhengzhou and build a benchmark project in Beilong Lake, a luxury area. Zhang Yingqian participated in the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This path from product creation to scale expansion feels familiar to Zhang Yingqian. After Kangqiao Real Estate initially built its reputation on its products, financial institutions and consulting companies came to persuade the boss to learn the high-turnover model and expand its scale. Finally, around 2019, a branch was established in Shanghai and began to expand to the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the industry encountered a cold winter just after leaving Henan, and the expansion of Kangqiao Real Estate was hindered. Now, Zhang Yingqian saw in her circle of friends that the consulting company that had persuaded her boss to expand had gone to Jinsha for exchanges again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More and more people came to Yedu for cooperation. Some had money, some had land, and they were invited to Zhengzhou and Beijing with preferential terms. &quot;When the market is bad, there will be more (seeks for cooperation).&quot; Sun Chaoyang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Yedu did not agree. The company&#39;s current development plan still does not extend beyond the northern Henan region where Puyang is located. &quot;Everyone wants to go out, but we should recognize ourselves more clearly. We don&#39;t have the ability to go out now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bigger problem is that the myth of scale created by the high-leverage and high-turnover model has been shattered. Where else can the company go? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite its expansion against the trend, Yedu is inevitably affected by the market environment. Wang Zhixing said that the total monthly sales volume of the company&#39;s four properties in Qingfeng is only more than 100 units. In the past, one property could reach such a level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution Yedu came up with is to transform into services. In 2021, Cheng Xiaofeng proposed to open a pastry shop in the community to sell handmade steamed buns. The employees found it incredible, &quot;How much money can I make selling steamed buns?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the idea was implemented and expanded from the pastry shop to supermarkets, dry cleaning, housekeeping and other services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Yedu opened a 500-square-meter supermarket next to its headquarters. Wang Zhixing introduced that the company spent more than one million yuan in 2022 just to learn how to open a supermarket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pang Donglai, who also lives in Henan, is the key learning target. Yedu Supermarket is equipped with the same Dyson wash basin as Fat Donglai, which costs more than 20,000 yuan. It also provides tea, strollers, free charging and other services. The products are also self-produced just like Fat Donglai. The steamed buns, noodles and bean sprouts are even produced in-house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supermarket staff told Southern Weekend reporters that the company plans to open three more supermarkets of the same size in Qingfeng County where there is a large flow of people, and smaller stores in residential areas. But the first store is not yet profitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yedu’s idea is to provide supporting services for the entire chain of clothing, food, housing and transportation. In the future, it will also develop catering and open pharmacies. Not only for property owners, but also for people throughout the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The company hopes to regard service as its core profit point in the future, and real estate will only be incidental.” Sun Chaoyang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Yingqian and Sun Chaoyang are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[长相与年龄不符意味着什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259588]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;People are growing older all the time, but their appearance does not necessarily keep pace with their age. When the appearance does not match the age and clearly looks older or younger than the actual age, different people will have different explanations for this. Especially if you look older than your actual age, it is often interpreted as premature aging. In fact, many scientific studies support the reasoning that there are actually signs of aging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A long-term follow-up heart study in Copenhagen found that gray hair, facial wrinkles and male baldness are several obvious signs of aging, which may indicate that people have a higher risk of myocardial infarction, especially People with much longer gray hair have a significantly higher risk than those without gray hair. In addition to these specific external characteristics, the general feeling of &quot;looking older&quot; also has reference significance for assessing health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to guess a person’s age based on visual information alone due to the interference of external factors such as clothing and grooming. In 2016, researchers from the Institute of Public Health at the University of Southern Denmark conducted a comparative study on nearly two hundred groups of identical twins and found that even if twins have the same genes and very similar looks, people can still tell the difference between their faces. Read the clues to aging too quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These elderly twins were over 70 years old as early as 2001. Researchers asked people to guess the age of the elderly people through their ID photos. The results found that whether it was changing their faces or dressing up, it would affect the age of the elderly people. People&#39;s perceptions of the age of the elderly. Statistics more than a decade later also show that the older twin is more likely to die earlier. Facial cues become a predictor of risk of survival or death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although many studies have discovered some health secrets hidden behind the face, there are not many studies that systematically analyze the relationship between appearance and aging. In order to clarify what it means to look inconsistent with age, in March 2023, researchers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands and other institutions tried to investigate how people&#39;s perceived age is related to a series of aging by analyzing more data. relationship between diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Look younger and healthier&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As expected, the results were as expected. Corresponding to the higher risk of older-looking people, those who looked younger than they actually were Younger people, who are at lower risk for many age-related diseases, also have better cognitive function overall. Relevant research was published in the British Journal of Dermatology, providing a certain reference for scientific face reading. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The phenomenon of appearance and age inconsistency is very common in daily life. In order to understand this phenomenon more scientifically and deeply, we must first distinguish three concepts about age. In addition to sensory age, which can be assessed by people&#39;s appearance alone, chronological age and physiological age are also more valuable references for health and aging. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daniel W. Belsky, an associate professor at Columbia University School of Public Health who has long studied aging issues, told Southern Weekend reporters, “Actual age measures the time since birth, while physiological age It is a measure of health. A physiological age value can be understood as a person&#39;s typical health status at this actual age.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, according to the normal aging rate, a person in good health will Their biological age should be close to or even consistent with their actual age. But in reality, some people&#39;s biological age will deviate significantly from their actual age, showing an atypical health state. Among them, if the biological age is younger than the actual age, it means that the overall health status is better than that of the average person of the same age, while the biological age is greater than the actual age, the degree of aging is deeper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The analysis of sensory age in the latest research actually explores the possibility of identifying aging through a simple way of vision, and the results show that looking younger is indeed associated with a higher risk of various diseases. lower. Specifically, looking five years younger than your actual age has a significantly lower risk of osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cataracts, and hearing loss, as well as better cognitive performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These results are based on the analysis of health data of more than 2,600 European middle-aged and elderly people. It is worth noting that the age distribution of the people included in the study ranges from their fifties to their eighties and are in the process of age-related diseases. Significantly elevated stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Young people’s bodies are not necessarily young&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although current relevant research focuses on middle-aged and elderly people, it does not mean that the rhythm of maturity and aging is only in It starts to accelerate suddenly after entering middle age. There is evidence that among young people in their twenties and thirties, as their chronological age steadily increases, the gap in their biological ages begins to appear. Looking at specific manifestations, people who age faster have poorer physical abilities, cognitive decline, and brain aging. These people often feel that their health is getting worse and they look older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2015. What&#39;s even more cruel is that these observed aging gaps occur between the ages of 26 and 38. The same 38-year-old is not yet middle-aged, but the physiological age of different people is obviously different. Daniel Belsky, now an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Center for Aging Research at Columbia University, was involved in the study. Over a period of nearly 12 years, researchers recorded changes in a range of physiological indicators in nearly a thousand participants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Aging is a process that begins early in life. We can see signs of it in healthy young people, and some people age faster than others already at a young age. Therefore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and seeking an environment with clean air and water are safe and reliable, and creating opportunities to participate in social interactions is also a priority.&quot; Daniel Belsky told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In some aspects , this is all self-evident. But it is important to realize that even in youth, which we tend to think of as indestructible, our lifestyle and environment can influence the trajectory of our aging, with long-lasting consequences.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;At present, it is not easy to study aging, because compared with the life span of animals such as mice, which can be quickly observed in animal studies, the time span from birth to death in humans is much longer. After entering middle-aged and old age, the increase in age-related diseases makes it easier to observe people&#39;s aging. Relatively speaking, the signs of aging in young people are less easy to detect. However, when it comes to delaying aging, young people actually have more time and opportunities to make changes to improve their own health. Therefore, identifying the signs of aging as early as possible and understanding the laws of aging are of great significance to alleviating the pressure on global public health in the context of aging. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Perceiving the Signs of Aging Early&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I’m not sure individuals really need to measure their biological age.” explains Daniel Belsky, Popular Aging needs to be measured in medical research, not only to identify factors that accelerate or delay aging, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of some anti-aging projects, policies, life interventions and drug therapies. &quot;However, for those who do want to know more about their aging and health, there are a range of tools on the market that can help estimate biological age, from blood tests to DNA tests. These tests themselves are not dangerous, but the results should Interpret with caution, and it is best to interpret relevant results with the help of healthcare professionals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, a research report published in &quot;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&quot; It shows that chest X-ray examination, an already widely used technology, may be used to assist in the assessment of human aging. By training and developing related artificial intelligence models, the researchers used chest radiographs to estimate the age of the client. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that for relatively healthy people, the age estimated by artificial intelligence through chest X-rays has a strong correlation with the actual age. But for people with pre-existing medical conditions, the difference between estimated and actual age is associated with multiple chronic conditions, identifying increased risk for hypertension, interstitial lung disease, chronic renal failure, and more. This means that common picture information such as chest X-rays may become an aging biomarker to help people evaluate the status of chronic diseases and even predict life span, while improving the level of personalized intervention and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with these methods that rely on medical equipment, looking at faces directly and roughly assessing aging and related health risks based on whether appearance matches age is obviously more concise, although the accuracy is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it should be noted that, including looking at faces to assess sensory age, many relevant studies currently include thousands of samples, but the sources are relatively single and lack sufficient representation. Differences actually play an important role in sensory age assessment, which is also an obvious limitation of related research so far. Whether the health implications of appearance and age mismatch are effective in all types of communities remains to be confirmed by more research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparative studies on skin aging have long found that the skin aging trajectories of Asians and Europeans are very different. Taking Chinese and French women as an example, a small sample study shows that Chinese women start to develop wrinkles on their faces almost ten years later than French women. This time difference will make Chinese women look significantly younger at this time, but by the age of four In their teens, Chinese women will experience rapid aging in terms of facial wrinkles, showing a non-linear trend. In comparison, French women&#39;s aging in this aspect is relatively stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such as this, due to the differences in facial development between different races, the accuracy of applying the sensory experience of one group to predict the age of people in another group will be relatively limited. In addition, there are cultural differences in how people dress in different societies. If we understand the phenomenon of appearance and age mismatch in a cross-cultural context, we may find different rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Efforts to delay aging&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, when it comes to looking at faces, whether appearance matches age is only one aspect. In 2022, biological research also found that there may be a connection between physical attractiveness and health indicators such as immune function. After a series of experiments and tests, researchers found that people who were more physically attractive also had better immune performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Summer Mengelkoch, an experimental social psychology researcher at Texas Christian University who participated in this study, told Southern Weekend reporters that although a person who cares too much about physical attractiveness may appear They are very superficial, but their research shows that when people pay attention to the physical attractiveness of their partners, they may actually care about more than just looks, and may also use this to select a healthy partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latest research starts from the gap between sensory age and actual age, providing more evidence for scientific face reading. By identifying the signs and risk factors of aging as early as possible, you can take action to slow down aging. In May 2023, researchers from Harvard Medical School found in studies on mice and humans that physiological age will fluctuate in both directions under the influence of stress. When stress is excessive, physiological age will increase, and after recovery from stress, physiological age will increase. Age will reverse repair. This may provide a suitable entry point for future interventions targeting aging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether we are middle-aged or still young. To promote healthy aging, the things we can do are actually the same. Eat a healthy diet, do a lot of physical activities, and participate in family activities. , socializing with friends and community, cultivating a sense of purpose and meaning, and avoiding toxic stress and pollution.&quot; Daniel Belsky emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The scientific community is now developing new drugs that can slow down physiological aging and extend the healthy life cycle. At the same time, we already know how to promote healthy aging by changing the environment in which we live—reducing pollution, ensuring safe and secure housing, and providing affordable and healthy food. We should invest in these areas as well. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从魂魄、中阴身到幽灵Vs魔鬼：万圣节话中西之鬼异同]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259582]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Every year before Halloween comes, all kinds of creative and scary costumes bloom everywhere, and you can constantly watch short videos. Although today&#39;s Halloween is no different from &quot;Cosplay Festival&quot;. But its original &quot;ghost-driving&quot; element is still vaguely visible - even though in modern society, ghosts and gods have long become the objects of ridicule played by humans. However, various countries&#39; understanding of &quot;what is a ghost&quot; still follows thousands of years of tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a wonderful discussion and definition of &quot;what is a ghost&quot; in &quot;Book of Rites·Jiyi&quot;: &quot;Zaiwo said: I heard the names of ghosts and gods, but I don&#39;t know what they mean. The Master said: Qi is also , the prosperity of gods. The prosperity of souls, the prosperity of ghosts. The combination of ghosts and gods is the ultimate teaching. All living things must die, and after death they must return to the earth. This is called ghosts.&quot; Zaiwo didn&#39;t understand what ghosts and gods were, so Confucius told him: &quot; God is essence, and ghost is soul. All living things will die, and after death they will return to dust, which are called ghosts.&quot; - Confucius played a homophonic joke here: ghosts are all living things. ultimate destination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of this, in China’s oldest traditions, ghosts and gods are often not clearly distinguished. As the saying goes, &quot;Ghosts are ancestors, and ancestors are also ghosts.&quot; The Confucian attitude towards ghosts and gods is also very interesting. Confucius once said: &quot;Respect ghosts and gods and keep them at a distance.&quot; He also said: &quot;If you can&#39;t serve people, how can you serve ghosts?&quot; In short, he tried his best to avoid the issue of ghosts and gods, and even showed an agnostic tendency to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Confucianism places great emphasis on respecting ancestors and offering sacrifices on time. If ghosts and gods do not exist at all, then what are they worshiping? Confucius added another patch to this: &quot;Sacrifice to the gods as if they were present, and sacrifice to the gods as if the gods were present. Confucius said: If I don&#39;t offer sacrifices, it would be as if I didn&#39;t offer sacrifices.&quot; In other words, when offering sacrifices to ancestors, it seems as if the ancestors are really in front of you; when offering sacrifices to gods, It was as if God was really in front of me. Confucius also said that if I do not personally participate in the sacrifice, the sacrifice will be the same as no sacrifice. From this, it can be seen that Confucius emphasized that those who participate in the sacrifice should have pious emotions in their hearts. According to Confucianism, sacrifice is a moral ritual used to unite the community, rather than a religious ritual used to pray for blessings and ward off disasters. Therefore, salutes are just out of recalling the feelings of ancestors. As the saying goes, &quot;sages teach with Shinto.&quot; And the sacrifices are mainly for the living people to see: &quot;Be careful and pursue the long distance, and the people&#39;s virtue will be strong.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From today&#39;s perspective, Confucius&#39;s view is very advanced. However, on the other hand, it seems to be contradictory to avoid the issue of ghosts and gods while requiring people to worship sincerely. Mohism, the lifelong enemy of Confucianism, once seized this point and vigorously ridiculed Confucianism. Contrary to Confucianism, Mohism strives to prove the real existence of ghosts and gods, so it regards sacrifice as more important than Confucianism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Taoism, the attitude is more distinct than that of Confucianism. It is believed that after death, one returns to heaven and earth, and there is no such thing as ghosts and gods. Therefore, &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; sings with drums and pots, and &quot;Liehzi&quot; believes that death means eternal rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when Mozi argued that &quot;the ghosts and gods must be solemnly sacrificed&quot;, he also exposed his true thoughts: &quot;Although the ghosts and gods are asked to die, this can still bring joy to the crowd and get relatives in the hometown&quot;—— &quot;Even if there are really no ghosts and gods, we can still connect with the villagers through ritual gatherings.&quot; This is the same as Confucianism, which shows that Mozi&#39;s own belief was not so firm. After all, it is hard to imagine that monotheistic believers would say, &quot;Even if there is really no God, belief in God can have the following benefits...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the Mohist school, which emphasizes ghosts and gods the most among the local schools, has this kind of attitude towards the existence of ghosts and gods. Attitude, it is not difficult to understand why the early setting of the underworld in Chinese mythology is so monotonous. Before the introduction and prosperity of Buddhism, although China had the concept of the underworld, it was still very simple: the underworld is the destination of the soul and is controlled by the Lord Taishan, but there is no such thing as hell; and although the story of reincarnation appeared very early, it is not It is regarded as a fixed procedure in the underworld, and is just an anecdote similar to &quot;seizing the body&quot; in later generations. Therefore, there is no concept of reincarnation and rebirth. For the ancients, death still means eternal separation and tranquility. As the saying goes, &quot;What is the way to die? The body is supported by the same mountain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to hell after death is also the oldest view of life and death in China. It is still used as a euphemism for death to this day. There is also a famous story here, where Zheng Zhuanggong dug into the ground to meet his mother:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Zheng Zhuanggong decided that his younger brother had rebelled, he was very angry with his mother Wu Jiang who favored his younger brother. He put Wu Jiang under house arrest in Yingdi, and swore a poisonous oath: &quot;It&#39;s not as good as Huangquan, and we won&#39;t see each other again.&quot; This means we won&#39;t see each other until we die. As a result, Ying Kaoshu, an official of Yingdi, successfully persuaded Duke Zhuang of Zheng and aroused his family affection and filial piety. But Duke Zhuang still used the oath of poison as an excuse, so Uncle Yingkao said: &quot;This is easy to do. We can dig tunnels until the yellow spring water is dug out, and build an underground courtyard there. Can&#39;t you guys meet?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;So Zhuang Gong, mother and son were able to meet in the tunnel. They hugged each other and cried, and reconciled as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people were speechless when they first read this paragraph: they reconciled as before, but the problem is that Zheng Zhuanggong and his mother didn&#39;t like each other at first... And the Yellow Spring is really a yellow spring? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, Huangquan Temple comes from burial. After death, people go underground, not just Huangquan. Most scholars believe that the original meaning of Huangquan is underground water, because many three-generation ancient tombs are located below the water level. When Buddhism brought reincarnation in, it combined with the view of Huangquan to create &quot;Hell&quot; (Naluka) - the Indian native &quot;Naluka&quot;, which is more similar to a parallel universe or an alien space. After death, people will enter this Space is judged; but Chinese tradition believes that after death, people must go underground. Therefore, the Buddhists had no choice but to move &quot;Naluojia&quot; underground, which gave it the name &quot;Hell&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reincarnation of Buddhism is inherited from the traditional setting of Hinduism. There are actually similar theories all over the world. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato often mentioned reincarnation in his books. But for most civilizations, this theory is just an anecdote, not a universally accepted assumption. Only in South Asia, reincarnation is the axiomatic basis of all religions and philosophies. Even the reason why the Buddha became a monk was to find the right path to escape the suffering of reincarnation. Buddhism believes that if all living beings are freed from reincarnation, it means the end of all &quot;suffering&quot;. This is what Buddhism says &quot;all living beings are suffering&quot;. Beings who are not in the &quot;reincarnation&quot; are no longer sentient beings, but Buddhas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Buddhist theory of reincarnation is obviously in conflict with China’s native sacrifices. In order to solve this conflict, there are various patches, such as &quot;Ghosts queue up in the underworld to be reincarnated, and they have to live during the lottery.&quot; This &quot;lottery&quot; state between two reincarnations and two deaths is called the &quot;bardo&quot; in Buddhism. But this patch is still incomplete - the emperor wants to offer sacrifices to his ancestors. Is it because the ancestors have waited hundreds of years and still not passed away? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after Taoism absorbed the concept of reincarnation, it added another patch: humans have three souls and seven souls, and the three souls are the heaven soul, the earth soul, and the life soul. What dissipates after death is not the soul, but the soul. The three souls reincarnate after death, the heavenly soul goes to heaven, and the earthly soul lives in the ancestral hall or tomb. Therefore, before a person&#39;s life soul is reincarnated, all the money burned is for the life soul. The soul of life is reincarnated, and what is burned is for the soul of earth. Different Taoist schools have different patch theories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in modern times, Christianity has brought heaven into the world, and the situation has become even more confusing: After death, a person can enjoy the sacrifices of his descendants in the underworld and enter the six realms of reincarnation. Can he also watch his descendants in heaven at the same time? Some people have tried to reconcile this: after death, people enter Hades to be judged. After the verdict, the guilty go to reincarnation or hell, and the innocent ascend to heaven where they are, and accept sacrifices, perfect. In fact, these are not important, because the Chinese people&#39;s attitude towards life and death still comes from Confucianism: everything is a moral ceremony rather than a religious ceremony, and everything is to comfort the living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Christian attitude towards ghosts, it is also very interesting to study in detail: the devil (Satan, the devil) or demons (that is, the fallen angels who follow the devil) we often call, although they are translated as &quot;ghosts&quot;, But it is not the same thing as Chinese ghosts. The ghost that the Chinese talk about is closer to the ghost that the Europeans talk about. According to the Bible, after death, the soul will sleep with the body, waiting for the arrival of judgment and resurrection in the last days. People who belong to Christ will go to the Kingdom of God after death, which the Bible calls the new heaven and new earth; people who do not belong to Christ will go to the Kingdom of God after death. Imprisoned in Hades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Christianity believes that ghost phenomena in the world are all illusions made by Satan, and there are no ghosts in the world at all. Some Christians believe in the existence of ghosts, but are opposed to any form of communication with them because the Old Testament repeatedly warns against ghost communication rituals. Therefore, we can see that ghosts rarely appear in European and American ghost films. Vampires, werewolves, and cursed children are the common protagonists - but even these ghosts are also opposed by Christianity. Therefore, every year on Halloween, there are still Christian churches in Europe and the United States advocating a boycott and advocating that if children come to ask for candy, they can be given a Bible or a cross as a gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海关总署：11月1日起出入境人员免于填报健康申明卡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259653]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 10:42:24&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and its implementation rules, the General Administration of Customs decided to Starting from 0:00 on November 1, 2023, entry and exit personnel are exempted from filling in the &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Entry/Exit Health Declaration Card&quot;, but they have infectious diseases such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and unexplained subcutaneous bleeding.

In terms of net profit alone, the four major state-owned banks have surpassed their international peers: in the first half of 2023, the total exceeded 603.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than twenty years ago, the four major banks fell into &quot;technical bankruptcy.&quot; After China&#39;s accession to the WTO, the country&#39;s door opened wide, and foreign banks entered China frequently, and since 2006 they have enjoyed national treatment. Observers and the industry have been crying wolf for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China Construction Bank and Bank of China were designated by the State Council as pilot projects for the shareholding reform of wholly state-owned banks, and were expected to &quot;transform into internationally competitive modern joint-stock commercial banks in about three years.&quot; After unprecedented financial restructuring and the introduction of international strategic investment, China Construction Bank and Bank of China were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2005 and 2006 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move has clarified a replicable path for the shareholding reform and listing of ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China. As Jiang Jianqing, the then chairman of ICBC, said, the joint-stock reform is a glorious prelude to the reform of my country&#39;s state-owned banks. It is also a desperate battle with no retreat and a reform that cannot afford to lose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the glorious prologue, strengthening corporate governance is an important task. Under layer upon layer supervision, the four major industries are moving inwards and innovating continuously. A clean financial statement trusted by global investors is an example of 20 years of practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and Ernst &amp; Young are the four internationally renowned accounting firms (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;). Among them, Deloitte China Vice Chairman Wu Weijun has served as the Bank of China and China Postal Savings The signing accountant for the stock reform and listing of banks. The former is the pilot stock reform and listing of China&#39;s state-owned banks, and the latter is the final project of the stock reform and listing of China&#39;s state-owned banks. He is praised by the financial industry for participating in and leading the design of a &quot;bank reform roadmap&quot; suitable for China&#39;s national conditions, and providing technical guidance for promoting the reform of the four major state-owned commercial banks in the three areas of corporate governance, financial reporting and capital restructuring. He is also known as the accountant most familiar with China&#39;s state-owned banks, as he has served as the signing accountant for Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China. Today, he has served as the signing accountant for the annual report of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for three consecutive years. As early as more than 20 years ago, he served as a partner of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, actively promoted the implementation of the localization transformation plan of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, and has been committed to playing the role of auditors as &quot;gatekeepers&quot; in the capital market. &quot; value and have a &quot;capital eye&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a fellow traveler in the great era of China&#39;s banking reform and opening up, on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of China&#39;s financial reform and opening up, Wu Weijun repeatedly emphasized in an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend that the reform of China&#39;s four major state-owned commercial banks is a The results and historical significance of the arduous reform despite all difficulties are also remarkable. Today, the world is facing major changes unseen in a century, and China&#39;s financial industry will face huge historical challenges. At this important moment in the deepening and development of international and domestic finance, the presence of Chinese financial entrepreneurs is crucial. They will lead Chinese financial companies to shift from expanding externally to strengthening connotation with high quality. He personally is willing to continue to serve the development of the country&#39;s financial industry professionally. “It is the most glorious thing in my profession that the accounting statements I sign can be recognized by the international capital market and international supervision.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Weijun particularly emphasized the internationalization of talents. &quot;I suggest that Chinese enterprises comprehensively review the existing international talent training system and build an advanced international talent competency model.

He was not only the first Chinese partner of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, but also the first to obtain the British Chartered Certified Accountant after 1949. Qualified Mainland Chinese. During his more than 30-year career, he has worked in mainland China, Hong Kong, New York, London and Sydney, and has participated in, promoted and witnessed many historic transformational events in the financial and accounting fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1993 to 1994, he assisted American expert Tom Macy in serving the People’s Bank of China’s Financial System Prudential Supervision Reform Consulting Project, introducing the most basic risks into the risk management of commercial banks. Evaluation method - five-level classification of loans, and establish an accounting system for the Chinese banking industry that can be basically understood and accepted by international organizations and global peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When assessing the historical value and even the impact of these two events on today, he said, &quot;The impact of these two events cannot be overemphasized. The accounting system of commercial banks is in line with international standards and has provided international Investors and counterparties recognize our banks, and the Basel banking regulatory system accepts our banks, creating conditions for state-owned commercial banks to establish accounting controls, risk management and modern corporate governance systems. The five-level loan classification not only provides banks with It provides basic risk management tools, helps maintain asset quality, and also provides regulatory agencies with a regulatory grip for financial stability. This is the institutional foundation for modern financial development. It is important to realize that the institutional construction for the development of China&#39;s modern financial industry only takes 30 years In two years, we still have a lot to learn and improve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, he experienced an unforgettable memory in his career - participating in and leading the design of the &quot;Bank Reform Roadmap.&quot; He commented on this, &quot;The reform of China&#39;s four major state-owned commercial banks is an arduous reform that overcomes all difficulties. But its results and historical significance are significant.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can the reform persist and advance rapidly? Wu Weijun said, &quot;Supporting such a difficult banking reform to move forward is the determination of the central government&#39;s top management, as well as the professionalism and courage of the leaders at the executive level. At that time, I was the only one in the leadership team of the audit team who grew up in mainland China. . I very much want to carry out the reform of China’s banking industry and bring China’s state-owned banks into the ranks of the international banking industry. If the accounting statements I sign can be recognized by the international capital market and international supervision, it will be a great achievement in my major. The most glorious thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also participated in the formulation and implementation of the localization transformation plan of the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms from 2010 to 2012. &quot;I value the inheritance of professionalism. Professionalism has two supporting points, one is moral integrity, and the other is professional service to the country, because the premise of professionalism is patriotism. Professionalism is the foundation of professionals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that in financial companies, the work of external auditors has special characteristics, that is, high-quality external audits are not only needed to protect the rights and interests of shareholders, but also to meet the regulatory compliance needs of domestic and foreign banks, and are also global financial and commodity trading counterparties. needs for party exposure risk management. The total on-balance sheet assets of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, where he serves as the signing accountant, exceed 40 trillion yuan. He told the team that they must make professional efforts to help ICBC increase its return on assets, even if it is only one ten thousandth. One ten thousandth of 40 trillion yuan in assets is 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only serving the banking industry, in important overseas capital markets, the &quot;Big Four&quot; members generally serve more than 70% of the listed companies. At present, China&#39;s capital market has become the second largest market in the world, but as of the end of October 2023, there were about 5,300 A-share listed companies, of which the number of companies with audit reports issued by the &quot;Big Four&quot; Chinese member firms only accounted for about 7%. Faced with such a gap, Wu Weijun believes that there is still much room for improvement in being a &quot;capital eye&quot;, which mainly includes clarifying the relationship between financial information preparers, auditors and regulators in the financial reporting chain and consolidating responsibilities; using large Data analysis and other technological means can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of audits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is generally believed that audit reports signed by the &quot;Big Four&quot; accounting firms, including Deloitte, are a passport to the international capital market.

In the early 1990s, China&#39;s economic system reform entered a new stage of transformation, starting from a &quot;planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as a supplement&quot; to a &quot;socialist market economy&quot; system. In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of a socialist market economic system, and China&#39;s economic system began to undergo profound changes. How can international investors have enough confidence to enter China and understand China? The biggest difficulty in attracting foreign investment at that time was how to convince international investors that the Chinese government could truly embrace the market economy, follow international rules, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors during the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the state-owned bank reform period that began in 2003, state-owned banks What are the difficulties for commercial banks to attract foreign capital to invest in Chinese state-owned banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2002, I served in the restructuring and share reform and listing of Bank of China Hong Kong.

Therefore, we assisted the People’s Bank of China in designing an accounting subject system and introducing the most basic risk assessment method—five-level loan classification. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the general direction of China&#39;s financial industry reform was marketization and internationalization. Both regulators and regulated persons had the enthusiasm and initiative to actively learn from foreign experience. This is the starting point for an international dialogue. Professional service organizations, such as Deloitte, mainly serve as a bridge for dialogue and communication between Chinese regulatory agencies, financial companies and international organizations. When China&#39;s financial institutions were reformed and listed, we played the role of &quot;marrying daughters&quot; and carrying the sedan chair. The gap is not terrible. The terrible thing is that there are no people on both sides of the gap who are willing to take a step forward. In the financial industry, we still don’t have the capital to be proud of. We must have an attitude of walking on thin ice. In the financial battlefield, it is never your competitors who defeat you. This is called professionalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past 20 years, the financial regulatory system has undergone many changes. The China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission were born out of the People&#39;s Bank of China and were established simultaneously in 2003. Later, they were merged into the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission in 2018 until the State Administration of Financial Supervision was listed in 2023. Do you think there is room for change compared to the international regulatory regime? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For China’s financial industry, 2023 is an extraordinary year. China&#39;s financial regulatory system has been transformed into &quot;one committee, one bank, one bureau and one meeting.&quot; No matter how the organization is set up, there is only one room for change, and that is to improve professionalism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of improving China&#39;s regulatory level in the past 20 years, I have put forward my professional opinions in three areas and had a positive impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first point of view is to strengthen the &quot;iron triangle&quot; relationship of financial supervision. This point of view was raised in 2009 after I returned from my secondment at the UK Financial Regulatory Authority. Under the financial regulatory framework, the &quot;iron triangle&quot; relationship refers to the tripartite relationship between the financial regulatory authorities, the central bank and the Ministry of Finance. The financial crisis tests a country&#39;s financial emergency and leadership capabilities. Improving the coordination capabilities of the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; relationship and responding quickly and effectively to crises plays an important role. Solving the problems of the financial system requires more than one government agency alone. Even in normal economic times, the three agencies need to coordinate to provide clear and non-duplicate guidance to the financial system. In terms of unified leadership of the financial system, the coordination and execution capabilities of this &quot;iron triangle&quot; need to continue to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of the Central Financial Working Committee is a need for modern economic and financial management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point of view is to establish a regulatory tripartite negotiation mechanism. This view was raised when I, as a representative of an accounting firm, communicated with the then leaders of the China Banking Regulatory Commission after the establishment of the China Banking Regulatory Commission in March 2003. At that time, I proposed that we should learn from advanced international practices and that the regulatory authorities organize tripartite meetings every year for regulated financial institutions and their external auditors to discuss financial and business risk issues of regulatory concern and arrange regulatory work. Sometimes, closed meetings can even be arranged, where the regulator and the external auditor communicate on important and material issues without the presence of the regulated institution&#39;s management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third point of view is to supervise the shareholders of financial institutions. This was raised seriously by me at a seminar held in Xianghe, Hebei Province in 2005 to prepare for the listing of Bank of China. The bank&#39;s capital adequacy ratio requirement is 8%, which means the bank uses a leverage ratio of 12.5 times. If shareholders are not monitored, banks may be exposed to bad shareholder behavior. Discussion of the proposed regulation of shareholders also extends to Huijin&#39;s management model. I firmly express my support for Huijin’s model and promote Huijin to become a professional management organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, these views of mine can stand the test of time. I believe that some of the views I expressed today will prove to be important 30 years later and will appear on my transcript of professional service to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the structure of my country&#39;s financial regulatory system has been significantly adjusted and optimized. Under the existing regulatory framework, how to improve the effectiveness of the regulatory system and operating mechanisms? In terms of operational effectiveness, the following three articles must be done in particular: first, how to attract and retain the best financial talents to join the financial supervision team; second, how to coordinate supervision between the central bank, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other regulatory authorities Collaboration, how to respect the Ministry of Finance’s status as the last savior, how to give full play to the shareholder supervision role of the Financial SASAC (currently undertaken by Huijin and the Financial Department of the Ministry of Finance); third, how to develop and apply more powerful regulatory technology tools to enhance Supervision quality and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You suggest attracting and retaining the best financial talents to join the regulatory team. In the civil service sector, how to achieve breakthroughs and attract outstanding talents at market prices? Is there anything we can learn from foreign financial regulatory agencies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Financial supervision and fiscal management and other institutions must respect professionalism. They function and are professionally based. We must trust experts and not doubt the patriotism possessed by professionals. Technical talents must be protected and supported in the civil service system. In the British and American financial regulatory systems, only high-level people, such as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, are listed in the civil service system. All other professionals are paid according to market prices. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have said before that the financial industry needs to strengthen supervision . In fact, the financial industry has been tightening regulations. How do you view the relationship between strong supervision and reform and innovation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Strong supervision and reform and innovation are not contradictory and cannot be neglected. Only by strengthening supervision can we prevent and resolve systemic financial risks; only by reform and innovation can we enhance the diversity of financial products and services, enhance the breadth and depth of the financial market, and better meet the financial needs of the people and the real economy. Smart financial entrepreneurs believe that supporting the real economy is supporting the future of the financial industry. The strengthening and bonding of the relationship between the real economy and the financial industry requires financial innovation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strong supervision and reform and innovation are &quot;both necessary&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot;. The key is to balance the relationship between supervision and innovation and grasp the intensity and boundaries of supervision. In short, regulation must be neither insufficient nor excessive. Excessive regulation will hinder reform and innovation for sustainable financial development. Of course, reform and innovation cannot be at the expense of significantly increasing systemic financial risks, and financial behaviors that are divorced from the real economy cannot be condoned. &quot;Idling&quot; financial innovation that is divorced from the real economy and within the financial link is &quot;pseudo-innovation&quot; for the purpose of financial profit-seeking, and must be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“ &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Respect for professionalism is &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;bank reform &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;guarantee of courage in the face of danger &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The regulatory system is constantly changing, and banks are also constantly changing. You have participated in and led the design of the &quot;Bank Reform Roadmap&quot; that suits China&#39;s national conditions. At that time, the four major banks were considered &quot;technically bankrupt&quot; due to their extremely large non-performing assets. Where did your courage come from to design a &quot;reform roadmap&quot; and participate in bank reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before the reform, China’s four major state-owned commercial banks were “technically bankrupt” and relied only on implicit state financial guarantees. to make ends meet. If there is no shareholding reform, the four major state-owned commercial banks will go from &quot;technical bankruptcy&quot; to actual bankruptcy. This was an urgent problem that needed to be solved in China&#39;s economic system reform at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We dare to design a reform roadmap for the four major state-owned commercial banks that are &quot;technically bankrupt&quot; because we have seen the country&#39;s reform courage and determination to overcome all difficulties; We are confident in our own professional abilities and have the ability to operate on the problems faced by financial institutions; this is because the management of financial institutions are responsible and dare to take responsibility, and can carry out the task list we have listed. In 2003, after completing the audit of Bank of China, we put forward more than 500 management suggestions. The leaders of Bank of China specifically instructed the internal audit department to set up a working group to supervise the implementation of the suggestions we made. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2003 to 2006, you served as the signing accountant to assist the Bank of China Listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai.

The basis of this confidence is recognition of financial reform policymakers and leaders, including recognition of the policy directions they have formulated. The leaders of financial institutions realized that failure to reform would lead to a dead end. They used their own knowledge reserves and were willing to cooperate with domestic and foreign experts to find a way out for reform. It was they who proposed, &quot;We need a road map.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial reform policymakers and leaders at that time adhered to the direction of marketization and internationalization, respected professionals, trusted and gave full play to the power of domestic and foreign experts. The major state-owned banks have completed the work tasks in the reform stage. The current challenge is to continue to improve their core competitiveness and adapt to the new environment, new changes, and new trends more efficiently. The leaders of major state-owned banks we have dealt with are professional. In any era, we need to respect professionalism. Respecting professionalism is the source of confidence and the guarantee of courage in the face of danger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to assisting Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank of China in their share reform and listing, you He has also served or is currently serving as a signing accountant for China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

After the stock reform and listing, large state-controlled commercial banks have made remarkable achievements: their financial and risk prevention and control capabilities have been enhanced; their balance sheets have been relatively solid, and their ability to create profits has been enhanced; they have built a &quot;four meetings and one layer&quot; as the core. A corporate governance system recognized by the international capital market; forming a layout for international operations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now, bank reform and development are facing more complex and severe challenges. How to build a modern commercial bank is always a difficult problem. It is a complex and arduous project that covers all aspects of strategic management, risk management, information systems and corporate culture. What is particularly difficult is that leaders of state-owned commercial banks must clarify how to balance the policy attributes and commercial attributes of state-owned banks, and achieve both economic benefits and social responsibilities while adhering to the leadership of the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why are they motivated to revolutionize themselves? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The power of self-revolution of large state-owned banks mainly comes from the following three aspects: the determination and leadership of the state and the government to run banks well; The governance system of major banks that is in line with international standards has been established; the growth, achievements and positive actions of financial entrepreneurs and professional bankers have been achieved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let me explain by taking the effectiveness of the boards of directors of major state-owned banks as an example. The boards of directors of large state-owned banks are mainly composed of three groups of directors. One group is equity directors representing state-owned shareholders, who are from the Ministry of Finance and Central Huijin; the other group is independent directors who have international experience and risk management, law, accounting and other fields. professional knowledge; one group is the executive director responsible for operation and management, they are the central management cadres. This is a strong bank strategic management team that is both professional and political. They are highly self-motivated and have a lofty sense of mission. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Enhance &quot;Number Management Capabilities&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2018, as a visiting researcher at the Finance and Development Research Center of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, you focused on in-depth research on issues related to China’s banking industry and financial system reform, summarizing the impact of the 40 years of reform and opening up on accounting development and banking reform. accumulated experience. Please tell me, in the accounting field, what are the main questions you raised and the experiences you summarized? What is the relationship between accounting and finance? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The accounting standards system, audit market construction and accounting talent level directly affect a country&#39;s accounting capabilities. Looking back on the 45 years of reform and opening up, China&#39;s accounting standards have been continuously optimized and improved to achieve industry coverage, national unification, and international standards; the audit market has undergone institutional reforms and multi-level accounting firms have been built to adapt to the national market system; accounting talent training has received attention and established The National Accounting Institute launches the National Accounting Leading Talent Project to cultivate professional forces for China&#39;s reform and development. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The more the economy develops, the more important accounting becomes.” Accounting standards for enterprises are important rules for the market economy. The CPA profession bears the important responsibility of building social integrity, and accounting talents are also strategic talents needed for national development. Accounting standards, the CPA industry and the level of accounting talents are important factors in accounting capabilities. A country&#39;s accounting capabilities reflect its economic system and government governance soft power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Huang Renyu discussed his view of big history in his book &quot;The Fifteen Years of Wanli&quot;. One of the most important theories is the country&#39;s &quot;digital management capabilities.&quot; He believes that a stable and mature business society needs to have the ability to calculate and record the resources of the entire society. Only in this way, “the flow of funds will be convenient, the physical economy will become a financial economy, the conditions for exchange will increase, the division of labor will be further rationalized, and the entire country will Can be &#39;managed by numbers&#39;&quot; - and the country can be strong. Simply put, Professor Huang Renyu believes that digital management capabilities are the foundation of a strong country. I very much agree with this point of view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Accounting capabilities are the basis of national governance capabilities. Especially in the era of digital economy, the formation and use of digital assets require the existence of the basic function of accounting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My views on the relationship between accounting and finance are clear. The finance of enterprises is finance, and the finance of society is finance. Accounting, finance and finance will be the &quot;trinity&quot; disciplines. Everyone should learn some accounting knowledge honestly, because all economic activities will eventually be tested by &quot;debit&quot; and &quot;credit&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Financial companies need to shift from &quot;extension and expansion&quot; to &quot;connotation and strengthening&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the latest Fortune 500 list, the four major banks are all in the top 50; in the selection of the British &quot;Banker&quot; magazine, the four major banks dominate the top four . In your opinion, what challenges does China&#39;s banking industry have in terms of countercyclical operating capabilities and risk control capabilities? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The balance sheet of state-owned commercial banks is no longer a simple balance sheet of commercial operating entities, but is determined by China’s economic fundamentals. Support, it reflects the distribution of financial assets in Chinese society. The asset quality of commercial banks will be highly dependent on the health of the state-owned economy and the government&#39;s financial condition. This is the main peculiarity of the balance sheets of large state-owned banks. Banks must play their role in risk agency supervision in economic operations, discover risks in a timely manner, and report risks and hidden dangers in economic operations to relevant national departments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report card of state-owned commercial banks must be based on &quot;long-termism&quot;. The rapid expansion of balance sheets requires the implementation of strict risk discipline, especially strict credit discipline. Bankers need to adhere to the spirit of professionalism more persistently, absorb the lessons of the last round of deleveraging, improve the quality standards of lending and purchasing bonds, manage the entrance of non-performing assets in an incremental manner, and at the same time continuously consolidate the quality of existing assets and maintain sufficient Capital and loss absorption cushion, adhere to scientific liquidity management methods, and adhere to a clean, healthy and sustainable balance sheet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At present, what reforms do you think China’s state-owned banking industry still needs to deepen? and promote which developments? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Weijun:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The development of the financial industry has always been highly related to the overall situation of the times. The world today is facing major changes unseen in a century, and China&#39;s financial industry has faced huge historical challenges. At this important moment in the deepening and development of international and domestic finance, the presence of Chinese financial entrepreneurs is crucial. As the world&#39;s second largest economy, China&#39;s financial industry today needs a strong team of financial entrepreneurs more urgently than ever before. They need to give full play to their leadership and lead Chinese financial enterprises from simply expanding externally to expanding. High quality and strong connotation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must protect China’s financial entrepreneurs. Finance is a risk-taking industry, and the business decisions financial entrepreneurs have to make are risk-taking decisions. If a boundaryless accountability system is used to constrain financial entrepreneurs, it will definitely stifle the initiative of financial entrepreneurs to take risks and weaken the support of finance to the real economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial entrepreneurs also play a little-known function in the operation of the social economy. They perform an agency supervisory role in the operation of the social economy. Take bankers as an example. They lend money to businesses, and what makes them feel uneasy day and night is the risk that the borrower will not be able to repay the principal and interest of the loan. Therefore, bankers will regularly visit enterprises from the date of lending, requiring enterprises to maintain a healthy financial situation and meet the requirements of loan contracts. This supervisory role has improved the efficiency of China&#39;s economic development; at the same time, financial institutions have also accumulated relevant loans The knowledge of people and industries can guide the effective flow of funds to the real economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is China’s innovation successful? Because China’s economy is large, the cost of trial and error is very small when amortized. When successful, the overall economic effects of innovation are large. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage such a trial and error mechanism to better attract capital into the innovation market. This requires the participation of investment banks. We must encourage and cultivate a group of investment bankers who take root in China and support the high-quality and efficient development of China&#39;s economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[约瑟夫·奈：中美不会彼此构成威胁]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-31 07:57:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2. myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35970adf3270835011604556288/NaBoGdbWdHEA.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835011604556288&quot; data-media=&quot;video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;成Draft 555 &quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35970adf3270835011604556288/NaBoGdbWdHEA.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud .com/ 93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35970adf3270835011604556288/NaBoGdbWdHEA.mp4&quot;>;&lt;/source>;Draft 555&lt;/video>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[日常用语的“职业密码”丨人在职场]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259566]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 23:02:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My friend is a senior lawyer. One day he received a call from an old classmate asking him if he had any acquaintances in the hospital. Illness requires immediate hospitalization.

Those who seem to be born to speak standard Mandarin are actually just his accent. In daily communication, people often use words, sentences, and quotations from scriptures, which often bear the imprint of their profession, or it may just be the inertia of their language. There is a saying that one should never leave one&#39;s profession in three words.

A colleague who &quot;doesn&#39;t know the language&quot; proudly revealed to me: Because of his strong accent, when he went to the dialect areas of his hometown for secret visits and open checks, it was even more confusing, and he was treated as a native of his hometown.

When tracking and investigating a people&#39;s livelihood complaint, he personally experienced the procedures as a local citizen. The reception staff at the government affairs center had seen countless people and were quite experienced. He discovered a &quot;flaw&quot; on the spot: You, you are... a reporter, right? Asking questions about this and that, and turning over and over again. We ordinary people are very direct when it comes to doing things, not like you! With one word to reveal the secret interviewer, the colleague pretended to smile bitterly, and had no choice but to admit that he was unlucky and go for another secret visit at another time. This time, recite silently three times: Get rid of routines, get rid of routines, get rid of routines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“What did you think at the time?” “What do you think about this?” “What are the solutions to this problem?”… Reporters’ clichés have sneaked into our daily lives.

The driver picked me up half an hour early and then went in the opposite direction to pick up the next two passengers. During the chat, my reporter&#39;s professional habit kicked in. I first asked him about the passenger situation, then asked about his passenger background, then asked about his experience and feelings in the industry, and then asked him about the competition situation in the industry. I wanted to know about the current situation of Tailwind. The bitterness and joy of car owners. When we were resting in the service area on the way, the driver approached me and said, &quot;Boss, you are such a nice person. You are so polite when chatting with us and treat us as one of your own. Unlike some bosses who urge us to drive as fast as possible after getting in the car. No delay at all...&quot; ...I smiled and prepared to explain to him that the chat just now was just a &quot;mobile interview&quot; and he was just another of my &quot;interview subjects.&quot; As the words came to my lips, I decided to call myself the &quot;boss&quot; and respond to his gratitude: the big bosses all have people driving, and the little bosses only ride along.

Discussions about this game have also become hot searches on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This phenomenon deserves concern and analysis. The plot line setting of the game is very simple. You transform into the male protagonist Gu Yi and use the first-person perspective to immersively meet, interact and socialize with six beauties with different ages, looks, personalities and family backgrounds. You can choose one of them. Develop the character deeply and make it your other half: the charming witch who loves to go to nightclubs, the intellectual sister who loves literature and art, the innocent school girl who is not materialistic, the unruly rich lady, the sexy mother who raises her children alone, and the girl who wants to be a little girl at heart. The cool CEO, the choice is yours, which one you will end up with, you can do whatever you want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is a male-oriented love clearance game. The target audience is men. There is no harem or side effects. It is just pure love and satisfying men&#39;s various fantasies about their significant other. There are relatively few games in this category on the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public has the impression that young people, especially young men, love to play games, which is true. The hunting and war that our ancestors engaged in in the tribal era were the first priority for survival. This has become the pursuit of power and victory engraved in genes. The mainstream favorites of men are action, combat, war, civilized hegemony and strategy. The game involves a battle of wits and courage. In this type of game, most of the male players are male. Love is either absent or is just an add-on or embellishment. There is a high probability that the game producer has established such a mental position: every man’s dream is to conquer the world. , falling in love is also about capturing a woman’s heart by conquering the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The design idea of ​​this game is very different. It just allows a very ordinary man without any cheats to fall in love with a beautiful woman. Although the game has 12 hidden endings and hundreds of route choices , &quot;Every choice you make will trigger unexpected hidden stories.&quot; However, compared with the mainstream male-oriented games on the market, it is not really complicated, nor can it be said that the workmanship is exquisite, so it must be so popular. Particularly successful is that it hits the pain points of young men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major feature of the game is &quot;real-person interactive images&quot;: six beauties with different styles are all played and photographed by real people. In the era of general artificial intelligence (AGI) led by GPT-4, it is not difficult to use AI to design stunning beauties that are more perfect than real people, and the cost is lower. This approach has already had a negative impact on the profit model of &quot;welfare girls&quot; who sell personal photos. The impact. The producers of this game went in the opposite direction, using real people to act on camera, and pre-filmed various plot lines like genuine film and television works, allowing players to choose the objects and plots they want to develop in depth, allowing players to become film and television male protagonists. , the power to control and promote the development of the plot on your own, and it can also approach the experience of interacting with real people in real life, which can be said to be thoughtful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sexual version of this game is the so-called otome game. Otome is a girl. Women choose to fall in love with men, whether they are domineering CEOs, rich second generation, celebrities, or race car drivers. In short, it is to satisfy women&#39;s perfect imagination of their significant other. In terms of proportion, there are several orders of magnitude more otome games than male-oriented romance games. In this sense, &quot;Done!&quot; I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! &quot;The reason why it is so popular may be because there are too few such games. Game producers ignore and underestimate men&#39;s emotional needs. In addition, &quot;live-person interactive images&quot; fill the gap, so it suddenly opens up. an ecological niche. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The popularity of this game is enough to show that the male world is not all about killing and working to make money. Men also have emotional needs. Our traditional culture does not encourage men to open up and express themselves. &quot;A man cannot shed tears easily.&quot; Men must appear strong and carry everything without being weak or shrinking. However, everyone has moments of weakness and emotions. There are times when I cannot bear the need to express myself and my emotions break down. Men are human beings too, and their spiritual world should also be cared for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, men’s voices have been absent from public opinion. In the statements of some merchants, there is even a saying that &quot;men&#39;s consumption power is not as good as that of dogs.&quot; However, this situation is changing. The values ​​and consumption concepts of the new generation of young men are very different from their parents. They care more about themselves and invest more in their own image and spiritual world. For example, in recent years, the consumption and consumption of male cosmetics have increased annually. Significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to iiMedia Consulting data, among Chinese users who choose to shop through online live streaming channels, 58% are men and 42% are women. Among them, those born in the 1980s and 1990s are the main shopping force, accounting for The total exceeds 80%; live streaming e-commerce shopping users are mainly distributed in first- and second-tier cities, with second-tier cities leading the way with 42%. This is very different from the impression some people have. The consumption power of young men is rising and blowing out, which is a trend worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When men convert their productivity into consumption power, they also win the hospitality of businesses. This is the rule of the game in the consumer society. &quot;It&#39;s over!&quot; I&#39;m surrounded by beautiful women! 》The fire is another footnote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, since it is a romance game, it will inevitably lead some people to discuss the relationship between games and reality. Some people worry that the quality of opposite-sex partners in romance games is much higher than in real life, which will cause players to invisibly raise their inner expectations and standards for mate selection, and lose interest in the available partners in reality. There should be a real social investigation on whether this effect exists and how big it is, and it is meaningless to talk about it in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a person who has to earn money to support his family and career during working hours, but only occasionally spends some time playing games during get off work hours or weekends to satisfy his dreams and fantasies that cannot be realized in real life, should not be punished. Even if you are harsh, you won’t lose your sense of reality just by playing a few games, because the gravity of the real world is strong enough to pull you back to the ground. Occasionally falling into fantasy, even if it is a fantasy that cannot be realized, will make a person&#39;s heart shine, or make the soul gain a sense of relaxation and transcendence, which is necessary for a person&#39;s mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, if you are completely immersed and lost in fantasy due to the lack of anchors in the real world, and never want to get out of the virtual world, or use the perfect objects in the virtual world to ask for optional objects in the real world, then of course It is a pathology and not desirable. A sane adult should never go to this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[​张又侠：中国军队绝不答应、绝不手软]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259617]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30 21:25:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
