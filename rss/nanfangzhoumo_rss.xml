At present, has declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shoe speculation is not a rare game in human history. There have been various objects of speculation in human history, such as tulips, cotton, copper, and tin. In China, Pu&#39;er tea, precious Chinese medicinal materials, famous wines, walnuts, Tibetan mastiffs, and even green onions and garlic are all fried. All speculation and speculation activities have a similar process: consensus formation, professional market formation, financialization, bubbles, loss of rationality, and then, the bubble bursts and the last batch of entrants go bankrupt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, basketball fans bought the same sneakers of their favorite stars, and sneaker collection only developed in a small basketball circle. Driven by celebrities and hungry marketing by shoe factories, the price of shoes is getting higher and higher. This is how the sneaker consensus came to be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tulip speculation also shows characteristics very similar to shoe speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1593, a botany professor from Vienna brought tulips from Turkey to the Netherlands. This exotic and beautiful plant became the talk of high society. In the 17th century, the Netherlands was known as the &quot;Sea Coachman.&quot; Many Dutch people made their fortune through navigation and trade. At that time, the Netherlands was the richest place in Europe, and its assets were also expanding. When you have money, you will have some spiritual needs, and this need points to tulips. The price of tulips slowly increased as demand for tulips increased as dignitaries sought after them. This is also a process of forming social consensus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A very important link in forming a consensus is the proliferation of wealth myths. When some people make a lot of money through initial production, sales, and reselling speculation. The story will spread far and wide, attracting envy and followers. In the current information age, this process will be even more intense, and within a short period of time, everyone will know the story of wealth. This is the spread and explosion of consensus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consensus among shoe speculators is that there is another important driving force, and that is the brand. The second-hand market for sneakers can be compared to the secondary market for stocks. The secondary market will have an impact on the primary market. Similarly, the second-hand hype of sneakers will also affect the primary market to a certain extent. The higher the price of a certain brand of shoes, the stronger the brand power is and the better the stock will be. Relevant analysis shows that there is a significant positive correlation between the transaction volume of sneakers in the second-hand market and the stock price. Therefore, the price of fried shoes is high. Although the brand side does not get the premium of fried shoes, it can gain profits from the stock market and the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This will cause the company to change its business strategy to a certain extent. For collectibles, it will implement hunger marketing in terms of production and pricing, and launch limited editions and co-branded shoes, making these styles the object of speculation. But the paradox here is that the objects of hype are always increasing. As a modern industrial product, the quantity of shoes can easily increase. For a financial product, this is very dangerous. As a large-volume industrial product, shoes do not have the trust mechanism or proof-of-work mechanism of Bitcoin. The marginal cost is very small and depends entirely on the manufacturer&#39;s limit. However, there is competition between manufacturers. In the end, it will form a tragedy of the commons effect. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the consensus expanded, a professional market emerged, turning shoes into a financial product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second-hand sneaker trade began to develop in 2012 and experienced explosive growth in the following years. In 2015, StockX, a second-hand sneaker trading market, was established in the United States. The platform built a &quot;stock market&quot; for trading items, allowing users to trade sneakers like stocks. Users can see the index of each sneaker on the platform and check the price of sneakers at all times. In China, there were also multiple trading platforms for &quot;shoe speculation&quot; at that time, which were very similar to the trading model of the securities market. Not only did they derive K-line charts and &quot;shoe futures&quot;, but also derived from the Internet &quot;Cloud Shoe Speculation&quot;, showing a sense of participation. It has characteristics such as large number of investors, large trading volume, and violent price fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some third-party payment institutions are also providing leveraged services such as installment payments for shoe speculation platforms, and some people use this to gain high profits with high leverage. However, these leverages amplify risks. Not only do borrowers bear huge debts, but also the lending platform faces the risk of a break in the capital chain, creating a chain reaction and leading to financial risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of tulip speculation, the formation of a professional market also played an important role. At the end of 1634, Dutch tulip merchants formed an organization similar to an industrial guild (College), which basically controlled the tulip trading market. The role of this industry organization is to formulate rules and facilitate the exchange of information. In essence, this means that tulips were formed as a professional market for financial product trading, and then financialization also appeared, and tulip futures began to appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Market formation and financialization will greatly stimulate bubbles. At that time, on a certain shoe speculation platform, the average selling price of Air Jordan 1 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this madness pales in comparison to tulips. Between December 1636 and January 1637, the prices of all varieties of tulips rose across the board, and speculators entered the Dutch tulip market. At that time, a rare bulb could be sold for 5,500 Dutch guilders, which was equivalent to 184 pigs or 46 cows at the time, and the equivalent of $140,000 today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After high prices, there is collapse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As more funds enter, the price of shoes is raised, but in the end, the excessive price will cause the consensus to break down, and the person who finally takes over will suffer losses. In 2021, the price of a pair of sneakers dropped from 1,659 to 700. A shoe dealer bought shoes for 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but the original price dropped to more than 1,000 yuan. After the tide receded, countless people died on the shallows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for tulips. By February 1637, people began to wonder how much the tulip bulbs bought at a high price were worth after they bloomed. The collapse happened, and no one bought the tulips that cost 5,000 guilders each and sold them for 50 guilders each. Essentially, this is a consensus bust, and the reason for the consensus bust is that the price goes beyond common sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively stable financial products either have use value or can be stored for a long time to go through cycles. The tulip bubble lasted for 27 years, starting in 1610 until prices collapsed in early February 1637. But the rapid rise and fall only lasted for just over 3 years. The most direct reason is: tulips cannot be preserved. Shoes also have a similar feature. Rubber and leather cannot be stored for a long time and will oxidize in the air. This is destined to make it impossible for shoe speculators to survive the cycle. Once there is any trouble in the economy, this type of speculators will be the first to be hit. Relatively speaking, Bitcoin has a consensus mechanism, proof of production, and black market uses, while tea and gold can be stored for a long time, and the consensus will be stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hypework has distinct characteristics of the times. The economic, technological, and cultural conditions of each era are different, and different consensuses will naturally be formed. But in the end, all hype will lead to the same result: the bubble bursts, and the last batch of entrants go bankrupt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[高邮：一座普通县城的工业逆袭丨县城故事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258985]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/XCAZKCi8YlXGa7eJp8NEOyFbk7GBVjxcLESYdXhr.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/XCAZKCi8YlXGa7eJp8NEOyFbk7GBVjxc LESYdXhr. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gaoyou, Zhenguo Temple on the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zhuhu People&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Looking for Gaoyou on the map, the first thing you see is a large blue water swamp - Gaoyou lake. The east bank of the lake forms an unnatural straight line, which was formed after the Beijing-Hangzhou Canal was dug. The old town of Gaoyou is right on the edge of the canal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zengqi described his hometown and mentioned the relationship between the canal and the old city, &quot;The canal is as tall as a &#39;hanging river&#39;, while the county&#39;s terrain is low... Standing on the river embankment, you can overlook On the roofs of people below. Children in the city fly kites, and the kites float under the feet of people on the embankment.&quot; The water system shapes the appearance of the city and people&#39;s character. Wang Zengqi called it &quot;calm as water, flowing as water, and clear as water.&quot; He once Carve yourself a seal of &quot;Zhuhu People&quot;. Zhuhu is the nickname of Gaoyou Lake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going down the steep slope along the road on the river embankment and entering the old city, the driving speed becomes slower. The speed limit on the road is 20 kilometers, but the actual speed can only be this. Pedestrians and electric motorcycles are constantly passing through the narrow single lane, which is full of lively life. The architectural style facing the street is old, and many shops retain memories from the last century. For example, the Gaoyou Food Factory store near Fu Gongqiao Road has a long counter across the entrance with traditional mooncakes on an iron plate. They have been sold out all morning. Out of half. The specialty of the store is a kind of halva called Dongtang, which is wrapped in maltose with wheat flour mixed with sesame seeds. It is stacked on top of each other and has &quot;Handmade&quot; printed on the old-fashioned wrapping paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vehicles stopped at Zhongshan South Road. A stretch of lane further south was designated as a historical and cultural district. It used to be the residences of officials and wealthy families. Local scholars believe that Qin Shaoyou’s former residence is in Jiaojia Lane. Nowadays, most of the houses here have been renovated into self-built rural houses. Only the shops on the main road have been uniformly decorated in the style of ancient buildings. Most of the shops are open, running snack bars, cotton shops, shrouds and longevity materials shops, and some people set up stalls to sell freshly caught fish and shrimps. The operators and customers are elderly. The old people on the street will wave their hands and say to passers-by, &quot;Go to Nanmen Street, it&#39;s beautiful there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the Nanmen Street archway to Yucheng Station, it is an ancient city built in the style of a scenic spot, with black tiles and white walls. The rebuilt Qin Post Pavilion is also in this area. According to historical records, the history of Gaoyou began with the &quot;Public Post Pavilion&quot; in the Qin Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most modern building in the old city is the Wang Zengqi Memorial Hall. It looks like seven irregularly arranged thick books and is surrounded by narrow alleys densely packed with bungalows. Opposite the memorial hall, there is a &quot;Er Zi Cattail Meat&quot; shop. Two display boards indicate the inextricable relationship between the shop owner and Wang Zengqi - the grandson-in-law of the prototype of the character in Wang Zengqi&#39;s novel. But it is difficult to find the Gaoyou described by Wang Zengqi. The Zhenguo Temple was rebuilt on the river island where the Ximen Pagoda is located. Tianwang Temple and Chengtian Temple are no longer there. Naturally, there is no midnight bell ringing on the canal. The sound of the boat crossing is not a whistle. But it is a short and intensive motor sound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s Gaoyou is far from being a small place with backward economy and famous only for its double-yellow duck eggs at Wang Zengqi&#39;s time. It has become a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province and is managed by Yangzhou City. It is changing rapidly and changing with each passing day. Gaoyou has become a famous down clothing manufacturing city in China and a street lamp manufacturing base in China. It is famous throughout the country for many industries. Its GDP in 2022 will exceed 100 billion yuan, and industrial invoice sales will exceed 130 billion yuan. In the &quot;Research on China&#39;s Top 100 County Economies in 2023&quot; released by CCID, Gaoyou ranked 66th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new generation of Zhuhu people are as diligent, lively and tolerant as water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Sxovroi8pdRTXFDwZghj82sP592P3gwNzRuhiCgd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Sxovroi8pdRTXFDwZghj82sP592P3gwNzRuhiCgd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the garment workshop of a garment factory in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, employees are rushing to make down jackets for export&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Duck, duck down, new energy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the 1970s and 1980s, the textile and clothing industry in Gaoyou emerged, with township factories and family workshops blooming everywhere. In the impression of old Gaoyou people, Most people are making clothes. This is of course an exaggeration. Survey data since the 21st century shows that the number of employees in Gaoyou&#39;s textile and garment industry is around 40,000-60,000, accounting for nearly half of the city&#39;s industrial employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Bosideng Chairman Gao Dekang once said that 70% of China&#39;s down clothing is processed and produced in Jiangsu, and 70% of Jiangsu&#39;s down clothing is processed and produced in Gaoyou. In the same year, Bosideng invested 450 million yuan to build an industrial park in Gaoyou Economic Development Zone, becoming the largest investment and largest construction project in Gaoyou at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, when He Qixin, a local entrepreneur from Gaoyou, proposed cooperation to Bosideng for the first time, Bosideng did not agree. Their focus was on establishing a wholly-owned production base. At that time, Yangzhou Salon Garment Co., Ltd., which was so new, was already the garment factory with the largest number of employees in Gaoyou, with more than 1,700 people. It manufactured for many well-known brands, including Bosideng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why did Bosideng make a 180-degree turn after 8 years?” He Qixin later recalled in an interview with Yangzhou Evening News, “First, because of the quality of our products and the ability to deliver them on time. Ability, and more importantly, we have a large number of skilled garment workers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director of the Gaoyou Economic Development Zone Management Committee also attributed the diligence and dexterity of Gaoyou workers to one of the reasons, &quot;Bosideng was The factory in Huai&#39;an is larger than Gaoyou, but workers in Huai&#39;an can only process 5.5 down jackets a day, while workers in Gaoyou can process 8 pieces a day.&quot; But the director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee believes that He Qi&#39;s new business vision is more important , &quot;Without He Qixin, there would be no Bosideng (in Gaoyou).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Qixin&#39;s entrepreneurial experience started with a village-run factory built with funds raised by village cadres. of orders. Before that, he worked as a temporary worker in various factories for more than three years, such as knocking carbon blocks in the carbon instrument workshop of the fertilizer factory and working as a spray paint inspector in the electric fan factory. When he first entered the factory, He Qixin had just graduated from junior high school. He had to make a living early because of his poor family. When he was younger, he started raising ducks to support his family. Later, the duck down filling of down jackets often reminded He Qixin of his childhood as a &quot;Duck Commander&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years after setting up the factory, He Qixin found a new production direction. In the mid-1980s, gabardine Chinese tunic suits were popular. Although the cost of clothing materials was high and it was difficult to purchase, He Qixin did some calculations and felt that the profits were considerable. At that time, the price of gabardine was more than 10 yuan per meter of fabric, and a roll of fabric cost 450 meters. The factory needed to consume three or four rolls a week. Due to lack of money, He Qixin only bought three or four rolls of cloth at a time and had to restock every week. He traveled between Gaoyou, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wujiang, and Shengze, carrying heavy cloths alone. Relying on such resilience, He Qixin gradually grew the 80-person factory to a level that Bosideng could not ignore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of production in Gaoyou, Bosideng achieved sales of 300 million yuan, and in the second year it was 1 billion yuan... The director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee thinks that what is new and valuable is that, &quot;In cooperating with Bosideng, he continues to improve his voice and keep up with the development of the industry.&quot; After the textile and clothing industry found it difficult to expand its scale, He Qixin began to deploy in new industries. In addition to the textile industry, He Qixin has also cooperated with Bosideng to invest in new materials, logistics, real estate, hotels and other industries in Gaoyou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the work report of the Gaoyou Municipal Government, the industrial advantages of textiles and clothing as the four basic industries were still emphasized until 2014. When looking back in 2015, the industrial achievements became &quot;continuous transformation.&quot; Gaoyou Economic and Technological Development Zone lists the optical storage and charging industry as a characteristic leading industry. In 2023, He Qixin integrated its subsidiaries to establish Xinlinfei Group. The total investment in the optical storage and charging industry exceeds more than 20 billion, accounting for the largest share of Gaoyou Economic and Technological Development Zone. half of the district. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entrepreneurs led by He Qixin have promoted the development process of the entire Economic Development Zone. The director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee concluded: &quot;It is because of such a group of entrepreneurs in our park that we dare to do things and dare to try. , the park develops faster.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/XbogCvFM6Gx5mTWo6W5a7Amo8Ob5pE8IZMyu14eK.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/XbogCvFM6Gx5mTWo6W5a7Amo8Ob5pE8IZMyu14eK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254441&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Workers work in the intelligent workshop of a semiconductor manufacturing company in Gaoyou Economic Development Zone&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Qianyi Park&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Gaoyou Economic Development Zone is a provincial development zone established in November 1993. The initial planned area was 6.43 square meters Kilometers, 30 years later, the total area of ​​the park today is 101 square kilometers, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 32%. In 2022, GDP growth will be close to 20.5 billion yuan, and industrial invoices will be 55.6 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gaoyou Economic Development Zone, which started from farmland, has no obvious geographical and resource advantages, making it difficult to attract foreign capital through investment promotion. The director of the Economic and Technological Development Zone Management Committee said, “The time when other regions will really invest here will be in 2019.” Before that, like Heqixin’s introduction of Bosideng, it was through joint ventures and cooperation between local companies and foreign companies. way to attract customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The local advantages are not obvious, so leading cadres began to find new ways to study the economic policies and situations of surrounding areas and build Gaoyou&#39;s location advantages. The director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee recalled: &quot;In 2019, attracting enterprises from Shenzhen to invest was actually discussed around the strategic steps of the Yangtze River Delta region, not just the development zone. For electronic information companies in Shenzhen, the supporting radius is only Half an hour, and we had not yet started the entire industry, why do people come to you? So we talk about the Yangtze River Delta - a high-end cluster area for the electronic information industry. Nanjing has Jiangbei New District, Wuxi is an integrated circuit design center, and Shanghai has the most talents. Densely, Kunshan and Suzhou are the earliest industrial bases - Gaoyou, right in the middle of the Yangtze River Delta.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to attracting investment in Gaoyou lies in the cadres&#39; cognition, &quot;Many companies that come to invest will I found that it would be more difficult to go to other places to socialize, but we are very professional here. We can help you with which end of the industry your product is in and which equipment you use is better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let The director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee was most impressed by Sanfu Xinke, which settled in Gaoyou Economic Development Zone in 2023. Originally, this company had its eye on another economic development zone in Jiangsu, but after visiting Gaoyou and communicating with city leaders, it finally Gaoyou was chosen. &quot;They are engaged in surface treatment technology. After arriving, we found that we could not only communicate with them about the industry, but also put forward countermeasures for problems that may be involved in the entire production process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;May 2023 , Gaoyou Economic and Technological Development Zone has completed its annual investment promotion tasks, and the next big goal is to achieve a RMB 100 billion park in 2025. In addition to introducing new enterprises, the management committee&#39;s focus is to serve existing enterprises well. Every Monday morning, the management committee holds a regular weekly meeting to discuss how to help enterprises solve problems. &quot;There are three biggest pain points for enterprises: the first is funding issues, the second is employment issues, and the third is market issues.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;New strategies were released for these three issues at the weekly meeting in September. The park guarantee studio solves the problem of mutual guarantee loans between enterprises, and the government can provide credit guarantees for loans within 5 million; establishes a central kitchen and talent apartments to improve the living conditions of enterprise employees; establishes an integrated development platform to integrate the services of enterprises in the zone Products, recommendations and connections between upstream and downstream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes the strategy is very detailed. A decision passed at the weekly meeting on September 18 was to help companies delay paying import duties on equipment. The director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee explained: &quot;Imported equipment has a 13% value-added tax. Tens of millions of units of equipment will have to pay millions of tariffs at a time. Our supply chain finance company will help pay it first, and then the money will be transferred back from the subsidy. Extend the payment cycle and reduce the financial pressure on enterprises.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to pay attention to each enterprise, the Management Committee divided all enterprises into 21 grids, and each grid was divided into 21 grids by the work of the Management Committee. Personnel serve as &quot;grid members&quot;. They must be familiar with the industrial chains they are responsible for and regularly conduct economic analysis for the enterprise. &quot;What are the advantages, what are the difficulties, and which direction should we work in the future?&quot; The director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee asked all staff to work in the economic and technological development zone, and they should understand the economy. &quot;Even if some problems are not solved for the time being, We can solve the problem and the enterprises can feel that we are paying attention and not ignoring them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to its original advantageous industries of textiles, clothing and metallurgical machinery, the Economic Development Zone has set its future development direction in light. storage and charging industry, electronic information and life and health industries, and actively negotiates cooperation with listed companies. Regarding the goal of the 100-billion-dollar park, the director of the Economic Development Zone Management Committee is very confident, &quot;Judging from the investments that have been signed so far, the goal of the 100-billion-dollar park in 2025 is achievable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/34l6OhN1MS0xJUqHEuW4SvsPAPabaL7eZ0b2s4q2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/34l6OhN1MS0xJUqHEuW4SvsPAPabaL7eZ0b2s4q2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254440&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Workers are processing signal signs. Although modern factories have been established in the street lighting industry in the new district, the workmanship of small workshops still exists&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Growing street lamp factories&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another major traditional industry in Gaoyou is the lighting industry, which is known as the &quot;Hometown of Street Lamps&quot;. Most of the factories are concentrated in Guoji Town, Sendong Qiao Town and Tianshan Town are now included in Gaoyou Huxi New District. In the new district, factories of all sizes can be seen everywhere. Chen Guoqing is the deputy secretary-general of the Gaoyou Lighting Association. According to him, there are currently about 1,000 lighting companies in Huxi New District, with fixed sites. There are about 500 slightly larger ones. Home, a popular slogan here is &quot;Entrepreneurship for All&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The large number of lighting factories has created employment for 40,000 people. Chen Guoqing is a native of Guoji Town. His relatives and friends are all in this industry. They either work in factories or set up their own factories. The restaurants and other small shops offering daily life services are all run by outsiders. The annual income of an ordinary worker in a lighting factory can reach 100,000 yuan, but local housing prices are not high, more than 4,000 yuan per square meter, because many people choose to buy houses in Gaoyou urban area or Yangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time goes back 40 years. Guoji is a well-known poor township. It is located to the west of Gaoyou Lake, surrounded by water on three sides. The terrain is low-lying and the transportation is very inconvenient. There is only one road to Yangzhou, to Gaoyou County. You have to take a boat. At that time, people&#39;s income depended on farming, but due to the low terrain, the fields would be flooded whenever it rained heavily. &quot;If the fields are flooded, there will be no food, and food and clothing cannot be guaranteed. Girls from neighboring towns are not willing to marry to Guo Ji,&quot; Chen Guoqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because survival is difficult, people here will seize every possible opportunity. In 1976, Yao Peishan, secretary of the Pantang Brigade of Guoji Commune, heard about a man who secretly made ballasts (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;lamp accessories&lt;/span>;). A young man, Chen Jingchun, invited him to set up a factory. The start-up capital was the money earned by the production team from selling two pigs. Once the products were made, they were carried in sacks to find buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Kl76Mo8nwDAHAnciicxDSLtsB8dXZ3lH8frtUOKs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/Kl76Mo8nwDAHAnciicxDSLtsB8dXZ3lH8frtUOKs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254444&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Howell Transportation’s simulation showroom&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Ji’s successful entrepreneurial story seems to have an element of luck. The first pot of gold that Chen Jingchun&#39;s village-run factory got came from the news he accidentally learned: A radio factory in Shandong that was on the verge of bankruptcy had thousands of ballasts to be processed. Chen Jingchun bought them at a price of 5 yuan each. After inspection and After packaging, they were sold for 16 yuan each, making a total profit of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Using this money as a basis, the factory gradually developed other products such as light poles, lamps, and light sources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Jingchun&#39;s factory continued to grow and trained a large number of production staff and salespeople. In the 1980s and 1990s, all local farmers, bricklayers, and workers wanted to do sales. Zhao Jinyin, the founder of Noel Lighting, was a salesman. “Because of the lack of information, people who go out basically gain something, and it is possible to pass a Orders amount to 10,000 yuan per household.&quot; After the restructuring of state-owned enterprises, these people became the mainstream of independent factories. In Gaoyou, a city with highly concentrated industries and specialized factories for each subdivision, it is not difficult to set up a factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Zhao Jinyin left school in 2002, he began to run out, holding one or two pages of paper to sell to people. &quot;There is no strong purpose, and I don’t know where to go.&quot; His first big order was also based on As luck would have it, I randomly got on a bus heading to Wuhan. After entering Hubei, I found that there were no street lights in a county I was passing through, so I got out of the car and approached the road administration bureau. The two parties hit it off immediately. In less than ten years, Zhao Jinyin saved a fortune and founded Noer Lighting in 2011. It took another ten years to expand the factory from a dozen acres to the current 100 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outdoor lighting fixtures in Huxi New District account for 40% of the national market, and light poles account for 70%. Most factories still produce ordinary lighting products with low thresholds. Larger companies like Knoll Lighting have begun to upgrade equipment and transform into &quot;multi-pole-in-one&quot; smart street lights that are supporting transportation. &quot;The main reason is that the price competition of traditional street lights is fierce and the involution is serious.&quot; In the era of accessible information, Large manufacturers may not have an advantage in a price war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, talents and funds restrict the industrial upgrading of Gaoyou lamps. &quot;We are basically in rural areas. It is difficult to recruit outstanding college students. Even if the salary level is high, they may not want to come.&quot; Zhao Jinyin said, Noel The current smart street lighting team relies on hiring and cultivating internal talents with high salaries. Howell Transportation directly set up its R&amp;D team in Jiangbei New District, Nanjing. Chairman Hao Binghe thought about leaving Gaoyou, but quickly gave up the idea, &quot;The industrial chain is here, the reputation is here, and only here can we develop well.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about transformation in Huxi New District, the bosses of many companies recommended Hao Binghe of Haowei. &quot;I am a technical person, and I have lived in an atmosphere where everyone is determined to make progress since I was a child.&quot; Hao Binghe is from Guoji. He said, &quot;Innovation is very painful, and the losses caused by unsuccessful research and development are very scary. In the first two years, Because there was a problem with the investment direction, tens of millions were lost. Innovation cannot be immediate, otherwise everyone would innovate.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The risk of transformation makes Knoll and Howell tend to cooperate with state-owned enterprises, but local Lamp companies have never thought about cooperating with each other. Hao Binghe believes that the manager system is unrealistic. &quot;We all work alone here. Our structure is not that good. When you reach a certain age, it will definitely be passed on to the family.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The lighting industry, which originated from Chen Jingchun, is like a tree that continuously branches and grows from a single trunk. The branches are dense but independent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WQFt4sfbUNb3e26RItq51IEmqpfagApUfOlkVgoo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/WQFt4sfbUNb3e26RItq51IEmqpfagApUfOlkVgoo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254447&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the historical and cultural district beside the canal, the houses here will not be demolished, but most residents have built rural self-built houses&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Gaoyou Economic Development Zone is a joint effort between the government and enterprises to move toward scale and intensification, Huxi New District is more of a support for small enterprises. The industrial chain is highly concentrated, and the two development trajectories present different industrial forms. In Gaoyou, a county with no advantage in natural resources, no special policy support, and little foreign capital, both models have opened up a vital path from spontaneous growth to outward progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the top 100 counties, Gaoyou is not particularly eye-catching, but if we take double yellow duck eggs as the starting point, the history of Gaoyou industry is a revelation of the rise of industry in ordinary counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从0到1，“一带一路”倡议下中国社会组织的国际化之路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259096]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 19:59:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In October 2023, the third &quot;Belt and Road&quot; International Cooperation Summit Forum was held in Beijing, which is also a commemoration of Special event for the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “One Belt, One Road” initiative is not just business exchanges, but also emphasizes cultural exchanges and people-to-people connections, which opens a window for Chinese social organizations to “go global”. In March 2015, the &quot;Vision and Actions on Promoting the Joint Construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road&quot; issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce with the authorization of the State Council pointed out that people-to-people bonds are the key to the construction of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; It is necessary to strengthen exchanges and cooperation among non-governmental organizations in countries along the route, focusing on grassroots people, and extensively carry out various charity activities such as education and medical care, poverty reduction and development, biodiversity and ecological environmental protection, so as to promote the improvement of production and living conditions in poverty-stricken areas along the route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the General Office of the Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Notice on Promoting the Participation of Social Organizations in the Activities of International Non-Governmental Organizations&quot; and &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening the Training and Promotion of Talents for International Organizations&quot;, actively advocating the participation of social organizations. International exchanges and strengthening international talent cultivation. In 2016, the &quot;Opinions on Reforming the Management System of Social Organizations to Promote the Healthy and Orderly Development of Social Organizations&quot; was released, further encouraging social organizations to &quot;carry out external exchanges in an orderly manner&quot; and &quot;give full play to the important platform role of social organizations in non-governmental external exchanges.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum in 2017 officially launched the “Chinese Social Organizations Action Plan to Promote People-to-People Connectivity along the Belt and Road (2017-2020)” and the cooperation network of civil society organizations along the Silk Road. More than 160 Chinese and foreign non-governmental organizations have joined the cooperation network, and more than 90 Chinese organizations have joined the action plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many organizations stated that the “One Belt, One Road” initiative has a significant impact on their internationalization journey. &quot;In the past, social organizations carried out international business independently based on their own business development. Now there are policies to clearly support and encourage going global. This difference is still very big.&quot; Secretary-General of China Rural Development Foundation (formerly China Poverty Alleviation and Development Foundation) Chen Hongtao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, my country currently has 51 registered international social organizations; since 2013, relevant work has been further accelerated, with a total of 24 international social organizations registered, accounting for 47% of the total. Chinese social organizations are not only going global, but also increasingly participating in the international governance system. In 2015, Professor Deng Guosheng of the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University conducted research on the “going global” strategy of Chinese social organizations. At that time, there were &lt;span>;48&lt;/span>; social organizations in China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) that had consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. This number has now grown to 103. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Sail to the sea&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Chinese social organizations &quot;go global&quot;, and the China Rural Development Foundation can be regarded as one of the &quot;first batch of institutions to eat crabs&quot;. The China Rural Development Foundation carried out de-administrative reforms in the late 1990s. In 2005, it began to explore international development. In 2007, it proposed an internationalization strategy for institutional development and began to go abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our internationalization can basically be divided into three stages: internationalization without going abroad, internationalization on a business trip, and resident internationalization.” Chen Hongtao introduced that internationalization without going abroad, For example, if you participated in international actions or international assistance before 2009, you would mainly donate money and materials through cooperation with other international organizations. In 2009, the International Development Department was established, with a dedicated team to carry out special projects. At this time, the domestic team was mainly responsible for traveling overseas to implement. In 2015, the China Rural Development Foundation officially registered and established offices in Myanmar and Nepal, marking the transformation from a local social organization in China to an international public welfare organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the China Rural Development Foundation has 3 country offices and is carrying out projects in 7 other countries in a relatively stable and sustainable manner. Internationalization is written into the organization&#39;s vision, &quot;to build an international public welfare platform that is more trustworthy, more worthy of expectation, and more worthy of respect.&quot; &quot;One Belt, One Road&quot; has also been included in the organization&#39;s charter, &quot;responding to the &#39;Belt and Road&#39; initiative and participating in international poverty reduction cooperation.&quot; and humanitarian aid”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Amity Foundation, established in 1985, has been active in the field of international exchange and development. From &quot;bringing in&quot;, such as introducing foreign teachers and introducing advanced concepts in the field of international development, to &quot;going out&quot; in 2009 and launching a series of international projects. From 2015 to 2019, the Amity Foundation successively set up African offices, international offices and Kenya offices in Ethiopia, Geneva, Switzerland, and Nairobi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the early institutions that were trying to cross the river by feeling their way through the river to explore “going out”, the pace of Chinese social organizations’ “going out” has accelerated since the “One Belt, One Road” initiative was proposed. The Red Cross Foundation of China closely follows the overall requirements of the country&#39;s &quot;Belt and Road&quot; construction and in accordance with the foreign aid work deployment of the Red Cross Society of China, and established the &quot;Silk Road Fraternity Fund&quot; in 2017. This fund is a &quot;Belt and Road&quot; public welfare fund, covering China&#39;s international humanitarian aid, state-supported private foreign aid, Chinese enterprises&#39; &quot;going global strategy&quot;, international volunteer services, etc. Relying on the partners of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement around the world, after the establishment of the special fund, the Chinese Red Cross Foundation quickly established an international working network to carry out projects along the “Belt and Road”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “One Belt, One Road” initiative has also inspired more organizations that have been focusing on global issues since their establishment. The Beijing Pinglan Charity Foundation was established in April 2018. Since its establishment, it has actively participated in responding to domestic and foreign humanitarian crises, environmental crises and other emergencies. In 2019, the Beijing Pinglan Charity Foundation conducted preliminary research on the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, set up a local office, and sent a working group to carry out humanitarian assistance work. &lt;span>;In 2021&lt;/span>; the Beijing Pinglan Charity Foundation’s Geneva office was established, with staff stationed there to carry out international exchanges and cooperation in the fields of humanitarian assistance and environmental protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Promoting &quot;people-to-people connectivity&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Chinese social organizations face far more complex situations and more severe tests than at home. However, as the world&#39;s No. 1 China, the two largest economies, is both a developing country, and its governance experience seems to be more &quot;resonant&quot; with that of less developed countries. &quot;Compared with Western developed countries, China&#39;s social organizations&#39; going global still has our own characteristics. &quot;Professor Huang Haoming, Executive Director of the Hainan Asia Philanthropy Research Institute and Honorary Chairman of the China Association for the Promotion of International Non-Governmental Organization Cooperation, introduced. One of these characteristics is reflected in our culture of gratitude. &quot;In the past, China was more of a recipient of foreign aid. Now we As we develop, we begin to go out and help other countries. As Mozi said, &#39;love universally&#39; and &#39;not attack&#39;, and go out in a peaceful way. &quot;The second is the awareness of equality and respect. &quot;Because we ourselves are also developing countries, when we go to other less developed countries, we are not condescending or asking them to listen to us, but more of equality and respect. &quot;The third is to focus on problem-oriented and results-oriented. &quot;Our non-mechanical transportation when going abroad is more based on the needs of the recipient countries, such as solving the problem of children&#39;s schooling and cataract surgery, which are all real solutions to the urgent needs in people&#39;s lives. problem. &quot;As a result, the poverty reduction experience and brand projects that have achieved good results in China have gradually formed international influence overseas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Love Package Project, launched in 2009, is the largest domestic project of the China Rural Development Foundation. One of the most popular and influential projects. The project builds a public welfare platform and distributes packages to children in underdeveloped areas to provide one-on-one care and inspire children&#39;s childhood dreams. From the launch of the project to the end of 2022, the Love Package Project A total of 869 million yuan of social donations have been received in China, benefiting nearly 8 million students in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to the “Belt and Road” initiative, in February 2019 The China Rural Development Foundation and Alibaba Philanthropy jointly launched the Panda&amp;nbsp;Pack&amp;nbsp;Project, which brought the PandaPack Project from China to countries along the “Belt and Road”. As of the end of 2022, the international PandaPack Project has raised more than 139 million yuan, benefiting 14 countries including Myanmar, Nepal, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan, Namibia, Uganda, Mongolia, Philippines, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Burundi, Chad, etc., with more than 1.184 million beneficiaries. International Love Package The project has also become one of the largest overseas public welfare projects implemented by Chinese social organizations, and has become a representative of the people-to-people bonds of the &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot;. The project won the Best Reduction Award in the &quot;Second Global Poverty Reduction Case Collection&quot; awarded by the United Nations system in 2021. &quot;Poverty Cases&quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2017, the Red Cross Foundation of China, relying on the Silk Road Philanthropy Fund, has also begun to optimize the supply of humanitarian services in countries along the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; and provide humanitarian assistance to people in urgent humanitarian needs along the routes. As of the end of June 2023, a total of nearly 70 million yuan has been invested to fund international humanitarian assistance projects in 26 countries in Asia and Africa. The funding areas include medical assistance, health intervention, community development, relief and disaster relief, volunteer services, etc. The number of beneficiaries 62,669 people. Among them, the international free lunch project has benefited 7,197 students in 6 countries: Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, helped 1,105 children return to school, and created employment for hundreds of African women. Nemy Matinde, one of the students who was once aided, returned to a community school to become a teacher after graduating from university. He said: &quot;Chinese public welfare organizations helped me, so I also want to use my own power to help more children here, so that They have access to education. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of global biodiversity and ecological environmental protection, more and more Chinese organizations are gradually practicing. The Global Environmental Institute (GEI), founded in 2004, is one of the strongest in the country. , a large-scale grassroots environmental non-governmental organization, committed to using market mechanisms and policy suggestions to solve environmental problems. Since its establishment, GEI has focused on promoting international cooperation on environment, energy and other issues from a local perspective, especially South-South cooperation. As early as In 2005, GEI brought China&#39;s mature and reliable biogas technology to Sri Lanka and to Laos five years later. GEI has been carrying out projects in the fields of biodiversity protection, global climate change, energy efficiency and other fields for many years. In 2011, all projects were completed &quot;Going Global&quot;. From 2012 to 2019, its projects have covered Myanmar, Mongolia, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Ghana, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo and many other countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Walk on a tightrope. OK&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The “Belt and Road” initiative has led more Chinese social organizations to go global, but this decade is only the first step. Professor Huang Haoming said that Chinese social organizations still have to go global. Faced with many challenges, the legal basis is insufficient from a macro perspective and policy support is relatively lagging behind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the “Belt and Road” initiative was proposed in 2013, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council successively issued a series of opinions and notices to encourage social organizations to participate in international Non-governmental organization activities and international exchanges. The promulgation of the Charity Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China in 2016 ushered in the era of &quot;good&quot; governance in accordance with the law. There are some provisions related to overseas donations, but there are no provisions related to the &quot;going global&quot; of charitable public welfare organizations. In the same year, the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Administration of Activities of Overseas Non-Governmental Organizations in the Territory&quot; was passed and implemented, regulating and guiding the exchanges and cooperation of overseas non-governmental organizations in China. There are laws to follow for overseas non-governmental organizations to carry out activities in China, and Chinese non-governmental organizations Organizations have gone global but are still wandering in the legal void.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the National People&#39;s Congress of China published the &quot;Charity Law &lt;span>;(&lt;/span>;Revised Draft&lt;span>;)&lt;/span>;&quot;, facing the society The public is soliciting opinions. An article has been added to the revised draft: “The state encourages international charitable exchanges. Charitable organizations that accept overseas charitable donations or cooperate with overseas organizations or individuals to carry out charitable activities must go through approval or filing procedures in accordance with relevant national regulations. &quot;Although international exchange terms have been added, there are no specific provisions on international cooperation and overseas project development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Funding is another major factor that restricts Chinese public welfare organizations from going global. Take the China Rural Development Foundation as an example For example, the total donation income in 2022 is 1.159 billion yuan, and international projects will be 31.0095 million yuan, accounting for less than 3%. International project funds come from the public, enterprises, foundations and government departments, of which public donations account for the bulk, accounting for 70%, and others Foundations and enterprises each account for 10%. Government donations include grants from Chinese embassies and consulates abroad and grants from the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, accounting for only about &lt;span>;5%&lt;/span>;.&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; Judging from the experience of other countries, when international non-governmental organizations carry out projects overseas, government overseas aid funds are an important source. &quot;Compared with other countries, our government&#39;s purchase funds for social organizations are still relatively small,&quot; Professor Huang Haoming said, “For example, about 20% of the U.S.’s annual foreign aid funds are implemented through their non-governmental organizations, which is a huge amount. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the China International Development Cooperation Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce issued the &quot;Foreign Aid Management Measures&quot;, which pointed out that South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund projects should be carried out, that is, using the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund to support Projects implemented by international organizations, social organizations, think tanks, etc. This sends a positive signal for the government to implement foreign aid through social organizations, but it is only the beginning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talent is also a challenge for Chinese social organizations to go global. A 2021 study on &quot;Chinese Social Organizations&#39; Participation in the &#39;Belt and Road&#39; Construction&quot; conducted by Yang Li, Director of the International NGO and Foundation Research Center of Beijing Normal University, showed that social organizations generally lack talents with rich foreign-related work experience. 124 companies participated in the survey Institutions, 50% of institutions have no relevant foreign-related talents, and less than 13% of institutions have 7 or more foreign-related talents.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Professor Huang Haoming’s view, international talents are not only foreign language skills, but also more important It is comprehensive quality. There are four key and difficult points, one is to have an international vision, the other is to understand international rules, the third is to have the ability to resist risks, and the fourth is to have strong negotiation skills. &quot;When carrying out projects overseas, you need to deal with local people. , the working environment is also full of uncertainty and requires strong adaptability. &quot; Professor Huang Haoming said.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Steady the first step and help peers take the first step&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Earlier, the China Rural Development Foundation &quot;went global&quot; &quot;We encountered various challenges and problems. For example, when we were working as the first hospital in Sudan, there was a problem with customs clearance of materials, which ultimately resulted in demurrage fees. Later, looking back, the reason was mainly because we were not familiar with the customs, laws and regulations of the other country. . Accordingly, with the funding of the Asia Foundation, the China Rural Development Foundation compiled an &quot;Operation Manual for Chinese Non-Governmental Organizations Going Global&quot; to share the key points of going global with other organizations to help them go global more smoothly. At the same time, the China Rural Development Foundation actively organizes and participates in various &quot;going global&quot; activities, such as the Chinese Social Organizations Going Abroad Symposium, the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; Chinese Enterprises Overseas Philanthropy Road Seminar, the China-Egypt Non-Governmental Organization Webinar, and the China Rural Development Foundation. non-forums, etc., to share the challenges and experiences of going global and build a collaborative network.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As China’s first non-governmental organization in the environmental field to “go global” to carry out overseas projects, the Global Environment Institute (GEI), at the Ford Foundation In 2016, with the funding of &quot;Going Global&quot;, the experience, challenges and thinking of &quot;Going Global&quot; were also researched, and the report &quot;Chinese Non-Governmental Organizations &quot;Going Global&quot;: Current Situation, Challenges and Policy Recommendations&quot; was released, which focused on the relationship between Chinese and foreign non-governmental organizations and the government, Case references for enterprises to carry out cooperation projects provide reference for peers. Then, in 2017, GEI joined hands with experts from different fields to hold a &quot;Going Global&quot; symposium for Chinese non-governmental organizations to discuss and share experiences in participating in international affairs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In May 2021, Amity Foundation Secretary-General Ling Chunxiang was successfully elected as a director of the International Confederation of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA). This marks that Amity has further accumulated experience in deeply participating in international governance. To this end, Amity actively cooperates with the International Relations of Renmin University of China Associate Professor Xu Ying of the college co-wrote the article &quot;Seizing International Political Opportunities - The Path of Internationalization of Chinese Social Organizations&quot;, introducing Amity&#39;s participation in the United Nations humanitarian aid system by joining ICVA and its significance to the internationalization of Chinese social organizations. Other peers provide reference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything is still in its infancy, and mutual help and teamwork are particularly important. Chen Hongtao, Secretary-General of the China Rural Development Foundation, said: &quot;Although the international construction of the China Rural Development Foundation is currently Some progress and results have been achieved, but compared with some mature international institutions, there is a relatively large gap in the number of countries covered overseas, project scale, team capabilities, international influence, etc. In the future, we hope to strengthen learning and exchanges , while linking more social forces and joining hands with more social organizations to go global. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to large institutions that have explored internationalization earlier, Professor Huang Haoming has also observed in recent years that some local institutions have begun to take the first step. Their exploration may provide reference for other places and even the country. “Yunnan takes advantage of its border, and the Yunnan Provincial Foreign Affairs Office, Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce, Yunnan Provincial Promotion Association and other departments and social organizations have collaborated to form a very good communication mechanism. This is rare in the country. &quot;Professor Huang Haoming said, &quot;When talking about &#39;going out&#39; in the past, most people talked about institutions in Beijing. In recent years, institutions such as Shenzhen International Exchange and Cooperation Foundation, Shanghai Fosun Foundation, Sichuan Haihui Poverty Alleviation Center, Tibet Charity Yuan Foundation, Zhejiang Gongyang Association, etc. are also doing very distinctive things. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “14th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Social Organizations” issued by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 2021 pointed out that it is necessary to steadily implement the “going out” of social organizations, carry out overseas cooperation in an orderly manner, and enhance the participation of our country’s social organizations in global governance. ability to improve the influence of Chinese culture and China&#39;s &quot;soft power.&quot; The word &quot;stable&quot; may be the current attitude of China&#39;s public welfare institutions in &quot;going out&quot;. Only by stabilizing the first step can we take a more stable step in the future. next step.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[演唱会吸金能力超越黄金周，“周杰伦”经济能拯救地方文旅吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259080]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“小便事件”冲击青岛啤酒？全链条管控能力或存疏漏]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259088]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;How much impact will a video of more than ten seconds have on a 100-billion-dollar listed company? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many investors in Tsingtao Beer (600600.SH) have been worried about this throughout the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A video posted online showed a male employee wearing blue overalls and a safety helmet digging into a suspected raw material warehouse to urinate. The video said it happened at Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 Factory. After the market closed on October 20, this video was widely circulated on the Internet and became a hot search topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Market Supervision and Administration Bureau of Pingdu City, where Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 is located, confirmed to the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that the malt involved has been sealed and the investigation of the incident is still ongoing. A person from Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 responded to a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald that the incident in the online video was not in the warehouse of No. 3 Beer, and the person involved was not an employee of No. 3 Beer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement has not been officially confirmed by Tsingtao Beer. A reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald noticed that the clothes of the person involved in the online video were similar to the work clothes of Tsingtao Brewery No. 3. Regarding the progress of the investigation of the incident, a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald contacted the Tsingtao Brewery Board Secretary Office several times over the weekend, but was unable to get through as of press time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Food safety is a top priority in the beverage industry. Domestic beer giants have rarely encountered such major public opinion in recent years. Many investors have questioned on platforms such as Stock Bar: How can the production safety control capabilities of large wine companies be weak? Could this be some kind of business war &quot;script&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final investigation results will lead to different directions. If it is confirmed that the incident is related to the Tsingtao Brewery factory or employees, it means that there are major problems with the internal control system of this century-old beer giant. If it is confirmed that the incident was committed by a third-party supplier and did not occur within the Tsingtao Brewery factory, Tsingtao Brewery&#39;s responsibility will be relatively reduced, but it will still expose its omissions in the entire chain of supplier control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coinciding with the weakening growth momentum of domestic beer since the third quarter, Tsingtao Beer’s stock price has continued to fall recently. How to characterize this incident and how to deal with it later will test the wisdom of the parties involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Pingdu Municipal Supervision Bureau: The malt involved has been sealed&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 said: It is not in the warehouse and is not a Tsingtao Brewery employee&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the video, The urination incident occurred at Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 Factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 is located in Pingdu City, a subsidiary of Qingdao City, more than 100 kilometers away from Qingdao City. It was formerly known as Beihai Brewery. It was founded in 1986 and had a production capacity of less than 10,000 when it was built. However, after years of capacity transformation, especially in recent years, the scale has continued to increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An article on Tsingtao Beer’s official WeChat ID earlier this year mentioned: In the past five years, Tsingtao Beer Plant No. 3 has undergone multiple upgrades, with annual production capacity jumping from 750,000 kiloliters in 2018 to 2022. 1.2 million kiloliters, making it a world-class factory. Not only that, Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 is also the leader of Tsingtao Beer Intelligent Industrial Park, which gathers 11 industrial chain supporting enterprises and is the largest clustered, intelligent, garden-style industrial park in the global industrial chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do such very elementary production safety incidents occur in a world-class factory? Some investors pointed out that in a factory of this size, the bathroom must be standard and not far from the workplace. Why would employees go to all the trouble to go into the raw material warehouse to urinate, and even be caught on video? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 22, a person from the Third Tsingtao Brewery Factory responded to a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald that the video of an employee urinating online was not at the raw material warehouse of the Third Factory, and the person involved was not an employee of Tsingtao Brewery. , the specific circumstances of the incident are still under investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald contacted the Pingdu Municipal Market Supervision Bureau on October 21. A person from the Pingdu Municipal Supervision Bureau told the reporter that it was certain that the malt involved had been sealed, but the specifics of the incident The results of the investigation are yet to be officially announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People from the Municipal Supervision Bureau did not respond to whether the incident was committed by employees of Tsingtao Brewery No. 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;21st Century Business Herald compared the photos on the official account of Tsingtao Brewery Factory No. 3 and noticed that the work clothes of employees at Tsingtao Brewery Factory No. 3 are dark blue, with yellow hats, and there are light-colored strips on the back of the work clothes, which is consistent with The people involved in the video posted online were wearing similar clothes. However, due to insufficient clarity, it is difficult to determine whether the person involved in the video was wearing work clothes from Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 Factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/981cc1a404f50dd891c7f657a05c0533.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/981cc1a404f50dd891c7f657a05c0533.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254839&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/401a211480df23b912e12a6b4096f4fd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/401a211480df23b912e12a6b4096f4fd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254840&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>;(Comparison of the work clothes of Tsingtao Beer Factory No. 3 and the clothing of the person involved in the online video)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tsingtao Beer officials issued a situation statement on the evening of October 20: In response to the Tsingtao Beer Factory No. 3 that appeared online on October 19 Our company attaches great importance to the relevant video and immediately reported it to the public security organs, who have intervened in the investigation. At present, this batch of malt has been completely sealed. Our company continues to increase management efforts to ensure product quality, and welcomes consumer supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 produces main brand products&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Consumption intention will be affected in the short term&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What netizens are worried about is: has similar incidents happened before? Budweiser has twice made false alarms due to similar news. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2017, a video of female workers manually pouring Budweiser beer was widely circulated. &amp;nbsp;After Budweiser reported the case, an investigation found that the video was fake wine made from recycled Budweiser beer cans from a domestic copycat brewery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, news circulated on the domestic Internet that &quot;an employee of Budweiser beer has peed in it for many years.&quot; It was later discovered that the news was &quot;fake news&quot; from an external spoof website. Budweiser quickly refuted the rumors on its domestic platform, saying that the rumors were &quot;malicious slander of the company&#39;s products&quot; and &quot;this matter is purely fabricated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have strict production procedures. After the malt enters our production line, it will go through various processes such as cleaning, sterilization, disinfection, and fermentation. Consumers should rest assured.” The aforementioned person from the third Tsingtao Brewery Factory said 21st Century Business Herald reporter emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some industry insiders also told reporters that malt is generally cleaned to remove impurities before brewing, and industrial canned beer is also sterilized, which will most likely not affect the drinking safety of the beer. However, there are also draft beer products on the market that are not sterilized and only fermented at low temperatures. The purpose is to retain more flavor. Such products are difficult to preserve and have a short shelf life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is widely circulated on the Internet that Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 mainly produces non-Tsingtao beer brands such as Guoli and Red Snow Dragon. They are not major brands on the market. Most locals in Qingdao do not drink them and they mainly sell them to other places. , some of which brands have been discontinued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald learned that Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 also produces main brand products such as Classic 1903. Classic 1903 is one of the representative products of Tsingtao Beer’s product upgrade in recent years. It has a shelf life of 365 days and theoretically also requires sterilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the overwhelming news will still have an impact on some consumers&#39; willingness to consume. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald noticed that a netizen posted a post saying that he habitually purchased an extra box of Tsingtao beer, but after thinking of the news, he finally chose to delete it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some consumers asked the customer service of Tsingtao Beer flagship store whether the products come from the third factory? Customer service responded that it was not clear which factory the product came from. Since the product is shipped randomly from the warehouse, it cannot be designated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time on the afternoon of the 22nd, Tsingtao Brewery and the Pingdu Municipal Supervision Bureau have not disclosed the results of their investigation into the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is finally confirmed that he is an employee of Tsingtao Beer or that the incident occurred in a Tsingtao Beer factory, it means that Tsingtao Beer’s internal control system will face torture. If the incident is confirmed to be the behavior of a third party, Tsingtao Beer&#39;s responsibility can be reduced, but there are still omissions in Tsingtao Beer&#39;s full-chain production control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the incident is true, then this incident is a very low-level mistake. As a listed company and the oldest leading beer company in China, Tsingtao Beer reflects the internal management and quality control of Tsingtao Beer The lack of the system will definitely have some impact on the entire image of Tsingtao Beer and its performance in the capital market.&quot; Zhu Danpeng, vice president of the Guangdong Provincial Food Safety Promotion Association, told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The third quarter performance is the focus&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As the relevant video was widely circulated after the market closed on October 20, Tsingtao Beer’s stock price was not affected and closed with a slight increase on the 20th. official. Investors are watching how the market will react after the market opens on Monday, the 23rd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with this unexpected incident, the impact of the recent weakening of beer consumption sentiment on major beer stocks deserves more attention from investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After offline opening this year, the beer industry ushered in a year of recovery. The beer output of designated enterprises across the country increased by 7% year-on-year in the first half of the year, especially in March and April, based on a low base in the same period last year, the year-on-year growth was as high as 20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the industry leaders, Tsingtao Beer has enjoyed the dividends of recovery. In the first half of this year, Tsingtao Brewery achieved operating income of 21.59 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 3.43 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 20.1%. Tsingtao Beer&#39;s stock price hit a record high in April, exceeding 123 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, starting from June, the consumption enthusiasm in the beer market began to decline. First, in June, the beer production of designated enterprises across the country increased by only 1.6% year-on-year. In the summer of July and August, under the dual influence of heavy rains in the north and typhoons in the south, beer consumption during the peak season was not as expected. Coupled with the impact of the high base in the same period last year, The beer output of designated enterprises across the country has declined, with year-on-year declines of 3.4% and 5.8% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, beer consumption became even weaker. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the beer output of designated enterprises across the country in September was 2.866 million liters, a year-on-year decrease of 8%. The cumulative output in the first nine months was 29.933 million liters, a year-on-year increase of 2.1%. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tsingtao Beer’s stock price has been declining since April. As of last week, the stock price was as low as just over 80 yuan. It has fallen by more than 30% in less than half a year, which is a new low in the past year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tsingtao Beer will disclose its third quarter report on the evening of October 27. As of the close of trading on the 20th, Tsingtao Beer’s market value was approximately 110.6 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家烟草专卖局原党组书记、局长凌成兴被查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259102]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 10:09:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ling Chengxing, former Party Secretary and Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the National Supervisory Commission. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“22万美元降至1美元”？美国防部长陷入降薪风波]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259090]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Austin has been in &quot;trouble&quot; recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It has been more than a thousand days since Austin took office as Defense Secretary on January 20, 2021.

The Army, Air Force, and Navy None of them achieved their goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although the U.S. military has adopted many innovative ways to encourage young people to join the military, including the Army reusing the slogan &quot;Do your best&quot; from the 1980s, the Air Force has relaxed Following previous tattoo and drug testing policies, the Navy introduced record financial incentives of up to $140,000.

Derek Van Orden expressed support for Greene&#39;s amendment, noting that suicide rates among active-duty service members and veterans are high in 2021. Thirteen soldiers died during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many outsiders believe that the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan has become a &quot;joke&quot; in U.S. military history. The hasty retreat of U.S. forces and the chaos at Kabul airport resulted in the deaths of thirteen U.S. service members in the attack in Kabul. During this withdrawal, Austin was accused by public opinion of failing to properly handle this major military operation, which caused the US military to be in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Austin abandoned thousands of American citizens and allies to terrorists in Afghanistan. He should be directly responsible for this incident.&quot; Former US Navy SEAL Team member Van Orden said publicly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The main contradiction currently facing the United States is the contradiction between the rising cost of maintaining hegemony and the gradually declining comprehensive national strength.&quot; Yang Zhen believes that &quot;from At this point, Austin lacks the political wisdom and strategic vision required for this position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the U.S. House of Representatives also pointed out that the United States has invested in Ukraine The huge amount of funds has failed to bring substantial strategic benefits to the country. Austin&#39;s failure to provide effective leadership on this issue has cast doubt on U.S. military policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since Russia launched the conflict against Ukraine in February 2022, the Biden administration, with the support of Congress, has provided nearly $75 billion in aid to Ukraine. Includes humanitarian, economic and military support. However, various opinion polls show that there is growing doubt in the United States about the need to continue providing additional assistance to Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Yuanxi believes that after Austin came to power, in the process of assisting Ukraine, an alliance of 54 countries was formed to jointly support Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The first bird is shot&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On one side is the Republican Party The other side is the support of the Democrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Austin has played an important role in helping Ukraine and strengthening defense partnerships around the world.&quot; Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said of Austin defended his performance and said Democrats viewed the Republican pay cut proposal for Austin as a &quot;political stunt.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/09/21/house-gop-plans -to-pass-defense-budget-fail-again-as-shutdown-looms/&quot;>;As part of the debate over the fiscal 2024 defense appropriations bill&lt;/a>;, Republican lawmakers approved multiple similar proposals to cut their Don&#39;t like the pay for DoD jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that since the bill must pass the Democratic-controlled Senate and be signed by Biden, it is unlikely to be passed. But it marks yet another Republican rebuke of America’s current military leadership and reflects the country’s growing partisan divide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Yuanxi believes that cutting the salary of the Secretary of Defense is an emotional expression of the Republican Party’s opposition to Biden’s administration. The main purpose is to &quot;disgust&quot; Biden and pave the way for Trump&#39;s election. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This time the House of Representatives has adopted a tactic of clipping its wings. The target is directly at Biden, almost explicitly accusing him of improper employment.&quot; Yang Zhen believes that the House of Representatives believes that Austin is not up to the job, and destroying the U.S. armed forces is not an exaggeration. This is Biden&#39;s biggest problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2023, the results of a poll conducted by the American Gallup Consulting Company, a public opinion polling agency, showed that opinions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party continue to diverge. It is difficult to reach consensus on most issues, and American politics is increasingly divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Yuanxi believes that the fight between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in the United States is to attack President Biden and the Democratic Party by finding the weaknesses of a person in such a sensitive position as the Secretary of Defense. In fact, this is the result of a struggle between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of September 28, the U.S. House of Representatives voted on four separate appropriation bills. The four appropriation bills involved defense, homeland security, agriculture, and the State Department respectively. and external affairs. Three bills related to defense, homeland security, and the State Department and Foreign Affairs were passed, while the bill related to agriculture was vetoed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is noteworthy is that this budget dispute not only reflects the long-term contradictions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, but also creates a &quot;superposition of contradictions&quot; within the Republican Party, creating a complicated situation . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The dispute between the two parties has no bottom line.&quot; Yang Zhen analyzed that in the American political arena, the dispute between the two parties is the main theme, and the current security situation is not a problem for the United States. It is not optimistic. The opposition party&#39;s demand to reduce the salary of the Minister of Defense to US$1 is actually putting the interests of the party above the interests of the country. &quot;This is a very dangerous sign.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;To some Republicans, all Democrats are bad people, and vice versa.&quot; Dr. Todd Grande, a well-known American sociologist, once said Publicly stated, “This is a very simple and quite dangerous way of looking at the world.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 3, the U.S. House of Representatives dismissed the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives. McCarthy&#39;s motion was voted on, and the result was a narrow vote of 216 in favor and 210 against, passing the motion to remove McCarthy. This also marked McCarthy as the first speaker of the House of Representatives to be voted out of office in the history of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This recall incident has made American public opinion believe that the political struggle between the two parties will become more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Zhen analyzed that this incident left several impressions on voters: first, Biden made a mistake in employing personnel, and his own ability to exercise power is questionable; second, Biden&#39;s ability to exercise power is questionable; It is because the senior officials of the Biden administration are not qualified for their jobs, and this administration must step down; third, all the security problems facing the United States today are due to the Biden administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the degree of political division and intensification of conflicts in the United States, the 2024 election year is destined to be full of uncertainty. Where will the future of American politics go? Still remains to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Lin Xi also contributed to this article)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[怀化乡村：拨开云雾，宛若仙境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258935]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凯文·凯利：乐观正成为当下的稀缺品]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258993]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/rtQ8pkH6qICN7d7zir27NV4LHexFToo0mwhK5VQt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/rtQ8pkH6qICN7d7zir27NV4LHexFToo0mw hK5VQt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254477&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Future Emperor&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 12, 2023, outside the Reading Theater of the East Branch of Shanghai Library, the rain was pouring. In the reception room on the basement floor, KK was discussing the process with two guest hosts, and the camera was pointed at them. An hour ago, KK had just finished an exclusive interview with Southern People Weekly. This was the third media he received that day. The chicken sandwich prepared by the organizer had been lying on the table for more than half an hour, with no intention of being opened. In 12 minutes, the signing event for his new book &quot;Precious Life Advice&quot; will begin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;KK wears a decent shirt, trousers and sneakers. He is 71 years old, with a sparse top of his head, leaving only the white hair on his temples and a white beard that stretches from his chin to the side of his face. After nearly 14 hours of flight, he arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco the night before. At this moment, even with a 15-hour time difference and being crammed into a tight schedule, the fatigue in those blue eyes only flashed past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;KK is the abbreviation of Kevin Kelly, the founding editor-in-chief of the well-known technology magazine &quot;Wired&quot; and the author of &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Chinese readers often call him this. Kelly&#39;s most influential work in China is &quot;Out of Control&quot; written in the early 1990s. This book was once one of the must-read books for the protagonists of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) before reading the script. It was called &quot;the book of the 1990s&quot; by Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and the author of &quot;The Long Tail Theory&quot;. One of the most valuable books of the era.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading often and always new is one of its value expressions. If you open this book on Douban Reading, you will find that comments from readers from all over the world are densely dotted between the paragraphs. Until the ChatGPT craze in early 2023, there were still articles citing Kelly&#39;s view that &quot;machines are becoming biological, and organisms are being engineered.&quot; &quot;In releasing the power of life into the machines we create, we also lose control of them. They gain wildness, and with that wildness come some surprises and surprises. And then, that is what all creators must face The dilemma: They would no longer fully own their proudest creation,&quot; Kelly wrote in &quot;Out of Control.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book was first published in the United States in 1995. To the public, in an era when computers were still mainly used for office work and production, the concepts such as cloud computing, blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and digital currency discussed in &quot;Out of Control&quot; seemed too advanced. . This 528-page &quot;big book&quot; was not popular in the United States at that time, and it would be 15 years before it was truly &quot;born at the right time&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 2008, Kelly received a special email in his mailbox. The sender is a Chinese named Zhao Jiamin. At that time, the latter had just taken over as the general manager of the community translation platform &quot;Yiyan&quot; and was eager to explore the platform&#39;s business model. He had high hopes for translation and publishing. Which book should I start with? Zhao Jiamin thought of &quot;Out of Control&quot; recommended by a friend not long ago. It was a book that he fell in love with just by flipping through the catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The year &quot;Out of Control&quot; was published in the United States, Zhao Jiamin was still an undergraduate student in the Automation Department of Tsinghua University. A few years later, he went to the University of Southern California to further his studies and received a doctorate in industrial systems engineering, and then joined Oracle to engage in technology development. For Zhao Jiamin, who has a technical background, he chose this old book not because of his optimism about its potential market value, but because the &quot;complex systems&quot; discussed in the book are a topic that he has been interested in since college. The &quot;complex systems&quot; theory emerged in the 1990s, advocating the use of interdisciplinary methods to study the unified laws behind various complex systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a morning, Zhao Jiamin made the decision to buy the rights to publish this book in China. However, Kelly did not have high expectations for how much new royalties the Chinese market could bring. Instead, it was Zhao Jiamin&#39;s idea of ​​using &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; translation that aroused his interest. Kelly once described the operation of &quot;hive mind&quot; in nature in &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Now this collaborative thinking will promote the implementation of its Chinese version, which makes him &quot;amazed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Out of Control&quot; was released in China much later than Zhao Jiamin expected. During this period, it went through various twists and turns, such as the integration of the collaborative translation team, the separation of Yiyan.com, Zhao Jiamin&#39;s departure and starting a new business, etc. It was already the second half of 2010 when the review was completed. Under the background of &quot;nothing to delay&quot;, this book was launched at the end of 2010. Coincidentally, it was precisely the various &quot;out of control&quot; in the early stage that made the publication of &quot;Out of Control&quot; the perfect time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, with the popularization of smartphones and 4G networks, China made great strides from the PC Internet era to the mobile Internet era. When &quot;Out of Control&quot; was published in China, WeChat had been launched less than two months ago, Xiaomi and Meituan had only been established for nine months, and Alibaba had just achieved sustained profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;That year was a typical dividing point, and China&#39;s economy was about to enter a new upward cycle. If at this time, a highly regarded book tells you that there are traces to follow in the future, then no matter what Whether it is for psychological or financial reasons, of course there will be demand.&quot; Zhao Jiamin recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot;. In the Chinese translation, the subtitle of the book was changed from &quot;The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World&quot; to &quot;The Ultimate Fate and Outcome of All Humanity.&quot; Today, Zhao Jiamin still laments that the timing of publication is rare but cannot be sought, &quot;If it had been published a year earlier, it would probably have been unknown. A year late, the moment before dawn has been missed again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Out of Control&quot; &quot;After the publication, Kelly came to China for a week to participate in publicity. Zhao Jiamin described Kelly as one of the few foreign authors he had ever seen who was &quot;especially cooperative&quot;. The publishing team arranged more than a dozen interviews and five or six speeches for Kelly, which he readily accepted and gave his all. Relying on this round of intensive publicity, Kelly gained his first batch of readers in China and was able to establish his reputation among relevant practitioners, scholars who are sensitive to new technologies, and the media. It was precisely with this foreshadowing that &quot;Out of Control&quot; was able to catch another &quot;express train&quot; soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2012, Kelly went to China again. At the Tencent Beijing Clubhouse, talking side by side with Kelly was Tencent CEO Ma Huateng. The latter ranked fourth on the Forbes China Rich List that year. Since 2010, Tencent has been locked in the &quot;3Q war&quot; with Qihoo 360. Just ten days before this conversation took place, both parties announced that they would file lawsuits against the other party for their unethical behavior and abuse of market dominance during the 3Q war. According to Zhao Jiamin&#39;s recollection, Tencent was in urgent need of finding a suitable guest speaker to raise its voice in this public opinion war. Zhao Jiamin recommended Kelly, &quot;He was one of the few choices at the time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the conversation, Ma Huateng said that practitioners, including himself, were &quot;like frogs at the bottom of a well&quot; and &quot;trapped in a certain limited range.&quot; Inside, there is no way to globally observe the changes in the entire industry and the entire environmental ecology.&quot; We hope to get &quot;more forward-looking guidance&quot; from Kelly. The dialogue between the two parties covered topics such as corporate management, monopoly, personal privacy and Internet mobility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this &quot;peak dialogue between the &#39;Future Emperor&#39; and the &#39;Product Emperor&#39;&quot; promoted by the media, Kelly and his &quot;Out of Control&quot; became famous in China. Zhao Jiamin recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that the sales of &quot;Out of Control&quot; jumped from a few thousand copies at the end of the previous year to tens of thousands. &quot;As a &#39;big book&#39;, this number is far beyond expectations.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Godfather&quot;...the titles superimposed in front of Kelly&#39;s Chinese name are becoming more and more abundant. The popularity across the ocean surprised Kelly at the time. &quot;Although the sales of this book in the United States are getting better and better, it is far behind that in China. There is little competition among books of the same type. At that time, China&#39;s Internet had just begun. At first, I was surprised that so many people could find resonance in my book.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Invitations to speak came one after another. In 2014, Kelly was invited to attend the Zhejiang Entrepreneurs Conference. In the previous two conferences, the invited foreign guests were Jim Rogers, a well-known investor who has long been optimistic about China, and John Nesbitt, the author of &quot;Megatrends&quot;. &quot;You have to believe in the impossible. The greatest product in 20 years has not yet been invented!&quot; Kelly sounded encouraging at the end of his hour-and-a-half speech. Then, four words appeared on the huge screen - &quot;You are not late (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It&#39;s not too late to act now)&lt;/span>;! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Kelly had published many works such as &quot;What Technology Wants&quot; in China. He is still diligent in promoting. After leaving the large-scale business event with security personnel in Hangzhou, he rushed to Shanghai the next day to attend a book signing in a bookstore and talk to dozens of readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of Kelly&#39;s invited public speeches are about trends, which has always been his biggest selling point in China. In 2016, &quot;Inevitability&quot; was published in China. In the book, he listed &quot;12 inevitable technological forces&quot; that &quot;will shape the next 30 years&quot;. &quot;When our use of technology is close to the trajectory preferred by technology, we will be able to manage complexity, optimize interests and We are better at reducing the harm caused by technology.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like many well-known futurists, Kelly emphasized in the preface that “these forces are not destiny, but trajectories.” However, this does not affect the ability to take &quot;Logical Thinking&quot;, who won the rights to the world premiere of the book, said in the promotional copy that it &quot;predicts which areas will have major wealth opportunities in the next 30 years.&quot; Public information shows that the paper version of the book sold more than 100,000 copies in the first month after its release. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;Out of Control&quot; is the most famous in China, &quot;What Technology Wants&quot; is regarded by Kevin as the culmination of his thoughts, and &quot;Inevitable&quot; is the output of applying this methodology.&quot; In Zhao Jiamin It seems that the greatest value of Kelly&#39;s work is not prediction, but providing a technical philosophical framework that integrates complex fields such as machines, systems, biology and society. &quot;In this sense, these books are not outdated today.&quot; , human beings&#39; understanding of technology and human nature is still full of confusion and contradictions. But compared to obscure philosophy, most people&#39;s expectations will be more utilitarian - to see the future first. This is understandable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/B1k8KBSpzTnQT9Ec4mCteOlBadSv8RZaQUdpKRda.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/B1k8KBSpzTnQT9Ec4mCteOlBadSv8RZaQUdpKRda.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254472&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhao Jiamin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New topic&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recipient Affected by the new crown epidemic, Kelly last visited China four years ago. As of early September 2023, there are only two direct flights per week from San Francisco, where he lives, to Shanghai. &quot;There used to be several shifts every day,&quot; Kelly said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. Department of Transportation announced in August 2023 that starting from September 1, Chinese airlines will be allowed to operate 18 pairs of direct round-trip passenger flights between China and the United States every week, and from October 29 Increased to 24 pairs per week (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Note: the number in August was only 12&lt;/span>;). However, according to data from aviation data analysis company Cirium (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ruisiyu)&lt;/span>;, the international flight capacity of the Chinese aviation industry in October 2023 The overall level was 54.7% of the pre-epidemic level; during the National Day holiday, routes to Japan, South Korea and Central Europe recovered quickly, while flights between China and the United States remained at a very low level compared with 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Normally, there are more foreigners on flights to China. I didn&#39;t pay special attention this time, but it seemed that most of the people on the plane were Chinese faces.&quot; Kelly recalled to &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; the day before What you see on board. On the night he arrived in Shanghai on September 11, he went to the Bund specifically. The landscape lighting themed light and shadow show that he often remembered in the past was not staged, but the familiar popularity still came to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kelly came to Shanghai just a few days before the 34th Shanghai Tourism Festival. Promotional slogans - &quot;Into Beauty and Joy&quot; are hung on both sides of some main roads. In the first half of 2023, Shanghai&#39;s cultural tourism consumer market took the lead in the country in accelerating recovery. The city received 139 million domestic tourists and achieved domestic tourism revenue of 155.019 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of more than 100%. In contrast, the number of inbound tourists in the first half of the year was only 1.24 million, less than 13% of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Bill Gates, who also visited China again after four years in June, said, &quot;In four years, the world has undergone tremendous changes.&quot; Leaving the bustling crowd on the Bund, Kelly found himself in Another context. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being invited to attend the 2023ESG Global Leaders Conference, another important task of Kelly&#39;s trip is to promote his new book &quot;Precious Life Advice&quot;. On his 68th birthday, Kelly began penning down some life advice for his children. In the following years, he continued to write new ones, &quot;getting pleasure from compression and decompression&quot;, and finally selected 500 pieces to be collected into a book. Different from tomes that require careful consideration of words and sentences, this booklet of about 200 pages is more in line with the &quot;short, flat and quick&quot; public reading purpose in the fragmented era. It seems that everyone can get some resonance, inspiration, or relief from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 12, when I walked through the crowds queuing up to buy books and arrived at the venue, it was still 5 minutes before the official start of the event at 6:30. The theater, which can accommodate more than 700 people, is already 70% full. I was sitting in the middle of the venue. On the left was a girl holding a pink Stella Dew plush backpack. She was taking a selfie with Kelly&#39;s new book. On the right was a middle-aged man wearing a dark blue polo shirt and a primary school student of about third or fourth grade. ; In the front are an old woman with a white bun, a young woman eager to stuff tomatoes into her mouth, and a young man wearing a Hawaiian-style short-sleeved shirt with white flowers and red bottom; in the aisle, there is another man holding a The young father of a several-month-old baby paces back and forth. Even though it was a working day and a rainy day, the venue was almost full after an hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this conversation that lasted for an hour and a half, Xu was following the theme of his new book, and &quot;lying flat&quot; became the most common topic mentioned by the guests and questioners on the spot. In fact, Kelly is no stranger to this term. In a media interview earlier that day, he had already learned the accurate pronunciation of this Chinese word from the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I lie down every night.&quot; Kelly joked when answering the host Dong Chenyu, a lecturer at the School of Journalism at Renmin University of China, about whether young people in the United States will &#39;lie down&#39;. He went on to mention his own experience, &quot;In the 1960s, I experienced the hippie movement. At that time, young people&#39;s &#39;lying flat&#39; was a rebellion against the existing system. In a sense, &#39;lying flat&#39; is not without value. .I often encourage people to do things when they are young that have nothing to do with society&#39;s definition of success, to do things that are a &#39;waste of time&#39; and have no immediate reward. These experiences will become your muse later in life. Of course, you will eventually You need to stand up one day, because only creating new is a rebellion against the old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The topic did not end easily. In the question-and-answer session later, a female audience member who looked to be in her early twenties asked again, &quot;How should young people deal with the current situation of &#39;can&#39;t roll up and can&#39;t lie flat&#39;?&quot; The audience burst into laughter. After several minutes of relay translation between the two hosts, I’m not sure whether Kelly could understand the twists and turns behind this repeatedly stated question. Kelly attempts to express the inevitability of living with contradiction. &quot;So I should accept the status quo?&quot; the girl concluded, disappearing into another round of laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the conversation ended, I dispersed with the crowd. Several men in their 40s gathered together to discuss how they &quot;didn&#39;t enjoy themselves&quot; during the dialogue and question-and-answer sessions. They are obviously more interested in Kelly&#39;s &quot;technological prophecies&quot; than &quot;life mottos.&quot; I told Zhao Jiamin the feedback from these &quot;technical fans&quot;. &quot;Most people born in the 70s and 80s became fans of Kevin through &quot;Out of Control&quot;. The establishment of many people&#39;s technical ideological systems, including myself, was somewhat influenced by him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years have passed by. &quot;Financial Eleven&quot; wrote in &quot;The Sharp Decline of China&#39;s Unicorns: Helplessness and Vitality&quot; that most of China&#39;s existing leading unicorn companies were established around 2012, and the mobile Internet, which has a low threshold for entrepreneurship, was once the best However, with the end of the mobile Internet dividend period and changes in the general environment, the necessary factors that contributed to the birth of unicorns are weakening or even disappearing. Today, investment is still strong in robotics, semiconductors and ESG (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Environment, social and corporate governance&lt;/span>;) and other fields. People have to adapt to the new cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Jiamin can understand the differences in concerns of different groups and different stages of life. This is not a different response to anxiety. Some people hope to find opportunities on the &quot;map of the future&quot;; some people suffer from internal friction in &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;lying down&quot; and hope to find concentration in the wise man&#39;s mottos. As Kelly said in &quot;Precious Life Advice,&quot; &quot;My suggestions are not rules. They are like hats. If one doesn&#39;t fit, try another.&quot; People are constantly &quot;trying on hats.&quot; ”, because the days are always moving forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A well-known futurist once defined his role this way - &quot;facilitate complex conversations about the future, inspire others to think incredible things, and challenge their biases and assumptions about the past, present and future.&quot; In this sense, four years later, Kevin Kelly, a 71-year-old American futurist, will find that the high-spirited Chinese readers he was once familiar with are giving him more difficult problems. After all, there may be traces of the &quot;inevitable&quot; inner trend, but no one can give an accurate answer on how to heal the &quot;out of control&quot; present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djjsGL5twqf7s0xD4VNzPkUj7j89ZDG6eKEKuy89.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djjsGL5twqf7s0xD4VNzPkUj7j89ZDG6eKEKuy89.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 15, 2017, Kevin Kelly (left) watched robot operation at the Singularity Robot Experience Hall of Zhejiang Robot Industry Group&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Talk about direction, not destination&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the most interesting part of your job, and what is the most challenging? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kevin Kelly: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t have a “career” in the traditional sense. I&#39;ve been very lucky to have always climbed the ladder of my interests. I am my own boss, I control my own time, and if I can do that I am one of the richest people in the world. The most challenging thing is how to take full advantage of this and create something that only I can create. As I wrote in &quot;Valuable Life Advice,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be the best, be the only one.&quot; I don&#39;t want to spend my limited time doing things that everyone else can do. It can be difficult, especially for young people, to figure out your relative strengths. When you are young, it doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t find the exact answer, you can work towards it. This is why I like to talk about directions rather than destinations. You may never reach your destination, but you can keep moving toward it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 20 to 27 years old, you are an independent The photographer has traveled to more than a dozen Asian countries and regions.

That experience cultivated my optimism and allowed me to talk about technology in a more confident way, not from a purely technical perspective, but from a technical and cultural perspective. This has also become my uniqueness. Your uniqueness is based not only on your talents, interests, and habits, but also on your experiences.

In 1987, I heard that the first artificial life symposium would be held in Los Alamos.

I had never seen a conference like this anywhere else and I knew I couldn&#39;t miss it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was strapped for cash at the time. After buying the air tickets, I could no longer afford the hotel. The seminar lasted three or four days. I spent the day at the venue and spent the night at a nearby campsite. The seminar held a total of about 60 speeches, and I attended all of them. The content of the speeches was very novel and interesting. Later, I compiled the key information of each speech and published it on the Internet. Although the audience was small, the response was very enthusiastic, so I came up with the idea of ​​writing a book on technology integration. This is my first book. I started writing in 1990 and it took about three years to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a period of rapid economic growth, people are full of longing for the future.

The leader of the coup and the former captain of the presidential guard deposed President Ba Zum stopped exporting uranium ore to France. After negotiations between the two sides failed, French President Macron announced that he would withdraw all troops stationed in Nigeria by the end of this year. How much impact will this have on the “return to Africa” strategy proposed by the French government a few years ago? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To predict this, we must first understand the concepts of &quot;French Africa&quot; ​​and &quot;CFA Franc&quot; in African geopolitics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​and &quot;African Franc&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an old colonial power, France had nearly 13 million square kilometers of colonies at its peak, ranking second after the United Kingdom. Its colonies are mainly in Africa, and once occupied 37% of the total area of ​​Africa. Such a vast African area, with French as the official language, is called &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After World War II, the &quot;anti-colonialism&quot; movement rose around the world. France sent troops to suppress the independence movements in Indochina and Algeria. After the defeat of the war, France realized that &quot;colonialism&quot; was over and followed this historical trend. Former French colonies became independent one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 1960s, the colonial systems of Britain and France have completely collapsed. In the &quot;post-colonial era&quot;, the relationship between the old colonial empires and the former colonies of the Third World has gradually entered the realm of equality at the international political level. era. Of course, due to uneven development in other aspects such as economy, technology, culture, society, and life, Western countries have market advantages in international commerce and trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1945, the French government issued the &quot;French African Colonial Franc&quot;. Each French colony in Africa established a &quot;business account&quot; in the French Ministry of Finance and deposited all foreign exchange into this account. The fixed exchange ratio between the &quot;French franc&quot; and the &quot;Chinese franc&quot; is 1:1.7. As of 1949, France controlled 80% of the exports and 75% of the imports of African colonies through financial means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1958, France formulated the &quot;Constitution of the Fifth Republic&quot; and changed the &quot;French Federation&quot; to the &quot;French Community&quot;. Each member state of the &quot;Community&quot; enjoys autonomy in domestic affairs, economy, etc., but foreign affairs, defense, etc. are still controlled by France. After 1960, 12 countries in the &quot;community&quot; became independent. In 1961, the &quot;Community&quot; Senate announced its dissolution. Since then, France has maintained relatively close bilateral relations with the original Community member states in the form of bilateral treaties, trade agreements, and &quot;associated countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the French colonial system, French African countries became independent one after another. The new African states banded together to negotiate with the French government. These newly independent French African countries formed the &quot;Monetary Union of West African Countries&quot; in 1962, and the &quot;Bank of Central African States&quot; was established in 1972. These two central bank systems uniformly issue the legal tender of these new countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;West African CFA Franc (FCFA): 8 countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d&#39;Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo formed the &quot;West African Economic and Monetary Union&quot; and issued The currency is called the &quot;CFA franc&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Central African CFA Franc (CFAF): Cameroon, Central Africa, Congo (Brazzaville), Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Chad and other six countries form the &quot;Central African Economic and Monetary Community&quot;, called &quot;African Financial Cooperation&quot; franc&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Chinese CFA franc&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;CFA Franc Zone&quot; covers 15 African countries south of the Sahara (the island nation of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, which issues the Comorian franc separately) with a population of approximately 155 million. The exchange rates of &quot;West African CFA franc&quot; and &quot;Central CFA franc&quot; are equal, but they cannot circulate with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1960, France issued the New Franc (Nouveau Franc), whose currency value was determined to be 100 times that of the old Franc, equivalent to 0.1802 grams of gold content. The fixed exchange ratio between the French franc and the CFA franc is 1:50. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s and 1990s, Africa&#39;s economic development was slow, stagnant, and even seriously regressed. Fiscal deficits in various countries soared, inflation was serious, and debt problems intensified. The global financial community generally believed that the &quot;CFA franc&quot; was overvalued. With the intervention of the &quot;World Bank&quot; and the &quot;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&quot;, in 1994, the fixed exchange ratio between the &quot;French franc&quot; and the &quot;CFA franc&quot; , adjusted to 1:100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 1999, the &quot;EU&quot; recognized the currency cooperation agreement between France and the CFA franc zone, and approved the &quot;CFA franc&quot; to be officially linked to the upcoming euro, with a fixed exchange rate of (CFA franc: euro) 655.957: 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political Independence Vs Economic or Monetary &quot;Dependence&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Now that these former French African countries have achieved political independence, why do they have to be closely linked to France in terms of economy, especially currency? The reason is: the social structure and economic development of these African countries are backward, and their national economies are completely dependent on France. Modern currency is no longer a physical currency defined by the gold standard, silver standard or bi-standard precious metals, but has evolved into a national credit symbol. Banknotes that lack credibility will not be recognized by the international community, and the region&#39;s economy will collapse. After currency collapse, great social unrest, or even horrific famine and bloody civil war, often occur within a short period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the &quot;Western CFA franc and Central African CFA franc&quot; issued by African countries had to continue to be pegged to the franc. Relying on the credit endorsement of the franc&#39;s international currency status, these countries maintained the general stability for decades after their independence. , for the people there, the more simple function is that the more stable &quot;CFA franc&quot; can buy food and have food to eat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, France made huge profits from the relationship between the franc and the &quot;Chinese franc&quot;, which played an important role in France&#39;s post-war reconstruction and economic revival after World War II. At the same time, black people in &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​can also take advantage of the exchange of &quot;Chinese francs&quot; with French francs in their hands to go to France to study and do business, creating a large number of &quot;African elites&quot; who accept French thought and culture and speak French. This gives France great ideological, cultural, political and economic advantages in &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. At the same time, among the nearly 68 million people in France, there are nearly 8 million blacks (including illegal immigrants), accounting for nearly 12%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the long-term cooperation process, France and Africa compromised with each other: the headquarters of the &quot;Central Bank of West African States&quot; and &quot;Central Bank of Central African States&quot; were moved from Paris to Dakar and Yaounde in Africa respectively. . Alliance member states will adjust the proportion of foreign exchange deposited in the Bank of France from 100% to 65%. The &quot;West African Central Bank&quot; has a 7-member board of directors, with French directors reduced to 2; the &quot;Central African Central Bank&quot; has a 12-member board of directors, with French directors reduced to 3, which greatly reduces the weight of France and increases the rights of Africa. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1973, France signed the &quot;Currency Cooperation Agreement&quot; with the &quot;West African Monetary Union&quot;, defining four principles of currency cooperation:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. The principle of rigid exchange, France ensures the stability of the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot; Exchange rigidity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. The principle of fixed parity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. The principle of free flow, there is no restriction on the flow of funds within the &quot;West African Monetary Union&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;4. On the principle of centralized management of foreign exchange reserves, the proportion of foreign exchange reserves deposited by West African countries in the Bank of France will be reduced to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the &quot;CFA Franc&quot;, the franc&#39;s international currency status, credit endorsement, and support from the French government (especially France&#39;s commitment to the rigid exchangeability of the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot;) protect the economies of Central Africa and West Africa. It played an important role in maintaining social stability in the former French African region. In the 1970s, life in these African countries was pretty good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 1999, when the euro was born and the French franc withdrew from the stage of history, the &quot;CFA franc&quot; was pegged to the euro at a fixed exchange rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on the long-term stability of the franc and the euro, the &quot;Cfrican franc&quot; has maintained a strong currency value even in the turbulent era of wars, frequent coups, and social crises in other parts of Africa. This has played a vital role in maintaining the existence of the government in &quot;French-speaking African&quot; countries and surviving the continuous wars, coups, economic crises, and social unrest across Africa. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with other regions in Africa, the &quot;CFA Franc Zone&quot; has avoided inflation caused by excessive currency issuance and maintained currency credibility and stability. Between 2014 and 2017, the global inflation rate ranged from 2.8% to 3.2%, and the sub-Saharan (outside the &quot;CFA franc zone&quot;) inflation rate soared from 6.3% to 11.3%. The inflation rate in the &quot;CFA franc zone&quot; has always remained between 0.7% and 1.7%. With good monetary credibility, the &quot;CFA Franc&quot; maintains the record as the longest-lasting fixed exchange rate mechanism in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1994, Central African countries established the &quot;China-Africa Economic and Monetary Union Community&quot;. In addition to the monetary union and economic union, they also established a Community Parliament and a Community Court. In 2000, West African countries formed an economic community with the West African CFA franc as a link, gradually eliminating trade barriers and unifying tariffs within the alliance, and achieving common economic progress and retreat. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;French troops in Africa&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the end of the &quot;Cold War&quot;, ideological conflicts gave way to Huntington&#39;s so-called &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;, and &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​is no exception. The conflict of civilizations in the context of great power competition for hegemony has even threatened the survival of many African countries. In 2012, the Malian government forces were defeated by the anti-government forces. The Malian government had no choice but to ask France, its former sovereign state, to send troops to rescue them. In 2013, the French army launched &quot;Operation Serval&quot; to drive the anti-government forces into the desert in northern Mali. , helped the Malian government regain most of its territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current military operations carried out by France in &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot; ​​are not the colonial military aggression of &quot;might is right&quot; two centuries ago, but a stability-maintaining alliance military operation within the framework of modern international law. A hallmark of this type of action is that it requires a formal invitation from a legitimate government. If the local government does not agree to the continued presence of foreign troops, the French troops will have to withdraw. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The withdrawal of the French army from Niger is an example of this type of military operation: the French army was invited by the legitimate government of Niger to come to &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; (maintain stability). However, a military coup occurred in Niger. Although the current regime lacked legitimacy, it issued an expulsion order and the French army had to withdraw. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;From West African CFA Franc to Eco? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;France considers that ancient &quot;colonialism&quot; is gone forever. The so-called &quot;return to Africa&quot; ​​strategy refers to France using a modern social form to rebuild an equal relationship with &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. New inter-state relations. The first priority is currency, and the major decision made by France is to support the currency reform of &quot;French-speaking Africa&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 21, 2019, French President Macron reached an agreement with the Chairman of the &quot;West African Economic and Monetary Union&quot; and announced that he was preparing to abolish the &quot;West African CFA Franc&quot; and use a new currency &quot;Eco&quot; in 2020. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This currency reform has three main changes:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Abolish the West African CFA franc and use the new currency Eco. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. The Central Bank of West Africa will no longer hand over 50% of its foreign exchange to France for management and can freely configure its foreign exchange portfolio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. France withdrew and no longer sent representatives to the &quot;West African Economic and Monetary Union&quot; banking institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, after the &quot;West African CFA Franc&quot; was reformed into Eco, two &quot;unchanges&quot; were maintained:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First: Eco is still pegged to the euro, maintaining a fixed exchange rate of 655.957:1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second: France’s commitment to West African countries remains unchanged, and it can provide foreign exchange support if there is a crisis in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the &quot;West African CFA franc&quot; is one of the important measures in France&#39;s &quot;return to Africa&quot; ​​strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France aims to promote the economic integration of the &quot;West African CFA franc zone&quot; in order to attract countries such as Nigeria and Ghana outside the franc zone to join. As the original initiator and guarantor of this new economic cooperation zone, France will have the greatest say in the currency union and become the biggest beneficiary of Africa&#39;s cheap labor and abundant natural resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the countries in the &quot;West African CFA franc zone&quot;: having the right to issue currency conforms to their domestic &quot;financial nationalism&quot; trend and is conducive to increasing the government&#39;s reputation and safeguarding the survival of the regime. Most West African countries are small in size and have small economies. There is no economic power in the region to guarantee support for the implementation of a unified currency, so they must rely on France for support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, if countries outside the alliance (Nigeria, Ghana) can meet certain economic and other conditions, Eco does not rule out the possibility of attracting them to join, thereby establishing a larger monetary union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously: France’s goal is to focus on Nigeria. Nigeria is not only rich in oil resources, but also has a population of more than 200 million and maintains the highest fertility rate in the world. Some scholars predict that Nigeria&#39;s population may reach about 700 million by the late 21st century. According to some schools of thought, the &quot;demographic dividend&quot; is huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the agreement, the issuance of the new currency Eco requires each country to meet certain economic indicators as a threshold, such as: fiscal deficit does not exceed 3% of GDP, inflation is within 10%, and public debt does not exceed 70% of GDP. etc., it is still a test for these countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of 2022, neither the &quot;West African CFA franc zone&quot; countries nor French officials have announced a specific timetable for Eco&#39;s advancement. Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, West African countries have experienced sharp declines in fiscal revenue, sharp increases in public expenditures, and high fiscal deficits. They are unable to reach the previously preset threshold, and the issuance of new currencies will be delayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The French government’s big game in “French-speaking Africa” and the “African Franc Zone” is of course based on French interests. But this is a new arrangement in the &quot;post-colonialism&quot; era. On the one hand, France maintains its influence in these places, but on the other hand, it also has to contribute money, effort and credit. Some countries are not willing to play with France in this way. France They have to withdraw obediently, so France generally plays the role of &quot;big brother&quot; or &quot;co-leader&quot;. If there is a younger brother who does not recognize this &quot;big brother&quot; or does not recognize this &quot;co-leader&quot;, France cannot use force as it did in the past.
