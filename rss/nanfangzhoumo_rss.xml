Chen Chong is one of the three directors of the movie &quot;Her in the World&quot; to be released on September 9, 2022, the other two are Sylvia Chang and Li Shaohong. The film tells an emotional story under difficult circumstances, involving mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, couples and lovers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, Chen Chong received a call from producer Dong Wenjie, hoping to invite several well-known female directors to jointly shoot a movie. She finally decided to tell the story of a pair of lovers separated in two places, &quot;to explore the closest expression of the oldest theme of love.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like all previous works she directed, Chen Chong wrote the script herself. She repeatedly looked at the real photos taken by her colleagues. There was a supermarket scene in the movie, so she found many supermarket CCTVs and watched them, wanting to know details such as the denseness of the crowds. The script was originally written to rain, and the rendering of rain was used to increase the atmosphere, but later she learned that there was no rain in reality on the day set in the movie, so she removed this setting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Without the rain, wouldn&#39;t the story have happened? Wouldn&#39;t the feelings be conveyed? So, whether there is rain or not is not important, but whether there is the conveyance of emotions is important.&quot; She said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her in the World&quot; was originally scheduled to be released on the May Day holiday in 2021, but was later postponed to the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2022. During the editing of the film, a Southern Weekend staff writer interviewed Chen Chong in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Love and loss are eternal&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;The setting of this movie sounds a bit like Love in the Time of Cholera. When you were approaching this story, did you have a clear setting from the beginning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After receiving the invitation from the producer, I searched online for a week and finally found this story about lovers who were exiled in two places. Touched me. The girl returned to Beijing to visit her parents during the Spring Festival, but she has not been able to see her boyfriend who was locked down in Wuhan since then. This melody of love, loss, and exile resonated with me—I too am unable to travel home to visit my elderly parents due to the pandemic. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For lovers who are blocked in two cities, the mobile phone screen is something that arouses their infinite desire and is warmer than real life. In fact, this is also the relationship between most people and their mobile phones. Especially during the epidemic, people’s interactions with others and their understanding of the world come from mobile phones. The contradictions and conflicts in human nature also come from people&#39;s different interpretations of online messages. We all seem to be living on isolated islands in our mobile phones. The more attractive &quot;reality&quot; on the screen seems more &quot;real&quot; than life itself. The themes of love and loss, life and death are ancient and timeless, and my challenge was to give it a new screen narrative for today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever considered adding a paragraph about their love history? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Absolutely no flashbacks. This story is that these two people are always in different frames, and it wants you to be deeply moved by them. These are the rules I set for myself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the era of the epidemic, two people can only use mobile phones What love words can a lover say during a video call? What excites you about the process of writing a screenplay? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Their conversations are actually very simple conversations, the most daily and common conversations. My husband and I often do this too. Video communication. These two people are in love. They video chat when they wake up in the morning, before going to bed at night, and while cooking and brushing teeth. They chat casually in separate places, but it makes people feel the joy and love of two people together. , this is my excitement point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the emotional tone expressed in this story? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a story about true love. If a person can love like this once, he is very lucky. Not everyone can love like this. Because he has had real happiness, and the sadness of loss is sublimated into the beauty in the black mirror. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people in the world are actually not satisfied with love in their hearts. So I believe it, but the desire and demand for love still seems very strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After we finished filming, several of the main creators climbed Xiangshan Mountain. After climbing to the top, they saw many people writing blessing signs. . I said let’s hang one too, and we wrote our blessings for the movie and hung it there. I looked through it carefully, and there were hundreds of tags, and there were countless love words in them. They were all &quot;So-and-so loves so-and-so&quot; and &quot;So-and-so will be with so-and-so forever.&quot; More than half of them, you can Did you say that love is gone? impossible. When you fall in love, can you stop yourself? Even this bit of vitality is gone, and your life has been in vain. This thing is different from desire. It is really a gift from God to you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Princess Sissi is the Empress of Austria. She has extremely happy resources and unlimited money, and her husband loves her very much. He has worshiped her and been obsessed with her all his life, but she is not happy. I don’t know how the paradox in life is formed. Is love the greatest value of happiness in life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, this is a gift. You don’t need to be good enough or work hard. You don’t need to do your homework. You don’t need to move bricks. You don&#39;t need anything, it will come to you. Maybe love won&#39;t be important in the future, I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t imagine it. Why refuse such a gift? I can&#39;t imagine. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The role starring Yi Yang Qianxi, at the beginning Is it just set at the age of two or three years after graduating from college? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Absolutely. We met in college, have been in love for four years, and are about to get married. He is the happiest young man after graduating from college. period. The simplest dream of having this simple college sweetheart is to get married, the girl can wear a wedding dress, and the boy can put a ring on her. The definition of disaster is when the simplest dreams are destroyed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From a distant perspective, love is a An ordinary story is about a man and a woman falling in love. Your film is set in a specific time and space. What happened in this love story? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, movies are such a thing. There is no need to make sense, and there is no reason to make love. It’s not that you think this person is a good match for this person, that has nothing to do with it. I&#39;m going to give you something that I believe you will believe. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/22/AyDbJY0ejP1bgC5wplwp0rFOdfYLmKYPeg1imHQZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1439&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/22/AyDbJY0ejP1bgC5wplwp0rFOdfYLmKYPeg1imHQZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;209384&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Chong directed a short film in &quot;Her in the World&quot;, telling the story of a pair of lovers who were separated in two places during the epidemic. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I can see clues of my dishonesty”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you studied directing in the United States? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I studied TV production and took some directing classes, but that directing class was completely useless. In fact, film is an apprenticeship, and film school comes later. When the movie first started, everyone was learning on the spot, apprentice-style. The kind of learning from a master should be more useful. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You directed the first film &quot;Tianba&quot; When you were young, you cut it yourself. By then, did you already have strong confidence to complete it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no strong self-confidence, only strong desire. I&#39;m not a particularly confident person, and self-doubt is a big part of my thinking. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But outsiders see that you have many successes, which proves that you Be qualified to do it yourself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will always think that it is a coincidence, that it is a misunderstanding, that it confuses people. I think so, In fact, this may be the case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever gone to the cinema to watch your own movie? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Very few. I&#39;ve seen it, but it&#39;s quite unbearable. I actually have a very sensitive radar. I can see the clues of my own dishonesty. Maybe others can’t see it, but I can definitely see it. So watching your own movies is not an easy task. Movies are not a tool for actors, but for directors, so you are a pawn in it, and if you see your own problems, it does not affect your feeling that the movie is pretty good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The films you directed are all because of yourself Do you have the desire to create, or do you have to find funds or outside sources? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Both. If funds come to me and I don’t have the desire, I will definitely not go. Because being a director is quite hard for me and not an easy thing. I am not a genius director, nor am I a technical director. I have limited talent and limited skills. If I don’t have a strong narrative desire, then I simply can’t do this. So you must have a strong narrative desire to do it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The movies you direct are all written by yourself ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I must, because it is not difficult for me. Of course I hope to get opinions and tips from like-minded creators, as well as a lot of information that everyone has worked on together, because I think information is the best thing for me to write a script. But the script is actually the movie I see in my mind when I close my eyes. I write it down first, and it will definitely change after all the main creators come in. But the first thing you write down is the movie you see in your head, so it&#39;s not that difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When was the first time you stood on the Oscar stage? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Last Emperor&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you feel a great sense of satisfaction at that moment? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, when I was young, I didn’t particularly care about work or these things. I only cared about falling in love. In fact, work gives me a chance to buffer, and it saves me from the whirlpool of emotions time and time again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said that your main business at that time was negotiating When you are in love, do you now feel that those times were a waste? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No waste. I don’t know what is wasteful. It may be a bit wasteful to keep doing things you don’t want to do. For example, if you are in love, if you do something you want to do, but that thing is ridiculous or wrong, or it brings you a lot of losses, I think it still cannot be considered a waste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever been on stage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t dare. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because I am afraid of crowds, I am especially afraid of crowds. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is true that Chinese domestic movies rarely look older Do you have a female character with a solid concept? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Very few, too few, especially in the current film culture, which advocates youth, and the requirements and standards for women are still... You know it. Your richness, your soul, your complexity, it does not have a carrier, because your body is not accepted, where does it find its home? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you subconsciously try to please female audiences when making movies? , consider what they think, and not offend them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Your responsibility is to be honest, your responsibility is not to please, your responsibility should be to express yourself. When I make movies, I never think about the fact that I should make movies about women. I don’t have that burden. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you put this scene in a reality show, no matter how you perform it, it will be like chewing wax&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Media reporters sometimes subconsciously connect your characters, such as Wanrong and Hong Rose. Maybe those strong people in the characters who can fight for their own rights think that They are feminist heroes, do you have that connection? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was playing Wan Rong or in &quot;Red Rose and White Rose&quot;, or in Jiang Wen&#39;s movie, I never thought about women. Rights, women&#39;s status, women&#39;s anything, were never considered. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You filmed &quot;Red Roses and White Roses&quot; Did you like Zhang Ailing when you were young? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I like Zhang Ailing, but I am not a Zhang fan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Who do you like among female writers? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Marguerite Duras, who wrote &quot;The Lover&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; are some old ones, and Polish author Olga Tokarczuk is the 2018 Nobel Prize-winning writer. I especially like &quot;Fireworks in March&quot; written by Li Bihua. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Lu Wei talks about the movie &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; , Li Bihua’s original novel is a second-rate novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Sometimes a first-class novel really cannot change a movie. If you think about it, it is already first-class, what else can you do to it? It just takes second- and third-rate talent to turn it into a movie and take it to a higher level. I don&#39;t really like Li Bihua&#39;s books, but I read &quot;Fireworks in March&quot; and was very shocked. A friend gave it to me and I started reading it on the train. When I got to pages 60 and 70, I said it was a bit difficult and this was a bit too painful. She said if you persist, you will be rewarded. I persisted in reading it, and it was a great reward. Only long novels can give you such a sense of satisfaction. You can&#39;t get it anywhere else. It&#39;s satisfying but also regretful at the same time. Why did you finish reading it? It&#39;s so good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You wrote that when your daughter was 9 years old, The birthday gifts you want are books and swimming. Is this tradition of reading a result of your family environment when you were a child? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, when I was a kid, I didn’t have many books or anything interesting to read. My grandma has a small box, which contains some things brought back from abroad, including some comic books and other biographies of Dong Cunrui and Jiao Yulu. There are actually very few things to read. My grandmother had a set of Chekhov&#39;s short stories, but they were no longer complete at that time, so I read them piecemeal. Because they like to read, and I also like to read. My mother stopped me from reading at that time because she thought it was not good and it was better to do some homework, do housework, and go out to play. My mother is a medical scientist. After retirement, she only reads novels. She likes to read novels. In the past two days, I have been looking at her bookshelf, which contains a wide range of Chinese and foreign books, including Wang Anyi, Chi Li, Chen Zhongshi, Nabokov&#39;s &quot;Lolita&quot; and Hemingway&#39;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is your own reading like? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no standard thing. I have read some romance novels, for example. I was shocked when I read Marquez&#39;s book. My English was not good at that time. Not long after I arrived in the United States, I was very tired from reading &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. I couldn&#39;t look it up in the dictionary and explain it to you with just one click. I was very confused. Tired and very slow. I was shocked. Is this what the book says? So it’s very, very complicated. I read it when I was in China. I don’t know where I found Kafka and also read it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What role does writing play in your life? proportion? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not a heavy proportion. During the epidemic, because we are locked up at home, having such a luxury is not the norm, and it does not mean that we have to write every day. But I love words, and I write when I’m in quarantine. I didn&#39;t study much when I was in elementary school or middle school. I went to Shanghai Film Academy less than one semester after middle school. I have never read any domestic classical books. The real education comes after studying abroad. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, there have been several domestic performances. Have you ever been to a reality show? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I participated in one and it didn’t make me die of embarrassment. Once in a show, someone was asked to play a scene in which I played Wanrong before, and then I was asked to comment on it. I said, how can I comment on this? I cannot comment on this, because countless masters have created such an environment and atmosphere for me. Without the magic of the movie itself, putting this scene in a live-action show would be like chewing wax no matter how you play it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[20岁的她会是中国女子网球的希望吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257924]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 15:00:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/J49b237SL4yZBk0wxflFj4doMIOdarYuYzsro5qS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/J49b237SL4yZBk0wxflFj4doMIOdarYuY zsro5qS. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252800&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, in the women’s singles tennis final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Zheng Qinwen won 2 Defeated Zhu Lin 0-0 and won the championship &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The women&#39;s tennis at the Asian Games that ended on September 29, 2023 In the singles final, Chinese player Zheng Qinwen defeated teammate Zhu Lin in straight sets 6:2, 6:4 and won the gold medal in the women&#39;s singles tennis event at the Hangzhou Asian Games.

Zheng Qinwen, who only turned 21 in October this year, has just begun his career. The excellent results have given fans high expectations for this Hubei girl: After Li Na, the representative Chinese female tennis player, retires, will she, who is also from Hubei, be the next hope for Chinese women&#39;s tennis? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/WBGP66uN3qIInLbWR6KFYC7U06hMeuAE5yJwTZRZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/WBGP66uN3qIInLbWR6KFYC7U06hMeuAE5yJwTZRZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252801&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, Zheng Qinwen returned the ball in the women&#39;s singles tennis final of the Hangzhou Asian Games&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Rocket Girl&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September 2014, tennis player Li Na officially retired. In her 15-year career, she reached the WTA women&#39;s singles finals 21 times and won a total of 9 WTA and 19 ITF singles championships, including the 2011 French Open and the 2014 Australian Open women&#39;s singles championships. She is Asia&#39;s first Grand Slam women&#39;s singles champion. She was once ranked second in the world&#39;s women&#39;s tennis singles rankings, with a total career record of 503 wins and 188 losses. When she retired, she was ranked sixth in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Na&#39;s retirement has left an insurmountable peak and a huge vacuum for Chinese women&#39;s tennis. She has retired for more than nine years. At least so far, there has not been a player in Chinese women&#39;s tennis who can surpass her or even be on par with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, when Li Na lifted her first Suzanne Langland Cup at Roland Garros in Paris, 9-year-old Zheng Qinwen was receiving tennis training in Wuhan under Li Na’s former coach Teacher Yu Liqiao. In her memory, it seemed that people all over the country were paying attention to Li Na&#39;s game that day. &quot;Li Na&#39;s victory planted a dream in me. One day I will also win a Grand Slam.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was the third year that Zheng Qinwen officially started tennis training. In 2008, Zheng Qinwen&#39;s father took her to Beijing to watch the tennis match at the Olympic Games. Zheng Qinwen thought quietly. After the game, she and her father repeatedly discussed the details on the court and told her father that she was very interested in tennis. His father was once an athlete. He took Zheng Qinwen to play table tennis, badminton, basketball, and volleyball... His daughter was able to get started, but she was not outstanding. This time, he decided to let Zheng Qin play tennis. The coaches at Zheng Qinwen&#39;s hometown Shiyan Sports Center recognized her talent very much and believed that the power bursting out of her body was much higher than that of her peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2014, Zheng Qinwen participated in the 12-year-old category of the National Youth Tennis Ranking Tournament and won the singles and doubles championships in one fell swoop. In the same year, the Shiyan Tennis Team she led participated in the 14th Hubei Provincial Games and won 2 gold medals. Her serving speed reached 169 kilometers per hour, which was outstanding in the country and the world at that time. Therefore, she was hailed as a &quot;genius girl&quot; by many domestic sports commentators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Qinwen successfully entered the Beijing Wheel of Ingenuity Tennis School and received the guidance of Li Na’s mentor Carlos. Zheng Qinwen gradually grew from a talented player to a mature player with no shortcomings and comprehensive skills. In 2015, Zheng Qinwen won the championship in the 14-year-old group (12 to 14 years old) of the European Youth Tennis Tour. She has participated in many national and world tennis events and achieved outstanding results. When she was 16 years old, she participated in the French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open youth competitions, reaching the top 16 in each of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, my father contacted Spanish male tennis player Pere Riba, who had just retired as a coach, and the two parties decided to cooperate. Zheng Qinwen started training in Spain under the care of his mother. From Monday to Saturday, he had 2 hours of tennis training in the morning, 1 hour of physical training, and 2 hours of tennis training in the afternoon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2020, tennis competitions that were temporarily suspended due to the new crown epidemic resumed, and Zheng Qinwen began to participate frequently. In an interview with the media, Zheng Qinwen recalled that in order to more conveniently compete in Europe, the team would drive around Europe, driving from Barcelona to Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic. The furthest trip took 22 hours on the road. She didn&#39;t want to be eliminated in the first round and have to take a 22-hour drive home, so she worked very hard after playing. In order to maintain the best competitive condition, she hardly used the Internet during the competition, and even turned off her mobile phone when she arrived at the competition venue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2022, 19-year-old Zheng Qinwen participated in the French Open for the first time. She defeated Zanievska, Halep, and Koné successively, reaching the top 16 of the tournament, refreshing China The youngest age for a female tennis player to reach the top 16 in a Grand Slam tournament. In the fourth round, she faced Swiatek, ranked No. 1 in the world and the last French Open champion. The first set took more than 80 minutes. Zheng Qinwen broke Swiatek&#39;s 37-day record of no opponent winning a single set. He won the &quot;tiebreak&quot; 7-5 and won the first set with difficulty. In the second set, Zheng Qinwen suffered from a right thigh injury that affected his performance. In the end, he lost 1:2 and missed the top 8. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zheng Qinwen unfortunately stopped in the top 16 of the French Open, but the comprehensive skills and playing temperament she displayed made fans all over the world remember &#39;Chinese Zheng&#39;. The potential shown by Zheng Qinwen makes us believe that this season She will also bring more surprises!&quot; People&#39;s Daily reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, when Zheng Qinwen first entered the professional arena, he was ranked 630th in the world. In the following more than two years, Zheng Qinwen won 8 ITF championships. He made history in his first Grand Slam tournament, reaching the second round of the Australian Open, the top 16 of the French Open, the top 32 of Wimbledon, and the top 32 of the US Open. WTA named him the &quot;Best Rookie of the 2022 Season&quot;. Because of her extremely fast rise in rankings, Zheng Qinwen was called the &quot;Rocket Girl&quot;. At the beginning of 2022, she promised to enter the top 30 in the world rankings, and at the end of the season, her ranking rose to 27th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/qFP5ZUAxB24XmnPICsOAUT3BD2qtDUSWZNNcpqVd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/qFP5ZUAxB24XmnPICsOAUT3BD2qtDUSWZNNcpqVd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252802&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 23, 2023, in the women&#39;s singles final of the Women&#39;s Tennis Players Association (WTA) 250 Palermo Station, Zheng Qinwen defeated Italian player Paolini 2-1 and won The first tour championship in her career &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Women&#39;s Tennis Players Association (WTA) official social account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Queen Wen&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the new season starts in 2023, Zheng Qinwen vows to enter the top ten in the world rankings. In the first half of the year, she went through a difficult downturn. In the 2023 Australian Open and French Open, Zheng Qinwen failed in the second round one after another. Before the start of Wimbledon, Zheng Qinwen changed coaches, replacing Spanish coach Riba with famous Belgian coach Wim Fiset, who has coached Naomi Osaka, Azarenka and other famous players. However, the grass court season was still hard for her to win, and Wimbledon ended with a first-round trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;Although I didn&#39;t play well in the grass-court season, I don&#39;t think my (strength) will decline. I will still work hard and prepare for the next stop. Change. The team must have had an impact, but I don’t think the loss was due to the coach.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before participating in the US Open, Zheng Qinwen went to Italy to participate in the WTA250 Palermo Station. She went all the way and won her first WTA tour-level championship in her career, and began to get out of the slump. &quot;This championship is hard-won. After experiencing failures, tears, regrets and disappointments, I finally tasted the taste of victory. I believe this is just the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a series of games before the US Open, Zheng Qinwen defeated Venus Williams and other famous players. After the start of the US Open, she quickly entered the state. Compared with before, she appeared calmer and more patient, with more swings and more frequent changes in long and short balls. She successfully broke into the top 16 of the US Open and expressed emotion in the interview: &quot;At the beginning of the year, I thought that reaching the second week of a Grand Slam was a basic operation, but I didn&#39;t expect that I would not have such a result until the last Grand Slam of the year. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, she defeated the 2022 tournament runner-up and No. 5 seed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, creating the best Grand Slam record in her career and becoming the sixth woman in the Open era to enter the Grand Slam singles. /China Tennis Association players in the 4 finals.

A relatively smooth growth process shaped her confident attitude and unruly temperament. During interviews, she often makes some sharp remarks. On August 12, 2022, in the third round of women&#39;s singles at the WTA1000 Toronto Station, Zheng Qinwen defeated Andreescu 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 and entered the quarterfinals of the WTA1000 competition for the first time. When asked if he would celebrate after reaching the top 8, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;I will only celebrate after winning. I will be sad if I don&#39;t win.&quot; After the game, he talked about the match with former US Open champion Andreescu. , Zheng Qinwen responded domineeringly: &quot;I am stronger than her.&quot; When asked if he would work hard to win the US Open seed, Zheng Qinwen said: &quot;It really doesn&#39;t matter. My philosophy has always been that no matter who my opponent is, I Just do your best and strive to win.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her speech became an indicator of the player&#39;s personality, and she was called &quot;Queen Wen&quot; by fans. At the US Open, fans called her &quot;Queen Wen&quot; from the sidelines. Zheng Qinwen enjoys this title very much, &quot;Of course I know, I like the name Queen Wen very much. After all, this is the Queen!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than half of the 2023 season has passed, and Zheng Qinwen is far from the top 10 in the world. There is still some distance. In an interview, she was asked why she always sets her goals very high, and why she always likes to speak out and take the initiative to withstand scrutiny from the outside world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/hQ7JJXROxkfoyIlo0v8iU3ExH2k7g3YygxTB8n8T.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/hQ7JJXROxkfoyIlo0v8iU3ExH2k7g3YygxTB8n8T.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252804&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 4, 2023, in the fourth round of the women&#39;s singles match at the 2023 US Open, Chinese player Zheng Qinwen defeated Tunisian player Jabeul 2-0 and advanced to the eighth round.

&lt;p>;2023年9月26日，菜鸟向港交所递交IPO申请文件，这是阿里巴巴启动“1+6+n”组织变革后首个分拆上市的业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书披露，菜鸟在2021年、2022年及2023年财政年度以及2023年3月30日－6月30日的三个月（下文简称最近的一季度），分别实现营收527.33亿元，668.67亿元、778亿元和231.64亿元，净利润分别是-16.88亿元、-20.04亿元、-23.25亿元和3.91亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，其上市前的三个完整财年累计亏损超60亿元，最近的一季度才扭亏为盈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟目前业务主要包括国际物流、国内物流、科技及其他服务三大板块。 2021年至2023财年（截至3月30日）及最近的一季度，其国际物流收入占比分别是55.1%、52.3%、47.4%、48.1%，都高于国内物流收入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年，阿里巴巴集团、银泰集团联合复星集团、富春集团等一众浙江资本圈大佬，加上国内快递物流企业顺丰、“三通一达”共同成立菜鸟。彼时，银泰集团创始人沈国军为菜鸟网络CEO。不过，仅过了一年，沈就卸任CEO，任副董事长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现任CEO万霖在2014年加入菜鸟，此前，他曾担任亚马逊全球物流部门的高级管理人员。 2017年，万霖正式执掌菜鸟，并让菜鸟成为阿里巴巴增长最快的业务板块之一。得益于此，万霖出现在阿里巴巴2023年最新披露的合伙人名单上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;押宝国际市场&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;也是在2017年，菜鸟的海外物流野心初显。这一年，菜鸟在吉隆坡推出首个e-Hub计划（综合电商物流枢纽），这成为通往东南亚电商市场的门户。主要针对速卖通跨境商家提供快递服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至2023年6月30日，菜鸟已在全球建立两个面积超1.5万平方米的物流枢纽，分别位于马来西亚吉隆坡和比利时列日，预计将在香港建设第三个物流枢纽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟在跨境物流服务上的表现离不开阿里巴巴旗下跨境电商全球速卖通。全球速卖通（AliExpress）成立于2010年，被称为国际版“淘宝”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位女装行业的跨境电商从业者告诉南方周末记者，市面上可选择的平台有亚马逊、速卖通、虾皮（Shopee）、敦煌、E-bay，由于成本低，早期跨境电商创业者倾向于选择速卖通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚马逊由于海外仓数量多，运输速度最快，欧美主要国家一星期左右能到货，偏远一点则需要半个月到一个月。 “快件到达当地后仍选择与当地邮局合作，派送时间由当地邮局决定。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟以第三方服务的方式向速卖通商家提供快递服务，“比如递四方就是菜鸟旗下的快递企业。”她说。天眼查显示，菜鸟网络对深圳递四方信息科技有限公司持股45%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书介绍，2022年，菜鸟国际物流服务收入较上年提升20%，最近的一季度比上年同期增长41%，主要原因都是速卖通的跨境快递服务显著增长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了服务阿里巴巴生态体系内的电商平台外，菜鸟还在香港及一些海外市场如西班牙、法国、波兰等国建立了本地物流服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书引用的灼识咨询数据提到，跨境电商物流2018年至2022年复合年增长率超中国本地，尤其是中国跨境电商远超其他地区跨境电商。欧洲及美国预计成为来自中国跨境电商商品的主要终点。此外，东南亚和拉丁美洲亦有望高速增长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据灼识咨询，2022年，菜鸟成为按包裹量计全球最大的跨境电商物流公司。前五名中，有两家中国公司，分别是菜鸟和EMS（中国邮政速递物流），剩余三家公司分别来自德国、法国和美国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在国际市场上，菜鸟也将直面顺丰、极兔的挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月15日刚刚在港交所上市的极兔也将目光投向全球市场。极兔是一家诞生于印度尼西亚的物流公司，截至2022年，其快递服务覆盖13个国家，东南亚市场份额最高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月，顺丰公告将赴港二次上市，释出消息前，顺丰大手笔收购包括嘉里物流旗下亚太区和欧洲从事快递服务的10家附属公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据此前媒体报道，2019年至今，顺丰海外布局步履不停，先后投资美国货运物流服务商Flexport、德国DHL公司旗下敦豪香港和敦豪北京两家公司100%股权、缅甸物流公司KOSPA Limited，还与印尼Triputra集团成立合资公司等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;建全球最大物流网络&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;菜鸟招股书介绍，最近的一季度的毛利率较2022年同期有所提升，由10.6%升至13.7%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其营业成本主要包括履约成本（运输路线、配送、仓储处理及其他采购及管理的服务，即第三方服务）及劳务成本。劳务成本包括员工福利开支以及外包劳务服务，基本占比在20%左右。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟在招股书中用“一杯咖啡价格送全球”来评价自身在跨境物流上提供的解决方案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一名跨境电商从业者对南方周末记者表示，寄送一件T恤的价格在二三十元，与中国邮政相差无几，但相较国外的物流企业而言成本较低。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了价格便宜外，菜鸟为速卖通商家提供的物流方案也在送达时间上由一两个月缩短至十天，部分国际快线产品只需五天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在菜鸟递交IPO报告的同天，速卖通联合菜鸟上线“全球五日达”国际快线产品，首批落地英国、西班牙、荷兰、比利时和韩国。也就是说，这五个国家的消费者只要下单带有“五日达”标识的商品，只用五天就能收到来自中国的包裹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述从业者表示，五日达商品需要商家在客户下单48小时内提供包裹上网信息。上网率达标就能申请加入五日达，平台也会自动让商家加入。商家完成上网率也不难，通常一个链接做起来后都会囤一点货，买家一下单就能发出去，菜鸟每天都会上门收件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何做到降低成本又提高运输速度？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其招股书中引用灼识咨询资料，菜鸟在全球范围内建立了最大的物流网络，包括两个超1.5万平方米的物流枢纽中心、1100多个仓库和380多个分拣中心。 2023年6月，平均每周包机、包板约170班，超过2700条运输线路含4400多个网点及超过1.7万个驿站。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科技也在发挥作用。如，人工智能AI的算法可以提升分拣准确性、改善库存管理、优化线路规划和车辆调度等。智能硬件上，有RFID、智能物联网设备、自动化及自动驾驶技术，包括AVG（自动化仓储技术）和电动无人配送车“小蛮驴”等。同时还提供数字化的供应链，便于监测、发现问题，提高效率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月，阿里达摩院自动驾驶业务并入菜鸟集团，部分人员转入菜鸟，也就是说“大蛮驴”（自动驾驶卡车）和“小蛮驴”都归菜鸟。招股书介绍，截至2023年3月30日，已有800多辆小蛮驴投入使用，配送超过一千万件包裹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/NzgzSpXJJwKMnxPPEpFsrvXwbWv21GI7T4uovkjt.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;菜鸟在招股书中详细披露了与阿里巴巴之间千丝万缕的联系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿里巴巴是菜鸟最大的客户。 2021至2023财年及最近的一季度，来自阿里巴巴的收入占总收入分别为29.2%、30.8%、28.2%、29.7%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟为阿里巴巴生态下天猫、淘宝、速卖通等多个电商平台提供物流服务。 2021年后，菜鸟还服务于阿里巴巴体系外的知名国际电商平台和线上渠道（如快手等）商家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招股书中也提示，因菜鸟与阿里巴巴建立战略协同关系，菜鸟维持与阿里巴巴生态体系的情况，或阿里巴巴生态体系自身发展情况，均将会对菜鸟产生影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟与阿里巴巴集团已有的资源合作以签署业务合作框架的形式固定下来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;包括阿里巴巴及菜鸟在各自业务运营中使用的若干软件及技术相关的若干知识产权。阿里巴巴集团相关方向菜鸟提供若干后台、行政支持及共享服务，阿里云向菜鸟提供基础云计算服务，百世物流为菜鸟提供货运服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟则向阿里巴巴相关方提供硬件及技术支持服务、仓储及管理服务、综合供应链解决方案及物流服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在管理层方面，菜鸟仍能保持一定独立性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;菜鸟的八名董事会成员中，蔡崇信、戴珊和蒋凡分别是阿里巴巴董事会主席、淘天集团首席执行官兼董事会成员以及阿里国际数字商业集团首席执行官兼董事会成员。这三人均是菜鸟集团的非执行董事，不参与日常业务管理及运营，仅提供专业意见及判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;万霖作为菜鸟集团首席执行官同时也是阿里巴巴集团高级管理层成员，但不在阿里巴巴集团担任其他管理职位。菜鸟董事会其余四人也不在阿里巴巴集团担任任何职务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[星际迷航般的传奇：“冥王号”采得小行星“贝努”样品归来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257904]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;美东时间2023年9月24日10时53分，“冥王”号探测器的样本返回舱，装载着从小行星“贝努”表面采集的样本，成功降落在犹他州盐湖城附近的沙漠里。NASA对这项异常复杂、科技含量很高的深空探测工程比较低调，未做大张旗鼓的宣传。但其任务却起源于近1/4世纪之前，整个项目像科幻片《星际迷航》般诡谲、烧脑、奇幻、浪漫。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1999年，NASA资助的“林肯近地小行星研究小组”发现了小行星Bennu（贝努，古埃及神话中的太阳神）。其赤道直径约500米，运行轨道位于金星和火星之间，与地球轨道有交叉，近地点约750万公里。这很快引起了美国“行星防御协调办公室”的注意，将其归类为“潜在危险天体”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过持续观测和研究，科学家认为：“贝努”由碳和其它矿物质构成，在太阳系诞生之初就已存在，很可能含有地球生命最初形成时所存在的原始分子物质，实属珍贵的太阳系“第一手素材”。更重要的是，经反复精密计算，在2175-2199年之间，“贝努”有1/2700概率撞击地球，属于高风险太空目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，NASA制定了对这颗高危险、高价值小行星的探测任务，全称为“（太阳系）起源、光谱解析、资源识别、安全、风化层勘探（Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer）”，意为：。这个冗长的专业名称，被缩写为“OSIRIS-Rex”，借用古埃及神话中的冥界之神“奥西里斯”，中文简称“冥王”号。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年9月8日，运载“冥王”号探测器的火箭升空。2018年12月31日，探测器进入距其仅1.6-2.1公里的环“贝努”轨道，这是人类探测器首次成功环绕体积、质量、引力都如此小的小天体长期飞行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此后1年多时间里，“冥王”号多次精细变轨，在多种不同高度对小行星进行了非常详细的探测，对重点考察区域，探测器飞掠高度甚至降低到距离小行星表面仅250米，这需要极高的飞控科技。探测器的PolyCam相机，用2155张照片拼出了它的超高清全球影像，分辨率高达5厘米/像素，是人类迄今为止获取的最高清的地外天体全球影像图，因此，“贝努”成为迄今为止人类在太阳系中最了解的小行星之一。在2018年底，探测器在其表面发现了水的痕迹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管环绕勘测非常详尽、精细，但登陆小行星表面取样却更加困难。NASA的科学家们发现：原先预计的直径约50米平坦着陆区，真实情况是乱石嶙峋，有可能进行着陆的区域直径最多仅约6米，超预期的难度会损坏“冥王”号着陆器。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科学家们紧急应变：变更了原方案，开发出基于光学影像的备用导航定位方案——自然特征跟踪技术，以“蜻蜓点水”的轻柔姿态一触即离。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年10月20日，“冥王”号探测器降落在“夜莺”采样区。直径0.3米的采样头与星体表面接触了约6秒钟，将小行星表面的碎石和尘埃颗粒收入囊中，然后点火离开。修改后的应变方案异乎寻常地成功：探测器采集了约250克样本，远超过原本计划中的60克样本任务要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年10月28日，“冥王”号将采集到的样品封装入返回舱。2021年5月10日，探测器带着珍贵的小行星采样，启程返航地球轨道，并于2023年9月24日，准确成功将返回舱降落到犹他州沙漠实验基地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA公布的计划：在接下来的两年时间里，样本25%将被送到多国约200名科学家手中进行研究。其余75%样本将被封存数十年，等待未来科技进步，更先进的新技术和装备出现后，再分批取出样本开展研究。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奇妙的是，“冥王”号探测任务并未结束，它把样品返回舱抛射回地球后，将借助地球的“引力弹弓效应”，飞往另一颗小行星Apophis（阿波菲斯，埃及神话中的破坏和混沌之神）。此后，“冥王”号任务代号将更名为“阿波菲斯探险者”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“阿波菲斯”是比“贝努”更小但更危险的小行星，其直径约370米。在2029年将从距地球约3.2万公里处高速掠过，这比距地面3.6万公里的地球静止轨道卫星还近，有2.7%的概率撞上地球。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直径大于140米的小行星，被称为“灭国者”，如果撞上中等国家，直接毁灭之；即便是领土面积最大的几个大国，若被砸中也会就此衰落。而直径10公里以上的小行星，是“行星毁灭者”，能把地球撞碎。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“冥王/阿波菲斯探险者”任务团队的科学家们，将在小行星于2029年4月13日飞掠地球时，操控探测器进入其环绕轨道，进行为期18个月的“阿波菲斯”近距离探索，对其进行全面考察，以便研究近地小行星的运动特性。最后，探测器将开启推进系统，搅动小行星表面，以研究其地表之下的物质和结构。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，“OSIRIS-Rex”项目的科学家团队，并不太在意2.7%小行星撞击率，行星防御并非其项目内的研究任务。下一步，要看NASA是否会利用2029年“阿波菲斯”送到家门口的机会，再次尝试“行星防御”项目实验，利用火箭推力，改变小行星轨道，将其推得距离地球远一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“冥王/阿波菲斯探险者”任务，其复杂与奇幻程度，已经有些类似《星际迷航》般的探索之旅：对未来的展望、对未知领域的好奇、对科学探索持之以恒、对梦想的执着、天马行空般的想象力、技术层面的精益求精……共同交织成还远没有结束的传奇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

data-key=&quot;252367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月13日，浙江湖州，邱佳红再次来到陈美凤住处。 （南方周末记者郑丹/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;胎龄8个多月，早产，头发黑黑的，是个男婴。关于未谋面的孩子，这是37岁的邱佳红知道的全部。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2022年9月16日23时35分，刚经历剖腹引产的邱佳红从全身麻醉中醒来，孩子的父亲郑小兵告诉她，取出来的婴儿是死的，被医生抱走了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在邱佳红的讲述中，自己原本健康的胎儿临产时被医院告知“孩子缺氧，脑神经不正常，要打掉的”。半年后，她突然意识到不对劲。在剖腹引产手术的头天下午，她接到过一个显示为浙江湖州号码的电话，连续打来两次，电话那头的老太太问她，孩子送人吗？ “莫名其妙，我说怎么可能送人，就挂了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随着诸多疑点一点点浮现，邱佳红怀疑自己是中了人贩子的圈套。成为“猎物”并不是没有缘故，那是一个让她难以启齿的原因——自己未婚生育的孩子，是郑小兵的私生子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红相信孩子还活着。她决定顺着那串陌生号码寻子，没曾想，阴差阳错掀开一起地下代孕、贩卖儿童大案。截至2023年9月13日，侦办该案的警方查明涉及多名被买卖儿童。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;雇私家侦探寻子&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;雨下了一早上，灰蒙蒙的粮油批发市场里人少，安静，成排的卷帘门大多被拉下来，偶尔几个外卖员来去穿梭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;身材瘦小的邱佳红领着南方周末记者，在市场里三拐两拐，熟练地钻进靠边的一幢居民楼，顺着贴满牛皮癣小广告的楼道到203室门前。这家住户就是当初给她打电话的老太太，如今已经置身于拘留所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老太太名叫陈美凤，58岁，福建莆田人。那张脸邱佳红记得清楚，文两道弯眉，耷拉着深眼袋，圆脸盘，高颧骨，挨肩炸开的一头灰发用发箍卡紧。她体型偏胖，冬日里时常裹一件黑色貂皮大衣，蹬一双黑筒靴，脚底有劲儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;半年前，2023年2月，邱佳红雇佣两名私家侦探，三人驱车从上海前往浙江湖州找到陈美凤的住处，试图在这里找到当初从医院消失的儿子。她回忆，挨着冻在楼下蹲点一周，也没有见到陈美凤抱着五六月大的男婴出没过一次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与陈美凤的正面对峙，发生在他们蹲点的第8天。 2月23日，邱佳红一早在203室门口堵住了散步回来的陈美凤：“陈阿姨，你认得我吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不认得”，陈美凤的普通话里夹杂着浓重的莆田口音，她客气地将来者请进屋里坐，老头子在给小孙女烧饭，屋里有些杂乱。邱佳红目光扫了一圈屋子，没有男婴。她又问一句，“那我的号码你从哪里来的？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈美凤才明白邱佳红的来意，“没打过”，她说，一会儿又咕哝，“不记得了”。在邱佳红的执意要求下，陈美凤被陪同前往附近一处移动营业厅调取半年内的通讯记录，邱佳红的电话号码果然出现在其中，通话时间为2022年9月15日16时29分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ed9bdd81dc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ed9bdd81dc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252368&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年2月一天清晨， 陈美凤抱孙女回屋。 （受访者供图/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当时的邱佳红并没有注意，在陈美凤给她打电话前后，还和同一人打过3通电话，后来发现是浙江美福宝妇儿医院（以下简称美福宝医院）院长陈勇进的号码。 2022年9月16日，邱佳红就在杭州的美福宝医院生产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来邱佳红从警方得知，这二人是莆田老乡。陈勇进就此事的回应是，“有可能是我告诉陈美凤（邱佳红联系方式）的，我不确定。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红想起，剖腹产手术后第三天，开刀医生于艳芬走进她的病房拉家常，“我当时痛得有点迷迷糊糊，她跟我聊了有两小时，问我家里兄弟姐妹都是做什么的，先生是做什么的，怎么认识的，聊得跟自己人一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“一系列回想以后觉得不对，她到我病房肯定是来打探消息的。”邱佳红认定，孩子活着，但被陈美凤跟美福宝医院卖了；男友郑小兵也有把孩子“送出去”的嫌疑，两人因此闹僵，分道扬镳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;面对邱佳红和私家侦探逼问孩子下落，陈美凤带着哭腔，“我真的不记得（打电话给邱佳红），我没做过（拐卖邱佳红之子）。”在一段2月23日的现场视频中，陈美凤主动提出，“要不我们去派出所吧。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当晚，邱佳红报案，陈美凤被抓。次日，浙江省湖州市公安局湖州南太湖新区分局就下了立案决定书：根据《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法》第一百零九条之规定，决定对南太湖新区拐卖妇女、儿童案立案侦查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;半年后，侦办该案的警方告诉邱佳红，陈美凤主要通过卖婴儿和代孕生意获利。就卖儿童一事，经调查已经发现多名被卖的孩童，案件受到公安部重视。而代孕生意虽然违法，但并不属于犯罪行为，故不在本次警方调查范围内。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;门背后的东南亚代孕姑娘&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;捅破陈美凤的代孕窝点，纯属意外。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红一行人在粮油批发市场蹲点那段日子，摸清楚的信息其实不多：大概是陈美凤夫妇、儿子儿媳，以及两个孙女一家六口住在这里，他们很少出门，不喜与邻舍打招呼。偶尔婆媳俩会轮流开一辆黑色宝马出门，去得最勤快的地方，是附近的湖州玛丽亚妇产医院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红发现，每天傍晚，陈美凤会抱着自家小孙女绕到后排，消失在另一幢居民楼里的407室，早晨六七点钟，又回到203室。白天，陈美凤的儿媳会拎着饭盒，骑一辆电动车两度往返于前后排房屋。婆媳俩离开407室时，都会将钥匙插进门孔，拧上几圈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;起初几天，邱佳红还听到过203室里传来婴儿的啼哭声，陈美凤在里面哼着调子哄孩子。挂在门口的小奶箱每早会收到一盒婴儿食用的鲜羊奶。几天后，啼哭声彻底消失了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;邱佳红猜测那哭声就是自己儿子的，很可能因为闹腾，孩子被陈美凤安顿在后排的407室。 “有一次晚上，我跟上去偷偷听，里面有好多人的声音，我觉得不对。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如果不是亲眼看到，她怎么都不会相信，在407室那扇门背后，其实是3个来自东南亚国家的代孕姑娘，个个20岁左右的年纪，其中两个挺着大肚子。邱佳红看到时，她们正躺在床上，刷着没有安装电话卡的智能手机。屋内摆设杂乱，打开冰箱，是满满当当的保胎药和补血药，垃圾桶里丢有废弃的医用材料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在一则邱佳红与同行私家侦探于2月23日进屋后录制的视频中，一个自称丽丽的女子起初沉默不语，后用不熟练的中文表达，自己来自越南，已经怀孕6个月，旁边床上的姑娘怀胎3月。俩人中间的床头桌上，放了一盒预防和治疗缺铁性贫血的胶囊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当被问及生一个孩子能赚多少钱，丽丽回答，“不知道，我还没生过，生好才知道给钱多少。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她称通过姐姐介绍找到陈美凤，“我姐在这儿生过，生好她已经回去了。她生的是女孩，说有2万多（人民币）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;407室内阁楼上住的另一位女子，则称是通过短视频软件上的网友介绍来的。在一段视频中，这位女子称自己刚来不久，还没有怀孕。 “有人给我介绍来这里，让陈阿姨帮我找工作，我就过来了。”当初介绍她过来的人联系方式已经遗失，因为“手机没卡，电话都删掉了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后经湖州警方查明，代孕女子中，有两名来自柬埔寨。 “两个姑娘都是有签证过来的，在这边都嫁人了。代孕的都是父母双方（买家）提供精子卵子，只是借个母体。”9月13日，南方周末记者陪同邱佳红前往湖州康山派出所询问案情时，一名派出所民警说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

data-key=&quot;252369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;浙江湖州，曾有东南亚代孕女子居住的407室。 （南方周末记者郑丹/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“像泰国等一些东南亚国家的代孕会比国内便宜一些，国内孕妈的价格已经被炒得很高了。”一家地下代孕机构的负责人老程（化名）告诉南方周末记者，国内孕妈一般来自比较穷苦的地方，“我们找的是25岁到32岁之间，生过一胎的为主”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按照流程，老程每次接到孕妈后，会安排她们先做全套体检。 “合格的在我们这边住下来，等她们一来例假，早期就让她们吃助孕药，建立人工周期，监测子宫内膜，找到合适的机会安排移植胚胎。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在一条完整的代孕产业链里，包括买家、孕妈、代孕机构用于做试管的私人实验室，以及可以开具虚假出生证明的妇产医院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;原卫生部2003年修订的《人类辅助生殖技术规范》明确规定，禁止以任何形式买卖配子、合子、胚胎，医疗机构和医务人员不得实施任何形式的代孕技术。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;然而，这一规章仅仅是对医疗机构、医务人员产生约束力，并不能制止医疗机构之外的组织和个人实施代孕。民法典未对代孕进行明文规制，代孕成为一门常年游走在灰色地带的地下生意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“说白了，我们做这个事情，你（买家）我（卖家）都没有风险，因为是在法律的空白地带。所有风险集中在医生和医疗机构，一是前面医生做试管的环节，要把精卵移植到孕妈这边，风险很高；二是后面的生产环节，医院需要把孩子出生证明写成你们夫妻双方（买家）名字，也是有风险的。”老程说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;针对在上海想找代孕的客户，老程开价68万元包成功，客户另加8万元可以指定孩子性别。 “公立医院监控比较严格，不太好操作试管，基本上都是在外面的智能实验室。如果你要求必须在公立三甲医院做试管，我们也可以安排，再加8万。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按陈美凤丈夫武玉嶂的说法，曾经，陈美凤也想在莆田开一家用于代孕的门店。 2020年11月，她在老家注册了莆田市添丁健康管理有限公司。 “莆田这边没有（代孕），看开一家怎么样。注册好了，结果做不成，就没开了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者走访发现，这是一处设在住宅区的小微企业，没有招牌，也没有门面。由于两次未依规公示年度报告，该公司已经被列入经营异常名单。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;打“擦边球”的接生医院&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月10日，南方周末记者以找代孕为由，在莆田见到了目前在取保候审期间的武玉嶂。 60岁的他跟儿子两人生活在老家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们早就没有做（代孕）了，才做一年，就没做了。”当得知来者要找陈美凤时，武玉嶂提高了警惕，“我这几年都在家里没出去，她在上海那边工作，在哪里搞不清楚。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他面前的客厅空荡荡的，摆在地上的玩具小马驹上挂着一个湖州玛丽亚妇产医院的手提袋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在武玉嶂的讲述中，十来年前，陈美凤跟他在家做鞋模，“我们自己办一个厂，招了三十多个工人，钱都是她管的。”等到儿子出去读书以后，陈美凤提出要到外面挣钱，说是莆田一个朋友介绍她跑医院的业务。那是个到处拉病人去医院看病的活儿，有时也会将一家医院的病人介绍到另一家医院，从中赚取小额介绍费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;湖州玛丽亚妇产医院是陈美凤较为固定的上班地点，该医院的工作人员也向南方周末记者证实，“陈美凤以前经常带人过来看病，这半年没见来了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“她会看病，去医院培训了几年，里面的医生给她培训，特别女孩子什么病要吃什么药，要花多少钱，她都懂。”武玉嶂说，陈美凤念过高中，懂的多，还办了护照。 “她专门和妇产科医院打交道，跟浙江、上海那边很多医院都熟悉，三甲医院也熟。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这份工作的另一面，是在医院物色合适的婴儿进行贩卖。据警方知情人士透露，在贩婴链条上，陈美凤属“买卖介绍”的角色，她常年在数家医院跑来跑去，涉案医生私下为其提供一些引产或打算产后弃婴的父母相关信息，她则去劝说、哄骗这些父母生下孩子，交与她处置。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“陈美凤被抓了，也牵连到我这里，我当场就被公安抓去调查。警方以为我在勾结陈美凤贩卖婴儿，但实际上我当时只接了代孕的。”9月22日，陈勇进告诉南方周末记者，陈美凤被抓后，美福宝医院里很多医生都一同被警方带走做笔录，当初为邱佳红做剖腹产手术的医生于艳芬已经辞职，“她当时也被处罚了，反正这个事情搞得挺大的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/488eb09656.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/488eb09656.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陈春来是知名上市药企上海美迪西生物医药股份有限公司的10大股东之一。公开资料显示，陈春来也是该上市公司总经理陈春麟的弟弟。和上海美迪西生物的其他几位陈姓核心高管一样，他们都来自“莆田四大家族”之一的陈氏家族。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“出事之前，我们接过很多代孕的，现在都不做了。”陈勇进称，过去，陈美凤时常会带一些孕妇来美福宝医院生产。每接一单代孕生意，就意味着医院要造假一份出生证明，在婴儿父母一栏填上买家的名字。 “她卖的十几个孩子中，大概有四五个在我这里生的，她跟我讲，这些小孩子都是代孕的，生完之后他们私底下去卖。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“代孕和拐卖儿童是两码事，对于我们院方来讲，我敢做（打）擦边球的事情，被发现了顶多罚点钱，但我绝对不敢做完完全全犯法的事情。我们一天营业额30万，一年营业额100亿，这么大医院，不至于冒这个风险。”陈勇进向南方周末记者强调，美福宝医院从未参与过陈美凤贩卖儿童的违法行为，此前也不知情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月15日，杭州市拱墅区卫生健康局因美福宝医院未按规定填写、保管病历资料等，对其罚款14万元。该处罚决定书还提到，2021年1月28日至2022年3月27日，美福宝医院出具了6份虚假出生医学证明，已构成违法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“那就是6个（以代孕为名接生的孩子）嘛，陈美凤带来生的不止6个，还有很多其他的，可能真的是有做试管，可能有其他的，我们又不清楚的。”陈勇进说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;关于美福宝医院是否涉及贩卖儿童，拱墅区卫生健康局与警方均未透露相关信息，上述处罚决定书也未提及。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今，在陈美凤老家莆田市荔城区的村子里，鲜有人知道她的名字。巷子深处行人稀少，青石砖道两边是有些年代的水泥小楼，一些敞开大门的客厅里供奉着妈祖或财神爷，空气中弥漫着香火味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“原来的村子拆了，大家都搬出去了。”一位年迈的村民告诉南方周末记者，“她好多年没回来了，只听说在外面做医药什么的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陈美凤出去之后，武玉嶂称因为批量出售鞋模被客户赊账太多，几十万收不回来，也不干了。他将自家三层小楼和两个仓库都租出去，一年收十几万元的房租。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;再后来，武玉嶂前往浙江湖州，给陈美凤打后勤，每天负责买菜烧饭，收拾屋子。 “我问过她一两次（生意的事），她说你问那么多干嘛，你反正有钱花就可以，还管那么多。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;武玉嶂并不是什么都不知道，“（代孕）女人太难找，我们也是从云南昆明那边找过来的，不容易。他们（陈美凤等）以前也到泰国去做（代孕生意），泰国可能比较贵。”武玉嶂含糊地说，买家可以提前挑选婴儿性别，价格在55万元到60万元；代买家看着代孕姑娘从怀孕到生完孩子，总报价65万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;实际上，这是一个略低于市场行情的价位。南方周末记者询问多家地下代孕机构，起步价均在70万元左右，但这些机构均表示，孕妈全部来自国内，没有国外孕妈的渠道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陈美凤从一单代孕生意中能分多少钱？她是否会通过医院渠道买卖现成的婴儿？武玉嶂均表示“搞不清楚”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;前述警方知情人士称，陈美凤在贩卖儿童的交易中，会根据孩子身体健康情况，定价在一个孩子十几万元到二三十万元不等，她从中拿几千到两三万元提成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;截至9月13日，警方查到经陈美凤之手买卖且有迹可循的多个孩子，卖出前均取得过孩子亲生父母同意。 “她认为干这个事情不是拐卖，而是做好事。因为一边不要小孩子，一边需要小孩子。她把不要的小孩给到需要的，途中牵个线，收个辛苦费。”陈美凤因此将所有交易记录和聊天记录都保留下来，于她而言，这都是“积德”的证明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10年前，由公安部督办的特大拐卖妇女儿童案主犯谭永志在被捕后，也称自己是在做好事。 “我是帮助人，人家要小孩了，我就给牵个线，我没有直接找人卖小孩。”据央视新闻，从2008年到2013年，谭永志组织或参与买卖22名儿童，每个孩子售价在1.5万-5万元不等，谭永志每单赚介绍费1000-6000元不等，总计获利十几万元。最终，河南省高级人民法院对谭永志判处死刑，最高人民法院于2016年核准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;前述知情人士称，与传统意义上的拐卖不同，陈美凤这起拐卖儿童案中带有抱养、领养的性质。在陈美凤的过往交易中，曾有一对父母将自己的孩子卖了17万元，陈从中拿几千元“奶粉钱”。后这对父母嫌17万元少，又去找陈美凤讨钱，不多给就报警。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月26日，南方周末记者致电湖州康山派出所，询问该案进展。警方表示，该案由湖州市公安局湖州南太湖新区分局侦办，其他情况暂不便透露。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;另一个版本&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那些被陈美凤贩卖的孩子，有的患先天性疾病或残疾，有的是因父母非婚生育“不好处理”。但其中并没有邱佳红之子。警方在陈美凤近几年的交易记录和聊天记录中，也没有找到相关线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按照警方透露的陈美凤说法，当初邱佳红在电话里不同意卖，陈就自称打消了念头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“孩子就是死掉了呀，按照她的意愿把孩子打掉了，送火葬场去了。”关于邱佳红之子，陈勇进告诉南方周末记者的是另一个版本：邱佳红最初向客服咨询能否打掉孩子，称孩子“有点问题”；2022年8月22日，她来医院做完检查一度犹豫，大概一个月左右又表示确定要打掉孩子。 “有个男的（郑小兵）陪着过来的，态度也是把孩子打掉。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我们的问题只有一处，法律规定28周以上的胎儿不能做引产，所以我们在病历中把邱佳红的胎龄改小了，其它全部是真实的。”面对南方周末记者追问邱佳红之子下落，陈勇进反问：“如果孩子是活的，我们是要打出生证明的。刑警已经调查过了，十几个孩子买家卖家查得清清楚楚，差她一个孩子吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;拱墅区卫生健康局公开的处罚决定书还提及，2022年9月15日至16日，美福宝医院为实际孕周37周2天的邱佳红实施了米非司酮联合依沙吖啶注射液羊膜腔穿刺引产手术及剖宫取胎术。对此，邱佳红说，“米非司酮片我只吃了两粒，根本不会起效，也没有打引产针（依沙吖啶注射液）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;被邱佳红多次催问案情后，警方告诉邱佳红，陈美凤案的调查如今已接近尾声，但在已有证据中，没有任何关于她的婴儿是活胎的线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“郑小兵、陈美凤以及给陈美凤打下手的小马仔，我们都问过了，没有孩子的线索。”2023年9月13日，当提及孩子父亲郑小兵时，派出所民警称：“最清楚（孩子情况）的，是那个人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此后，南方周末记者致电郑小兵询问是否知道孩子下落，对方称“我不知道这回事情”，挂掉了电话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月16日是孩子满一周岁的日子，邱佳红独自开车去上海郊区的村庄找人算命。算命的看过几根香火生烟的走势后，告诉她孩子还在，邱佳红感觉心安了一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[藏在温州的中国皮鞋大王，卖不动国产平价男鞋了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257655]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“浙江温州，浙江温州，江南皮革厂，倒闭了”，曾经大街小巷流传的一句广告词，道尽了如今温州皮鞋的心酸。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;温州皮鞋，曾是上世纪国产男士皮鞋品质的象征，由这座小城孕育的上市公司——奥康，一度成为中国男士皮鞋的龙头企业，上市11年，35岁的它近日却遇上了“中年危机”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8月30日晚间，浙江奥康鞋业股份有限公司（简称：ST奥康，603001.SH）发布了2023半年报，上半年ST奥康营收为164445.23万元，同比增长12.22%，归母净利润为899.76万元，同比增长177.59%。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，在全面飘红的财报背后，是持续多年的营业额大跌与2022年负增长的“元气大伤”。2018年奥康总营收30.43亿，2022年总营收仅有27.54亿，净利润率甚至为负值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了稳住市场份额，今年上半年，奥康推出运动皮鞋，邀请顶流明星代言和邀请迪奥设计师完善设计，但将传统皮鞋与运动鞋结合起来的运动皮鞋，却难以使奥康“逆天改命”。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;淘宝数据显示，奥康运动皮鞋的价格定位偏高，付款人数较少，热销第一的明星同款运动皮鞋有百余人付款，其余商品付款人数仅有几十人。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不止是奥康，国产男士皮鞋市场面临着集体性寒冬。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年开始，中国皮鞋产量下滑，整体发展疲软，男士皮鞋品牌的市场占有率不断减小，业务规模前十名的公司所占的市场份额从2011年的10.1%减少至2020年的6.9%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，运动休闲鞋的市场不断扩大，从2018年的2691亿扩大至2022年的4251亿，几乎翻了一番。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了运动休闲鞋的冲击，国产男士皮鞋还缺乏与国际大牌相争的竞争力。2020年热销男士皮鞋品牌排名前十中，仅有两个是中国内地的品牌，而其他品牌则来自中国香港、美国、意大利等国家或地区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国内品牌售价多为500元以下，奥康、红蜻蜓等国民大牌价格多在三四百元，分不到下沉经济的蛋糕，也很难吸引到高端市场。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;

An unusual sense of closeness. Astronomers believe that the moon and the earth had a super close contact in the beginning of time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was an ancient dwarf planet in the early solar system, located at the Lagrange point of the earth-solar system, which was almost the same as As big as Mars. According to the giant collision hypothesis, about 4.533 billion years ago, the dwarf planet was perturbed by the gravity of Jupiter or Venus and deviated from its original position and collided with the early Earth. The debris produced by the collision eventually formed the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ancient dwarf planet is often nicknamed &quot;Theia&quot; by Western astronomers. This is the name of a Titan goddess in Greek mythology who was the mother of Selene, the moon goddess. If we compare it to Chinese mythology, we may call this dwarf planet &quot;Chang Xi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the birth of the moon in Chinese mythology, many people will think of &quot;Pangu opened the sky and used his eye as the moon.&quot; However, this setting actually appeared quite late. It was first seen in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties: &quot;In the past, when Pangu died, his head was the four mountains, his eyes were the sun and the moon, his fat was the rivers and seas, and his hair was the vegetation.&quot; In older myths, , Chang Xi is the goddess who gave birth to the moon. She combined with the god Di Jun and gave birth to twelve moons. The earth&#39;s revolution period around the sun is exactly twelve times the moon&#39;s revolution period around the earth. Therefore, most peoples in the world divide the year into twelve months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the coincidence of the revolution period, the changes of lunar eclipses and lunar phases provide more inspiration for earth mythology: the legend of &quot;Tengu Eclipses the Moon&quot; has long been familiar to the Chinese people; coincidentally, in In Nordic mythology, there is a similar story of &quot;Sirius swallowing the moon&quot;: The wolves hated the light created by God, so a wolf named Skull chased the sun. When a solar eclipse occurred, Skull swallowed it. sun. Another wolf named Hati was responsible for chasing the moon, and when he caught up, a lunar eclipse occurred. At this time, people on the ground will beat gongs and drums to scare away the wolf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Australian Aboriginal mythology, the moon god is often described as a beautiful man who gradually becomes fat due to laziness (full moon). At this time, his wife, the Sun Goddess, would chop him with an ax. Although the Moon God will hide in a big tree, he will eventually die and will be resurrected 3 days after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, the moon god Chandra in Indian mythology is also a suave and beautiful man. Legend has it that he had twenty-seven wives and promised to love each of them equally. However, after marriage, Luna broke her promise and only loved one of her wives, and refused to listen to her repeated advice. This resulted in complaints from the other twenty-six wives. The life of the Moon God disappeared due to the curse. When he was about to disappear, the Moon God sadly prayed to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva restored the life energy of the Moon God through blessing; however, since the power of the curse cannot be taken back, the Moon God must go through the process of gain, fullness, food and loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from a global perspective, handsome men on the moon are considered non-mainstream. Most of the moon gods in various countries are beauties. For example, in ancient Chinese mythology, the moon goddess is named &quot;Wangshu&quot;, and she drives a moon carriage across the sky every night. &quot;Huainanzi&quot; also adds, &quot;Yueyu is called Wangshu, and it is also called Xian&#39;a&quot;. Literally explained, &quot;Wangshu&quot; means &quot;good-looking&quot; and &quot;Xian&#39;a&quot; means &quot;beautiful and good-looking&quot;. It can be seen from these two names that the ancients obviously believed that the Moon God was a beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting is not surprising. Compared with the sun, the moonlight appears white and cold. In addition, the moon&#39;s revolution cycle is similar to the female menstrual cycle, so it is reasonable for people to imagine the moon goddess as a beautiful woman. Selene in ancient Greek mythology was not only a beauty, but also drove a moon carriage. Among the Romans, the name of this moon god was Luna - the word &quot;luna&quot; representing the moon and the lunar calendar originated from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the beauty of the moon goddess, most Chinese people will immediately think of Chang&#39;e. But Chang&#39;e is not actually called this name, and she is not the Moon God at all: Chang&#39;e is just a general name for the Fairy of the Moon Palace. She is the maid of the Moon God rather than the Moon God herself. Chang&#39;e&#39;s name was originally written as Chang&#39;e. Later, in order to avoid the taboo of Emperor Liu Heng of Han Dynasty, it was temporarily changed to &quot;Chang&#39;e&quot; simply because the two words &quot;hengchang&quot; have similar meanings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taboo avoidance in the Han Dynasty was not strict, and taboo avoidance was only a temporary expediency and should be changed back later. But I don’t know whether it was because Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty was too beloved by the people, or because of the strong cultural influence of the Han Dynasty, a series of &quot;constant changes to the ordinary&quot; are still used today:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first sentence of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; &quot;The Tao can be Tao&quot; , non-constant Tao&quot; is still written as &quot;Very Tao&quot;; the &quot;Snake of Hengshan&quot; in &quot;The Art of War&quot; has always been written as &quot;Snake of Changshan&quot;, and Changshan Zhao Zilong has become an allusion; and Chang&#39;e&#39;s name is also called Today, Chang&#39;e has become a rare word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also the Han Dynasty when Chang&#39;e was forced to change her name, and Queen Mother Xi replaced Wangshu and became the new Moon Goddess. Then Taoism rose, and Taiyin Xingjun became the new moon god. This Taiyin Star King is said to be the Moon Mother Chang Xi. But whether it is the Queen Mother of the West or the Lord of Taiyin, they are all images of old women. The public obviously doesn&#39;t buy this, and still retains the impression that Luna is a beautiful woman. Therefore, it is not surprising that the &quot;Fairy Chang&#39;e&quot;, as a young maid, has replaced her boss and is regarded by everyone as the real moon goddess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In folk classics, Chang&#39;e always holds the Jade Rabbit in her arms. However, when it comes to seniority, it may be more reasonable to have the Jade Rabbit holding Chang&#39;e - the legend of the rabbit inside the moon is widely spread in East and Southeast Asia. The ancient Chinese books are among the earliest to record the legend of the Moon Rabbit. &quot;Chu Ci·Tian Wen&quot; says: &quot;What virtue is there in the moonlight, when death brings fertility? What is the benefit of the moon, but the tutu is in the belly?&quot; Therefore, the legends of various countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia The legend of the Moon Rabbit probably originated from China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Native Americans on the other side of the Pacific also spread the legend of the Moon Rabbit, which is even more magical: In Aztec mythology, Quetzalcoatl once descended to earth for training and almost died of hunger and thirst. At this time, a rabbit offered himself as food to save his life. Quetzalcoatl was moved by the rabbit&#39;s noble dedication, and after restoring his divine power, he promoted the rabbit to the moon god. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many versions of the Moon God in Mayan mythology, but almost all the images of the Moon God are holding a rabbit. After the arrival of Western colonists, the Mayans were unwilling to change their beliefs, and even stitched together Christianity and Mayan mythology: the sun god became Jehovah, the moon god became the Virgin Mary, and the corn god became Jesus Christ—I don’t know. How should they explain why Maria always held the rabbit? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many scholars believe that the legend of rabbits in the moon comes from the imagination of the shadow on the moon. However, so many ethnic groups around the world have various imaginations about shadows. For example, Europeans think that shadows look like a human face. Only the groups on the east and west sides of the Pacific believe that shadows resemble rabbits, which is too much of a coincidence. Therefore, some people also suspect that the legend of the Moon Rabbit may have been widely circulated among the ancestors as early as when the Native Americans left East Asia. Native Americans arrived in North America about 12,000 to 23,000 years ago. Based on this calculation, the legend of the Moon Rabbit may have been circulated for tens of thousands of years, and even now it has actually landed on the moon:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1969 Before Apollo 11 landed on the moon, the astronauts in the cabin mentioned Chang&#39;e and the Moon Rabbit in their conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lynton Johnson Space Center: There is a lot of important news about the Apollo this morning, and one of them calls your attention to a cute girl with a big rabbit. According to an ancient legend, a beautiful Chinese girl named Chang&#39;e has lived there for 4,000 years. It is said that she was exiled to the moon for stealing her husband&#39;s elixir of life. Perhaps her companion could be found - a huge Chinese rabbit, which always stood in the shade of the laurel tree and was easily spotted. The rabbit&#39;s name was not reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Astronaut Buzz Aldrin: OK, we&#39;ll keep an eye on that bunny girl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country&#39;s lunar rover was also named &quot;Jade Rabbit&quot; to pay tribute to this beautiful and ancient myth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, our fate with the moon goes beyond that. According to the latest large collision theory, the ancient dwarf planet did not collide with the ancient Earth, but a head-on collision. The two planets were completely destroyed, forming the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Venus, and then combined to form the Earth and the Moon. This also explains why the core accounts for such a large proportion of the Earth, because the core of the dwarf planet and the core of the Earth later merged into one, and the Earth&#39;s water may also come from the dwarf planet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, each of us is actually half a lunar person - or half Theian/half Changxi person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[济南城投公司一次性售1341套现房，房从哪来？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257906]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/RCBkXjPTUSHgAgP7TQ7gS7NWtD7htfWp74i5jRj6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/RCBkXjPTUSHgAgP7TQ7gS7NWtD 7htfWp74i5jRj6. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252757&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinan is full of high-rise buildings. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 22, 2023, at Qilu International Building, Jinan City, Shandong Province, Jinan Urban Development Group Assets Operation Management Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Chengfa) has opened bids for a project - recruiting housing marketing agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The project is selling 1,341 units of commercial housing, with a total area of ​​about 166,000 square meters, involving 4 properties, and developers include Greenland, Longfor, Poly, etc. Based on the average listing price in September, the total value of these properties exceeds 2.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that these houses are all existing houses and are first-hand residences. The project tenderer, Jinan Chengfa, is not a developer, but an urban investment company engaged in real estate development and operation, and is 100% owned by the Jinan Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only in Jinan, on September 21, 2023, the Beijing Equity Exchange auctioned and transferred 154 properties. The transferor was the Beijing Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee, and the source of the assets was &quot;physical assets of administrative institutions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where do local urban investment companies and government departments get their housing from? Why are they for sale? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The product of &quot;competitive construction&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang has worked in the Shandong branch of a national real estate company for seven or eight years. This time Jinan City Among the four properties for sale are projects of his company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters that the hundreds of units for sale in the project were resettlement houses built by real estate companies during land auctions, and were transferred to Jinan City Development after completion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the real estate market was booming in the past few years, real estate companies were vying for land across the country. In order to control land prices, local governments often limited the maximum price for land auctions. After the local auction reaches the maximum price, if the winner has not yet been determined, there will be a &quot;competition for self-sustaining&quot; and a &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;competition for construction&quot; means that after the developer&#39;s land quotation triggers the maximum price, it turns to competition for the construction area of ​​affordable housing. The one with the largest construction area is the winner. The housing provided is owned by the local government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang recalled that the above-mentioned land was purchased around 2018. In order to successfully bid, the company built two buildings as resettlement houses in a community of two to three thousand households, which increased the cost by more than 60 million yuan. But after the house was put on the market, the market price dropped and the entire project lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Jinan had just begun to implement &quot;competitive construction&quot;, which was still a minority in the country. Many cities usually use a lottery method to determine the winner after the land price triggers the maximum price limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that Jinan’s “competition for construction” has continued until now. In addition to the projects developed by his company, other properties sold in Jinan City Development this time are also the product of &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;competition-to-build&quot; housing was originally used as local affordable housing. Especially since the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Affordable Rental Housing&quot; in 2021, various places have accelerated the financing of affordable rental housing. Listings. In August 2022, Jinan Chengfa publicly purchased 3,000 units of commercial housing as rental reserves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Lin Gang admitted that the rental effect of the resettlement houses built by his company in the community was not good. The above-mentioned project, which was put up for sale by Jinan Chengfa, was completed in 2020. In 2022, I heard that two buildings would be used for lease by the government. The owners who had already moved in expressed their opposition and were worried that the mix of tenants would affect the community environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Some owners have come up with a plan and want to build a wall in the community to separate the two supporting buildings.” Lin Gang said that the owners’ opinions were fed back to Jinan Chengfa. The other party did not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are no companies near the community, it is not convenient for office workers to rent here and commute. The rental rate of the two resettlement houses has not been high. For Jinan Chengfa, this means limited rental income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the downturn in the real estate market, Jinan’s government fund income, which mainly comes from land sales, has been almost halved. Data from the Jinan Municipal Finance Bureau show that the city’s government fund revenue fell to 54.7 billion yuan in 2022 from 101.6 billion yuan in the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There have been very few land auctions in Jinan in the past four or five years.” Lin Gang said that under the influence of real estate regulation and the new crown epidemic, major real estate companies are shrinking, and Jinan’s land auction market continues to be cold. In order to maintain the team, his company has only acquired two pieces of land in Jinan in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its prediction of the fiscal revenue and expenditure situation in 2023, the Jinan Municipal Government pointed out that fiscal operations are still in a state of tight balance, and the pressure to increase revenue, reduce expenditure and prevent risks is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure, the Jinan Municipal Government proposed in the 2023 budget report to increase the profit handover ratio of municipal state-owned enterprises to 20%, and transfer the municipal-level state-owned capital operating budget to the general public budget proportion increased to 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Jinan Chengfa, who has a house in hand, the income from selling houses is obviously more substantial than renting. Taking the housing listings in Huatongyuan Community in Greenland as an example, Anjuke showed that the monthly rent for a three-bedroom apartment of about 140 square meters is 5,000 yuan, and the rent per square meter is about 38 yuan/month. If sold, the new house price is 22,000 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called Jinan Chengfa many times, but the staff declined the interview because the person in charge was not available. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Revitalizing idle properties&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is not the first time Jinan State-owned Assets has sold commercial housing. In July 2023, the Dongcheng Yijia Community developed by Jinan Urban Construction Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Urban Construction) was put on sale. Another property owned by the company, Xijiang Huafu, also announced that it will be launched for sale in the second half of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the equity penetration, Jinan Urban Construction is 90% owned by the Jinan State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and 10% by the Shandong Finance Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two communities are called &quot;civil servant communities&quot; in Jinan. Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of home buyers. The sales staff of Jinan Urban Construction Yi said that the two communities combined have a total of about 12,000 units, which were completed and delivered in 2016 and 2019. Half of the building was previously sold to civil servants, and the remaining half has been vacant until 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Dongcheng Yijia Community has more than 4,000 units for sale this time, and Xijiang Huafu has more than 1,000 units, which are expected to be officially launched after the National Day holiday. &quot;The two properties were originally off-plan properties and were sold internally by civil servants around 2013. The selling price was equivalent to the market price at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Lin Gang was still working as a real estate reporter for a newspaper in Jinan. &quot;When I got to know this community, people had already chosen a house.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Jinan hosted the 11th National Games and built a new Olympic Sports Center in the east of the city as the main venue. After the National Games, the Jinan Municipal Government also began to move eastward, moving into the Long&#39;ao Building, which is more than 100 meters away from the Olympic Sports Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil servants from Jinan Municipal Government units subsequently moved to Longao Building to work. Many civil servants did not have houses or lived far away. In order to meet the housing needs, two residential communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, were built. Judging from the distance displayed on the map software, the two communities are both within 3 kilometers of Longao Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Revitalizing State-owned Assets of Administrative Institutions&quot;, requiring the implementation of the government&#39;s tight living requirements and accelerating the revitalization and utilization of various state-owned assets such as houses, land, and vehicles. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, more than 5,000 units of existing houses have been put on the market in two communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, and Jinan&#39;s property market has been shocked. &quot;This is amazing. The total number of online new houses signed in Jinan a year is only 40,000 to 50,000 units.&quot; Lin Gang sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Jinan urban construction staff said that the current price of a small apartment of 95 square meters in Dongcheng Yijia is about 25,000 yuan/square meter, and the price of a large apartment of 175 square meters is about 29,000 yuan/square meter. Data from Lianjia.com shows that this price is lower than second-hand houses in the same area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because these two communities are all rough housing.” She said that in the two months since Dongcheng Yijia went on sale, more than 400 units have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that these two communities were built earlier, and the unit designs are not outstanding, which has also lowered the price to a certain extent. However, it has a superior location and is equipped with a high-quality school district. It is still popular after being listed and has a certain impact on surrounding second-hand houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 154 properties transferred by the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee of Chaoyang District, Beijing are similar to those in Jinan. This batch of properties is located in the China Railway Construction International City Community, and the listing price is also lower than the price of second-hand houses in the same community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Economic Observer&quot; report, after the completion of China Railway Construction International City, some houses were repurchased by Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee and other units, with plans to use them to solve the housing problem of employees. Later, it was not fully implemented as planned, and some of the houses remain vacant to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee provided Southern Weekend reporters with the phone number of the person in charge, but no one answered the call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lin Gang is a pseudonym at the request of the interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[掰掰告别狮子林桥后，天津还有哪些快乐？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[东亚家庭的悲剧与温情，全程哭着看完]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257890]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The son who has been away from home for many years suddenly received a call from his old man.

We long to grow up in such a family, enjoy the influence of music, and have a warm life like the director; and &quot;House of Gods&quot; reproduces another situation of East Asian families - There was no dialogue, they tortured each other, and after &quot;living&quot; based on instinctive consciousness, they escaped from this cursed place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother who is thin and works all day long; the father who has nothing to do and is addicted to lottery tickets; and the brother who is just muddling along and accomplishing nothing. Director Lu Yingliang does not directly present the desperate state of these family members, but through a &quot;god&quot;. A rare perspective that reflects everyone&#39;s inner world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the director&#39;s hometown, there has always been a strong belief in gods, and the Lu family attaches great importance to it. They have a separate room upstairs for worshiping a shrine and an incense altar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/355fc9f42b250a57564de8f63af746e6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;613&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/355fc9f42b250a57564de8f63af746e6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252725&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this source When Yu Lu Yingliang&#39;s brother was 12 years old, he suddenly became &quot;psychic&quot; and was chosen by the gods. He became a celebrity who traveled far and wide to seek guidance from gods. For many years after that, in addition to farm work, my brother also worked part-time as a fortune teller for others, and the Lu family became connected with the gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But through the director’s lens, we will find that family members have different attitudes towards gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although my mother is in poor health, she still climbs up and down every day to worship the gods. When asked repeatedly by her son why she persisted, she said lonelyly: &quot;In the past, when your brother left home, you and your father were not at home.

He always wanted to guess the numbers from the smoke coming out of the incense and use it to buy lottery tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elder brother, who has been dealing with gods for half his life, gradually fell into an embarrassing situation on camera. The film specifically uses the &quot;little tomato incident&quot; to expose the conceptual gap between the two generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before planting tomatoes, my brother specifically asked the gods for instructions on the farming date. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/224bc1a4bc313d1d17b872c64c05f5a5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/224bc1a4bc313d1d17b872c64c05f5a5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252728&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But right here Not long after the fruit seedlings were planted, heavy rains for days flooded the farmland, but the gods did not play any role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young nephew was unwilling. He first said angrily that he had stopped believing in gods for a long time, but soon after, he burst into tears, hoping that his brother could ask the gods to find a solution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elder brother did not want to deceive his son, but in order to soothe the next generation&#39;s uneasiness and confusion, he could only pretend to have a breath with the gods, saying that Hua Tuo would greet his friends and solve the dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, God becomes the comforter of this ordinary family. When the family finds no hope in reality, the more they place their hope on the gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/9b655e87cb3cd81be4aa2e6434d3b5a0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/9b655e87cb3cd81be4aa2e6434d3b5a0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252727&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like a director When my brother was doing farm work, he asked in despair and confusion: &quot;Do you really think God has helped our family?

The film explores such metaphysical themes, not to mention situating this discussion among members of a rural family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we don’t need to compare &quot;House of God&quot; with religious films such as &quot;First Reformed&quot; and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;.

He had to borrow money to pay off the debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang had no choice but to work hard in a big city at the age of 18 and almost never came back because he knew that once he fell into this house of gods and men, he would become the same as those god tablets and become the entrustment of the whole family. &quot;hope&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the beginning of the film until the middle and later stages, Lu Yingliang rarely appears in the picture.

The resentment that had been built up for many years gradually dissipated, not because the Lu family was on the right track, but because his father would eventually pass away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a sad ending for an East Asian family. Just like the recent &quot;That Time a Ghost and I Became Family&quot;, the father played by Tuo Zonghua finally opened his heart because Mao Bangyu had passed away.

I said it didn&#39;t matter, there would be another chance in the future, and then I pulled him with a smile to get ready to play. Unexpectedly, my son scolded me for my passive and careless attitude. He said no, so he would do it one less time. He would not be able to talk nonsense to his classmates next time. I was stunned for a moment. It was really I wonder why he is so interested in being a little teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under my gentle questioning, my son told the truth that he wanted to be a primary school teacher: because this way he could control other children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer surprised me. It was clearly a sign of a desire for power. I heard that this is a kind of power given by teachers to children who perform well in order to facilitate daily management. Children who serve as primary school teachers can help the teacher supervise other children, mainly in that they can criticize children with irregular behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wanted to indoctrinate my son and tell him that this idea was wrong. As soon as I said one sentence, I was already lacking in confidence and knew that my dogmatic words would be contradicted by him. I changed my way of saying this: When you are a primary school teacher, you should serve the children. When you find a child making a mistake, don’t scold him loudly, otherwise the other person will be sad. You should speak in a gentle tone. The son said very maturely, I understand. It seems that he has become accustomed to the rules of this little teacher&#39;s game, which I did not expect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that being a primary school teacher is sometimes difficult. Once, he and a classmate were both primary school teachers. His good friend was called out by the classmate when he was speaking. He wanted to be accommodating, but was rejected by the classmate. This made him very distressed and didn&#39;t know what to do. Another time, he criticized a classmate when he was a primary school teacher. A few days later, the classmate deliberately called his name when he was a primary school teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was stunned when I heard these stories. I was at a loss and felt very familiar at the same time. Isn’t this the epitome of the workplace for us adults, and it is too “social”. My son didn’t understand what I meant by “society”. I told him that what the other person did was wrong and you can’t do that. I asked a few friends who have children and they reported similar situations. The only comfort I can find is that such a mechanism can restrain children from some irregular behaviors in class, but it may not be effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe children don’t want to become too “social”. Sometimes they have no choice like us adults, or they are trapped in it without knowing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother of her son’s classmate told me something: Once, my son told her that one day her child was punished by the teacher at school to stand in the back of the classroom and talk to other children. She asked my son, how did you know, and he said without hesitation that the teacher made us stand while we were talking together. After listening to it, we burst out laughing. We were thinking about saying goodbye to others, but we suddenly exposed ourselves. Perhaps this is a contrast between &quot;society&quot; and innocence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times, children’s world is becoming adult, and children experience the rules and confusion of adult society prematurely. When we face our own problems, we usually appear powerless or messed up. When our children encounter the same situation, how can we expect them to be perfect? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I went to pick up my son from school one day, he happily said that today he was on duty as a student. I thought to myself, what&#39;s so good about being a duty student? Isn&#39;t it just voluntary labor? But he told me that being a student on duty was to help the teacher sweep the floor and arrange chairs. It was a task assigned to him by the teacher, and it was a supreme honor. Thinking about children&#39;s &quot;society&quot;, there may be a gratifying point, that is, the threshold for happiness is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently I watched a movie online called &quot;Goodbye, Our Kindergarten&quot;. In the movie, the kindergarten children sang a song at the graduation ceremony, &quot;We have spent countless days here. Every night, we laughed many times, cried many times, caught cold many times, we played here with so many dear friends, we ran here, fell here, fought here, goodbye to our Kindergarten, this is our playground.” The singing and lyrics moved me very much. Kindergarten should be a pure and happy playground, with less social fetters and worries. I recommended this movie to my son. He refused at first, but when I told him that it was about a few children going on an adventure to visit a good friend who was seriously ill, he expressed great interest. That weekend afternoon, because there was no Mandarin dubbing, I read all the lines to him with great emotion. After the movie ended, he said he was going to cry. I knew that he must have the same empathy for other people&#39;s sadness and happiness as the children in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a worker in the cultural industry)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(&quot;Raising Children&quot; in the &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of the Southern Weekend App, welcome Write a letter to share the scenery and principles you have learned as a parent and teacher on the way your children grow up.
