Japan has also high-profilely promoted its equipment in the United States and its allies. The role of logistics support. Foreign media said that the measures taken by Western military industrial groups are almost synchronized with the introduction of Japan&#39;s defense budget for the next five years, and they intend to prepare in advance within the framework of a quasi-alliance and cut the budget &quot;cake&quot; to the maximum extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, British Aerospace Systems has established close ties with Japan and plans to move its Asia-Pacific headquarters from Malaysia to Japan within the year to prepare to supply Patriot PAC-3 missile defense systems to Japan. France&#39;s Thales will cooperate with Japan&#39;s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop and produce equipment such as mine detectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the combined influence of commercial and political factors, Japan suddenly became a &quot;hot potato&quot; sought after by arms dealers in the United States, Britain and France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent times, the United States has frequently held offensive and defensive exercises with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, which has made the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea tense in Northeast Asia. Western arms dealers have a keen sense of smell. On the one hand, they are concerned about changes in the geopolitical situation, and on the other hand, they also fancy the business opportunities brought by Japan&#39;s substantial increase in defense spending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that as tensions in Northeast Asia escalate and Japan increases its defense spending, the changes made by these arms giants in order to cooperate with Japan&#39;s major adjustments to its defense strategy indicate that Japan hopes to further achieve cooperation with the United States and Europe. &quot;Military binding&quot; supports its ambition to expand its military power. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Opportunity to take advantage of&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Western arms dealers have moved their Asia-Pacific headquarters to Japan, selling arms nearby, and launching &quot;face-to-face&quot; in-depth cooperation with Japan , a win-win situation can be achieved. From a deeper analysis, this is the reason why the United States uses Japan and Japan hopes to &quot;borrow ships to go to sea.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the Biden administration has established many &quot;small circles&quot; in the hope of using, controlling and arming allies. Through the research and development of various advanced weapons and equipment, frequent military exercises with deterrence and actual combat significance, fighting &quot;proxy wars&quot;, testing the effectiveness of weapons and equipment and strategies and tactics, making huge fortunes by promoting arms, creating conflicts and conflicts, undermining regional stability, and maintaining it. In the global hegemonic position, it achieves the goal of &quot;killing many birds with one stone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines do not have advantages in military and technology. The United States&#39; selection and use of Japan is also &quot;a no-brainer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the Korean War and the Vietnam War, Western arms dealers had a history of moving their Asian defense contractor headquarters to Japan, allowing Japan to reap the benefits of its rapid economic rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Japan&#39;s heavy industry restarted. As Japan is the rear area for US military war supplies, a large number of orders for military supplies continue to fall on Japan&#39;s military production lines. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is a long-established military industrial enterprise of Japanese manufacturers. It has a complete production line of F-4 fighter jets. The F-4 Phantom fighter jets it produces have played a huge role as the main fighter aircraft of the U.S. Navy and Air Force, helping the U.S. military win 277 wars. The victory helped the US military save some face in the Vietnam battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the United States still wants to use Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of the Cold War, European arms dealers basically did not develop much. Therefore, European countries are also optimistic about Japan&#39;s funds and technology. At the same time, Japan also hopes to develop weapons and equipment instead of just relying on the United States. Before this, it was difficult for the United States to allow Japan to extend its olive branch to other countries in the research and development of weapons and equipment, especially heavy weapons and equipment. Now, the United States is opening up and hopes to arm Japan and allow Japan to provide assistance to the United States in the Western Pacific. assume more defensive obligations. Therefore, after the United States gave the green light, Japan and European countries moved forward in cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Japan’s security strategy has shifted from self-defense to auxiliary offense. At the end of 2022, Japan adjusted its security strategy. From the so-called self-defense in the past to the current auxiliary offense, it is expanding its military preparations in all aspects. Whether it is technology, funding, or procurement, Japan&#39;s own military production capacity alone is obviously not enough. . Therefore, Japan&#39;s turning its attention to European countries also reflects changes in its security strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There is money to be made”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On August 27, 2023, “Nikkei Asia” reported that “the world’s largest defense contractors Businesses are transferring their business operations in Asia to Japan, because in the face of the deteriorating security situation in East Asia, Japan is preparing to significantly increase defense expenses.&quot; Japan&#39;s &quot;business&quot; with Western arms dealers is conducive to dividing the cake and achieving strong alliances. , each takes what he needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From fiscal year 2023 to 2027, Japan’s total defense budget will reach 43 trillion yen, 1.6 times that of the previous five years. The latest defense budget finalized by the Japanese Ministry of Defense for 2024 has reached 7.7 trillion yen, equivalent to more than 380 billion yuan, once again setting a record high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, 900 billion yen will be used to purchase various ammunition and weapons and equipment, including new ship-to-air missiles and long-range cruise missiles. For example: the mass production costs of the &quot;performance-enhanced version&quot; of the Ground Self-Defense Force&#39;s Type 12 land-based anti-ship missile with a range extending to about 1,000 kilometers, and the production costs of &quot;high-speed gliding missiles&quot; used to defend islands such as the Southwest Islands. In addition, there are 64 billion yen for a new generation fighter aircraft project jointly carried out by Britain, Japan and Italy, and 75 billion yen for a new anti-missile interceptor jointly developed by the United States and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Japan held the largest international defense exhibition, attracting more than 250 arms companies from more than 60 countries and regions. European and American companies participating in the exhibition have shown great interest in the Japanese market. The Japanese government has planned to allocate more than 200 billion yen to purchase approximately 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan plans to deploy two Aegis system carrier ships by 2028, establish a new permanent &quot;unified headquarters&quot; in Tokyo Ichigaya, and uniformly command the three self-defense forces of land, sea and air; purchase long-range missiles and improve the Aegis system Carrier ships; develop new fields such as drones, space and the Internet, and ammunition support to improve sustained combat capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kishida government&#39;s sharp increase in defense expenses has allowed European and American arms dealers to smell business opportunities. Behind the increase in Japan&#39;s military expenditures, it reflects that Japan and the United States have cooperated more frequently at the strategic and tactical levels in recent years. This is reflected in the fact that the US-Japan alliance is undergoing subtle and profound changes. The alliance system has gradually changed from the past &quot;American master and Japanese slave&quot;. Shifting to &quot;US-Japan coordination&quot; means that the United States needs Japan to step up to the forefront in a series of regional disputes, including regional hotspot issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relocation of Western arms dealers to Japan may further fuel Japan&#39;s maritime ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has proposed that it should shift from the past &quot;marine defense governance&quot; to &quot;marine defense governance&quot;. Japan&#39;s ambition to become a maritime power is fully reflected in each phase of the basic marine plan. In addition, Japan plans to launch a series of maritime security assistance and increase strategic attention to Indo-Pacific countries, which will also bring certain complexity to the regional situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s ambition has always been demonstrated. Today, Japan plans to build the so-called largest warship after World War II - a modern version of the &quot;Yamato&quot; ship, which is 1.7 times the size of the U.S. Burke destroyer and exceeds the average tonnage of U.S. combat ships in terms of displacement and comprehensive combat power. This also shows that Japan can achieve great progress and development in its ocean strategy and offensive strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of weapons and equipment configuration, the United States’ Standard 6 (SM-6) air defense missiles will be used on this ship, and Japan’s air defense and anti-missile capabilities will be further improved. If the &quot;Yamato&quot; ship is equipped with a ground-attack version of the Type 12 anti-ship missile, its range can reach 1,000 kilometers. Japan&#39;s future maritime platforms will have powerful ground attack capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s military spending is rising and it wants to expand its military preparations. Western arms dealers see business opportunities and flock to them. Fundamentally speaking, this will allow the United States to better utilize and control Japan with the help of arms dealers and maintain the United States in the &quot;Indo-Pacific&quot; regional” and even global hegemony. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Japan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Arms Upgrading&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Japan has introduced the core business of the Western military industry and is also trying to intentionally introduce Western technology into its own arms production chain. middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 28, the Japan Defense Equipment Agency issued the &quot;Defense Technology Guidelines 2023&quot;, reaffirming the strategy of &quot;building a nation through scientific and technological innovation&quot;, focusing on strengthening defense capabilities and developing weapons and equipment that are ahead of other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan, within 5 to 10 years, Japan will produce weapons directly related to future combat methods, and after 10 years, it will realize the equipment of important technologies. Japan has listed 12 key technologies such as unmanned technology, new energy, new materials, instant communications and data processing as pillar technologies for the future defense industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Japanese military-industrial complex giant said that the entry of Western arms companies will increase the number of orders from small and medium-sized parts suppliers. There are currently 1,100 companies engaged in the production of fighter jet parts, 1,300 companies engaged in the production of tank parts, and 830 companies engaged in the production of warship parts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has reached an agreement with the United Kingdom and Italy to jointly develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, and recently jointly developed high-performance missiles with the United States for intercepting hypersonic weapons. Companies established in the UK, France, Italy and other countries plan to increase the number of employees and will mainly recruit local Japanese personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The American L3 Harris Technology Company is an aerospace company in the United States. It has begun negotiations with the Japanese Ministry of Defense on cooperation in drones and other fields, which provides a favorable opportunity for Japan to improve its military production capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the support of European and American arms dealers, Japan follows or coordinates with the United States and the West. During this sensitive period, Japan&#39;s defense budget is also increasing year by year. If this continues, Japan will fall into an endless cycle of arms race, which will bring serious danger to the regional situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another situation is that in order to make money, Western arms dealers may use the power of capital to bribe Japanese media, add fuel to the flames, and deliberately create conflicts. Western arms dealers have moved their Asian headquarters to Japan to cooperate with Japan in military research and development and sales. The Japanese government claims that the purchase of weapons and ammunition is a &quot;defensive measure.&quot; If the United States, the West and Japan intervene in hot geopolitical issues through arms exports, it will provoke conflicts and confrontations among relevant countries and make the situation in the Asia-Pacific region even more tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, six European and American arms dealers have moved to Japan and signed an agreement to &quot;carry out large-scale arms modifications in Japan&quot;. They are suspected of shifting arms to prepare for war, making it easier for Japan to obtain offensive weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan plans to rely on its military cooperation with the United States to gradually realize its so-called military ambitions in the context of great power competition and the Indo-Pacific strategy. Once the devil of militarism is released from its cage, it will have , the impact on the world will further increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the United States openly and covertly supports Japan to increase its defense budget. Japan&#39;s past &quot;exclusive defense&quot; has turned to &quot;active defense&quot; and it emphasizes the ability to attack enemy bases. The United States has adopted an attitude of encouragement and even support. Under this general premise, it is possible that the regional arms race will become more and more unfavorable, which is also caused by the United States and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一观众从三楼看展坠亡，广东美术馆通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258581]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 19:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Situation Briefing&lt;/strong>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 8, Ms. Yang, a visitor, visited the Guangdong Museum of Art and accidentally fell from Exhibition Hall 12 on the third floor of our museum to Exhibition Hall 6 on the second floor at around 11:50. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, our library immediately activated the emergency plan and quickly dialed 120 emergency hotline and 110 police hotline.

The integrated development strategy of &quot;commercial and investment banking&quot; is progressing steadily, and the benefits of investment-loan linkage are gradually reflected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strategic &quot;digital transformation&quot; of commercial banks has begun to shift from &quot;quantitative growth&quot; to &quot;qualitative improvement.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Loans tend to be in the manufacturing and technology industries&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center sorted out the 2023 interim results conferences, 2023 interim results conferences of 20 commercial banks The interim report and 2022 annual report found that 20 commercial banks all mentioned in the 2022 annual report the strategy of benefiting the real economy and providing financial support for manufacturing and national key areas. This strategy was emphasized again in the 2023 interim reports of each bank: each bank has proposed the goal of continuing to improve the quality and efficiency of serving the real economy in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the analysis of the distribution of corporate loan industries disclosed by 20 commercial banks in the 2022 interim report and the 2023 interim report, the above strategies mentioned by each bank in the 2022 annual report have achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The year-on-year growth rates of corporate loan balances in the national key strategic fields of manufacturing and technology services were 25.02% and 64.35% respectively. Judging from the absolute value of corporate loan balances, in the first half of 2023, the loan balance of manufacturing companies in 20 commercial banks reached 15.86 trillion yuan, becoming the industry with the highest corporate loan balance, surpassing companies in the leasing and business services industry with 15.35 trillion yuan. Loan balance. The industry with the highest corporate loan balance in the first half of 2022 is the leasing and business services industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that within one year, the credit structure of commercial banks has changed from the original &quot;three pillars&quot; of leasing, real estate and manufacturing to a model dominated by manufacturing. This also echoes China’s current economic form in which the old triangular cycle of “real estate, infrastructure, and finance” is moving to the new triangular cycle of “technology, industry, and finance.” At the same time, this also reflects the current new phenomenon of bank funds flowing into the real economy and supporting the development of manufacturing, scientific research and technical service industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/N9oJ5kvONawBpMQ3lLRpiKdDJJ8PVPk9WsUhQisL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height= &quot;1352&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/N9oJ5kvONawBpMQ3lLRpiKdDJJ8PVPk9WsUhQisL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254034&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main force that tilts credit towards the manufacturing industry is There are five major state-owned banks: industry, agriculture, China, construction, and diplomatic relations. In the first half of 2023, the total loan balance of manufacturing companies from the five major state-owned banks was 10.84 trillion yuan, accounting for 68.36% of the total loan balance of manufacturing companies from 20 banks. The three joint-stock banks Industrial Bank, China Merchants Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank followed the five major state-owned banks with loan balances of manufacturing companies of 669.412 billion yuan, 549.976 billion yuan and 542.672 billion yuan respectively, higher than the Postal Savings Bank&#39;s manufacturing company loans of 495.732 billion yuan. Corporate loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center also found that loans to companies in the scientific research and technical service industries have gradually become areas of concern for joint-stock banks and city commercial banks, which may be related to the misaligned competition strategy of state-owned banks. Among them, state-owned banks and some joint-stock banks did not disclose this balance. Among the city commercial banks, Bank of Shanghai did not disclose this balance in its 2022 interim report. However, from the 2022 annual report to the 2023 interim report, the bank disclosed it. the balance of this loan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In absolute terms, in the first half of 2023, Industrial Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank had the highest balances, at 36.536 billion yuan and 32.944 billion yuan respectively. In terms of year-on-year growth rates, Bank of Nanjing and Bank of Beijing have the highest year-on-year growth rates, 92.67% and 83.11% respectively. It can be seen that joint-stock banks are the main lenders in this industry, while city commercial banks are gradually paying more and more attention to this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Investment business&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;becomes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;an important growth point&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As the loan business turns, 20 The bank is developing its investment banking business, financial market business and “commercial investment banking” integration strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center sorted out the 2023 interim reports of 20 banks, their interim results conferences and investor exchange meetings and found that most banks mentioned strengthening investment banking business and financial markets. sector and build an integrated development strategy of “commercial and investment banking”. From the analysis of the bank&#39;s revenue structure and asset structure in recent years, this strategy has achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For financial investment business, the three indicators of investment income, net income from changes in fair value and net exchange income are particularly important, and the three indicators are highly correlated. In order to explore the actual benefits of various banks&#39; strengthening financial investment business strategies, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center conducted statistics on the sum of the above three indicators as a proportion of revenue for 20 banks in the past three years. Statistics show that, regardless of whether it is a state-owned bank, a joint-stock bank or a city commercial bank, the ratio is on the rise, and the upward trend is the most obvious for city commercial banks. With traditional credit business unable to take advantage, city commercial banks are using investment business as a breakthrough point to expand their balance sheets. Take the Bank of Nanjing, which was shortlisted for China&#39;s systemically important banks for the first time on September 22, 2023, as an example. In the first half of 2023, the bank&#39;s three income indicators accounted for 32.15% of its revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/Ofc6345KnFX3DOnrAT9TLvvgUBlY7MNjsr8GXJAv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;796&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/Ofc6345KnFX3DOnrAT9TLvvgUBlY7MNjsr8GXJAv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254033&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/HV5COF9Saq3kPHkt94b31busBbhVHgCZjn2Wv1V6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height=&quot;1852&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/13/HV5COF9Saq3kPHkt94b31busBbhVHgCZjn2Wv1V6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254032&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the above three income indicators are highly correlated with trading financial assets. In recent years, the proportion of trading financial assets to total assets of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks has also shown a growth trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/RKL1YucI0TOTVGgvItL317nTxA6jNIjeJJ9bYVcj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height= &quot;796&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/RKL1YucI0TOTVGgvItL317nTxA6jNIjeJJ9bYVcj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254031&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Feng Qingchao/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2023 Interim Report of Bank of Nanjing, 2022 According to data from the interim report, 2022 annual report, 2021 annual report and 2020 annual report, at the end of June 2023, the end of December 2022 and the end of December 2021, the year-on-year growth rates of its trading financial assets were 40.32%, 39.28% and 77.41%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to conduct an in-depth analysis of the composition of each bank’s investment business, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center sorted out the trading transactions disclosed in the 2023 interim reports of the five banks with the highest three income ratios among the 20 banks. Financial asset data. According to statistics, the largest trading financial assets of these banks are funds, followed by bonds or asset management trust plans. The funds invested by commercial banks are generally bond funds and currency funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By studying the types of bond funds invested by banks, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that some banks’ bond investment strategies are to purchase fixed-term bond funds issued by the bank’s fund management subsidiaries. This strategy may have the effect of reducing bond investment costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Industrial Bank as an example. According to the 2023 interim report disclosed by the fund products issued by Industrial Fund, the bank holds the Industrial Jiarong one-year regular open bond-type initiative issued by its subsidiary Industrial Fund Management Co., Ltd. The shares of securities investment funds and Industrial Jiafu one-year regular open bond-type sponsored securities investment funds are 99.87% and 99.88% respectively. According to Article 2 of the &quot;Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Certain Preferential Policies for Enterprise Income Tax&quot;, the income obtained by securities investment funds from the securities market includes income from price differences from buying and selling stocks and bonds, dividends and bonus income from equity, and income from bonds. Interest income and other income are not subject to corporate income tax for the time being. That is to say, compared with direct investment in financial bonds, banks can be exempted from paying 25% income tax if they invest indirectly in financial bonds through fixed-term debt funds, thus reducing investment costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the debt investment subjects of direct investment bonds, 10 of the 12 commercial banks (only 12 of the 20 commercial banks disclosed this data in their 2023 interim reports) maintained year-on-year growth increase. Among them, the two banks with year-on-year decreases were Bank of Nanjing and Ping An Bank. Although the amount of debt investment of these two banks decreased by 11.49% and 1.96% year-on-year, their trading financial assets increased by 40.32% and 17.81% year-on-year, and the proportion of funds and bonds among their trading financial assets was relatively high. The increase in the total amount of bonds in the debt base or trading financial assets is sufficient to cover the year-on-year decrease in the bond investment account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, whether it is direct investment in bonds or indirect investment in bond funds, the financial investment business targets of various banks are mainly bonds. Judging from the overall scale and income level, joint-stock banks and city commercial banks are indeed still in the established strategy of strengthening investment business, and this strategy has also achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investment banking business of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks has also improved in the past two years. Take Industrial Bank and Bank of Nanjing as examples. According to the 2022 bond underwriting rankings of the wind database, Industrial Bank ranks 6th with a total underwriting amount of 947.746 billion yuan. The top five are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications. State-owned banks. Bank of Nanjing ranked 14th with 284.505 billion yuan. As of September 27, 2023, the 2023 bond underwriting rankings of the wind database show that Industrial Bank ranked fifth with a total underwriting amount of 798.374 billion yuan, surpassing Bank of Communications. Bank of Nanjing moved up one place to 13th place with a total underwriting amount of 273.62 billion yuan. Therefore, judging from the changes in the amount and ranking of the above two banks, the bond underwriting strength of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks has indeed improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analysis of the bank&#39;s bond underwriting business found that the bank&#39;s investment banking business strategy and credit business strategy are similar, and the overall flow of funds shows the flow of funds to national key areas such as science and technology innovation and green, achieving the effect of investment and loan linkage. Take Industrial Bank as an example. According to the bank&#39;s 2023 interim report, the scale of its underwriting of debt financing instruments for green non-financial enterprises reached 13.72 billion yuan, ranking first among joint-stock banks, and it has launched its first science and technology REITs business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of income, investment business is a more important growth point for various banks. Each bank may achieve the goal of stable balance sheet expansion through the strategy of continuing to increase the proportion of this business. However, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that the above three income indicators are all related to trading financial assets, and the increase in trading financial assets will directly lead to an increase in risk-weighted assets, thereby reducing the core tier one capital adequacy ratio. Therefore, there is limited room to increase income through investment business. And&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314?source=147&amp;amp;source_1=238&quot;>;&lt;u>;&quot;The net profits of 20 banks account for more than 1/3 of A-shares,&quot; Wang&#39;s &quot;Fighting against the Increasing Differentiation of Interest Margin Pressure&quot; also mentioned that &quot;among the joint-stock banks, CITIC, Hua Xia and Zheshang Bank, their core tier one capital adequacy ratios are approaching regulatory red lines.&quot; Therefore, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center suggested that while vigorously developing investment-loan linkage strategies, banks should also pay attention to the tier-1 capital adequacy ratio and avoid blindly expanding their balance sheets, which could lead to regulatory red lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abandon quantitative growth&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Digital transformation&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Transform into quality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;While the linkage effect of investment and lending has emerged, the attitudes of various banks towards financial technology have changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After sorting out the 2023 interim reports, interim results conferences and financial technology job recruitment information of 20 banks, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that in terms of digital transformation strategies, compared with previous years, funding And with the increase in human investment, all industries will pay more attention to quality presentation in 2023. According to China Financial News Network, judging from the recruitment situation in the autumn of 2023, the financial technology positions of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China have experienced a &quot;reduction in recruitment&quot; for the first time. According to data from the 2022 annual reports of the four major state-owned banks, the four banks of &quot;Industry, Agriculture, China, and Construction&quot; each have more than 10,000 technology employees, and the number of employees in financial technology positions has approached &quot;saturation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some banks’ capital investment in the financial technology field is also not as strong as in previous years. Among the 20 banks, only China Merchants Bank and Everbright Bank disclosed information technology investment data in the 2023 interim report, which were 5.206 billion yuan and 2.043 billion yuan respectively, a year-on-year decrease of 2.87% and 4.44%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in terms of quality improvement, various banks have provided many specific cases on the effectiveness of digital transformation. For example, ICBC completed the feasibility assessment of the application of quantum technology in scenarios such as bond investment portfolios and option pricing based on quantum simulators; China Merchants Bank used models to automatically review loans, and &quot;Zhaoqidai&quot; realized the entire process of corporate loans online, and customers The fastest time from application to loan disbursement is 0.5 working days; Ningbo Bank takes advantage of WeChat banking in reaching customers and product promotion, enriching voice, video and other service methods to provide customers with a more efficient and simpler financial service experience business process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can also be found through vertical quantitative comparison that compared with 2022, various banks have achieved more actual results in the field of financial technology and digital transformation. For example, as of the end of June 2023, ICBC has deepened the construction of an enterprise-level corporate digital operation and management platform, and the platform has reached more than 1.6 million customers; China Merchants Bank&#39;s &quot;AI Tips&quot; has served 11.7288 million users, a year-on-year increase of 140.84%; Bank of Beijing The &quot;Intelligent Strategy&quot; retail digital operation system has launched more than 1,200 strategies, reaching more than 170 million customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Through quantitative horizontal comparison, it can be seen that ICBC’s digital transformation and technological capabilities are the best among the 20 banks. In terms of financial technology, as of the end of June 2023, ICBC had 1,878 new public patents, and the cumulative number of patent authorizations was 2,941, ranking first among its peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The effects of technologies in various industries empowering the field of risk control are also more significant than before. Take the digitally empowered inclusive finance risk control system disclosed in ICBC’s 2023 interim report as an example. The report describes in detail the entire process of digital access, intelligent risk control, and online and offline cross-validation. Its non-performing rate has increased year-on-year. The decline also demonstrates the benefits of digital transformation. Among them, &lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314?source=147&amp;amp;source_1=238&quot;>;&lt;u>;&quot;The net profits of 20 banks account for more than 1/3 of A-shares,&quot; &quot;Profit King&quot; Fights Increasing Differentiation Pressure on Interest Margins&quot; &lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>; has stated that &quot;in the first half of 2023, the non-performing loan ratios of 20 banks have almost all declined, and only Ping An Bank&#39;s non-performing loan ratio has increased. 1 BP.&quot; Bank of Beijing, whose non-performing ratio has dropped by 30 BP year-on-year, even emphasized the construction of a unified risk control platform in the digital transformation section of its official report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the above analysis that technology-enabled risk control, mobile banking and technology-enhanced investment strategies have achieved certain results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the road to digital transformation is still long. Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center recently found through actual measurements of different bank counter services and surveys of practitioners in different industries that most bank counter services still take a long time to process. Although robots and intelligent counters are placed at the entrance of every bank, in terms of customer experience, the robots are more like decorations, and the services that the intelligent counters can handle are also quite limited. The business process at the manual counter is quite complicated, and the waiting time for bank staff to operate is also long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that compared to the past, the current application of information technology in online business has been more extensive and is supported by actual data. If banks can increase the application of technology in the field of over-the-counter services, such as moving more over-the-counter services online, it may be able to reduce labor costs to a great extent and improve efficiency at the same time. In fact, some banks are already trying to take this step. Postal Savings Bank disclosed in its 2023 interim report that it is exploring digital operations and innovatively launching a &quot;cloud cabinet&quot; intensive operation model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子相亲后被诬强奸，五年方还清白：强加于己的巨大冤屈如何洗刷？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258513]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a retrial verdict has brought an old news back into public opinion. According to &quot;Dafeng News&quot;, Di, a native of Luannan, Hebei, who had been sentenced to three years in prison for rape, finally waited for a fair verdict from the court on October 10, 2023: The Tangshan Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that &quot;the facts are unclear and the evidence is insufficient.&quot; &quot;The original verdict was revoked and Xiao Di was found not guilty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this case is not complicated. On February 22, 2018, a dating agency in Luannan County introduced a woman to Di. After the two met, &quot;both were quite satisfied.&quot; That night, Di invited the woman and Wang, the owner of the dating agency, to dinner. After dinner, Di drove the woman in question and invited her out to play. They had a &quot;very good chat&quot; and had sex in the car. Afterwards, Di drove the woman back to the dating agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The owner of the dating agency called Di that night and said, &quot;The woman no longer wanted to have sex after having sex&quot; and &quot;asked Di to compensate the woman with tens of thousands of yuan.&quot; In desperation, Di had no choice but to return to the dating agency and work with the boss to find the woman involved to coordinate, but they did not reach an agreement on the &quot;compensation&quot;. On the second day after the incident, Wang took two people to Di&#39;s home and formally made a &quot;compensation request&quot; of 20,000 yuan. Di thought Wang was extorting money and was unwilling to accept it. Wang called the police that day. In the next few days, Di gave Wang several thousand yuan and received the assurance from the other party that &quot;it will be fine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 1, a week after the incident, Di was detained on suspicion of rape and arrested 12 days later. On June 1, 2018, the Luannan County Procuratorate prosecuted Di for rape. On December 29 of the same year, Di was sentenced to three years in prison for rape, and his second-instance appeal was also rejected. During his sentence, Di insisted on not pleading guilty and asked to appeal. He waited until February 28, 2021, to be released after serving his sentence. After being released from prison, Di requested a retrial. After more than two years of judicial proceedings, he finally won a not guilty verdict recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case has been delayed for five years. After many twists and turns, there are still many unanswered questions about the case. A retrial should not be the end of this case. Although the parties involved have been avenged, there are still many aspects of this case that deserve further questioning and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved are suspected of extortion and should be held legally accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you examine the case carefully, it is not difficult to see the absurdity of the &quot;rape&quot; charge. I would like to ask, if &quot;rape&quot; really exists, can &quot;paying 20,000 yuan&quot; be exchanged for not calling the police? How is this different from prostitution? The woman involved “no longer wanted to have sex after having sex.” Could it be that the so-called “consent” could be revoked at any time afterwards? If this is the case, the evidentiary standards for rape cases handled by public prosecutors and prosecutors are too low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the client is not found guilty of rape, the behavior of the dating agency owner is an out-and-out extortion, and there are both completed and attempted circumstances. According to Article 1 of the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Extortion&quot; promulgated by the two high authorities on April 23, 2013, extortion of public and private property worth more than 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan should be deemed as Article 274 of the Criminal Law The specified &quot;amount is relatively large&quot;. According to the standards of Hebei Province&#39;s two highs, the starting point for &quot;larger amounts&quot; is 3,000 yuan. In this case, the successful extortion amount by the owner of the dating agency was &quot;several thousand yuan&quot;, and the attempted extortion amount was 20,000 yuan, which fully meets the standard of &quot;large amount&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved in this case are also suspected of false accusation and frame-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the public opinion offensive of &quot;Internet essays&quot; in recent years, the false accusation method in this case can be described as simple and crude, and the case was reported directly to the public security organ. Judging from the results, the false accusation and frame-up caused the client Di to be imprisoned for three years, and it took a lot of time and energy to get justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of the parties involved in this case is undoubtedly worse than that of those &quot;victims of Internet essays&quot;. Since the false accusation has caused serious consequences for him being wrongly imprisoned, Di has more reason to obtain corresponding judicial relief. Article 243 of the Criminal Law stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution, if the circumstances are serious, shall constitute the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The client’s acquittal is only the starting point for him to seek judicial relief, and should not be the end. Di has the right to file a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting public authority to hold the owner of the dating agency and Wang accountable for criminal liability, and bear the accompanying civil compensation obligations, to relieve the heavy losses he has suffered in the past five years, and to clear up the huge injustice that has been imposed on him. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the dating agency and the woman involved may have serious suspicions of &quot;fairy dancing&quot; and organizing fraud. This is also something that the police should investigate in depth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the dating agency and the woman involved showed a situation of &quot;cooperating with each other and playing tricks skillfully&quot;. The woman&#39;s words and deeds were inconsistent, and the owner of the dating agency acted as a &quot;middleman&quot; to negotiate &quot;compensation&quot; with the client. Combined with the &quot;reverent&quot; attitude of the dating agency owner, this case has been cast into layers of suspicion of fraud. The suspicion that the dating agency owner and the woman involved colluded to commit the crime cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the suspicion of collusion is established, then this case can be called a &quot;dating agency fraud&quot;. The method is more sinister and vicious than the previous marriage agencies that &quot;only seek to make money&quot;, and is more sinister than &quot;conspiracy&quot;. &quot;Property&quot; marriage fraud is more crude and direct. It can be regarded as a &quot;fairy jump fraud&quot; disguised as a matchmaking agency, and is suspected of constituting the crime of fraud. Article 266 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever defrauds public or private property and the amount is relatively large shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or public surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of public interest, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved in this case also deserve to be severely punished by the law. If the result of this case is that one person, Di, is not guilty and the two are not punished, it will be tantamount to institutional incentives for similar acts of extortion, false accusations and frame-ups, leading to a situation where &quot;one will not be held responsible no matter what if the blackmail and false accusations fail.&quot; This situation is obviously not conducive to curbing similar illegal and criminal activities and puts more potential victims at risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, Di, the party involved in this case, certainly has reason to seek state compensation and compensation for the various losses caused by being wrongfully imprisoned. At the same time, he will launch a criminal private prosecution against the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved to pursue their various criminal responsibilities. They are required to fulfill their accompanying civil compensation obligations and seek justice for themselves. It is also necessary for relevant departments to intervene and conduct an in-depth investigation into the suspicion that the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved have committed gang fraud, so as to deter similar people who are lucky enough to get involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[猫狗鸟蛇……每年五十多万只动物命丧公路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/rdNvCtUMWcYoDaCM7cWfhM9jc5aX1oAK7AVNT30h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;870&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/rdNvCtUMWcYoDaCM7cWfhM9jc5aX1 oAK7AVNT30h. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254037&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Roadkilled cat. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the research team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blackbird (dōng), which is black all over and has a yellow beak, is a common bird in the city. It is good at imitating the calls of other birds and likes to move in the woods. Street trees and shrubs on both sides of the road provide ideal habitats for blackbirds, but they also pose fatal risks. Li Zhongqiu, a professor at the School of Life Sciences of Nanjing University, encountered blackbirds that suddenly appeared several times while driving, and almost became a &quot;murderer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Animal-vehicle collisions that result in fatal accidents are known as &quot;road kills.&quot; Nowadays, wheels have replaced shotguns as one of the main threats to animals, whether in inaccessible reserves or traffic-filled cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of animals killed on the roads is unimaginable. A research paper with Li Zhongqiu as the corresponding author was recently published in the academic journal PeerJ: More than 570,000 birds and mammals may be roadkilled in Nanjing every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been few systematic studies on road killing in China before. The study by Li Zhongqiu’s team evaluated the background data of road killing in Nanjing, a large city. &quot;Road killing is a very serious threat, but there is insufficient awareness among both the academic community and the public.&quot; Li Zhongqiu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cats, dogs, blackbirds, and sparrows are at the highest risk&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;my country’s total road mileage has reached 5.28 million kilometers, which can circle the earth more than 100 times. The transportation network extending in all directions has provided convenience for human life, but it has become a natural barrier for many wild animals. Every time you cross the road, it is like experiencing a journey of life and death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Academic research shows that 340 million birds die on the road in the United States every year, about 335,000 hedgehogs die on the road in the United Kingdom every year, and about 9 million large and medium-sized mammals die in traffic accidents in Brazil every year. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu told Southern Weekend reporters that road killing is one of the research contents of the interdisciplinary &quot;road ecology&quot; and there are many academic studies in the United States, Europe and other countries. However, currently, road killing is systematically carried out in China. There are not many studies, and the existing studies are mostly conducted in protected areas and lack analysis of urban environments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2020, Li Zhongqiu’s team has carried out a one-year monitoring of 9 roads in Nanjing. These 9 roads include 3 national roads, 3 provincial roads and 3 county roads. The roadside habitats cover residential areas, farmland, mountains, waters, open lands, forests, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/jHJGDj2QDMJyU4a0y9f3ok1ynq3BEws2c2vzFxAb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height= &quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/jHJGDj2QDMJyU4a0y9f3ok1ynq3BEws2c2vzFxAb.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254036&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A research team observes roadkill in Nanjing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(paper screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every two weeks, the researchers walked the entire route at a speed of no more than 40km/h. Record dead animals found on the road. The total mileage traveled is 5,831 kilometers, which is equivalent to the round-trip distance from Beijing to Urumqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 26 monitoring activities, researchers found a total of 293 roadkill animals. There are 136 mammals among them, the most common ones are cats and dogs, as well as wild mammals such as weasels and hedgehogs, and a kind of reptile - the tiger-spotted snake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are 143 birds, the most common ones being blackbirds and sparrows, which is related to their large population and wide distribution. Other birds include pearl-necked doves, gray magpies, white-headed bulbuls, etc., most of which are common species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;May to July is the peak period for road killings. The number of road killings in these three months accounts for about 1/3 of the whole year. Li Zhongqiu explained that this period is the breeding season for many animals. The baby animals lack survival experience. Adult animals increase the frequency of foraging to raise their children, and the probability of road kill increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locations where road kills occur are closely related to the animals’ habitats. For example, road sections with a high proportion of farmland, forestry and wetland areas have a higher risk of roadkill; the smaller the distance between the road and the river, the higher the risk of roadkill; roadkill is more likely to occur in areas far away from urban main roads ; Compared to curvy roads, the risk of roadkill is higher on straight roads because vehicles travel faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the model, researchers calculated the number of animals that are killed on the road in Nanjing every year - more than 110,000 mammals and more than 450,000 birds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The model is constructed based on the on-site monitoring of the retention time of animal carcasses, the probability of discovery, and the composition of different roads in Nanjing. Since the carcasses of roadkill animals do not remain on the road for too long, the researchers placed frozen chicken heads and frozen whole chickens on multiple road sections to represent small and large animal carcasses respectively, monitored the retention time of the simulated carcasses on the road, and calculated the number of roadkill animals. The probability of detection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/ctOxUfPfW7fH3pxoUlBEeQxIpnJsRrjlm6UaHUNb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height= &quot;203&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/ctOxUfPfW7fH3pxoUlBEeQxIpnJsRrjlm6UaHUNb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254035&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Roadkilled bird. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the research team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Common species also have important value&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to help animals reduce traffic accidents risks of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many protected areas establish ecological corridors for animal migration along transportation routes. For example, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has set up 33 wildlife crossings for sheep migration, benefiting Tibetan antelopes and other wild animals; Hubei Shennongjia National Park has built 25 animal crossings of three types: upper-span type, lower culvert type and gentle slope type. , making it easier for Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys to cross; Yunnan Province&#39;s Si Xiao Expressway has set up bridges and tunnels for Asian elephants, and the utilization rate of 25 wildlife passages by wild Asian elephants reached 72%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ecological corridors can also be established on busy urban highways. For example, in 2020, the Paiya Mountain-Qiniang Mountain Ecological Corridor in Dapeng New District, Shenzhen was completed, connecting the two mountains and spanning the highway. It is the first animal-only overpass in Guangdong Province that was completed and put into use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Dapeng Administration Bureau of the Shenzhen Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2018, Dapeng New District conducted a survey on road deaths of wild animals. In July and August, A total of 383 road kill incidents were recorded, killing more than 40 species, mainly amphibians and reptiles such as black-orbited toads, Hong Kong newts, anoles, etc., with a small number of birds and mammals also recorded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said that ecological corridors not only reconnect fragmented habitats, but also effectively reduce the occurrence of road kills. More than 40 infrared cameras arranged on the ecological corridor bridge have recorded that more than 60 species of animals breed, forage, and move within the ecological corridor. Wild mammals such as ocelots, wild boars, porcupines, and macaques have been recorded. A good animal habitat is formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu believes that whether cities build ecological corridors should focus on cost and local species. There are also some effective methods, such as setting up signboards in roadkill hotspots to remind drivers that animals are often found here, slowing down and observing more road conditions, or setting up speed bumps, building animal fences, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu admitted that the current understanding and research on road killing is still relatively rudimentary, and “it is difficult to assess the impact of road killing on the local ecosystem.” But at least from the data, road killing is The problem deserves more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Li Zhongqiu’s team’s research on road killing is only carried out in Nanjing. He hopes that in the future, the regional scope can be expanded to a national scale to conduct more in-depth research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the animals that encounter roadkill in cities are common species, they still have a unique status in the ecosystem. Li Zhongqiu gave an example. The common bird, the white-headed bulbul, is a bit annoying in daily life - vehicles parked under the camphor trees are often attacked by the bird droppings &quot;bombs&quot; of the white-headed bulbul. But the Bald Bulbul is an important functional bird in the ecosystem, and its excrement can help plant seeds spread several kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We always focus on humans and talk about whether a species is useful to us.” Li Zhongqiu said, “Every species living on the earth has its function and value. The more common it is, the more common it is. The more valuable a species is, we cannot ignore them living around us just because they are common.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙卓、符建涛被拐案宣判：两名被告分别被判刑5年、2年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 13, 2023, the Shenzhen Nanshan District People’s Court prosecuted the defendant Wu Moulong for abducting children and The first-instance public verdict was made in the case of Wu Mouguang&#39;s cover-up.

The wisest response is to make effective choices, stop losses in time and restart your life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Obviously, this setting is somewhat idealized, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Or to put it more crudely: it is the same as the previous two stages of love and marriage dramas. , seems to go deep into the emotional relationship, but in fact it does not give women a restoration that is more in line with the current status quo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Relatively speaking, the British drama &quot;Doctor Foster&quot; with the same theme &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (2015) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; did a good job Better. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3aa4b9ede131829b5343fe60d12aa7cf.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/3aa4b9ede131829b5343fe60d12aa7cf.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253869 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although it is also a story about marriage and infidelity, the content discussed in &quot;Doctor Foster&quot; does not stop at the topic of how the first wife treats her scumbag husband and his mistress. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The whole point of it is to show various views and values ​​on marriage through this&lt;/span>; story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the heroine Gemma represents the kind of person who regards honesty as the highest code of conduct, so after discovering that her husband Simon had cheated, she gave him several opportunities to explain himself, but her husband The final performance broke her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simon&#39;s setting is a bit different from the common image of a scumbag. Although he also cheated on her, he still loved Gemma, both physically and mentally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/949cc880e3657b2e19c5b1a2ebff2f56.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/949cc880e3657b2e19c5b1a2ebff2f56.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253870&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This kind of setting is more complex and full-bodied than domestic marriage dramas. In &quot;Good Things Come in Twos&quot;, the scumbag husband Wei Ming teams up with his first wife Lin Shuang and his mistress Jiang Xi - the former is an unthinking stereotype, and the latter is a crude setting that takes it for granted to cater to feminism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;, Gemma did not rely on anyone. She was calm and composed in the great pain, and she calmly tried to find ways to regain what she had lost. Everything ended in the fact that the mistress was pregnant with her husband&#39;s child in front of her husband, mistress and mistress&#39;s family. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Besides this main line, there are other extramarital affairs patterns in &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;. For example, Simon&#39;s mother never forgave her cheating husband until her death; and Gemma&#39;s neighbor, she felt that as long as her husband didn&#39;t cheat, she could tolerate it, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/72b80b3b55cb2c844358f30f6b7e0e25.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;627&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/72b80b3b55cb2c844358f30f6b7e0e25.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253871 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Different processing methods are presented in the series, which are both natural and restrained, so that it does not stop at one-dimensional crusade against a certain character, but in different situations.

It is this mentality of giving it a try without losing money that makes many Jay Chou&#39;s die-hard fans choose to &quot;grab it on behalf of others&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some media consulted a &quot;scalper&quot; as a consumer, and the other party said that the &quot;snatching&quot; price of Jay Chou&#39;s stands at the Shanghai Stadium is 1,500 yuan, while the ticket price for the stands is 580 yuan-1,280 Prices vary from RMB 2,080 to RMB 2,500 for tickets priced at 2,080 yuan in the infield, and RMB 2,000 for tickets priced at other prices in the infield. It is understood that some are &quot;robbed&quot; manually, while more advanced ones use special software. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity of the so-called &quot;proxy shooting&quot; service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation found that if it is a real &quot;scalper&quot;, then after the customer selects the seat class, he must pay the &quot;scalper&quot; in advance the ticket fee and hundreds or even thousands of yuan in agency fees, and the ticket will be issued by a familiar person. &quot;Scalpers&quot; who follow the rules and use proxy auction software use customers&#39; personal information to grab tickets. If you fail to grab a ticket, the real &quot;scalper&quot; will refund the ticket fee and the auction fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if you encounter fake &quot;scalpers&quot;, customers are likely to suffer heavy losses. Fake &quot;scalpers&quot; do not help purchase tickets, but use various methods such as &quot;upgrading seats&quot; and &quot;increasing the probability&quot; to induce customers to continuously increase service fees, and eventually disappear without a trace, defrauding customers of huge ticket fees and service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, &quot;internal invitation letters/internal tickets&quot; and &quot;bringing in by staff&quot; are also full of doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social platforms, some netizens posted photos of &quot;internal invitations/internal tickets&quot;, but other netizens quickly pointed out: This was a fake invitation modeled after another performance—— Although the ticket looks very similar, the counterfeiter was careless and got the performance venue wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, it is also difficult to fulfill &quot;the staff will lead you into the performance site&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the information transmitted online, some &quot;staff members&quot; claim to be from the &quot;ticketing company&quot;, while others claim to be from the &quot;security company&quot;. Not to mention that their identities cannot be verified.
