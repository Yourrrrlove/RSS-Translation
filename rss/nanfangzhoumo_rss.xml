There are three great creation gods in their folklore. In addition to the Thunder King and the Dragon King, there is also the old man Buluotuo who knows all things. In addition, the worship of nature has also derived many objects that can be sacrificed, such as mountain gods and land gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/1iVkwdpPF7uR7KbJCyujFW4UrAg8u1HXgC9756tT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/1iVkwdpPF7uR7KbJCyujFW4UrAg8u1HXgC9756tT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257434&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Firecracker competition on April 10, 2011, Baiyu Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In order to worship the gods, people gathered together to perform ritual songs and dances. With the development of the times, the original sacrificial singing and dancing gradually turned into a group singing fair activity. During March and April of the lunar calendar, or between August and September, when the weather is suitable in spring and autumn, people put down their farm work and sing in open places. Young men and women use singing to choose their spouses, and middle-aged and elderly people compete with each other and enjoy songs. Everyone and every family can enjoy the song fair, and the large-scale national event has shifted from &quot;entertaining gods&quot; to &quot;entertaining people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GDYjtAsOE2zGApnmHjnfaJ4JE5nRHMctRyY5jdT2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GDYjtAsOE2zGApnmHjnfaJ4JE5nRHMctRyY5jdT2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257436&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stilt walking competition on April 28, 2014, Yiwei Town, Tiandong County, Guangxi &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song fairs are generally popular in Zhuang areas. In 1983, the People&#39;s Government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region made a decision to designate the third day of the third lunar month as the Zhuang Song Festival. However, in Tiandong, Tianyang and other places in Baise City, there were dozens or even hundreds of song fairs a year at their peak. In recent years, due to young people going out to work, the number of song fairs has gradually decreased. In some areas, after the old singers quit, there are no young and middle-aged singers to take over, and the song fairs can only be suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/0FCrEwFra4rmiU3HYTcLRlG1AzO0FG0iiSntiKPu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/0FCrEwFra4rmiU3HYTcLRlG1AzO0FG0iiSntiKPu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wrestling match on Little Tomatoes, April 4, 2017, Baiyu Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to make the song fair continue better in the present? Tiandong County, Baise City, advocates &quot;one town, one section&quot; in 10 towns in the county. This time, the festival shifted from celebrating broad festivals to focusing on its own life. The song fair is not only for singing folk songs, but also for various folk entertainment activities, such as throwing hydrangeas, touching Easter eggs, grabbing fireworks, etc. Competitiveness is secondary, but more importantly, it is interesting and attracts participation. It allows towns and villages to discover their own special activities and stimulates people&#39;s enthusiasm for participation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VthFdlQoy2VQMB9yYQIoHT6aU7PDl1PemJtLI3Hl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VthFdlQoy2VQMB9yYQIoHT6aU7PDl1PemJtLI3Hl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bare-hand corn shucking competition on March 11, 2012, Naman Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yiwei Town is rich in fragrant pigs. Since 2014, the town has held fragrant pig races at the Gewei in the third month of the lunar calendar. The fragrant pig runs in front, and the owner leads it behind with a rope. The pigs just ran, but the people were much more excited. The audience&#39;s shouts and laughter flooded the whole street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tiandong County is the hometown of mangoes in China. Xiangzhou Town, where large-scale mango planting is carried out, came up with a mango-themed competition. Women used spoons to hold the mangoes, transport them back and forth, and first remove all the mangoes in the baskets. The one who reaches the finish line wins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/AiLlc8Dxd1Dsn9JkuwvuFGbBLYfoMQktFnwZB7qu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/AiLlc8Dxd1Dsn9JkuwvuFGbBLYfoMQktFnwZB7qu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257437&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gyro playing competition on March 17, 2014, Lihu Yao Township, Nandan County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some towns use small tomatoes as their main crops and hold tomato picking competitions. The couple picks tomatoes in a relay, and the one with the shortest time wins. The most beautiful scene is the wrestling on Little Tomato. The wrestling pool is filled with small tomatoes, and the wrestlers compete with each other. If they are not careful, they will slip on the small tomatoes and be covered in red juice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QMw69502wrbjPndaL0P4PMLBXEo5BZF2gqd9B7Hj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QMw69502wrbjPndaL0P4PMLBXEo5BZF2gqd9B7Hj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257444&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Nose sticking competition February 8, 2016, Pingma Town, Tiandong County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the transformation of the song fair is the revitalization of rural industries. In the past, there was no industry in the village, and people left their hometowns to work. When song fairs returned along with the industry, young people returned to their hometowns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/SxEUJDkgni4wP7RSZqJbhhSuKLoaDGFs9UHaZaev.jpg&quot;

Zhang Longji, the principal of a primary school in Jingning County, Pingliang City, was shown raping and molesting many students in public. He was executed on November 7. On November 11, local government office staff confirmed to Nandu reporters that this notice was indeed issued by the Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court, which had previously heard the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3b8ad1bc0bbb52159853539a5c14831e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1135&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3b8ad1bc0bbb52159853539a5c14831e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257973&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Court Notice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement of Pingliang Intermediate Court, Zhang Longji, male, Han nationality, was born on February 24, 1979 in Jingning County, Gansu Province, with a university education. From 2010 to June 2019, when he served as the dean, principal and teacher of a primary school in Jingning County, he used corporal punishment and other means to form a mental coercion on primary school students who lacked sexual defense ability. He used opportunities such as explaining exercises and students to hand in homework to He repeatedly raped five young girls aged 8 to 12 in his dormitory, and molested 17 children aged 8 to 14 in public in the classroom or in his dormitory. The Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court found Zhang Longji guilty of rape and sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life; he was found guilty of child molestation and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was punished for several crimes and decided to execute him and be deprived of political rights for life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the verdict of the case was pronounced, Zhang Longji appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Gansu Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court and the original death sentence was upheld, which was approved by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On November 7 this year, Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court followed the execution order issued by the President of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, identified Zhang Longji, took him to the execution ground, and executed him by injection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned that Article 236 of the &quot;Criminal Law&quot; stipulates that anyone who rapes a girl under the age of fourteen shall be treated as rape and shall be severely punished. Anyone who rapes a woman or rapes a young girl with multiple persons, if the circumstances are abominable, or in public in a public place, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years, life imprisonment, or death. On May 25 this year, the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate jointly issued the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Handling of Criminal Cases of Rape and Molestation of Minors&quot;, reaffirming the judicial philosophy of adhering to the word &quot;strict&quot; and severe punishment. The relevant severe and aggravated punishment clauses have been further clarified and refined to ensure that the punishment is suitable for the crime, the punishment is worthy of the crime, and the punishment is sufficient to control the crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一次误杀，引来一次次误杀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new Korean film &quot;Plastic Greenhouse&quot;, in some The plot setting is very reminiscent of Bong Joon Ho&#39;s &quot;Parasite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/8a8a72b85cc0cbc139587fdc901c0d35.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;1282&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/8a8a72b85cc0cbc139587fdc901c0d35.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257924&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;played by Kim Seo-hyung The heroine Wen Jing is a low-level domestic worker who takes care of an elderly couple with limited mobility.

On the contrary, Li Taijiang cares deeply about Wen Jing. No matter in terms of attitude or treatment, no one can find any fault. The same goes for Wen Jing.

Although the old lady often behaves inappropriately towards Wen Jing because of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, she can always repay evil with kindness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Jing accidentally killed the old lady, which was purely accidental. She did not call the police and surrender because she wanted her son to have a complete family after he was released from prison; the reason why she took her mother to the Li family for &quot;parasitism&quot; was not for gain, but because Wen Jing, as a &quot;stupid person&quot;, was the safest thing she could think of.

On the surface, it points to the plastic greenhouse in the wasteland where Wen Jing ended up, but its deeper meaning is a mixture of Wen Jing&#39;s kindness and evil, her tragedy and the death she caused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/fc74edd0909394f1dafc9bf6d83a9c30.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/fc74edd0909394f1dafc9bf6d83a9c30.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257931&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first feature film The curtain is a plastic greenhouse in the dusk, like a huge coffin, making people unable to breathe.

This becomes the question that detective Wu Youzhen keeps searching for in the second half of the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the school where she graduated to the company where she worked, from her native family to the social environment, Wu Youzhen discovered that it was not a certain person who &quot;killed&quot; So Hee, but the entire Korean society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ca121b2f95e1fa4be552b9b0d8e0e08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ca121b2f95e1fa4be552b9b0d8e0e08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Plastic Greenhouse &quot;In &quot;Chun Nan&quot;, a mentally retarded girl was abandoned by her mother since she was a child.

Professor at John&#39;s University, but her family left China shortly after she was born due to changes in the current situation. She later joked that maybe she had been closely associated with the word &quot;revolution&quot; since she was born, so she has been interested in the Chinese revolution throughout her life. &quot;Without the revolution, I would probably have grown up in China. I have always been curious about the Chinese revolution, and wanted to know why the revolution happened and what consequences it would bring to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili also spent his youth in China. She survived the surging global &quot;revolutionary&quot; wave of the left-wing movement, which further strengthened her future academic ambitions. After China&#39;s door opened, she became one of the first foreign scholars allowed to enter China for fieldwork and research. Her research interests mainly focus on modern popular resistance and grassroots politics, spanning the fields of political science and history. She has written Generous and award-winning, the American Historical Review commented that she &quot;combines a social scientist&#39;s love of order with a historian&#39;s eye for great stories.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili has taught at the University of Arizona, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley. Since 1997, he has taught in the Department of Government of Harvard University. In addition to her teaching work, one of Pei Yili&#39;s greatest characteristics lies in her participation in public affairs. She once served as the director of the Fairbank Research Center at Harvard University and the president of the Association for Asian Studies. Since 2008, she has served as the president of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, cultivating a group of outstanding students and scholars for China studies. Our interview took place in the office of the Harvard-Yenching Institute. The office is small, and the black-and-white photos that mark important moments of this academic institution in the past century hung on the wall exude a deep sense of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Since I became president, I have spent half of my time at Harvard-Yenching Institute and the other half as a professor at Harvard.” Pei Yili is still active in teaching, every Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. At 3:30, she is open to students. Each student had to make an appointment with her in advance and explain their questions succinctly. After learning that she had given me more than three hours of interview time, her students all expressed their envy that I had such a &quot;luxury&quot; opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili has a hearty personality and is quick to talk. During the interview, he burst out laughing from time to time. Even if he fell into a gloomy look when recalling the twists and turns of his family&#39;s experiences, he would immediately ignore this emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China has undergone too many changes in the past hundred years. This may be what attracts Pei Yili, a political scientist who studies China. &quot;Studying their successes and failures is exciting and fascinating.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QbYnyZoZXxiMPOUMUeZHcmbriNWr2fsheyj1zA8Q. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QbYnyZoZXxiMPOUMUeZHcmbriNWr2fsheyj1zA8Q.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;257454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pei Yili&#39;s parents&#39; wedding photo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (provided by interviewee/picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Birth under revolutionary fire&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Were you born in China?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;Why were you born in Red China?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the time I was a girl, for a long time, every time I followed the whole family back to the United States, whether at the airport or the dock, Immigration After the officer opened her passport, there was always a conversation like the one above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I would say that when I was born it was not red, just a little pink.” More than half a century later, Pei Yili was sitting in his office at the Harvard-Yenching Institute, recalling the past and couldn’t help but He let out a hearty laugh. Then, her expression became solemn. &quot;Yes, my parents both lived in troubled times in China; without the revolution, I would probably have grown up in China, so our family does have constant ties with China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili was born in a He has a strong religious family, and his parents are both missionaries of the Episcopal Church. Her father, Charles Perry - Pei Yili later learned that his Chinese name was Pan Xuesi - had studied Chinese and Japanese at Harvard University in his early years and had a special liking for East Asia. In 1931, Pan Xuesi traveled across the ocean and arrived in Shanghai to teach at St. John&#39;s University. St. John&#39;s University was founded in 1879, formerly known as St. John&#39;s College. It is sponsored by the Episcopal Church in the United States and is the earliest church university in China. After the September 18th Incident broke out, Pan Xuesi made a special trip to Northeast China. &quot;He also wrote a very interesting diary about his travel experience in Manchuria. He was very interested in this period of history.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Pan Xuesi met his future wife Kai Rui (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Note: the Chinese name is Kong Kaili&lt;/span>;) in China. Both later taught at St. John&#39;s University.

Because Pan Xuesi has been interested in Japanese culture for a long time, he chose to go to Japan for his honeymoon. &quot;When they were on their honeymoon, they heard the news about Japan&#39;s invasion of China, but they didn&#39;t dare to confirm it, so they went to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to ask whether the rumors were true. The embassy staff may not want to take responsibility and did not tell them the truth. They just said : No, there is no problem in China now. You can go back to China! So they boarded the ship from Nagasaki back to Shanghai as originally planned.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili said that his father liked water sports when he was young and was very fond of boats. The performance is very clear. Not long after their ship left Japanese port, my father became acutely aware that something was not quite right. He said to his wife: &quot;Strange, why is the waterline of the ship so low?&quot; He ran to the bottom to find out what was going on, and found that the bottom was full of Japanese soldiers with live ammunition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the soldiers Pei Yili&#39;s parents met back then were the regiments that had been reinforced from Japan after the Battle of Songhu began - they inadvertently became witnesses of history.这些与他们同船的士兵一到上海就投入到侵华战争中，成为残暴机器中的一环。而等待这对蜜月旅行归来的年轻夫妻的，是被战火燃烧的上海。 “母亲后来回忆，当船进入上海时，她已经闻到那种到处都是死人的味道，这是她从未经历过的……”父母回到他们在圣约翰大学的居所，发现他们结婚的小教堂已经被日军袭击，家里也被洗劫，所有的结婚礼物全部都日本士兵偷走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迫于时局，母亲带着出生不久的儿子离开上海回到美国暂避一段时间，父亲则选择留守在圣约翰大学。 1941年“珍珠港事件”爆发，日军进占租界，上海全面沦陷。圣约翰大学的外籍教师除了已经回国的，其余都被关进集中营，其中就有裴宜理的父亲。直到两年后美日政府交换在押人员，他才被释放回美国。祖母到纽约港口接他时，已经认不出瘦骨嶙峋的儿子。但是没过多久，潘学思希望能再次回到中国。 “在美国海军的帮助下，他如愿回到中国，帮助国民政府一起对抗日本人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1945年，二战结束，母亲也回到中国。对这个家庭来说，这是他们在中国一段短暂的安宁时光——1948年9月，出生在上海的裴宜理便是这段生活的结晶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1949年，中共革命已到决定性时刻，“母亲带着我和两个哥哥先离开了中国，而父亲再一次想留下来。”几个月后，局势更加动荡。潘学思无奈之下告别了他断断续续生活了18年的国家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到美国后，潘学思回到他曾经就读的大学教了几年书，但遥远的东方一直是他念念不忘的地方。 1951年，他们举家搬到东京，潘学思在圣公会创办的日本立教大学教书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1959年感恩节的晚上，全家人正围坐在一起吃饭，庆祝美国的传统节日。突然，他们听到院子里的狗不断地叫。父亲出去查看，没想到一场意外不期而至。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“两个年轻的日本学生喝醉了闯进来，他们都练过空手道……只用了几分钟，就把我父亲打死了……并不是有计划来袭击我父亲的，他们当时完全处于醉酒状态，也不知道我父亲是谁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位一生对东方抱有浓厚兴趣和关切的美国人，就这样以悲痛的方式结束了他的一生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲死后，母亲用她对世界的理解来处理这桩悲剧——尽管她的处理方式或许不能被大多数人理解：她非但没有要求重判那两个日本学生，反而为他们求情。结果是，其中一个被释放，另一个被判刑，而在他服刑期间，母亲不但经常去探望，还去法院为他争取减刑，那个年轻人只关了两三年就恢复了自由。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;母亲带着全家又在日本生活了几年，直到1962年返回美国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/5p8loEN1xkHBDkKV03QuMmhVUAu8H61h4WBf7px0.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1981年，裴宜理在松江与受访者合影&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;政治初意识&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;民众抗议活动，是她后来的学术兴趣及学术方向之一。而她对此最初的感性认识，即来自于早期的日本经历。上世纪50年代初期，每逢“五一劳动节”，日本共产党和日本社会党都会组织劳工抗议活动。那一天，裴宜理的父亲正巧经过，抗议者见到这位美国人，开始敲他的车窗玻璃，汽车被人群团团围住……父亲回家后，家人发现车窗玻璃几乎全部碎掉，而震惊中的父亲几乎在发抖。平静下来后，父亲尝试着向女儿解释什么是“五一劳动节”、那些人在抗议什么……这让小小的裴宜理对民众抗议这种形式产生了浓厚的兴趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1960年6月11日，近600万日本人走上街头抗议新版日美安保条约，美国驻日本大使馆附近被近20万日本抗议群众包围。在这庞大的抗议人群里，就有12岁的裴宜理。她特地逃学，走上街头，参加到反对日美安保条约的游行队伍里。在裴宜理的理解中，这个活动的实质并非“反美”而是支持和平，“人们似乎很高兴有一个美国小孩子参加。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从某种意义上说，这是她第一次参加“群众运动”，也是她第一次体会到群众运动的力量——时任美驻日大使哈格蒂乘坐的防弹轿车也被示威群众包围，大使本人不得不从后门溜进大使馆；预定6月19日访问日本的艾森豪威尔，不得不无限期推迟访问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孩童时期的裴宜理也好奇地观察到，在一些抗议活动中，民众的表达方式与庆祝宗教节日的仪式有很多非常相似的地方。比如，在日本的宗教节日中——与中国类似，人们会抬着轿子参加游行，轿子里坐着一个神，然后以一种蛇舞的形式到处走动。 “我很喜欢这种仪式，所以我经常参加我们附近的日本民间节日。我对日本的政治抗议感兴趣的部分原因也来自这种民间仪式。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个早期经验，后来变成她观察政治活动的一个独特视角。比如，她在对中国革命发源地之一江西安源的调查中就发现，李立三是如何智慧地利用传统的手法，来达到动员工人参加革命的目的：在五月一日国际劳动节这一天，李立三组织了一场工人游行。 “游行队伍当中，有一个八人抬的大轿子，一般来说，地方上的这种庆典，轿子上抬的都是土地神等一些民间宗教中的神，但是这一次，轿子里面是一尊马克思像。”这个细节就被裴宜理用来解剖国家政治动员与传统文化之间的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1965年，16岁的裴宜理进入威廉·史密斯学院（William Smith College）就读。她迅速置身于另一个汹涌澎湃的政治环境中。裴宜理后来自己总结说：“虽然我对民众抗议的直觉兴趣来自于日本的经历，但我的左翼思想更多地来自于大学时代。”她在大学里非常活跃，参加过帆船俱乐部、戏剧俱乐部、政治俱乐部……但“政治”是她更持久的兴趣和更投入的关怀。她还记得和大学同学们一起搭乘巴士去华盛顿，在五角大楼前参加抗议越战的游行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也是在这段时间，她与她出生的中国之间那种看似微弱的联系，又以某种方式变得强烈起来。威廉·史密斯学院规模不大，但有一个“毛泽东思想学习小组”，裴宜理是其中一员，她和同学们一道学习毛泽东思想，对中国政治产生了浓厚的兴趣。不久，她开始下决心学习中文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但她所在的大学没有中文课，她只能借助图书馆的录音机和几盘磁带开始自学中文。她问学校，是否可以凭借自修中文而获得学分。学校回答：我们没有中文课，怎么评估你的学习程度从而给你学分？裴宜理不甘轻易放弃，跟校方提出：“如果我自学到一定程度，我可以找康奈尔的一位教授来测试我。如果通过，我可以得到学分吗？”学校只好同意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裴宜理后来联系上了康奈尔大学的一位教授，对方说：你先通过磁带和语言书自学三个月，然后到康奈尔来接受我的测试。三个月后，裴宜理顺利通过了考试。有意思的是，她后来到台北学过一段时间的中文，台北的中文老师是在北京长大的，她很奇怪这位美国学生的口音，有一次忍不住问：“你的口音是从哪儿来的？你在美国的老师是东北人吗？”“我否认，我想说我的老师是&#39;录音机&#39;不是东北人，但那时我不知道怎么说&#39;录音机&#39;这个词！”回忆此事，裴宜理乐不可支。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“裴宜理”这个中文名字就是在台北学习时取的。很久以后，有一次她查看父亲的书，看到上面的中文图章，才发现父亲的中文名字是“潘学思”。 “所以我应该姓潘而不是裴”，说起这件事，裴宜理流露出一丝遗憾之情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WA5K5OwMwAXvSYgB2p4r65LJ0k64mD4kkdoi24OA.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;追寻中国革命的起源&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在密歇根大学攻读政治学博士学位时，裴宜理最初的想法是把中国的“文化大革命”作为博士论文题目，但遭到一位指导教授的反对。老师认为时机尚不成熟。她转而下决心用与当时流行观点不同的视角和方法，去探索中国革命的起源问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如何理解农民革命，这是一个被许多关注农民问题的各科学者所忽略的问题。”她解释自己的研究动机时说，“农民以革命的面目登上世界历史舞台这一事实，推动了许多试图解释农民叛乱原因的社会科学理论的发展。人类学家、历史学家、社会学家和政治学家都对这个重要问题提出了他们各自的答案。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此时的裴宜理已经流露了自己的“学术野心”：她决定通过对一个地区的研究来考察造反者与革命者之间的关系。这一计划必须集中在一个地区，这个地区必须既有农民造反的传统，又是1949年前共产党的基地。她把这个地区选在淮北。淮北还曾是著名的白莲教活动中心，这一松散的民间宗教组织曾在该地区发动过多次叛乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时中国的大门仍是紧锁的，像其他学者一样，她当时的选择是赴台北故宫博物院看档案，期间也穿插着去日本，在东京的图书馆做资料收集工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我当时是那么年轻而天真，完全不知道这个选题的难度——不然我绝不会蠢到选择这个方向做论文。”又是一阵爽朗的大笑。虽然她幸运地得到很多人的帮助，包括同在那里做研究的几位美国历史学家给了她很多建议，密歇根大学另一位研究中国历史的著名学者费维恺（Albert Feuerwerker）教授也细心地告诉她明清各种档案的位置，但是，“我完全不知道关于这个问题的原始资料是如此分散，它们的类型如此不同。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个障碍是语言。虽然读研究生的时候，她系统学习了两年的中文，包括文言文，但她从来没有像那几位来自美国的历史学家那样，接受过专门的阅读清代文献的训练。所以当她第一次在台北故宫博物院看到清朝档案的时候，几乎被绝望的心情击垮：“我永远无法读懂这些档案！”导师在回信里以不容退缩的口气说：“你得完全做原始档案的研究，而且得看所有的东西。”裴宜理也知道，导师不懂文言文，对阅读梳理明清档案的难度毫无概念，但她还是听从了他的建议。这下没了退路。她发现真正投入进去后，竟然完全有能力阅读那些档案。 “我们当年在台北几乎可以看到你所知道的所有原始档案。比如，你可以拿着两广总督给咸丰写的奏折，上面有咸丰皇帝的批示&#39;知道了&#39;。当你有这种感受的时候，档案内容再晦涩也无关紧要了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;靠着扎扎实实的工作，裴宜理完成了她的博士论文。 1980年，以论文为基础的专著《华北的叛乱者与革命者》在斯坦福大学出版。这部专著被视为海外中国研究第三代学者的代表作。裴宜理将自己的第一本书献给父母，“没有他们，我就不会从事中国研究。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XDBAeBrYfBKDdVmYZ9OQbRemzezD2UyCKWonhdJJ.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;重返中国&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“你是在中国出生的？”每次回到美国，入关时的盘问一度让裴宜理感觉自己是一个“二等美国人”。这个场景直到1972年——也就是尼克松总统访华那年——之后才发生了突变。裴宜理记得非常清楚，那一年她从日本旅行回来，入关美国时，像往常一样，移民局官员打开护照，不出意料地问了这一句，裴宜理照例予以肯定的回答。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我在等待下一个问题：&#39;你为什么出生在红色中国？但没想到，这一次对方的反应是：&#39;噢，真了不起！那你会说中文吗？&#39;我说：&#39;是的，我会说一点。&#39;他说：&#39;我们国家需要你这样的人。&#39;那是我第一次为我出生于中国这件事感到高兴。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美关系解冻后，美中关系协会全国委员会（National Committee on Us-China Relations）开始陆陆续续派代表团访问中国，每个团都挑选一位研究中国的学者陪同，以帮助成员们理解中国。 1979年6月，裴宜理被选中参加美国的大城市市长代表团，访问上海、北京、南京、广州和杭州等城市，亲眼看到了长城、故宫、西湖……她兴奋无比。 “我每天早早起床，去公园和当地老百姓交谈，我很喜欢这种感觉，”但另一方面，她又觉得她所看到的中国，不是之前充满革命浪漫想象的那个中国。裴宜理还去上海找到了他们当年在圣约翰大学的老房子，拍了很多校园的照片，带回美国给母亲看。不出意外，母亲在格外震惊之余也格外伤心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几个月后，裴宜理再次来到中国，这一次她的身份是访问学者，获得了在华学习一年的机会——她也是第一批被允许进入中国进行田野调查研究的外国学者之一，与她同时来中国的学者还有周锡瑞和黄宗智，后来都成为海外中国研究的中坚力量。她也经历了计划经济下的“票证年代”，“我们互相之间以同志相称，还在学术问题、政治问题的争论中经常引用毛主席语录。”但在革命热潮的背后，她渐渐发现了另一个侧面。比如，作为外国人，她可以坐软卧，普通中国人享受不到；对外营业的餐馆非常少，但像她这样的“访问学者”可以在餐馆的特别区域享受“特供”，普通中国人享受不到，也支付不起。 1980年春天，在南京大学蔡少卿教授的陪同下，裴宜理第一次去安徽调查，在涡阳与蒙城的实地探访，让她对中国农村的真实生活有了更为切身的感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一年，裴宜理来上海开会时遇到了时任上海社科院院长张仲礼——张早年毕业于圣约翰大学，碰巧是她父亲当年的学生。见面后，他们互相介绍自己正在进行的工作。听到裴宜理下一本书的工作计划之后，张仲礼打趣说：“你是上海人——我很多年前就看到你爸爸在校园里抱着你的样子。为什么不写上海的故事？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在张仲礼的建议下，自1990年代起，裴宜理的研究目光从遥远的淮北农村转向世界大都会上海，研究重点也从农民革命问题研究变为工人运动研究。她完成了专著《上海罢工：中国工人政治研究》，在这本书里，她也用不少笔墨写了杜月笙、黄金荣这些我们并不陌生的人物，挖掘了他们在工人运动中所扮演的一些真实的角色。这本书获得了1993年美国历史学会费正清奖。 《美国历史评论》评价她兼具“社会科学家对秩序的热爱”与“历史学家捕捉精彩故事的眼睛”。在写这本书时，裴宜理对涉及的劳工阶层做了详尽的调查和分析，其中也包括英美烟草公司。快要结束这本书时，她突然意识到，英美烟草公司在浦东的工厂，就是父亲当年被关押的集中营。 “我没想到，我所研究的对象在某种程度上与我自己家族的历史有非常密切的联系。所以我后来在《上海罢工》英文版序言里的第一句话写道：&#39;对我来说，写作本书有一种回家的感觉。&#39;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nmo7yEYcHen9ErQmaxrlIictm9QBHdxe28utFf3H.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nmo7yEYcHen9ErQmaxrlIictm9QBHdxe28utFf3H.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;实际上，无论是早期对农民革命的兴趣，还是后来转向对城市工人运动的研究，那些改变了无数人命运的革命，始终是裴宜理关注的大问题。著名历史学家周锡瑞在接受采访时，提过这样一个细节：2007年，裴宜理当选亚洲研究学会主席发表演讲时说，“我们不能忘记中国革命，不能忘记这些大题目，不能忘记如何来理解中国这个大转变到底是怎么发生的。”周锡瑞后来将自己的一本专著送给裴宜理，请她提意见。裴宜理回信给他，再一次说：“我们应该多思考中国的大问题。”——这其实既是裴宜理对同时代做中国研究的学者的期待，也是她对自己时时刻刻的告诫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了学术研究，裴宜理还积极参与公共事务和社会活动。 1999年，到哈佛大学不久，裴宜理即出任海外中国学研究重镇费正清中国研究中心（Fairbank Center for China Studies）的主任。在她名字之前，是费正清、史华慈、孔飞力、傅高义等一系列著名学者；自2008年起，裴宜理又成为另一个分量颇重的学术机构的掌门人——哈佛燕京学社社长。作为最著名的中西学术交流机构之一，哈佛燕京自1928年创立以来已经历了七任社长，从叶理绥、赖肖尔到杜维明等，每一任都是德高望重的学者。裴宜理在学界的地位和影响力可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裴宜理的研究重点是“中国革命”，这在西方的中国研究学界也许有点“非主流”。所以她当选后面对记者的采访，也有感而发：“在很长一段时间里，美国专门研究中国革命的只有区区十几人。这几年，研究中国革命的人又多了起来，毛泽东、&#39;大跃进&#39;、&#39;文革&#39;、抗日战争……都成了热门。”她打趣说：“否则，像我这种研究冷僻课题的家伙估计成不了哈佛燕京的新社长！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美大门打开、中国重新融入世界大家庭之后，商业和经济上的复兴与繁荣或许是最显性最直接的成果。但裴宜理感受更多的，是它在知识与学术交流上产生的巨大意义。过去的一个多世纪，从大清帝国时期到中华民国时期、再进入中华人民共和国，这块土地上发生了太多太大的变化，这或许正是吸引裴宜理研究中国的地方，“它们是如此复杂，又是如此迷人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[陕西回应强砍国槐树事件：属违规占用永久基本农田]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260438]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 19:24:52&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;针对网传“陕西丹凤县强砍3万多棵国槐树”一事，当地已成立由县农业农村局、县资源局、县林业局等单位组成的调查组实地调查。丹凤县有关部门11月11日发布调查结果如下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经查，反映问题地点位于丹凤县蔡川镇太子庙村。 2023年7月3日，蔡川镇接到丹凤县田长办《永久基本农田疑似图斑问题整改交办单》，反馈太子庙村3个卫星图斑疑似违法占用永久基本农田，要求限期整改。经实地调查，反馈图斑涉及的耕地上栽种有核桃树、国槐，确属违规占用永久基本农田。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接到整改通知后，镇村工作人员多次向涉及群众宣讲耕地保护政策，动员配合支持耕地保护工作，并根据《土地管理法》《基本农田保护条例》法律法规，当场下发限期整改通知书，其中3名群众拒绝限期整改。随后，镇村干部多次到地块实地查看，帮助对接销售，减少群众损失，但因其栽种苗木密度过大，且大面积形成干腐病，无企业采购。之后，镇村干部多次上门沟通未果，上述3名群众拒绝限期整改。 11月2日，蔡川镇政府会同县农业执法大队，对在永久基本农田上违规种植的核桃树、国槐苗木进行清除复耕。因在涉及地块上种植苗木属违法违规占用永久基本农田，不涉及赔偿事项。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2014年，知名电视人王小棣联合蔡明亮、陈玉勋、瞿友宁在内的8名导演成立公司，发起了“植剧场”与“QPlace”计划，意在打造平台，“给予有想法的编剧、演员、导演与后制人员一个得以滋养与发挥的空间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“植剧场”主要分为爱情成长、惊悚推理、恐怖灵异、戏剧改编四个板块，《恋爱沙尘暴》《荼靡》《天黑请闭眼》《花甲男孩转大人》等剧集打响了台剧革新的第一枪。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;外卷：流媒体平台的业务拓展&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;本土发力形成了良性竞争，而向外的业务拓展为则台剧带来了新动能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，HBO、Netflix、Disney等均大力拓荒海外业务，台湾成为了合拍华语剧的首选地区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外国流媒体带来的是工业化拍摄模式，快节奏、短剧集、前两集高投资吸引人的美剧风吹到了台湾。用制片人刘瑜萱的话来讲，和成熟的工业模式相比，之前拍剧的方式无异于“土法炼钢”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HBO是首个在台湾吃螃蟹的流媒体。 2017年它与公视合作了《通灵少女》，这部融合奇幻灵异和少女成长元素的剧集创下了收视奇迹。 2019年双方再度联手，打造扎根现实主义的《我们与恶的距离》，这部从不同立场讨论无差别杀人案的剧集成为了年度爆款。 2020年，底层平民题材的剧集《做工的人》再度掀起热潮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/c1cbbc89cd33f8cfc37e9d9dfa82c785.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;Netflix于2018年推出《你的孩子不是你的孩子》，对东亚教育问题的深入探讨在播出后引发广泛共鸣。 2019年的《罪梦者》、2020年的《谁是被害者》和2023年的《模仿犯》则主打大尺度悬疑，剧集品质不是一流，但热度与话题度齐飞。 2021-2022年的《华灯初上》较好地完成了群像塑造，复古的年代质感和厚重的人生悲剧使其不同于普通奇情剧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ab84f678d8ad4eaa60683992f4a3587a.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;FOX提供技术支持的《想见你》是近年来的现象级爆剧，且长尾效应显著，不仅让许光汉跻身一线，还衍生了同名电影。倘若拆解来看，它是在校园台偶剧的基础上做了加法，丝滑地融合了平行时空的奇幻元素，给人耳目一新之感。当然，看到最后，莫比乌斯环一般的叙事线索已经不重要，其底牌仍是擅长以细腻感情动人的本土优势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3555ee32ddb4ce49a0018ec6cd3a0c58.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;外国流媒体在题材选择上偏向于类型融合，有时会有堆砌热门元素之感，如集悬疑、犯罪、灵异于一体的《罪梦者》不乏网络热传的高光桥段，但整部剧看下来劳累且混乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/616c2deebca29768dc10519ee6e576f6.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;筹备阶段往往是大数据为主导，所以有自以为踩中high点实则不然的黑帮梦幻偶像剧《极道千金》、中西灵异混搭剧《彼岸之嫁》、黑暗悬疑邪教家庭剧《谁在你身边》等不太成功的尝试。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/e56bf0fe61d21154e84e13e494dd430e.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;观察合拍剧的爆款不难发现：它们皆是较凸显在地元素的剧集，如《我们与恶的距离》改编自台湾社会真实案件，《华灯初上》则触及了日殖时期以后台湾特殊的条通文化。如何在中西文化交手时尽可能地发挥所长，是参与合拍的台湾电视人需考虑的重点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ab1939a869b6f7561f2e39b29513e610.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;腾讯WeTV推出的《永远的第一名》《第二名的逆袭》是同性题材的标杆。姜瑞智与林子闳等年轻艺人也因此获得了极大关注度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爱奇艺国际站涉及的类型更多，既有禁忌师生恋题材的《第九节课》，揭露暗网的悬疑犯罪剧《逆局》，还有凸显兄弟CP的灵异奇幻都市剧《不良执念清除师》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;剧集热播后，老牌男神周渝民再度翻红，新晋小生曾敬骅、陈昊森在《刻在你心底的名字》后各自拥有了代表作。 &lt;/p>;

In order to learn how to use it skillfully, she specially asked a friend to teach her online, wrote her first tweet, and left an anxious message to the producer&#39;s account: &quot;I seem to have #(marked) the wrong content, why is it different from yours?&quot; ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; is Liu Jiayin&#39;s third feature film, but she said, &quot;To a certain extent, this is my debut film.&quot; This film is her first time working with professional actors and a filming team, which requires a lot of communication work. The introverted Liu Jiayin needs to take a brand new step. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/JOgJRXabKSXRlbZ1QshfSkuDgbg7YvsEQMbBRIbh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/JOgJRXabKSXRlbZ1QshfSkuDgbg7YvsEQMbBRIbh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257870&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2023, director Liu Jiayin released her new feature film &quot;Worth It&quot; after a lapse of fourteen years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiayin is a teacher in the Literature Department of Beijing Film Academy. In her 17 years of teaching, she has often been criticized by her colleagues. Ask the same question as the students: &quot;When will you make a movie again?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, Liu Jiayin can be regarded as famous at a young age. In her first year of graduate school, at just 24 years old, she made her debut with the feature film &quot;Cowhide&quot; shot on DV. &quot;Won an important award in the Youth Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival. At the age of 28, she was shortlisted for the Cannes Film Festival Directors&#39; Fortnight for &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; and became a young director of great concern to the international film community. But for the next fourteen years, due to various reasons, she had no new films released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People around me are asking why I stopped filming? The motivation brought by pressure is huge.&quot; Liu Jiayin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first two movies, Liu Jiayin took care of almost all the affairs of the crew by herself. She was the director, screenwriter and photographer, as well as the producer and starring role. &quot;It was the era of DV, and I am particularly grateful to this period. I was definitely a beneficiary of it. This equipment was very suitable for my personality of &#39;working alone&#39;.&quot; Liu Jiayin recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Liu Jiayin began to officially write the script of &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot;. The final version was more than 60,000 words long, which is more than twice the length of ordinary scripts. Liu Jiayin also wrote a novel of more than 100,000 words for the characters in the script, describing the life of the novel&#39;s protagonist Wen Shan in more detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original title of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; was &quot;Listening&quot;, not only because Wen Shan&#39;s work in the film requires listening to complete, but also because of Liu Jiayin&#39;s insights in life, &quot;Listening is not hearing. It’s about understanding the other person and learning to think from the other person’s perspective.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Shan, the protagonist of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, is a frustrated screenwriter. He gave up his original profession because he couldn&#39;t write the stories that Party A needed, and accidentally became a eulogy writer. . This new career requires him to learn to listen to other people&#39;s stories and restore the emotions of the deceased to the deceased, and his own life has also turned around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time he receives an order, Wenshan will visit the relatives and friends of the deceased and take a lot of notes to learn as much as possible about the deceased. He interviewed his sister who felt sorry for her brother who always acted as a &quot;good guy&quot; and could not let go of him until his death; he met a son who was busy with work and neglected to communicate with his old father when he was still alive, so he could only regret it for the rest of his life; he also got to know the man who had traveled thousands of miles from Gansu to A persistent girl in Beijing who explores the true state of deceased netizens... Among Wenshan&#39;s many clients, there is also Aunt Fang, a cancer patient who booked a eulogy for herself early. After learning that she had cancer, she chose to actively &quot;fight towards death&quot; born&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this job, Wenshan healed his clients and himself. Starring Hu Ge told Southern Weekend reporters that Wen Shan&#39;s work is to influence others, &quot;nourishing the living with the dead&quot; and allowing the living to feel the meaning of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, Wenshan finally had the courage to face his past failures, and he could face the script that he could not finish no matter what, and write characters he believed in. &quot;The most important thing is that life recognizes Wen Shan.&quot; Liu Jiayin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival awarded the Best Director Award to Liu Jiayin, and she was once again recognized by the Class A film festival. In September, &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; was officially released, which was Liu Jiayin&#39;s first movie to be released in public. After the movie was released, her Weibo really played a &quot;listening&quot; role. She received hundreds of private messages from viewers.

Your story allows us to see ourselves.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A young girl shared the story of her mother who died after eight years of suffering from cancer. &quot;It would be great if my mother could leave the traces of her short life on paper.

These stories flew into Liu Jiayin&#39;s mailbox one after another, and she would Try to reply one by one during work breaks. &quot;These strangers gave me a lot of encouragement.

I was using a DV player. At that time, there were still many doubts about using such a special method to shoot movies. So I chose not to listen, thinking that I could just make it myself.

Listening is not about hearing, but about truly understanding the other person. Not only have I been misunderstood by others in my life, but I have also misunderstood others.

The character didn&#39;t have a name at the time, but I felt that he often appeared in my life, even in my room, and I would always think of him, so I gave him a name and determined to write his story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your previous two movies are very close to your own life Yes, you and your family are directly on the scene. &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot; is a completely fictional film.

This process is not particularly easy for me, especially since I am very bad at interacting with people. Every time I open the door to meet new students in the new semester, I need to do some mental construction. But what I teach is how to write stories. You must know why students write such things. You can&#39;t just say whether it is good or not. You need to understand them through stories.

It mainly comes from daily observation of life and the screenwriter’s skills. A screenwriter should write in a way that makes people believe. In fact, I don’t have any creative skills, I just live seriously. The client&#39;s story is different in age, relationship with deceased relatives and friends, and understanding of emotions. It is similar to the situations we encounter in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wen Shan can’t be a good screenwriter, what do you think?

I think Wen Shan encountered too many rejections in his previous work as a screenwriter. He was thought that the things he wrote were too ordinary, not enough for this, not enough for that. In short, the characters he wrote were &quot;not worthy&quot; of being the protagonists. After Wen Shan was denied again and again, he gradually began to doubt himself. Especially when you still can&#39;t pay the rent a few years after graduation and have to ask your parents for rent, it&#39;s a very difficult feeling. This sense of failure not only denies work, but also denies values. Do you think, &quot;Is the way I look at life wrong?&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Wenshan has not tried to defend himself, but his voice is too soft. In this case, a person&#39;s personality will also change. But to a certain extent, a screenwriter who fails to defend his story is failing to defend himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think life finally recognized Wen Shan?

We can be affected by some small things, and we can also establish real connections with other people. These people are either very dramatic people in the script, or ordinary people who are inconspicuous, but they are very important to the people around them and are important to them.

He realized that his feelings and things he did were important. This may also be the reason why many viewers left me messages saying they saw themselves in the movie.

My curiosity drove me to get closer. I pitched and chatted with them. They are freshmen from the School of Foreign Languages. They are not only classmates, but also fellow Zhanjiang fellows. It happened that there were no classes or homework on Friday afternoon, so we were bored, so we met to play basketball. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Men and women are clearly differentiated&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As I walked, I asked how many people were in their class. They told me that there were 34 girls and 5 boys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why didn&#39;t you think about asking the female classmates in the class to go out for fun?&quot; I asked casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were quite surprised by my suggestion: &quot;Teacher, I don&#39;t know any of the girls in the class.&quot; &quot;Teacher, I know two girls in our class, but they asked me to date them. This is absolutely impossible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are 34 girls, how many people have you added to WeChat?&quot; I continued to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I added 5 people, but I don’t have much contact with them.” Classmate A said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Three, and they are all cadres in the class, but I only contact them when something happens.&quot; Classmate B replied to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You are a freshman now. You should have a lot of courses, and there should be many opportunities to take classes together.&quot; I continued to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes, we have classes together almost every day. The problem is that although we are in the same classroom, boys sit with boys and girls sit with girls. In class, they mainly listen to the teacher&#39;s lectures; after class, they disperse separately. , there is little communication and interaction with each other.&quot; Student A said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Both boys and girls, everyone deliberately keeps their distance. Everyone agrees that as soon as they enter the classroom, boys and girls will sit separately.&quot; Classmate B added. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, college students should have relatively free control of their time. Their physical and mental development has matured, and their need for interaction with the opposite sex is relatively strong. It is normal for them to date and become friends with the opposite sex, but the reality is not in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although classmates in the same class can meet every day and have many contact opportunities, having contact opportunities does not necessarily mean that substantial familiarity, understanding and understanding will occur in real life. Where is &quot;Geng&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing the confusion on my face, classmate B told me the whole story, &quot;Teacher, have you heard of some hot words on the Internet, such as &#39;licking the dog&#39;, &#39;lowering the head&#39; and &#39;Pu Xin&#39;?&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After his explanation, I realized that among boys and girls, the one who takes the initiative to add the other party’s WeChat account or asks for the other party’s contact information will be considered by a small number of members of the opposite sex to be a “dog licker” and a “lower” person. This situation is relatively common for boys who take the initiative. In other words, when a boy takes the initiative to add a friend to a girl he is interested in or finds interesting, some girls will think this is a strange thing and ask, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; &quot;What are your intentions?&quot; &quot;Do you want to pursue her?&quot; Me?&quot; If the boy is not the right person for the girl, the girl will think that the boy is &quot;general trustworthy&quot;, which means &quot;ordinary but confident&quot;. The problem is that some girls may not think this way, but in order to avoid girls thinking this way, boys do not want to be misunderstood and bear the stigmatized label of &quot;normal men&quot;, so they would rather or simply not be active or take the initiative to avoid embarrassment, even in the face of The girl you are most attracted to or the girl you like the most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Does the teacher know about the &#39;campus wall&#39;?&quot; Classmate A asked me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course I don’t know. He explained to me this way: &quot;It is a public platform for students to publish information. It seems that every university has it. For example, once I join someone else and I am rejected, they will remove me. If I post screenshots of others on the &#39;campus wall&#39;, then all the students in the school will know about me, and I will be polite and sweep the floor in school, unable to hold my head up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can&#39;t control the other person&#39;s thinking, thoughts and actions. , I am even more unable to face and avoid this kind of risk, so I will not take the initiative to get close to the opposite sex.&quot; Classmate B said helplessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Invisible Wall&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This reminds me of: A year ago, I played ball with several boys from my senior graduating class. They told me that after four years, they could not recognize any of them. Students in the same class may not be able to name their classmates. In their eyes, students of the opposite sex in the same class or major are just &quot;classmates&quot; rather than &quot;friends&quot;, &quot;close friends&quot; or &quot;besties&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to my observation, a basic feeling is that the current friendship or friendship between college students in the same major or class, especially between people of the opposite sex, is very weak. They are either busy or idle, and they are busy. Even if they may have a crush on a classmate of the opposite sex, they will never take the initiative or actively express their needs or wishes to make friends or interact with each other. In other words, after entering college, an &quot;invisible heart wall&quot; suddenly appears between boys and girls. This wall imprisons boys and girls, and no one wants to take the initiative to tear down this wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it was high school before entering college. The relationship between classmates in high school was generally very good. They got along with each other day and night, discussed and solved problems together, had fun and decompressed together. The boys handed ambiguous notes to the girls they liked, and the girls Look at the boy you like a few more times, meet at a corner of the school gate next night during self-study, and arrange to go home together. When you are excited, hold each other&#39;s hand and give him warmth, strength or encouragement. How normal is this? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;My college years&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of my college career, which was from 1997 to 2001. In the first class in the first week after the military training, the head teacher spent two whole classes asking each student to come up to the podium and introduce themselves. Then everyone went to a restaurant at the school gate to have lunch together, and they quickly became familiar with each other. . Boys and girls meet together for morning reading, breakfast, and class; after dinner, everyone has evening self-study together. After self-study, they play badminton for an hour on a wide road in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public displays of love were also extremely common at that time. When it comes to the person of the opposite sex they like, a generous and cheerful person will express their feelings directly, &quot;Can I ask you to watch a movie?&quot;; a shy and reserved person will use an intermediary to act as a matchmaker and express their intention to date through a small note or letter. If two people have dinner together, watch a movie (usually an all-night movie), and then hold hands, it basically declares that the &quot;intimate male-female relationship&quot; has been basically established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, it is normal to express this emotion or affection to someone you like or like. I remember clearly that there were 42 people in our class, 22 boys and 20 girls. When I graduated as a senior, there were as many as 5 couples. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Concerned about the values ​​​​and true psychology of contemporary college students&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Boys today are generally not interested in love, don’t they want to know and understand girls? Or on the contrary, are girls today generally not interested in falling in love and not wanting to get to know and understand boys? I feel neither. Faced with the overall environment of high employment pressure, some people have been nervous since their freshman year and are busy with postgraduate entrance examinations, public entrance examinations, College English Level 4 and 6, driver&#39;s licenses, teacher qualification certificates, etc. However, in addition to &quot;many things to do&quot;, they When people still feel lonely or lonely in their hearts, they also long to meet or have a beautiful love. The problem is that no one wants to be considered a &quot;dog-licking tribe&quot;, &quot;Xiatou tribe&quot; or &quot;Puxin tribe&quot;, and no one wants to take the initiative Go out and get to know the opposite sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Contemporary college students are relatively unfamiliar with their classmates, so who are they relatively familiar with? It is understood that compared to students taking public courses or professional courses, it is easier for them to get acquainted with people who have the same or similar interests or hobbies. For example, the relationship between classmates within hip-hop clubs, literary clubs, basketball clubs, opera clubs, etc. should be close to classmates who have taken the same professional course. The reason is that various clubs are more in line with the interests or hobbies of students. This is what they like or like to do in their hearts. Everyone communicates and learns skills together, and closely cooperates and collaborates together, which can often brew the seeds of emotion. And in In professional courses, the course itself may be relatively difficult, and most students are not very interested in discussing or communicating together, so the establishment of close relationships naturally takes a long time. From a spatial perspective, professional classrooms are formal, formal and serious spaces, while various clubs are informal, informal and leisure spaces. The latter make people relatively relaxed, relaxed and natural. This is the informal space. effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let college students feel more relaxed and light, make them feel physically and mentally happy, let them dare and have the courage to do the &quot;duty things&quot; that suit their age group, let the friendship between classmates return to innocence and depth, and let the conversation Talking about love has become a matter of course, which is what the new atmosphere of contemporary college students should mean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve the above goals, I believe that relevant parties should pay more attention to the values ​​​​and true psychology and mentality of contemporary college students. Each university has set up public required courses on the psychology of college students to encourage and advocate the construction of an open An inclusive and harmonious relationship between men and women breaks down all kinds of conceptual barriers and obstacles that create gender opposition and hostility. In terms of course learning, teachers may wish to encourage students to conduct group discussions, and suggest that men and women be paired into groups to create a good atmosphere for heterosexual discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, relevant parties should find breakthroughs in extracurricular time, fill students&#39; extracurricular time with as many public activities as possible, and create opportunities for male and female students to contact, understand and understand each other, such as organizing students to carry out Campus tours, city tours, outings, autumn outings, weekend hikes or dinner parties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[辛柏青：适度的，饱满的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260363]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/3o5PaHrmlWyAEtsipZOYUbuJyvzjyK2zBnv225d7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/3o5PaHrmlWyAEtsipZOYUbuJyvzjyK 2zBnv225d7. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257463&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2020, director Zhang Lu returned to Beijing from South Korea and was quarantined in a hotel in Guangzhou for two weeks in accordance with the COVID-19 prevention and control policy at the time. He wrote a script and sent it to Xin Baiqing, saying that the protagonist Gu Wentong was written for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Wentong is from Beijing. He is divorced. His daughter is fostered at his sister’s house. He lives in the old house left by his mother. He has an affair with a young girl and then separates. His best friend as a boy is in a foreign country. suicide. This person who once wrote poetry now makes a living by writing articles about food. He wanders the streets and alleys of Beijing, lonely, and has a sense of drifting that cannot be stabilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actor Xin Baiqing previously collaborated with Zhang Lu in &quot;The Long Confession&quot; (2021) - the brothers Lichun and Lidong went to Japan from Beijing to find Yanagawa, a girl with whom they had a bond when they were young. Having something on your mind. Xin Baiqing plays Li Chun, who already has a family. He goes to a foreign country and hides his loneliness and discomfort in a nonchalant way. He said, &quot;Director Zhang Lu prefers to write about people who have a sense of wandering and loneliness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing let Zhang Lu see this feeling at a certain moment when Xin Baiqing was resting or lost in thought on the set. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Wentong lives next to the White Tower, and Xin Baiqing also grew up in Beijing. Zhang Lu once said that Xin Baiqing has the &quot;not anxiousness&quot; of an old Beijinger. People who are not in a hurry seem to be taking things too slowly, have heavier traces of time on their bodies, and have a closer relationship with the past than those who keep running forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Wentong in &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot; looks like a man trapped in time. He wears lazy cloth shoes, only a ginger corduroy jacket and a floppy backpack. Most of the time Walking, occasionally taking the bus, and eating braised food that &quot;only people over fifty years old miss&quot; are separated from everything that is happening at the moment, and I am used to saying sorry to everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do I look at such a person more often?&quot; Zhang Lu said in an interview with &quot;Watching Movies&quot;, &quot;Because for this kind of person, the past time is still there, and the present time is still there. Subtle changes have occurred, and two things from time are squeezing on him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Gu Wentong, the past time and the present state are both related to the missing father: the five-year-old In 2006, my father was accused of molesting a woman on the bus and my mother kicked him out of the house. When he reached middle age, he suddenly received news that his father&#39;s &quot;hooligan crime&quot; was an unjust case. For so many years, his father had been watching him from a distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scene of reconciliation between father and son was brief. The two danced a ballroom dance in a simple room accompanied by DVD footage from the last century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two grown men dancing together is not a Chinese way of expressing emotions, let alone Xin Baiqing&#39;s. He asked Zhang Lu, how to dance? Zhang Lu said that he can dance when the time comes. He asked Tian Zhuangzhuang, who played the father, that he could understand all the scenes in the script and could imagine the final appearance, but the dancing scene was weird. Tian Zhuangzhuang also said that there will be a solution on that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When that day came, Xin Baiqing said one line first: Dad, stand up. The two of them jumped stiffly a few times. Xin Baiqing said to Tian Zhuangzhuang, Dad, the blood vessels in your hands are like earthworms - this is what his daughter said to Gu Wentong before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Zhuangzhuang glanced at his hand, and then put his hand on Xin Baiqing&#39;s shoulder. Dancing comes naturally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That’s right, Xin Baiqing sighed. &quot;With this one action, my father&#39;s emotions for so many years fell into his hands and onto my shoulders. This action is small, but it contains too much content.&quot; He thought, &quot;When you go straight to the result and the goal, When you are doing this, you will wonder why it is so difficult? But forget about the result and purpose, and when you enjoy the process and express it, the results will appear naturally.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/35L5QZOT7RYnaU2SmvxFrPGenorKPmviuYXjG1ST.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/08/35L5QZOT7RYnaU2SmvxFrPGenorKPmviuYXjG1ST.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Movie &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot; Stills &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;People&#39;s Insurance Drama&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 27, 2023, &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot; will be released. The film was shortlisted for the main competition of the 73rd Berlin Film Festival at the beginning of the year. In April, director Zhang Lu attended the &quot;Light of the White Tower&quot; post-screening event at the Beijing Film Festival and commented, &quot;Xin Baiqing&#39;s performance is self-evident. It&#39;s easy to win awards for hard-working performances. Xin Baiqing deserves the award.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In terms of fame, Xin Baiqing may not be a first-line star actor. In some years, he did not have many film and television works. But in the movie &quot;Legend of the Demon Cat&quot; (2017), in just a few scenes, the audience was completely attracted by his performance as Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only has one scene in the script: Gao Lishi carries Li Bai to the Banquet of Bliss. Li Bai was drunk and composed a poem, &quot;The clouds want the clothes and the flowers want the face.&quot; Drunkness is the keynote. Xin Baiqing thought, does he really want to act drunk? &quot;My understanding of Li Bai is that it was a period when Li Bai was particularly sober, because all his illusions about his official career had been shattered. Everyone was praising him for being a high official. He knew very well that it was over.&quot; To have Drunk state, but you must be sober and cannot act drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the set, director Chen Kaige said that there would be no need to walk in the scene later, and he would just shoot it directly. Great, Xin Baiqing later said, &quot;I am willing to collide with the most vivid things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first shot was passed in one go. When he got to the monitor, Chen Kaige first said something off-topic, &quot;We have to cooperate in the future&quot;; then he showed Xin Baiqing the monitor: Xin Baiqing sat up, stretched out, and rubbed against the golden tortoise, and then asked Concubine Yang Youyou ,who are you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Kaige said, this is Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TV drama viewers may have known Xin Baiqing through &quot;Happiness is Like a Flower&quot; (2005) in the early years or &quot;Da Qin Fu&quot; (2020) in recent years. The role that really makes him remembered is Zhou Bingyi in the period drama &quot;Human World&quot; (2022) - the eldest brother in an ordinary family in Northeast China: sent to the countryside as an educated youth, admitted to Peking University, and later became an official with outstanding contributions during the reform and opening up period. The shadow of many people in special times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenwriter Wang Haiyu received an invitation to adapt and read Liang Xiaosheng’s original novel. He felt that the description of Zhou Bingyi was relatively thin, such as the process of demolishing the &quot;Guangzi Film&quot; in the shantytown where he grew up after he took over the government. Passed a few pens. In Wang Hailu’s story, his younger brother Zhou Bingkun represents the family (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;the grassroots people&lt;/span>;), and his older brother Zhou Bingyi represents the country (&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Government officials&lt;/span>;) are the backbone. So she put a lot of effort into writing the scene after Zhou Bingyi became a leading cadre. &quot;If I have to say it, the first half of this play is Zhou Bingkun&#39;s home court, and the second half is Zhou Bingyi&#39;s home court,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About halfway through the broadcast of &quot;Human World&quot;, Wang Hailu and Xin Baiqing met at an event. Zhou Bingyi&#39;s highlight hasn&#39;t been aired yet. Wang Haiyuan doesn&#39;t know what Xin Baiqing can do. The two parties only exchanged a few polite words. She seemed to have heard Xin Baiqing say, &quot;This script is very literary.&quot; She thought this was just a polite comment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After watching the complete drama, Wang Hailu regretted not chatting more with Xin Baiqing, &quot;This is such a good actor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A brief example: watching the demolition of shantytowns in the drama Before that scene, I was a little nervous. I gave Zhou Bingyi a few thousand words of lines for that scene. When the plot came to that point, I could only write it like this. I thought the director might have a way to reduce the difficulty of performing this scene during filming. ——I didn’t dare to expect the actor to fulfill his wish. At that time, I had the impression that Xin Baiqing was a niche actor in literary films. ——Unexpectedly, the ten-minute scene was filmed in one shot. Xin Baiqing used his His understanding of the characters, his talent in temperament, and his line skills have successfully endowed him with the real nobility that a ruler should have.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a year has passed since the premiere of &quot;Human World&quot;, and Zhou Bingyi was demolished in a shanty town. Clips of handling disputes on the spot and explaining policies to neighborhood friends whom he has known since childhood are still circulated on self-media and have become classic examples of both performance and speech. Wang Haiyuan started her career as a novelist, and was later transferred to the General Political Repertory Theater to do drama. She said, &quot;At that time, I often heard senior teachers say that the theater protects the people, and the people protect the opera. The success of Zhou Bingyi&#39;s character must be the people protect the opera.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/BRGvtnAAlX0OGVZ0J1Igr0XPE8tD9S34KazHwDXT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/BRGvtnAAlX0OGVZ0J1Igr0XPE8tD9S34KazHwDXT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257461&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A person&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;After &quot;The Human World&quot;, Xin Baiqing received a large number of official roles. But he doesn&#39;t want to be typecast. Only fresh roles can arouse his curiosity. He filmed the first feature film &quot;Three Decades&quot; by documentary director Xu Tong, playing the villain Yan Yonggang, and starring with Duan Yihong who played the policeman Jia Guozhi. In the prosperous era, Yan Yonggang injured policeman Jia Guozhi during a pursuit. Jia was not killed, and Yan was not arrested. A blood feud was formed, but a sympathy for each other was born. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his original novel &quot;Jinbao Island&quot;, Xu Tong wrote about Yan Yonggang, a son of an official, like this: his actions are dark, his person is fair, and he has a sinister aura. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tong and Xin Baiqing went to the writer Acheng&#39;s house to discuss the adaptation of &quot;Zhenbao Island&quot;. That was the first time he met Xin Baiqing. As soon as he parked the car, he saw Xin Baiqing arriving in an SUV behind him. Alone, no team, no assistant. &quot;I felt very comfortable at that time. He was very natural and alone. He didn&#39;t have the habits of the entertainment industry or the behavior of actors.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After meeting at Acheng&#39;s house, Ah Cheng Cheng told Xu Tong, pay attention, Bai Qing is holding her breast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tong later observed carefully that Xin Baiqing had no breasts at all. He was about 1.8 meters tall and stood straight. Xu Tong asked Xin Baiqing, has he always been in this shape? Xin Baiqing said yes. It has been like this for decades, and he is neither fat nor thin at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Tong understood that Acheng was not referring to the body shape, but to the impression that Xin Baiqing was holding her breasts. &quot;Because of his thin temperament and subtlety.&quot; Similarly, Xu Tong found that Xin Baiqing had a special look in his eyes, &quot;He looks at things, not directly with his eyes shining, but as if there is a gap between them. Layers of things, the light is recycled and contained inside.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aware of these two points, and looking at the characters created by Xin Baiqing, Xu Tong felt, &quot;His expressions are moderate and at the same time full and full. It means that the thing behind his back is full.&quot; Chen Kaige had a similar evaluation of Xin Baiqing. He said that Xin Baiqing &quot;eats very deeply and vomits very little.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of 2022, &quot;Three Decades&quot; will start filming in Shaanxi. Xin Baiqing promised Xu Tong to join the group in advance and turned down other arrangements. &quot;After he said the Spring Festival, I walked over.&quot; Xu Tong recalled, &quot;Looking back on our work during that period, I feel that he is not an actor. He did not regard our cooperation as a project. He just Create a character. Familiarize yourself with the environment, enter the space, and then get into the character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was a script reading before the start of filming, and everyone didn&#39;t talk much. Xu Tong said that Xin Baiqing and Duan Yihong had already turned the characters over and over. If you understand everything thoroughly and talk too much, it will affect the spontaneity of the scene. He described the performances of the two actors as &quot;very exciting and very surprising&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although they were happy to work together, Xu Tong and Xin Baiqing did not interact much after that drama. Part of the reason is Xu Tong&#39;s intention. &quot;I need to keep a distance from the actors in order to create a sense of strangeness. Having too many personal relationships will affect my imagination of the characters in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He feels that Xin Baiqing is more I understand this, so I rarely appear outside of the role. &quot;If the audience is too familiar with your face, when you create a character again, the credibility of that character will be reduced, or the impact will be lost.&quot; It will decrease.&quot; A good actor needs to maintain a considerable degree of solitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WiaFJATdWFFloHdXydwOnr5AsDfw9IIQK1u6CqPj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;609&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WiaFJATdWFFloHdXydwOnr5AsDfw9IIQK1u6CqPj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257464&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;三板AX ”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The partners of Xin Baiqing we found are very willing to talk about his performances, but it is not easy to talk about performances with him himself. Like Zhang Lu said, he was holding on to his mouth; or like Xu Tong That said, he was recycling it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rather than describing his mental journey in detail, he would rather summarize it this way:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My working method is to try my best to turn literary descriptions into visual images. The first step is my Where does the image come from? What does he look like, what is his hairstyle, what clothes he wears, whether he wears glasses, the way he walks, the way he talks, and whether he has any habitual movements. In fact, these are all learned when he was in school. The most basic. Then, some of the background of the script is not written in the script, but I want to give him some rich emotional relationships, or some experiences, so that I can imagine a deeper dimension for this character. After the performance, This character will not be so one-sided and single, and the audience will feel that he may have more aspects and three-dimensionality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The basic skill of this actor is to observe life, there are no other skills, nothing new The content is all three-dimensional, but you have to do these three things in a down-to-earth manner, that is, the actor is armed to the teeth.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is by relying on these three things that he leaves his comfort time and time again. District and meet the challenges of new roles. &quot;When I take a role, I only consider whether I am interested in it, not whether I can control it. When I see a new role and I can&#39;t control it, I stop acting, and there will never be any progress.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first glance Look, Li Chun in &quot;The Long Confession&quot; looks nothing like Xin Baiqing. Producer Xu Jiahan recalled that the first actor selected by the crew was Zhang Luyi, who will play the younger brother Lidong, a somewhat stubborn middle-aged literary artist suffering from cancer. They asked Zhang Luyi, find yourself a brother, who is suitable? Brother Lichun is a bit like the opposite of Lidong, secular and open-minded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Luyi replied: Xin Baiqing. He felt that Xin Baiqing was a bit &quot;sultry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So there was the first collaboration between Xin Baiqing and director Zhang Lu. In a scene, in a Japanese B&amp;B, Li Chun and his young lover Yanagawa sat opposite each other and talked, and Xin Baiqing burst into tears, &quot;It was telling and repenting. I felt that kind of expression was particularly clear.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Lu yelled, come on, one more line, and asked Xin Baiqing to say his lines to the wall. &quot;I thought at the time, wasn&#39;t the one just now bad? Of course I didn&#39;t discuss it with the director. Since there is already a stronger expression, I will repeat what the director said.&quot; In the next line, Xin Baiqing turned his back to the camera and muttered to himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the finished film, Zhang Lu used the latter one. Xin Baiqing thought, yes, Lichun may have feelings for Yanagawa, or maybe he just came here to find himself. &quot;And my kind of performance limits all possibilities to one, but makes the road narrower.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing quickly understood Zhang Lu&#39;s style. He said that watching Zhang Lu&#39;s movies is like reading poetry, and there is no standard answer. When I interviewed Zhang Lu at the end of 2020, he indeed said that movies should be like poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the role of Li Chun, Xin Baiqing won the China Film Golden Rooster Award for Best Supporting Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time of &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot;, the two had a very good understanding and didn&#39;t have too much discussion. Zhang Lu would ask him if he felt comfortable acting? Quite comfortable. That’s it, take the next one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The so-called comfort (means), I think everything is right. There is no &#39;strange&#39; in this scene, there is no such uncomfortable and difficult movements, behaviors, and tone. It is waves. It is a calm, still and deep expression of expression, rather than which note pops up and becomes stronger; which note becomes deeper. Maybe it is used in this movie, and the comfortable feeling is like this.&quot; Xin Baiqing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being burdened with the dissatisfaction of the times and the family, in the ambiguous relationship between the sexes and the dramatic father-son relationship, the role of Gu Wentong has a lot to play. But Xin Baiqing knew that what Zhang Lu wanted was a performance that was not externalized, or even a non-acting one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He often said that people in life are multi-faceted. You may be talking about something happily one second, but you may fall into a very self-conscious mood the next second. I don’t know why. People often get distracted and say nonsense. These are real life conditions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This puts higher demands on performers. Not acting requires a particularly strong inner concentration, otherwise you will feel that I am wrong if I don’t act? But precisely when I don’t doubt myself and am particularly determined, another unspeakable state may arise. The audience It will be captured. If you don’t act, you may need to be more fulfilled in your heart. This enrichment does not mean that your purpose is more fulfilling, but that your past life, experience, your temperament, and the connotation of your thoughts will be felt at that moment. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 29, 2023, the closing ceremony and awards ceremony of the Beijing Film Festival was held. As Zhang Lu said, Xin Baiqing really won the award. He won the &quot;Tiantan Award&quot; for Best Actor for &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot;. This is his first movie award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sD0TPDJ9dOvlC0xXjG9FRfXGk083Fk6e61ffRF8m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sD0TPDJ9dOvlC0xXjG9FRfXGk083Fk6e61ffRF8m.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257462&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the drama &quot;Hurry Up&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Game sense &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to film and television roles, Xin Baiqing has always been an actor at the National Theater. The first major theater play was director Tian Qinxin&#39;s &quot;Hurry Up&quot; (2001). He played the protagonist Tian Han. The play included self-narration that broke the fourth wall, emotions with his cousin, his wife, and his beauty, as well as several scenes in the play. For example, the Syrian boy in &quot;Salome&quot; translated by Tian Han and Guan Hanqing in the script written by Tian Han were both played by Xin Baiqing. Later, in &quot;Red Rose and White Rose&quot; (2007), he played &quot;Liu Xiahui&quot; known to all Shanghai. In &quot;Four Generations Under One Roof&quot; (2010), he played the role of Guan Xiaohe, who lives in an alley and seeks fame and wealth from the Japanese, and won the Drama Golden Lion Award for Performance. In &quot;Green Snake&quot; (2013), he played Fahai, who was both human and divine. In 2023, he will also play Su Shi in Tian Qinxin&#39;s new play &quot;Spring Dawn on Su Di&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing remembers the words of director Tian Qinxin, whom he has collaborated with many times: The biggest difference between drama and film and television, or the biggest charm of drama is that it can be dressed up. Movies and TV dramas won’t look for Xin Baiqing, but Tian Qinxin will. &quot;It feels very playful to dress up this character, and it makes me suddenly enlightened. It has become a fun thing. It doesn&#39;t mean that I have to go through all the trouble to create someone. The drama is as big as the sky.&quot; , such a big yoke is put on you, no.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In more than 20 years on the stage, Xin Baiqing’s roles are not many, and he can count them on two hands. Looking back now, every role has He could still recall the stories. Compared with film and television, drama is far away from fame and fortune. Xin Baiqing himself sometimes wonders why he has never left drama? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fame and fortune may be just a moment. It&#39;s great that my play has become popular. It is recognized by so many people. I enjoy it very much, but it will pass soon. But acting in a play requires being in the rehearsal room every day. Rehearsing all the time, this kind of simple happiness is so rare. The older I get, the things, social environment, and relationships I face become more and more complicated. (Performing a play) This thing is not complicated. I can go back to simplicity If you find the place where you were when you were little, you will be particularly happy.&quot; Xin Baiqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He has a very clean temperament. This kind of cleanliness is rare.&quot; Tian Qinxin said that in the rehearsal venue, she would sometimes be suddenly moved by Xin Baiqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the new version of &quot;Kurst&quot; was staged. Xin Baiqing went to watch it as an audience member and felt that the younger generation of actors performed better than himself. &quot;When I was young, I was a bit heartless. I just had fun and played silly every day. I didn&#39;t care about my brain and didn&#39;t take things personally. Because it would be very painful if I pretended too much, you know?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;But there is no way, life is just stuffed into my arms, and I have stuffed a lot of it into my arms over the years.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What has life stuffed into him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fire, rice, oil and salt are all put in it. You really can&#39;t tell the details. This is living and living.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the version of &quot;Hurry&quot; played by Xin Baiqing, there is a section where Tian Han Watching a theater in Tokyo, I read a confession, to the effect that I have found my passion, just like a planet has found its orbit: &quot;I was confused when I was a child, and I probably can&#39;t understand it. I only love the color I want, I will let it pull out a track and lead me to revolve freely.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said this line and asked Xin Baiqing if it resonated with him when he was young, but he denied it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I was a child, I really didn’t know what it meant. I just pronounced the word out to compose a new word to express a state of sadness. What is life, what is pulling, what is my color. , I don’t know what I want. Now that I’ve reached this age, I know everything, and I don’t need to say such words anymore. I have all the insights, but it’s been a cold autumn.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Through his works, it is difficult to trace the trajectory of his climb in performance. Nor did he give a so-called “eureka moment.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I understand your question, but there is no specific node. Because life itself has no nodes. My life is stable, but are you willing to experience the stable life with your heart? I have experienced it with my heart, age, age, and stability. What time brings to people will be subtle and accumulated little by little.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only said that if he plays Tian Han again now, it should be different. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Blunt&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2008, when director Jiang Wei was filming &quot;Latent&quot;, his first consideration was to cast Xin Baiqing and Zhu Yuanyuan to play the roles of Yu Zecheng and Cuiping. He felt that Xin Baiqing had some Literary popularity. Unfortunately, Zhu Yuanyuan was pregnant. Jiang Wei said that Xin Baiqing could go alone, but Xin Baiqing did not go to accompany the childbirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Latent&quot; was aired, it became a phenomenon-level TV series, winning awards all over the country. Xin Baiqing has regrets, but not regrets. This isn&#39;t the only time I&#39;ve run into a favorite character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The role Xin Baiqing wanted to play most was Faust. In Goethe&#39;s play &quot;Faust&quot;, the learned scholar makes a deal with the devil Mephistopheles, selling his soul in exchange for endless knowledge and wisdom, and willing to go to hell after death. Later, when someone actually approached him to play &quot;Faust&quot;, he refused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why didn&#39;t I act when this opportunity came to me? I struggled for a long time, and then I realized that what I wanted to act was not Goethe&#39;s Faust.&quot; He couldn&#39;t say anything. Explaining what Faust he wanted to play, he knew what he didn’t want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I feel quite blunt, and in life I feel that I am not very bright or very smart anyway.” Xin Baiqing said of himself. But he has his own little world. When he is particularly tired, or driving in a car, he watches other people play Four Kingdoms Army Chess on the Internet. Sometimes when he sees that the game is too bad, he also says that he can’t stand it anymore, so he closes it and clicks to play it again later. &quot;Just like that, I am very happy in my heart, but when I communicate with others, I become a very boring person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Baiqing likes diving. Putting his life on the bottom of the water, distracting thoughts were forced to be reduced to a minimum. The oxygen content, diving depth, and direction were all no problem. When he could finally relax and take a look at the bottom of the sea, he felt that it might be similar to the feeling of being in space, and he felt better. It becomes wider. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who is an actor is sensitive, but sensitivity can sometimes hurt oneself. As an &quot;introvert, not good at expressing people&quot;, Xin Baiqing uses this method to let himself go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jiahan is the producer of &quot;The Long Confession&quot; and &quot;The Light of the White Tower&quot;. She said, &quot;In real life, Teacher Bai Qing is very polite and harmonious with the crew. &quot;&quot;The Long Confession&quot; was filmed in Japan. Xin Baiqing did not understand Japanese, but &quot;will try his best to adapt and is unwilling to cause trouble to others.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But you always feel that he has a little secret, and he just happened to find an outlet in the script.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1997, the 1993 undergraduate students of the Performance Department of the Central Academy of Drama were about to graduate and were rehearsing. During the break, a dozen classmates went to have lunch with the teacher. Walking in Dongmianhua Hutong in front of the school, the teacher asked, who among you can continue to act in dramas after graduation? The originally cheerful atmosphere suddenly became quiet. At that time, acting in a drama meant being poor, and no one said anything. Xin Baiqing added, &quot;I would be happy to act in dramas for the rest of my life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Xin Baiqing will be 50 years old, and some of his teachers at that time have passed away. Whenever he rehearses a play, attends a class reunion, or visits his teacher&#39;s grave, he will recall that scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
