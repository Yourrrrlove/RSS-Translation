Some children may have to wait for several days before they can be admitted.” Ding Guodong is the deputy chief physician of the Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine. This overloaded work rhythm with my colleagues has started in mid-September. &quot;At this stage, almost 90% of the hospitalized children in the pediatric respiratory department are infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and there are many cases of drug resistance of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.&quot; . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae has a diameter of 50-300 nanometers, nearly one thousandth the diameter of a human hair. It is a microorganism between bacteria and viruses. Pneumonia caused by this microorganism is the most common community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 5 and above in China (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;refers to infectious diseases suffered outside the hospital Pulmonary parenchymal inflammation&lt;/span>;), mostly occurs in autumn and winter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the beginning of the school season in September, not only Shanghai, but also hospitals in Beijing, Hebei, Jiangsu and other places have seen more children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and they tend to be younger. According to a CCTV News report on October 13, the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases has increased across the country recently, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae has entered the season of high incidence. Children need timely medical treatment and appropriate medication. &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;&quot;There are 246 people in front of you&quot;&lt;/h4>;&lt;p>;Before four o&#39;clock in the afternoon on October 15, Qin Nannan finally registered her son.

Narada Big Data Research Institute combed through the management regulations and banned dog breeding regulations in the top 15 cities with GDP in 2022 and found that the list of banned dogs and the number of banned dog breeds are different in different places. Rottweilers are used by Beijing, Shanghai, Cities such as Guangzhou are clearly listed on the list of prohibited dogs, while Chengdu and Shenzhen are not prohibited. Moreover, many places have different standards for the shoulder height and body length of banned large dogs. Beijing requires key management areas to prohibit the breeding of aggressive dogs and dog breeds with an adult height of more than 35 centimeters. Tianjin, Wuhan, Hangzhou and other cities have mentioned bans on breeding. Violent dogs and dog breeds with a body height exceeding 45 centimeters. Nanjing, Suzhou and other cities have clearly banned the breeding of ferocious dogs, large dogs and other adult dogs with a body height (shoulder height) exceeding 61 centimeters as determined by the public security organs and veterinary authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/48466fe39e17ef0662e7a589ea8ea87c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1563&quot; height=&quot;3362&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/48466fe39e17ef0662e7a589ea8ea87c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254636&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;*Relevant management regulations for dog breeding in some cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Hanning and other cities&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Dog management regulations have not been updated for more than 16 years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;For In response to incidents of vicious dogs injuring people in cities, each city has now issued regulations prohibiting or strictly controlling dogs, involving dog vaccinations, registration, dog-raising behavior standards, etc., including the types of dogs that are prohibited. Among the 15 cities included in the statistics, each city has issued at least two regulations related to dog breeding management, involving dog breeding management regulations, animal epidemic prevention regulations, or regulations on the promotion of civilized behavior, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The review found that Tianjin has the largest number of dog-raising management regulations, including the &quot;Tianjin Dog-raising Management Regulations&quot;, &quot;Tianjin Animal Epidemic Prevention Regulations&quot;, &quot;Tianjin Civilized Behavior Promotion Regulations&quot; 5 items including Tianjin Dog Registration and Dog Registration Management Measures&quot; and Tianjin Dog Breeding Epidemic Prevention Management Measures. Followed by Beijing and Chongqing, each with 4 items. Beijing has the &quot;Beijing Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot;, &quot;Beijing Dog Breeding Registration and Annual Inspection Management Measures&quot;, &quot;Beijing City Civilized Behavior Promotion Regulations&quot;, and &quot;Beijing Animal Epidemic Prevention Regulations&quot;; Chongqing has &quot;Chongqing Municipal Interim Measures for Dog Breeding Management&quot;, &quot;Chongqing Municipal Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot;, &quot;Chongqing Municipal Animal Epidemic Prevention Regulations&quot; and &quot;Chongqing Municipal Civilized Behavior Promotion Regulations&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dog management regulations are an important basis and specific reference for law enforcement in many cities. However, after sorting out the latest revision time or implementation time of some cities, it was found that among the 15 cities, Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Wuhan Cities such as Beijing and Nanjing have not revised relevant dog management regulations for more than 16 years, and the longest has been 20 years. As early as 2017, the Hangzhou Municipal Urban Management Committee stated in response to a media interview that the revision of the regulations was included in the research project of the Hangzhou Municipal Government’s 2016 Legislative Work Plan. In 2018, the Nanjing Municipal People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee has revised the &quot;Nanjing Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; and included it in the &quot;Nanjing Municipal People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee 2018-2022 Legislative Plan&quot;. In 2022, the 22nd meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th Wuhan Municipal People&#39;s Congress will review the &quot;Wuhan Municipal Dog Breeding Management Regulations (Revised Draft)&quot;, but it has not yet been officially announced. Recently, relevant personnel from the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau also revealed in interviews with the media that relevant departments are working on revising the &quot;Tianjin Municipal Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with other cities, the &quot;Chongqing Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; will be officially implemented on June 1, 2023. Previously, the 2008 version of the &quot;Chongqing Dog Breeding Management Interim Measures&quot; was implemented. Judging from the number of revisions of dog breeding management regulations in the 15 cities included in the analysis, Hangzhou and Suzhou had relatively frequent revisions. The latest revision of the Dog Management Regulations will be in 2022, and the previous revision was in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/66212136c002ea146d35a1cf91703f12.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1563&quot; height=&quot;2358&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/66212136c002ea146d35a1cf91703f12.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254635&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Some cities have restrictions on the shoulder height of prohibited dog breeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rongshen has not banned Rottweilers&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Many places have banned large dogs with different physical standards and high standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt; p>;The Rottweiler that bit a girl in Chongzhou, Chengdu on October 16. The male dog’s shoulder height is generally 70-90 cm, and the female dog’s shoulder height is 65-80 cm. Generally speaking, it is a large dog breed (generally, the shoulder height of various places is 60 cm). Centimeters and above are considered large dogs), but the &quot;Chengdu Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; stipulates 22 types of aggressive dogs and large dogs, which does not include Rottweilers. In addition, in the Shenzhen Municipal Administration for Market Regulation’s announcement on the list of aggressive dogs, Rottweilers were not included in the list of banned dogs, but Rottweilers were banned in 13 other cities included in the statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nandu Big Data Research Institute found that in the above-mentioned cities that have promulgated dog breeding management regulations, it can be seen from the lists of banned aggressive dogs published in various places, and relevant notices or announcements about permitted dog breeding in key management areas. The rules governing dog ownership and dog ownership restrictions vary. For example, Beijing stipulates that in principle, small toy dogs with an adult height of less than 35 cm (inclusive) should be raised in key management areas, and breeding of aggressive dogs and dog breeds with an adult height of more than 35 cm should be prohibited; Tianjin has clarified that key dog ​​management areas must Raising small ornamental dogs with an annual body height of no more than 45 cm is prohibited. It is prohibited to raise aggressive dogs and dog breeds with an adult body height of more than 45 cm. It is especially emphasized that after dog registration, dogs with a body height of more than 45 cm will not be registered; Qingdao requirements Violent dogs not included in the regulations, hybrid dogs containing the blood of ferocious dogs, or hybrid dogs with a height of more than 60 centimeters are prohibited from breeding, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/fd48e977c4b8123be445b7e2553a9449.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1564&quot; height=&quot;2860&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/fd48e977c4b8123be445b7e2553a9449.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254634&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Number of dog breeds banned in 15 cities (unit: breed). &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The breeds of dogs banned in different places are different&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;There are more than 4&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;0 breeds of dogs banned in Tianjin, Beijing and other places&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;After sorting through the lists of banned dogs in these cities, we also found that the number of banned dog breeds varies from place to place. Among the 15 cities included in the statistics, the number of banned dog breeds in Tianjin reaches 49; Followed by Beijing, Qingdao, and Changsha, each have 40 types of banned dogs. In contrast, the number of prohibited dog breeds in Shanghai and Chengdu is relatively small, with only 21 and 22 respectively. It is understood that among the cities not included in this statistics, Shenyang requires that 48 types of dogs are not allowed in key dog ​​management areas, including 39 types of aggressive dogs and 9 types of large dogs; Jinan has made it clear that individuals are prohibited from raising large dogs, There are 56 fierce dog breeds, and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the names of prohibited dog categories in these cities, there are also some differences in the names of prohibited dogs. Some use full names, and some use abbreviations. For example, Japanese Tosa Inu, some cities prohibit dogs. The only ones on the list are called Tosa Inu or Tosa Fighting Dog; Italian Twisted Boliton, some are called Twisted Boliton, some are directly called Neapolitan, and so on. Judging from the list of banned dogs in the 15 cities included in the statistics, it is impossible to find a single category of dogs with the same name or all banned dogs. However, Tibetan mastiffs, bull terriers, Newfoundland dogs, Central Asian shepherd dogs, etc. are generally included in the prohibited list, but there are always cities that are not included in the prohibited list. For example, Newfoundland dogs do not appear on the lists of banned dog breeds in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Tianjin. Due to the large differences in the number of dogs in different places, there are problems such as a certain dog breed being allowed to be raised in one place but prohibited in another place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, some experts analyzed that because the power to formulate specific dog-raising rules is left to the people&#39;s governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, this is also the reason why dog-raising regulations vary so much from place to place. It is necessary to keep pace with the times. Policy follow-up, as well as continuous and active improvement of the operating mechanism of the policy system, more standardized management, will close the gap of inconsistent standards for the prohibition of violent dogs, and prevent the recurrence of tragedies of violent dogs injuring people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[他们关心大山里的孩子，那么谁来关心他们丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258834]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On December 10, 2013, Naituo Village Primary School, the lighting in the classroom was poor and The temperature is relatively low and students have classes outdoors.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2013, as a volunteer, I rushed to the Daliang Mountains. During a charity event where we took family portraits for fellow villagers for free, I met Wan Chaohui, a local volunteer teacher. He was 28 years old at the time, from Sanmenxia City, Henan Province, and a typical northerner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wan Chaohui teaches in Naituo Village, Sedi Township, Zhaojue County, at an altitude of more than 2,600 meters. Naituo Village Primary School was built in 1990. It has dark brown tiles and yellow-brown mud walls. It has been in disrepair for a long time. The walls are cracked. There are three large cracks. The widest one can fit into Wan Chaohui&#39;s fist. There are more than ten small cracks. , can fit into the child&#39;s fingers. The windows were sealed with plastic film to prevent the whistling mountain breeze from blowing in. There are three rooms, with the teacher&#39;s dormitory in the middle and first and second grade classrooms on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As school was about to start, the primary school’s flagpole was broken by a pig. Three boys carried firewood daggers on their backs and went up the mountain to cut a 3-meter-long bamboo pole and carry it back to school. Wan Chaohui tied the five-star red flag with nylon rope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 1, 2013, the first class started. Class starts at 9 o&#39;clock. Wan Chaohui gets up at 7:30 and wipes his glasses repeatedly with a tissue. Standing on the podium, Wan Chaohui took out the roster and called the names, but after calling several names, no one answered. Some children grinned and laughed, while others stared at him with blank expressions on their faces. They couldn&#39;t speak Mandarin. Wan Chaohui was so anxious that he circled back and forth in front of the blackboard. Finally, he called Brother Jida, the village party secretary, and Jida came to act as his translator. A class lasts 45 minutes, all of which is used for roll call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the adobe house of the primary school has been transformed into a brick building. The school has toilets and shower rooms, a kitchen and a cement playground, as well as new desks and chairs, basketball hoops, flag poles, Dormitory beds and wardrobes. Worried that the fellow villagers were illiterate, Wan Chaohui specifically asked the construction workers to draw two little figures on the toilet wall to help the fellow villagers differentiate between men&#39;s and women&#39;s toilets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I met Wan Chaohui again in 2019. At the Yi Torch Festival in June, the school playground turned into a playground for students to light torches. More than 20 children surrounded Wan Chaohui in the center of the circle. The torches were lit, and Wan Zhaohui and the students ran around the school holding the torches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the blink of an eye, ten years have passed since my teaching career. In July 2023, I met Wan Chaohui again. He is 38 years old and nearly middle-aged. Over the years, another main storyline of his life has slowly emerged: returning to the secular world, getting married and having children. At this time, a specific topic that had been discussed every time I met him in the mountainous area gradually became important: as a volunteer teacher, his monthly living allowance was less than 3,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2017, Wan Chaohui, who had stayed in Liangshan for 5 years, met his first wife after being introduced by a Yi friend. From the first meeting to the marriage certificate, it only took A week&#39;s time. The boys in the class acted as relatives of the man. According to the Yi people&#39;s habit of marrying a wife, the villagers helped kill two pigs; the girls in the class ran to the mountains to pick Soma flowers, put them on the classroom podium, and wrote &quot; Happy wedding”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the marriage, his wife opened a restaurant in Leibo County, and Wan Chaohui still taught in Gujue Village. The two places are 150 kilometers apart and it takes more than 5 hours to drive. Due to their different cultural backgrounds and living habits, their relationship has become increasingly estranged. In May 2019, the two divorced. In September 2020, Wan Chaohui married a local kindergarten teacher, and their child was born the next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After having a family and having children, I realized the reality of oppression, such as diapers, milk powder, rent, water and electricity and other living expenses.&quot; Once, &amp;nbsp;Wan Sitting in front of me Chaohui told all this calmly. He has wanted to leave the mountainous area and return to urban life many times, but he is worried about his 38-year-old age. &quot;Many employers clearly stipulate that they do not accept jobs over the age of 35.&quot; Speaking of his parents, Wan Chaohui also looked helpless and guilty, &quot;I only go home every winter and summer vacation. Sometimes I feel that I am quite unfilial.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He belongs to a special group among the volunteer teachers, not the mainstream, but still worthy of concern. How should teachers who volunteer to teach and are willing to take root in the mountains for a long time stay here? So this short film &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/256942?source=131&quot; title=&quot;Standing in the mountains for ten years, with a monthly salary of less than 3,000: A support teacher&#39;s mid-life crisis &quot;How to explain&quot;>;Standing in the mountains for ten years, with a monthly salary of less than 3,000: How to explain the &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; of support teachers&lt;/a>;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While filming, I happened to meet a group of new college students who came to teach. Some have returned from studying abroad and some have graduated from teacher training. Most of them plan to teach for one or two semesters before leaving the mountainous area and returning to normal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[阿奇霉素上热搜，广东儿科专家紧急提醒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258871]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 17, the topic &quot;azithromycin&quot; became a hot search on Weibo. At the same time, the increase in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in the respiratory departments of many hospitals across the country has also caused concern. Huang Huarong, director of the Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, revealed in an interview with Southern+ reporters that about 90% of the patients she currently treats have respiratory infections, and about 80% of them are Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/7115b1ec97e19569a54369be370a8827.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;457&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/7115b1ec97e19569a54369be370a8827.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254629&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As for the use of azithromycin, Huang Huarong said that it is indeed the main drug currently used clinically to treat Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. However, there are many clinical types of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children, and parents cannot judge the type and condition of the disease by themselves. Therefore, it is not recommended to take it by yourself, let alone trust the so-called &quot;strategies&quot; on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern+:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is azithromycin the main drug for the treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Huang Huarong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At present, macrolide drugs such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin are the most popular clinical drugs. The drug of choice for the treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. New tetracycline antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline or quinolone antibiotics can also be used for treatment, but caution should be used in children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, azithromycin is the main treatment drug for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Take azithromycin once a day, with three days as a course of treatment. It will take effect quickly and relieve acute symptoms. In addition, azithromycin is convenient to administer, can take into account children&#39;s medication compliance, and is conducive to improving the therapeutic effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern+:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Under what circumstances is it more appropriate to use azithromycin? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Huang Huarong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Patients diagnosed by doctors as having Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can be treated with azithromycin. Generally, patients with mild symptoms will experience relief after taking medications. But that doesn&#39;t mean azithromycin will always work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, different children may have heterogeneous manifestations such as different symptoms, different onset conditions, and different physical indicators. The choice of drug needs to be determined by the doctor based on the specific situation. For example, children with mycoplasma pneumonia are more suitable for treatment with erythromycin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, if severe symptoms such as persistent high fever, wheezing, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing occur, it may be severe or cause other complications. At this time, just using azithromycin is far from enough. It needs to be combined with other drugs and other treatment methods for comprehensive treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, patients may develop unresponsiveness to macrolide drugs due to self-drug resistance, abnormal immune-inflammatory response, and mixed infections. That is, taking azithromycin cannot be effective, and other drugs need to be identified, added, or replaced in a timely manner. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern+:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can I buy my own medicine and take azithromycin? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Huang Huarong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Azithromycin is an antibiotic drug and is a prescription drug. It should be used under the guidance of a doctor. It is not recommended to take it by yourself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Clinically, there are many types of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children, and parents cannot judge the type and condition of the disease by themselves. In particular, children&#39;s physiques are different from those of adults, and some children have an excessively strong immune-inflammatory response and their condition progresses quickly. If the drug is not suitable for the disease, the best opportunity for treatment may be missed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When using medicines for children, special attention should be paid to the safety, rationality and effectiveness of the medicines. The doctor will determine the dosage, course of treatment, usage, etc. of the drug based on the child&#39;s weight, physique, age and other characteristics.

Some children may have intrapulmonary complications such as plastic bronchitis, pleural effusion, and acute attacks of bronchial asthma, as well as extrapulmonary complications such as damage to the nervous system, circulatory system, blood system, and skin and mucous membranes, and require prompt medical treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/81d7fd3207a47ea4e51255fc378cd269.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/81d7fd3207a47ea4e51255fc378cd269.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254628&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern+:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What suggestions do you have for the prevention of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Huang Huarong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is mainly spread through droplets, and the pathogen is carried in secretions during coughing, sneezing and runny nose. Try to avoid going to crowded closed places as much as possible, and wear a mask when necessary. Pay attention to washing hands frequently, ventilating frequently, strengthening exercise, and improving physical fitness. Children with the disease should pay extra attention to rest and improve their immunity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past three years, people have been wearing masks for a long time, which has reduced the occurrence of respiratory diseases and also caused people&#39;s &quot;pre-existing immunity&quot; to various pathogens to deteriorate. This is also one of the reasons why there are more infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and various types of bacteria and viruses today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents find that their children have persistent fever, cough, headache, sore throat and other symptoms, they should seek medical treatment promptly and do not blindly abuse drugs. Do not relax your vigilance after receiving treatment. You must continue to pay attention to the child, pay attention to severe warning symptoms such as persistent high fever and difficulty breathing after treatment, and return to the hospital in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[老无所依丨昼夜有时]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258771]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/17/KlNGGnxk06oKgMlZ29wO2uHbbQAs4OG6XJf5uUgM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/KlNGGnxk06oKgMlZ29wO2uHbb QAs4OG6XJf5uUgM. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254311&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon her pufferfish deflated with a &quot;pop&quot;. He looked sick and hopeless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first she would still think about us, feeling sorry that her sister was not married yet and that I had no children. When staying at her eldest sister&#39;s house, she would ask her eldest sister to invite her father over for dinner. She was afraid that he didn&#39;t know how to take care of herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later she could only think about her own affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She wants to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to porcupine dates, she also believes that Bentong ginger can cure her gallbladder cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m so lucky to see this by chance.&quot; One day, she showed me a report about ginger&#39;s ability to cure diseases. She soon found a woman selling ginger powder nearby. The woman ground Bentong ginger into powder and put it in capsules. My mother bought five or six bottles of ginger powder capsules and gave me one as a gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then there are the leaves of the durian. We heard at the hospital that the leaves of the solanum pomegranate have miraculous effects. Some people boiled water with it and drank it for a few months, and their cancer was cured. So my father collected a bunch of durian leaves. He stored the leaves in her tailor shop. Day after day, they look fragile and pale in the sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most ridiculous thing is the father’s idea. He brought back a brochure from Yiyo, claiming that he had met a Reiki master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pink and purple brochure has a photo of a middle-aged man printed on it. The man was wearing a black tunic suit and was serious in speech. He raised his hands in front of his chest as if he was pushing an invisible thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A gentle natural treatment that brings out the best in your mind, body and soul. When health shines, wealth grows.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also on the brochure are Reiki treatments and Reiki Masters Introduction and testimonials of “reiki benefactors”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father went to my eldest sister’s house carrying a bucket and several empty water bottles. He and the Reiki master agreed to treat his mother at his eldest sister&#39;s house the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just believe me once, just this once.&quot; He said on the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I don’t know.” My mother said when I repeatedly asked her what she thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe she didn&#39;t dare to say &quot;no&quot; to her father, like before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She used to say this with fear or impatience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result was that we children rejected the Reiki master. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last two weeks, my brother took time off to go home and take care of her. At that time, she could no longer walk. Suddenly her will to live returned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I must get better, I must be able to walk, and I cannot let Axiang hold me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We bought various health products for her. Her brother also took her to Kuala Lumpur to see a nutritionist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why did you delay it until now?&quot; the nutritionist said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They brought back a bunch of bottles and cans. We don&#39;t care whether they work or not. But soon she couldn&#39;t swallow the pills anymore. After her death, her brother returned them to the nutritionist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She then survived on morphine. The nurse said morphine is a painkiller. When she was feeling uncomfortable, the eldest sister fed her morphine with a syringe, increasing the dose. All the doctors could do was ease her pain. Administer morphine, pump out ascites, and inhale oxygen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her will to survive is so strong, unlike me, who wants to give up at every turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the end I couldn’t see the light either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three days before her death, I had a video call with her on the plane to Tokyo and found that her eyes were so empty. There is no light and no sadness. As if indifferent. She looked at me and said nothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;God loves you. I pray for you.&quot; I didn&#39;t let her see my tears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why would I say that? Things I’m not even sure I actually believe. In the church, this is what middle-class believers say. Now I am like them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looked at me blankly and said nothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is she tired? Fear? What was she thinking? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In those last few days, we were almost scrambling to find explanations for our actions. We found “palliative care,” deliberately avoiding the word “hospice.” We are not preparing for her death, we are living with her illness, and it may be a long, long time, we comfort ourselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fact is that we can only care for, accompany and comfort her. We can only watch her in pain and watch her die away bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors know better than anyone else. He called his eldest sister and asked her to invite relatives to visit his mother in the ward. &quot;The more people who come, the better,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The words suddenly came to my mind - &quot;Sometimes healing, often relief, always comfort.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her younger siblings arrived. They came one after another and sat by the bed to talk to her. Her spirits suddenly improved, she was in high spirits, and she talked a lot. At that time, no one thought that maybe it was a comeback. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just a few days ago, she would suddenly become confused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night on the phone she told me loudly that she had five children and named them one by one. Then she asked me why she couldn&#39;t see her children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No. No, no, no. Why no?&quot; She said to me in Hokkien. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. Didn&#39;t see it. Why not? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I told her I would go back to see her soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eldest sister told me that she only remembered that the person she had just spoken to was me after hanging up the phone. &quot;That was Ah Hong just now.&quot; She murmured to herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her last days, although her husband and children took turns taking care of her, she also got a maid as she wished (people seem to like to judge a person&#39;s happiness in his later years), her The scene, her appearance, and the photo of her sitting alone on the hospital bed that I have buried deep in my heart always remind me of &quot;No Country for Old Men.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From beginning to end, she struggled alone, carrying her suffering and loneliness alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, she once asked me what &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; meant. She told me that a neighbor said that she and her father were homeless because three of their five children were abroad and no longer around. The woman said this in front of everyone while they were doing morning exercise at a nearby gym. My mother wrote down the four words &quot;no place for old people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when I watched &quot;Nowhere&quot;, I was no longer thinking of her. I was thinking about Natsuki and myself. Occasionally I would secretly lament that because of her and Xiamu&#39;s illness, I was thrown into such a fate and had to face a distant and unknown future early on. It’s as if our future has already arrived. We stumble, sometimes at a loss, sometimes patient, sometimes unmoved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe I should comfort myself in this way. On the last day, she was not sad or in pain, but had something to look forward to. At two o&#39;clock in the morning, she got up from the bed and told the maid Yuni that she had dreamed of her father and that she was going home. She said this without any sadness or fear. She wanted to go home, she always wanted to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She left during the day. She went to places unknown to us. Maybe she thought she was finally home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Nowhere&quot;, Jessica once asked those homeless people on wheels if they had ever thought about their future. Sylviane said the only thing she could do was to keep going and drive over the cliff like Thelma and Louise in Thelma and Louise. Alice says her body will remain in the desert forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know where my mother went. I don&#39;t know where we will go either. We never knew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Nomadland&quot; also has another name - &quot;Nomad Life&quot;. A long time ago, when talking about nomadic people in class, the teacher said that they &quot;lived in pursuit of water and grass.&quot; Wherever there is water and grass, that is their home. This is a life of constant searching, testing and trying. This is how people live, and so does mother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[联合国“近东救济工程处”：“加沙正被推向深渊”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258857]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D还原消失的海滩女童事件：警惕海滩的各种“隐形杀手”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258910]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 16:12:08&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[碧桂园辟谣“创始人父女已离境”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258869]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 15:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678022701523769&quot; data- media=&quot;video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;da5905d728f643fbae16817a69ac3075-ld-nbv1.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/48276b87vodtransgzp1251434507/5619700d55766 78022701523769/sampleSnapshot/sampleSnapshot_10_0. jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/5619700d5576678022701523769/MLInLoiOiu0A.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src =&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/5619700d5576678022701523769/MLInLoiOiu0A.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;October On the morning of the 19th, Country Garden issued a statement saying that the company was concerned about rumors that &quot;the founder&#39;s father and daughter may have left the country.&quot; The rumors were posted on multiple online platforms with ulterior motives, causing a negative impact.

Wang Xing, a defense lawyer from Beijing, questioned the identity of one of the prosecutors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the system of calling prosecutors from different places (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;abbreviated as &quot;referred to as &quot;remote prosecutors&quot;&lt;/span>;), the higher-level procuratorate can Prosecutors from lower-level procuratorates within the jurisdiction are called to handle cases on behalf of the court, and the called prosecutors can also be assigned to other lower-level procuratorates to handle cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that according to relevant laws, Chinese prosecutors have regional attributes, and the prerequisite for performing their duties is to be appointed by the standing committee of the local people&#39;s congress. For example, if the municipal procuratorate wants to transfer an prosecutor from District A Procuratorate to District B Procuratorate to handle a case, it should first remove the person from being a prosecutor from District A Procuratorate through the Municipal People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee, and then appoint him or her as an prosecutor from District B Procuratorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous practice, higher-level procuratorial organs often directly called prosecutors from lower-level procuratorates without going through the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The common feeling among lawyers is that when they raised objections to the identity of the prosecutor transferred from another place, the prosecutor either ignored it or said, &quot;It is under the dual leadership of the superior procuratorate and the local congress standing committee, so the superior The court has the right to invoke&quot; as a defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this time, the attitude of the prosecutor opposite Wang Xing was obviously relaxed. He made it clear that he would abide by the new rules to resolve the identity issue. &quot;If the appointment process of the local congress standing committee has not been completed by the time the court opens, he will not speak in court.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new rules refer to the highest The &quot;Regulations on Several Issues Concerning the Unified Dispatch of Prosecutorial Personnel from the Jurisdiction to Handle Cases by the People&#39;s Procuratorate at Higher Levels&quot; issued by the People&#39;s Procuratorate on September 5, 2023 stipulates that if the transferred prosecutors want to perform their duties as prosecutors, such as appearing in court to support public prosecutions, they need to In accordance with the law, the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level shall be asked to make appointments in accordance with legal procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The promulgation of this regulation means that the &quot;war of words&quot; between academic and practical circles over the off-site inspection system has come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Legal Identity&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As early as December 28, 2022, the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress reported on the 2022 filing review work situation that the prosecutors were called from other places. It requested that “relevant appointment decisions must be made by the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress at the corresponding level” and stated that “research opinions have been submitted to the relevant formulation agencies and it is recommended that they be considered.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the nine months since the new regulations were promulgated, some local prosecutors’ offices have accepted lawyers’ objections to the use of off-site inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Wang Xing also met two prosecutors from districts and counties at a pre-trial meeting on a fraud case prosecuted by the Yibin City Procuratorate in Sichuan Province. The prosecutor wanted to express his opinion, but Wang Xing told the judge directly: &quot;If he disagrees, don&#39;t let him speak until the issue (their qualifications) is resolved, so as not to invalidate the pre-trial conference.&quot; April 19, 2023 , the Standing Committee of the Yibin Municipal People’s Congress publicly appointed these two people as prosecutors of the Yibin Municipal People’s Procuratorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;boot&quot; was launched, a prosecutor from a municipal procuratorate in the southwest region told Southern Weekend: &quot;New regulations have been introduced, and (offsite inspections) must follow the regulations in principle. If they do not comply, once the lawyer proposes When it comes to the identity of prosecutors, the procuratorate will be very passive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, the new regulations stipulate the applicable circumstances for the use of off-site prosecutors, that is, when there are a large number of people involved in the case and the case is particularly serious and complex, And when the case handling capacity is difficult to bear, the superior court can uniformly call on prosecutors from the jurisdiction. Among them, prosecutors from higher-level courts can be sent to lower-level courts to handle cases, and prosecutors from lower-level courts can be transferred to higher-level courts, or to lower-level courts within their jurisdiction for support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important thing is that the new regulations standardize the calling procedures for remote inspections. Article 7 stipulates that once the case is settled, or the higher court terminates the call, the prosecutor will be removed from the aforementioned duties according to procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new regulations also take into account some exceptions. If a prosecutor from a higher court is transferred to a lower court within its jurisdiction; or if a higher court transfers a branch of its own court or dispatches a prosecutor from the procuratorate to its own court or another branch of this court or dispatches a procuratorate, it does not need to perform the prosecutor appointment procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A grassroots prosecutor told Southern Weekly that before this, when a higher court issued a transfer order, he had to go to the brother court at the same level to handle the case. The transfer period was usually three months, and he also I knew that &quot;the case investigators were seconded elsewhere and were not appointed by the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, so I actually had no legal status.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the National People’s Congress Standing Committee usually only arranges a meeting every two months, it may not be able to meet the prosecutor’s time limit for handling cases. The remedy provided by the new regulations is that before the local Congress Standing Committee makes an appointment, the prosecutor who is called can assist in handling the case as an assistant prosecutor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of Chen in Honghe, Yunnan, who was suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, the Honghe Prefecture Procuratorate transferred all six prosecutors at one time to assistant prosecutors to assist in completing court proceedings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the opinions of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate expert group, the biggest difference between prosecutors and assistant prosecutors is that important court duties such as reading out the indictment, interrogation, interrogation, cross-examination, defense and issuing opinions in court should be performed by the prosecutor. The former performs it in person; while the latter can only follow instructions and engage in supplementary and auxiliary work such as reading out evidence and assisting in multimedia demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Repeatedly caught in the whirlpool of public opinion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before the filing and review opinions of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress were made public, &quot;off-site inspection&quot; has repeatedly fallen into the whirlpool of public opinion in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the gang-related case of Wang Yongming in Baotou City, Inner Mongolia put the focus on off-site inspection. During the first trial of Wang Yongming&#39;s case, the defense lawyer reported in court that a prosecutor was suspected of soliciting bribes. Subsequently, the case was assigned jurisdiction by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region High Court and transferred to the Wuda District Court of Wuhai City for trial. During this period, the Procuratorate of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region mobilized 18 prosecutors and assistant prosecutors from across the autonomous region to form a public prosecution team. Some skeptics pointed out that the practice of prosecutors from the autonomous region procuratorate joining the public prosecutor team and appearing in court to support the prosecution would lead to an imbalance in prosecution and trial and violate procedural justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the Wang Yongming case, in the &quot;Fraud Case of Xie Liuqing and Other 63 People&quot; in Wuhu, Anhui, the procuratorate also formed a &quot;public prosecution team&quot; to appear in court. Because 42 of the defendants were found not guilty in the first instance of the case, the Wuhu Fanchang District Procuratorate filed a protest. In October 2021, during the second trial of the case, the list of persons appearing in court from the Procuratorate was circulated online. Among the public prosecutors, in addition to personnel from various grassroots procuratorial systems in Wuhu City, they also include personnel from the procuratorial systems in Hefei City, Tongling City and other provinces, totaling 11 prosecutors and 2 clerks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This approach has caused great controversy. &quot;Whether the off-site inspection system is legal and constitutional&quot; has once again been put in the spotlight and has become an issue that cannot be ignored by relevant departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Xing’s impression, in some major difficult or gang-related cases, it is “common” to use inspections in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The evolution of off-site prosecution first started with the unified calling of outstanding public prosecutors in the jurisdiction. The &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Public Prosecutions and Strengthening Legal Supervision&quot; issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in June 2005 mentioned that &quot;the People&#39;s Procuratorate at a higher level may select and deploy outstanding public prosecutors or business backbones to handle major and complex cases based on the needs of case handling.&quot; In 2011, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate promulgated the &quot;Regulations on Deploying Excellent Public Prosecutors to Handle Major Public Prosecution Cases (Trial)&quot;, which stipulates that if necessary, outstanding public prosecutors in the jurisdiction can be deployed to handle cases. The newly revised &quot;Organic Law of the People&#39;s Procuratorate of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; in 2018 officially clarified the off-site prosecutorial system in the form of legislation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of many legal scholars such as Long Zongzhi and Han Xu of Sichuan University, the off-site prosecutorial system is designed to meet the needs of prosecutors and case handling. First, after the reform of the quota system, prosecutors who have the power to handle cases The number has been significantly reduced compared with the past. On the other hand, with the frequent occurrence of major, difficult and socially sensitive cases, it is difficult for grassroots prosecutors to complete their charging tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Zhang Jianwei, a professor at Tsinghua University Law School, the introduction of this system is in response to new changes in the form of defense: in major and sensitive cases, as well as in many corruption or anti-gang cases, out-of-town defense The involvement of lawyers has increased, especially the number of well-known lawyers taking on defense roles, which requires procuratorial organs in various places to respond with a higher level of public prosecutions; on the other hand, lawyers have formed teams to defend co-defendants involved in the case, breaking the past tradition of each acting independently and acting independently. The form of defense brings great challenges to grassroots procuratorial organs. In order to improve the level of public prosecutions and cope with new changes in the prosecution and defense situation, the procuratorial organs have deployed elite soldiers to undertake public prosecutions in the future, thereby ensuring the quality of public prosecutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no dispute over the rationality of using off-site inspections. The disagreement lies in how to use it. There have always been voices within the prosecution system that hope to refine the regulations. Long Zongzhi, a professor at Sichuan University Law School, mentioned in an article: During the revision of the &quot;People&#39;s Procuratorate Criminal Procedure Rules&quot; in 2019, many provincial procuratorates hope to clarify the scope, procedures and prosecutors&#39; responsibilities of unified calls. However, the author believes that &quot;from the current point of view, further experience needs to be summarized on how to call it specifically.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/19/YvHZdv9yPLrNkeO1GlGgHfunUjzyC8A8h76MYB01.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19 /YvHZdv9yPLrNkeO1GlGgHfunUjzyC8A8h76MYB01.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate issued &quot;About the Higher People&#39;s Procuratorate&quot; on September 5, 2023 Provisions on the unified deployment of prosecutors in jurisdictions to handle certain issues in cases.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are different opinions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Han Xu&#39;s view, the new inspection regulations for remote use The introduction of the law is not unrelated to the supervision of the National People&#39;s Congress, the voice of the academic community, and the review suggestions raised by lawyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year before the prosecutor in the second instance of Xie Liuqing’s case was determined, lawyer Gan Weidong wrote a letter to the Supreme People’s Procuratorate. He quoted at the beginning the second paragraph of Article 9 of the “People’s Procuratorate’s Criminal Procedure Rules”: The decision to call should be made in writing, and the prosecutor who is called can perform various procuratorial duties such as appearing in court to support public prosecutions on behalf of the People&#39;s Procuratorate handling the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think this provision is both unconstitutional and has no basis in superior laws.&quot; He wrote bluntly in the letter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doing so means that prosecutors can break through the jurisdiction of the National People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee to handle cases in non-appointment jurisdictions, which directly undermines the People&#39;s Congress system.&quot; Gan Weidong told Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, 2020, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate 12309 Procuratorial Service Center gave a detailed reply to Qian Weidong, clearly stating that when higher-level procuratorates call prosecutors from lower-level procuratorates to handle cases, they can indeed go to the local congress standing committee. appointment procedures, but in practice it is often difficult to meet the needs of case handling, and even leads to case handling being overdue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, some local prosecutors appointed transferred personnel as assistant prosecutors of the court. This temporary status belongs to the prosecutor, but does not need to be appointed or removed by the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. With the advancement of the reform of classified management of prosecutors and the reform of the prosecutor quota system, the position of assistant prosecutor has been eliminated, and the transfer of prosecutors to perform their duties in other places has become a problem. In order to solve the legality of using prosecutors in other places, when the Organic Law of the People&#39;s Procuratorate was revised in 2018, it was clearly stipulated that the People&#39;s Procuratorate at a higher level &quot;can uniformly call prosecutors in the jurisdiction to handle cases.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Xu said that the unconditional &quot;remote inspection&quot; does not have legal legitimacy. However, since laws and judicial interpretations have established this system from the institutional level, &quot;off-site inspections should be used as little as possible and should not become the norm but only the exception.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 11, 2021, during the second trial of Xie Liuqing’s case, lawyers Wang Xing and Shen Yachuan submitted a request to the National People’s Congress Standing Committee to review the legality of the off-site prosecution clause in the “People’s Procuratorate’s Criminal Procedure Rules”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the alleged violation of the provisions of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at all levels on the appointment of prosecutors, the two lawyers also mentioned that the use of prosecutors in other places also violates the principle of criminal trial level jurisdiction and leads to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. Avoid problems such as the inability of the system to be implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a year after receiving the filing and review suggestions, the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress responded to the lawyers’ suggestions in the filing and review work report released on December 28, 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A scholar with knowledge of the situation revealed: “After the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on the need for the approval of the appointment of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee for the deployment of prosecutors came out, there were different opinions, but the Legal Affairs Committee insisted on moving to another location. Appointments must be approved by the local People’s Congress Standing Committee.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to solve the remaining problems? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;With the introduction of new regulations by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the procedures for using inspections in other places are no longer controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question that practitioners are most concerned about now is how to deal with cases that have previously been handled by prosecutors without following the opinions of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;two highs&quot; also noticed this. On September 15, 2023, 10 days after the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate issued the new regulations, the &quot;two highs&quot; jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Issues Concerning the Unified Dispatch of Prosecutorial Personnel from the Jurisdiction to Handle Cases by the People&#39;s Procuratorates at Higher Levels&quot;, which clearly mentioned that for cases that have taken effect Judgment: If the complainant files a complaint on the grounds that the prosecutor who was transferred has not been appointed by the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level, and does not meet the circumstances that require a new trial under the Criminal Procedure Law, the complainant must be persuaded to withdraw the complaint; if he persists in the complaint, he shall be notified in writing. turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice also stipulates that for cases that have entered the second instance procedure, the second instance court shall not revoke the original ruling and remand the case for retrial on the grounds that the prosecutor called during the first instance was not appointed by the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Xu still has questions: Who will lead and supervise the prosecutor who was called? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He noticed that some prosecutors from higher-level procuratorates who were transferred to other places may have a higher rank than the chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate. As a result, it would be difficult for the chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate to lead the prosecutors of the higher-level procuratorate. . He has researched prosecutors who participated in &quot;off-site prosecution&quot; and found that in practice, there are indeed situations where &quot;higher-level procuratorate prosecutors who are transferred to lower-level procuratorates do not dare to supervise or have lax supervision because of their higher rank.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, when the called prosecutor is not suitable to continue participating in the case, who will make the decision to recuse himself? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new regulations mention that if it is discovered during the handling of a case that the prosecutor being called has circumstances that require him to recuse himself as required by law, the prosecutor being called should recuse himself, and the parties and their legal representatives have the right to request that they recuse themselves. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to the Criminal Procedure Law, the chief prosecutor should be responsible for the recusal of prosecutors. However, prosecutors who are transferred from other places are usually decided by the superior prosecutorial agency. In this case, whether the recusal of the transferred person is decided by the prosecutor general of the superior procuratorial agency or by the prosecutor general of the prosecutor&#39;s office where he is transferred? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jianwei&#39;s point of view is that because the call is often decided by the superior procuratorate, if there is a situation where the prosecutor needs to recuse himself during the call, then &quot;whoever dispatches the prosecutor will decide to recuse himself&quot;; but if the prosecutor is called When personnel have begun handling cases on behalf of the procuratorate to which a specific case belongs, &quot;for the sake of efficiency, the issue of recusal should be decided by the chief prosecutor of the procuratorate handling the case.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether relevant departments will issue more detailed judicial interpretations or corresponding regulations for off-site inspections in the future, Zhang Jianwei, who once served as deputy director of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, expressed his expectation, but has not yet done so. Hear about the plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[警方通报男子当街性侵醉酒女子：网传信息不属实]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258863]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/lREj0mw3STng0v2EnzvQY0D3hMsQdkBAAiocNZ9O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2008&quot; height=&quot;4631&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/lREj0mw3STng0v2EnzvQY0D3hMsQd kBAAiocNZ9O. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[老年相亲的奇观，“等你老了就明白了”｜记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258792]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73058&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;69896&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/c79f0bdf96.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;a0567795b9e103e6d94ea8797e82c17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;September 2023, Shanghai, IKEA restaurant Elderly people inside.

Take a deep breath, try to reverse your tired state, and cheer up to deal with a new group - a group of old single Shanghainese, who will definitely be bored. But to my surprise, they were much more interesting than I imagined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First, a man in sunglasses who was over sixty years old came up to me and greeted me. He thought I was looking for company. After all, there are many young women coming to this place.&quot; fishing&quot;. After learning that I was a reporter, he told me mysteriously that he was recently writing an article &quot;The Confusion of Love&quot;. He raised his head and began to sigh, &quot;How much time does a person have to wait for your love? This society is If you don’t have regret medicine, you will be farther and farther away from love when you reach 60 years old.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The man in sunglasses waved his arm and pointed at the dark old age behind him People, the blurry background in my eyes immediately became clear, and the individuals were distinct. &quot;Nowadays, we often don’t talk about the spiritual aspect, but mainly because of the house and the car. Many people have not found a partner, left, and are eclipsed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Indeed, straight to the point is The characteristic here is that everyone talks about their conditions, including financial conditions, physical conditions, physiological needs, etc. After a few sentences, it is clear what the other party is after. 68-year-old Hong Jianming said that everyone knows what level it should go to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Jianming said that the water here is very deep. Men want women to be beautiful, and women want men to be rich. &quot;You see, I am so handsome, but I have not found a partner. Because they know that I can’t support them.” I spent four afternoons in the IKEA restaurant, and most of the people I met described it to me as a dangerous place with all kinds of traps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many stories of &quot;liars&quot; circulating here, and the ones most likely to fall for them are Shanghai seniors over eighty years old. &quot;There is a woman in her 30s and 40s who comes here specifically to deceive people in their 70s and 80s. The older the better, the sooner she will die. She just bought several houses like this.&quot; Several women gathered around me and started talking. A common trick used by female swindlers is to make the elderly &quot;take the bait&quot; first with their young and beautiful appearance. Marriage is the most critical step in dividing the property. Frequent sex can accelerate the decline of the elderly, and the steps are steady and ruthless. A woman next to her with heavy black eye shadow interrupted, &quot;Pretty girls are all liars and will kill the old man.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Men seeking mates also believe in this trick. Conspiracy theories, on the one hand, they want to expose their wealth as much as possible to attract the attention of women; on the other hand, they must always be on guard to prevent the bad guys from succeeding. Similarly, there are also &quot;liars&quot; among men who have other agendas. They &quot;fish&quot; by exaggerating their financial resources just to sleep with the women who &quot;take the bait&quot;. From time to time there are men who get into fights in restaurants over a woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nevertheless, they will still dive into the IKEA restaurant without hesitation, because &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is just the tip of the iceberg here. In the past few years, the staff of the IKEA restaurant tried several times to drive these loud and noisy old people out of the area, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The elderly are too lonely. These people we have now can still walk, but we won&#39;t know in a few years.&quot; Hong Jianming said this As we were talking, a gray-haired old man was passing by in front of us, using a cane to move step by step, &quot;You see, this kind of old man is so weird. What is he doing here? He is just bored. Listen and see.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;IKEA restaurant brings them more than just a place to listen and see. Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, someone will organize everyone to have dinner together, especially restaurants that have special offers on Tuesdays. For example, one restaurant will give away a plate of stir-fried beef cubes worth 138 yuan on Tuesday. It is delicately placed on one end of a smooth rectangular plate with more than a dozen beef cubes. For this free signature dish, they have paid Been here dozens of times. There are more people, more food, and it’s cheaper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 19, I came to the IKEA restaurant for the third time. I learned that someone here had organized everyone to travel to other places together, and everyone contributed some money. They are an elderly group, taking care of each other; I also saw them talking about sex and love boldly here, even to the point of making the people discussing it red-faced, but when they went out, no one knew each other. Without that atmosphere, it would be difficult to say some words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After dinner that day, Hong Jianming, who had always been very humorous, suddenly told me in a serious tone that he often came out of the poker hall at around 1 o&#39;clock in the morning, and would Walk around the IKEA restaurant and People&#39;s Park and chat with people. In the bottom of his heart, he actually looked down on the group of old people in front of him who only talked about trivial matters. They were incomparable with his colleagues at his previous job, but there was nothing he could do about it when he was old. When he retired and got sick, he had to retire to the place where old people should go. place, go to the old people to seek a sense of identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What disappoints Hong Jianming the most is that his son dislikes him. &quot;He didn&#39;t explicitly say he disliked me, but I am his father. I don&#39;t know he is there yet.&quot; What are you thinking about? Pretending to be useless.&quot; Every time his son came home to visit him with something, the two of them would repeat a scene: the son would look at his watch from time to time and quickly find an excuse to leave, &quot;I said you can leave, and he would immediately gone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hong Jianming can see his son&#39;s dislike in all aspects. His son would never take the initiative to call and ask; his calls to his son were rarely answered, and his son would suddenly call him after a long time and ask him, &quot;What&#39;s the matter, Dad? I was busy in front of me and didn&#39;t hear you.&quot; It was always the same. so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are too many examples like this in IKEA restaurants. I learned from several people one after another that they had children and finally arrived. In his twilight years, he still has to live alone, with the house and pension in his hands being his last source of confidence. The IKEA restaurant is just a microcosm of the elderly group. You can imagine the phenomenon outside this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 21, I went to the IKEA restaurant for the last time. Until 9:30 in the evening, there were still four old people staying in the restaurant chatting. They said they couldn&#39;t sleep even after returning and it was good to chat. They said that I was still young and did not understand how powerless it felt to push time towards the end. I have heard this sentence several times: &quot;You will understand when you are old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;I really can’t empathize with it, I just think the topic is heavy. On the other hand, although in their mouths, 80-year-old Song Xiaofei is a confused person who gave 8,000 yuan of his pension to a 40-year-old out-of-town woman just to let her accompany him; 78-year-old Lao Zhang is also a confused person. Man, spending 300 yuan a day on a young woman to keep you company is a waste of money. But in my opinion, maybe it is rare to be sober. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After all, when people reach their twilight years, there is not much time left. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
