She and her husband spent 7 years saving 1 million yuan. After part of it was used to buy a house, the remaining 500,000 yuan was deposited in the bank. Now the monthly living costs can be covered by interest alone. She also shared a series of ways to save money, such as cooking at home for many years, not drinking coffee outside, only buying discounted clothes, taking her children to sunbathe instead of taking interest classes, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the authenticity of this experience has not been verified, in February this year, a Shanghai couple did decide to &quot;retire&quot; with a deposit of 3 million yuan. This news sparked widespread discussion at the time. Just recently, Professor Chen Bingzheng from the Department of Finance at the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University was interviewed by CCTV Finance. He mentioned that “a survey found that over 70% of those born after 90 start to think about pension issues.” He said that it is too late to start thinking about pension issues at the age of 35. From work After receiving your first month’s salary, you should start saving for retirement in a planned way. It can be seen that young people’s anxiety about saving money for retirement is not an idle complaint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much savings do you think you need to retire from the workplace with peace of mind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Come to the comment area to express your opinion, and we will send you a hot comment immediately! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 20:25:58 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[董明珠称孟羽童兼职接广告不合规：非工作时间能否干副业？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260289]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 20:20:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In May this year, Dong Mingzhu’s secretary Meng Yutong resigned, triggering various speculations and discussions. Recently, in an interview with Guangdong Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;Financial Eyes&quot;, Dong Mingzhu responded publicly to the matter for the first time: Internet celebrities do not judge people&#39;s quality, and it is illegal for people to advertise outside Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dong Mingzhu said Meng Yutong’s part-time job accepting advertisements was illegal” was once a hot search topic. According to a report by the Shanghai Securities News on May 16, the reason for Meng Yutong&#39;s resignation was that he &quot;often missed work to participate in business activities and take on private work&quot; during his time at the company. After the company talked to him, he still carried out related activities without improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, Meng Yutong did receive advertisements on social media platforms. In the short videos on his Xiaohongshu account, he appeared many times selling clothing, beauty products, electronic products and household goods. In the &quot;Good Things Pocket&quot; column, there are 65 notes included, none of which have anything to do with Gree Electric products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally thought that the rights and wrongs of this incident were very clear. However, many netizens believe that the contract Meng Yutong signed with Gree is a labor contract, not an endorsement contract. The time outside the eight hours is her own. Of course, she has the right to control how much she earns through endorsements and part-time advertising. Money is a reflection of her ability. This has also led to some discussions: Is it appropriate for the company to restrict employees from doing side jobs? If the income from your main job is not as good as your side job, will you leave your job? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this point of view and these discussions? First of all, it must be said unequivocally that it is not appropriate to use Meng Yutong&#39;s case to demonstrate the rationality of employees taking part-time jobs or doing side jobs outside of their own jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Yutong did graduate from a prestigious university, has a sweet appearance, and has good looks, but these qualities are not sufficient or necessary conditions to become an Internet celebrity. There are a lot of people with these qualities, but only a few lucky ones are successful. The track for Internet celebrities is very crowded and very winding. If someone says that Meng Yutong’s ability to become an Internet celebrity depends entirely or mainly on his personal abilities, that is undoubtedly not objective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that Meng Yutong became an Internet celebrity mainly due to Dong Mingzhu’s efforts on top of his buildable personal qualities. Dong Mingzhu made her his secretary, and announced that he would train her to be his successor and take her to various occasions. Through the event, many hot searches and topics were created, bringing her countless traffic. Dong Mingzhu is working hard to make her the first person to bring goods to Gree live broadcast. In this sense, Meng Yutong, who has become an Internet celebrity, is an asset of Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Dong Mingzhu and Gree are obviously old-school, hoping that gentlemen&#39;s agreement and personal consciousness will have sufficient behavioral constraints on Meng Yutong, rather than &quot;first Before the company invests resources in an individual, it ensures and locks in potential future earnings, and limits and eliminates the risk of breach of trust of a sparrow that turns into a phoenix and then soars into the sky and escapes control. That is, the contract stipulates the rights and obligations of both parties and improves the The cost of breach of trust should be taken into account before you can safely invest in betting and package marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when it was discovered that Meng Yutong was using the Internet celebrity identity created by the company to do private work, Dong Mingzhu and Gree did not immediately send a clear and strong signal saying &quot;this is not acceptable&quot;, but The reason is that there was no timely intervention or the intensity of the intervention was not enough. The mentality may be that the matter can be solved quietly internally, through reasoning and persuasion, so as to prevent the matter from turning into a negative incident or scandal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if Meng Yutong had been given a clear choice the first time he did private work, either to stop and hand over the proceeds from his private work, or to leave, the problem might have been solved long ago. When Meng Yutong took on more and more private jobs and his income outside of work became higher and higher, it became difficult for him to stop. At a certain stage, Dong Mingzhu could no longer tolerate it and had to resolve it through a final showdown, which brought us to the scene in May this year. Therefore, if there is something wrong with Dong Mingzhu and Gree, it is that they made the above two mistakes one after another. But this does not disprove that it is in line with professional ethics for Meng Yutong to use the Internet celebrity status created by the company to do private work and make big money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there is no simple answer to whether employees can work part-time or do side jobs outside of their regular jobs, and it needs to be analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it depends on whether there are express provisions on this in the labor contract or other types of contracts signed with the company or organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, units within the system generally have some clear restrictions on employees&#39; part-time work, and will regularly conduct inspections on employees in this regard, allowing employees to declare on their own. Of course you can lie or conceal the situation, but if your employer finds out, you will inevitably be punished or even lose your job. In addition, well-regulated companies generally prohibit employees from receiving remuneration from competitors, suppliers or customers. This not only potentially harms the company&#39;s interests, but may also lead to criminal investigation in serious cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it depends on the nature of your part-time job or side job, and whether there is any conflict of interest with your work in the unit and the business of the unit. You are a salesperson and have accumulated a lot of customer resources. At a certain stage, if you set up a business and go it alone, the company may not be able to do anything to you. However, if you secretly set up a business with a similar nature to the company while receiving a salary from the company, A company that imports customer resources into its own company is undoubtedly against professional ethics, and the company may not let it go if it finds out. Or if you are a technical R&amp;D person and sell the code you wrote in the company to a competing company or other companies, or take work from a competing company, this will also damage the company&#39;s rights and interests and seriously violate professional ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, &quot;Besides the eight-hour working time, it is all your own time, you can do whatever you want.&quot; This statement must be at least restricted by the above two rules. In the final analysis, it means respecting the contract and Observe professional ethics. As long as it does not violate the contract and company regulations, does not harm the company&#39;s rights and interests, has no conflict of interest with the company, and does not affect the main job, generally speaking, the company has no objection to individuals doing side jobs and part-time jobs to increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 20:25:58 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[桐子故事丨峡河西流去]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260210]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;701&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tongzi flowers bloom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Xiahe to Luanzhuang, we have to cross three ridges. It&#39;s not the three ridge heads, it&#39;s the third ridge head counting from Taoping. Taoping has now changed from a township to an administrative village. It is where the Santiao Ridge originates and the Yitiao Ridge begins. Going further south is the Funiu Mountains and then enters Nanyang. Why it is called Santiaoling instead of Sandaoling or something else is not clear. Indeed, the word &quot;Tiao&quot; is a bit strange, as if it is a ridge rather than a mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The side of Santiao Ridge near Luanzhuang is a ten-mile downhill slope. At the bottom of the slope is the Bada River. After crossing the river and going five miles eastward, you will reach Luanzhuang Town. Luanzhuang Town has been the capital of Luanzhuang since the Republic of China, the so-called economic, cultural, transportation and power center. The ancient town that was more than a hundred years old now has no trace of the past. Instead, there are concrete buildings rising from the ground on both sides of the Luanzhuang River, which is sometimes dirty and sometimes clear. Everything sold on the street is modern. For example, household appliances used for heating in winter are electric braziers instead of charcoal. Even the dogs running on the street have many fashionable hair styles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the side of the ten-mile downhill road, there are all tung trees. Of course, that was a scene more than thirty years ago. Nowadays, it is all pine trees and arrowgrass. The pine trees are overbearing and the arrowgrass is not a fuel-efficient lamp. With them, there is no one else. There are only a few tung trees here and there, and the old-fashioned people have nowhere to stand. In today&#39;s spring and summer, the mountains are green and interspersed with wild flowers of strange colors. Walking through this place gives people the excitement and satisfaction of returning home in rich clothes. In winter, half of the mountains are green and half are withered and yellow, like a failed oil painting. The economy of small places is not good. Traffic management personnel hide in those curves, use the terrain and vegetation to catch illegal motorcycles, and fine them to generate revenue. They catch them accurately. Unless there is an urgent matter, people rarely ride there. If you want to go there, you will choose morning or evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than thirty years ago, I was a junior high school student in Luanzhuang Town. At that time, most of my classmates didn&#39;t like studying very much, and it seemed that going to school was just to complete tasks to pass the time of their youth. In comparison, I love studying more, but compared with those brain-burning words and numbers, I still love things that have nothing to do with grades, such as tung seeds, from tung flower to tung seeds, I love them all. No matter what, it just feels good. I feel that they are mine and I am theirs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers bloom in March. At this time, many flowers have finished. The peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, pear blossoms and begonia flowers have all disappeared, but more summer flowers have not yet arrived. The day is already very warm. At this time, it suddenly gets cold, and there may even be snow. When the temperature becomes warm again, the tung flowers will bloom. The adults said that the tung flowers are still frozen by the cold wind. The tung flower is neither beautiful nor ugly, neither big nor small, but its aroma is different, it is a delicate fragrance, and the smell is very similar to its color and shape: white petals inlaid with light red ones. Each flower and branch is similar, like twin sisters. The tung flower blooms on one slope, so vast and dense that no one else can be seen. From a distance, the flowers on a slope look like chatty words that no one can talk about. Unlike other flowers, there are red, green and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many children at that time. If they all rushed to school together, there would be a long queue from front to back. The front is in the Tung Blossom Array, and the back is still on the other side of the ridge. The front is across the Bada River, and the back is still in the Flower Array. Everyone who goes to school carries a net bag, and the white buns, black buns and mixed-noodle buns in the pockets are clearly visible. Girls love vanity. They cover the buns with a layer of newspapers so that they can only see the prosperous scene of the motherland but not the buns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers have one use: treating burns. At the mouth of the Bascha River, there was an old Taoist priest who had returned to secular life. He was very old, bent over, and his beard and hair were all white. He often goes to the mountains to collect fallen tung flowers. The fallen tung flowers were spread all over the ground, as dense as tree heads. The strange thing was that there was no decrease in the trees, as if they were growing while falling. He carries a woven bag and collects a bag of fallen flowers. I don’t know what he did with it when he took it back. He mixed it with other ingredients, mixed it into a paste, put it in large and small bottles, and applied it on the injured person’s burns. I don’t know which year the old Taoist priest died, and the prescription for treating burns was taken away with him. He had no children, and no one passed him on. Besides, he couldn&#39;t make a living by treating burns. There weren&#39;t many burns all year round. He doesn&#39;t rely on this for a living either. If you get burnt, you have to go to the hospital and spend a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months after the tung flower bloomed, the tung seeds came out. They were all green and tender, but they were actually too hard to be broken open. The boys were throwing it at each other and hitting a bag on their heads. If you smash it open with a stone, you will find that the tung seeds are white and plump and crowded together. They are very fragrant when chewed in your mouth. They are more delicious than walnut kernels, but after a while, you will have a headache and nausea. The shell of the tung seeds removed and dried in the sun is a good material for making fires, which is perfect for burning the kang in winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school cafeteria only has one kind of rice, corn grits soup and porridge made from corn grits over high and slow fire. It only has breakfast and lunch. In the evening, you can only eat your own steamed buns or cook them until dawn. The food for dinner is very important. It must have oil and water, but most of them don’t have oil and water. It’s okay to have no oil and water. There are some varieties, but there are few varieties. It’s just a bucket of garlic juice mixed with sauerkraut, and the amount is limited, so it must be distributed reasonably. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a lacquer tree in front of Jinsuo&#39;s house. It is more than three feet tall and as thick as a hug. Such a large lacquer tree is rare. In summer, it blocks the sky and the sun, but in autumn, the lacquer seeds can be broken down to boil a large pot of lacquer seed oil. Lacquer seed oil is also a kind of edible oil, and can also be used to light lamps. On the way to send the deceased, a burning lantern can be lit. But the tree is too old, half prosperous and half withered, and half of the tree trunk is rotten. One summer, after a rain, a large mushroom grew on the dry side of the tree. It was red and yellow in color, like a flaming cloud falling from the western sky. The sumac mushroom is one of the finest tree mushrooms. It is tender and delicious and can be served on banquets. Jinsuo and I broke it off and filled a basin full of it, but he had no oil at home and couldn&#39;t find it after searching through the cabinets and corners. I said, if there is a way, go get the tung seeds to refine the oil. We went up to Santiao Ridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to refine oil from tung seeds. We picked a basket of tung fruits, smashed them open, dug out the tung seeds, crushed them with a garlic mortar, boiled them in a pot, removed the residue, and made a bowl of oil. I heard adults say that no matter what kind of oil it is, as long as it contains poison, it will be fine. When the tung seeds are boiled in a pot, the water vapor is boiled away and the smoke is released, which is considered to be poisonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We had vomiting and diarrhea all night. Jinsuo’s father gave us washing powder and water, and he stopped only the next day. Fortunately, I didn’t eat much that day and put in less oil. We didn&#39;t go to school for three days. We were both in the third grade of junior high school that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years later, Jinsuo went to college and I went to the mines, and our fates parted ways from then on. I don’t have his phone number, and he doesn’t have any contact channels with me. After his parents died, we knew nothing about each other. The only thing we vaguely knew was that he went to Europe after not working for a few years, married a wife, and settled down in a foreign country. Become your hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only remaining tung trees on Santiao Ridge will bloom a few branches in some years. The scattered tung flowers are hidden among the green bushes, which are more beautiful than the large stretches of tung flowers and do not look lonely at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;二&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tung fruit usually matures in mid-to-late October. The fruit changes from green to light red, and finally turns to dark brown, and it is ready for harvest. The pedicle of the tung fruit is very strong and closely connected to the branches. Unlike walnuts and chestnuts, which are easy to knock off, harvesting the tung fruits is a very slow and hard work. If the branches are not high, it is best for women and children to pick them by hand. Fast. The men climbed up the tree, beat it with bamboo poles, and beat the tree branches into hairless ghosts. There were always a few tung fruits that remained motionless, and in the end they had no choice but to leave them for the next year. Tongzi&#39;s body was heavy, and transportation was also a laborious task. A good laborer had to carry a basket, and he was hunched over and panting due to the exertion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of hammers is very wide. Almost any work related to breaking can be solved by pounding. The most effective way to produce tung rice is to thoroughly dry the tung fruits and pour them into a wormwood pit and pound them. This work is usually done by women and children. The cleaned rice is white and tender, like suet. We children were caught in the middle and busy, and when others were not prepared, we threw a pill in our mouths, and the adults picked it out, and vomited all over the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the oil squeezed from tung seeds. The process of pressing tung oil is similar to that of peanut oil. When I was a child, I had a good deed and a monkey spirit. I participated in the oil extraction work of adults many times. I don’t remember the tedious details. I only remember the transparency and purity of tung oil. There is no corresponding reference for the light yellow color, so I can’t describe it. , using one thing to describe and explain another thing, this ancient and omnipotent language method completely fails in the face of tung oil. The squeezed tung oil was put in pots and bowls, and outsiders came to buy it. Although they couldn&#39;t sell it for much, they made money from the oil, salt, sauce and vinegar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the best paint for furniture, and Master Lin is the best painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, a carpenter is also a painter, and a painter is also a carpenter. It is rare that a family hires a carpenter, and then hires a painter after finishing the furniture. A carpenter does not necessarily have to be talented, but he must be versatile. Otherwise, he would not be able to compete with hundreds of others. There is only Master Lin, who only knows how to paint. He knows nothing about the carpenter&#39;s work, but because his craftsmanship is so good, even if he has a unique skill, he still has no worries about making a living. eat. Because his craftsmanship is so good, his peers often lose their way out, making people both admire and hate them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin is not a local either. Some say he is from Henan, some say he is from Hubei, and some say he is from Sichuan. If he does not say it himself, others will just guess. People&#39;s basis is his accent, but for people who have been away for a long time, eating in all directions and enjoying the scenery in all directions, the local accent has long since disappeared, leaving behind a mixed accent. Master Lin was forty years old when he came to Xiahe. His craftsmanship was not learned in Xiahe, but brought from afar. He became a master as soon as he arrived. He himself said that it was a family tradition, and naturally everyone believed this statement. Most good craftsmanship comes from family traditions. Forty-year-old Master Lin arrived in Xiahe and married a woman at the age of forty-one, which naturally benefited from his good craftsmanship. The woman is seventeen or eighteen years younger than him, and she is still a girl. Her name is Liu Lanhua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua’s father is a mat craftsman and has been weaving reed mats all her life. When you go out to weave, you also weave at home. People who need it come to buy it or exchange it with it. Liu Xijiang&#39;s career as a mat craftsman consists of two methods, half of which is home-based work, and the other half of which is a family workshop. When Liu Xijiang got old, he didn&#39;t go out anymore. He kept a reed garden on the mountain behind his house. It was five or six acres, and it was enough for people with a radius of dozens of miles. Craftsman Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life and has saved some money. He is considered a wealthy family in the surrounding area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, people were too poor to afford coffins. When most people died, they were rolled into the earth with a reed mat. Naturally, the reed mat was made by craftsman Liu Xi. The craftsman Liu Xishan weaved from east to west mountains, weaving from day to night. Half of the mats weaved were used to dry food and half were used to roll people. Later, people&#39;s lives became more relaxed, and some people began to use coffin boards. Of course, reed mats were not absent from the burial. Later, everyone switched to coffin boards, and there was no such thing as reed mats. There are stars and moon, and at this time, someone begins to paint the coffin to make the deceased sleep more peacefully and longer underground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Carpenter Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life, and saw countless people being swept away by what he weaved with his own hands, but from the bottom of his heart, he did not approve of the way of sweeping people to their graves. He felt that it was really a waste of human life. . Similarly, he also hated the way people later painted coffins with chemical paint bought from the street. Not only was it not antiseptic, but how could the smell make people feel peaceful? In short, people are too busy in this life and have never had a good night&#39;s sleep. When they leave and enter another world, they must sleep more peacefully and more solidly. Liu Xijiang&#39;s greatest ideal is to have a tung oil coffin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin helped him realize this ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the whole village, young and old, witnessed the great and spectacular process of tung oil changing from raw oil to mature oil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin built a waist-high earthen stove in the yard of Liu Xijiang’s house. He set up a large iron pot on the stove and burned it with oak firewood. The smooth and clean stones are put into the pot and stir-fried. After the stones are hot, raw tung oil is poured in. There must be some care about how much to pour. Master Lin just pours it without saying anything. Then the pot swelled, and as the temperature rose higher and higher, the water vapor in the tung oil gradually evaporated. There was a fragrance in the air, and the fragrance was overwhelming, covering the whole yard like a big blanket. But the fragrance was something that no one had ever smelled before. It was so strong and unrestrained that I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was good or bad. At this time, everyone saw oily flowers blooming from the tung oil in the pot. Master Lin quickly added a shovelful of powdery stuff. After a while, a layer of white foam appeared on the surface of the tung oil, and thick yellow smoke came out. Master Lin directed a young man to stir vigorously with a wooden stick, and the foam quickly combined with the tung oil. At this time, the color of the smoke changed from yellow to black, and the thick smoke rose straight into the sky and gradually dissipated. Master Lin used a wooden stick to pick out a strand of tung oil, dripped it on the stone, dipped his fingers in the tung oil and stretched it upwards, pulling out a long filament. Master Lin ordered people to quickly put out the fire under the pot and shouted: It&#39;s done! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people watching were curious, nervous, and confused, as if they were in a dream. I feel that Master Lin is really amazing. I just realized that tung oil can be boiled into something good. In the past, I always sold the tung oil raw, which is a pity. Several years later, when boiling tung oil was no longer a unique skill, everyone realized that the powdery things were soil powder and camphor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cypress coffin board, which has been brushed three times with mature tung oil from the outside to the inside, is like a multi-sided mirror, reflecting the strange and curious faces of a group of people, the sun in the sky and the wandering clouds. . To prove the efficacy of tung oil, Master Lin poured a bucket of water into the coffin. When he poured it in, the bucket was full, and when he scooped it out, the bucket was full, no more, no less. Liu Xijiang said that this stupid tung oil could protect one&#39;s body for a thousand years! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Master Lin and Liu Lanhua had a daughter named Lin Ping&#39;er. Liu Lanhua has a good figure and two nice buttocks, which are like a ball of cotton. She can be as plump as she wants. It doesn&#39;t matter how many children she has, but she doesn&#39;t dare to have children. The policy is tight and she can&#39;t afford the fine. The year Master Lin left, Lin Ping&#39;er was thirteen years old and still in junior high school. After all, Liu Lanhua and Master Lin have been husband and wife for fourteen years. Liu Lanhua was really reluctant to leave Master Lin. On the day of the burial, it was raining, and Liu Lanhua was soaked from head to toe. Some said it was rain, some said it was tears, but it was both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything counts. Master Lin has lived in Xiahe for fourteen years, and his career as a tung oil craftsman has lasted fourteen years. It is neither long nor short, but the tung oil he has used and the furniture he has painted, I don&#39;t know how to measure it clearly. The craftsmanship he passed down and the industry he promoted intentionally or unintentionally came to an abrupt end five years after he left. According to the new economic development requirements and the transformation of rural industries, the superiors required that tung trees be abandoned and pine trees be planted instead. An industry or an industry finally withered and died with the changes of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day a year, Master Lin sent Lin Pinger to school. The school was in the town. He picked her up on Saturday and sent her to school on Sunday. He rides a big car, with his schoolbag and dry food bag hanging on the front of the car, and his daughter on the back seat of the car. Three ridges below the car, Tongzi flowers are blooming, flowers on the road, flowers outside the road, the head is connected to the tail, the tail is connected to the head, people and cars are passing through the flowers, the sky is above the head, the fragrance of the flowers in the nostrils is really exciting So happy. Master Lin thought, this year will be a good harvest again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The car arrived at Erdaopan, where there was a spring with clear water gurgling sweetly and sweetly all year round. People, birds, and small animals come and go here to drink water and rest. Because the pool is at a low level, people need to kneel down and stretch their necks to drink the water. There is a legend that there is a fish spirit in the spring. It has been worshiped by people for a long time and has achieved enlightenment. Sometimes it comes out at night to clean the dirt in the pool, so that the spring will always be pure and pure, but no one has ever seen it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin was a little hungry. He divided a cake in half, half for himself and half for his daughter, and ate it with spring water. When he took the second bite, he felt that the cake was stuck in his throat, unable to go up or down. He picked up a handful of water and poured it down, but it didn&#39;t work. He knew what was going on. He remembered that his mother was in the same situation. She was stuck like this for several years and then left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coffin that Master Lin asked the craftsmen to build for him was a Paulownia wood coffin. The Paulownia wood is soft and does not rot, but the advantage is that it takes no effort to obtain. A row of big trees grows beside the yard. , using local materials. Liu Lanhua said, it&#39;s still early, let the tree grow for a few more years. Master Lin said, it’s getting late and you have to prepare morning and evening. Liu Lanhua said, prepare a bite for me too. Master Lin said, it&#39;s still early for you, let the tree grow for a few more years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The spectacular scene of Master Lin boiling tung oil for himself was exactly the same as the scene when he boiled tung oil for the first time in Liu Xijiang’s yard fourteen years ago. There were many onlookers and many who helped. Although this technology is no longer a secret at this time. When the firewood at the bottom of the pot was finally removed, Liu Lanhua was a little panicked and punched a hole in the bottom of the pot, and the boiled tung oil poured down. Although everyone tried hard to save it, only one third of the shiny good stuff was saved. , the missing part turned into a burst of fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin’s coffin board was halfway painted and he ran out of tung oil. He had to go to the street to buy a bucket of foreign paint to finish the other half. Master Lin sighed and said, this is fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years after Master Lin left, one day, Liu Lanhua received a letter with an unknown address and unknown sender. The recipient&#39;s name was Lin Yide. Liu Lanhua didn&#39;t recognize the middle character in the name, so she asked her daughter Lin Ping&#39;er. Lin Ping&#39;er was in high school at this time and there were no characters she didn&#39;t recognize. She said that character was pronounced &quot;yì&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua initially thought that the sender had written the address and name wrong, and wanted to return it. Her husband&#39;s name was Lin Jianye, and she had never heard of this strange name. The rural postman said that there was nothing wrong, the postal code was correct. Besides, who knew where to return it and to whom? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua opened the letter and read it. After finishing speaking, she realized that the sender had not sent the wrong address and recipient. After she finished reading the letter, she quietly wiped away tears, then threw the letter into the pot hole and burned it. The burned letter did not turn into ashes, but kept the shape of the paper. It floated out of the stove hole, flew out of the yard, and was in the air. Floating. Liu Lanhua said in her heart, just let it go. I have read it, and you have read it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ping&#39;er came out of the room with a piece of clothing and asked what it was written on. Liu Lanhua said that there was nothing written. Someone sent the letter to the wrong place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[东西方贵族是如何消亡的？从贵族到精英是身份政治的式微]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260200]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Lucy Challenger, a blogger who claims to be a &quot;British etiquette expert&quot;, posted a video on TikTok, Teach netizens how to eat rice with a knife and fork in formal occasions. She believes that in a Western environment, one should not eat rice with hands, spoons or chopsticks, but should push the rice to the top of the back of the fork with a table knife and then put it elegantly into the mouth, which can appear more educated and graceful. This &quot;aristocratic&quot; video triggered all kinds of ridicule and ridicule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese people also like to emphasize the concept of nobility, such as nobility in houses, cars, and clothing brands... Even a few days ago, I even saw the &quot;nobility&quot; in latex paint in building materials stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They say they are aristocrats, but in fact they are mostly consumption paranoia. The social group of aristocrats has died, or is close to death, in both Eastern and Western societies. It is also an interesting historical review journey to have a general understanding of the birth, development, decline, and demise of aristocrats in Eastern and Western societies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In ancient Eastern and Western societies, aristocrats were born almost at the same time in the early stages of civilization. The development can be roughly divided into three major historical stages: classical aristocracy, ancient aristocracy, and modern aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aristocracy began in the Western Zhou Dynasty and Spring and Autumn Period in the East, and emerged in the Republic of Ancient Rome in the West. Because they arose in the early days of agricultural society, the classical nobility in the East and West all originated from large landowners. In the Spring and Autumn Period in the East, princes were nobles, and the feudal system was an ancient system of large land ownership. Dining with bells and dishes, wine pools and meat forests are the lifestyles of nobles that distinguish them from common people. The titles of duke, marquis, uncle, son, and male divided the nobility hierarchy, including the &quot;scholar&quot; class attached to the nobility, and constituted the ruling order of ancient oriental agricultural society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, in ancient Greek society, which was slightly earlier than ancient Rome, the aristocracy was not very powerful. Due to the lack of large contiguous areas of land in the Balkans, ancient Greece developed an early democratic system that reflected the demands of the wealthy business class in the city-states for an equal distribution of power. Rome owned a large amount of land in its conquered areas, such as North Africa and Spain, so it produced a large number of landed aristocrats. They were a strong foundation supporting the Roman Empire and shared power in the Senate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of classicism, the aristocrats of the East and West not only monopolized a large amount of land and wealth, but also monopolized culture, knowledge, and art, producing and consuming amazing cultural and artistic achievements of that era: Ancient Greece and Roman sculpture and architectural art, as well as the elegance and praise in the Eastern &quot;Chu Ci&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 4th and 5th centuries AD were a watershed era in the changes of human civilization: the classical civilizations in the East and West (Eastern Han Dynasty and Western Rome) were defeated by the northern barbarians, and human civilization entered a period of darkness that lasted for hundreds of years. Era (or &quot;Middle Ages&quot;). The classical nobility died out in this era, and instead, the second round of &quot;ancient nobility&quot; (medieval nobility) emerged in both the East and the West. Moreover, in this era, both the East and the West produced military lord aristocrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, after the Germanic tribes conquered the Western Roman Empire, they divided territories and enfeoffed feudal lords, resulting in a large number of barbarian military nobles. These medieval nobles were rough, unpretentious, and simple... almost all of them They are illiterate. They only emphasize the spirit of martial arts. They compete with each other on whose arms are thicker, stronger, and have longer swords. If nothing happens, they compete on horseback. European military aristocrats regarded reading and writing as shameful and unmanly. The writing needs at the administrative level were almost entirely borne by priests and attendants. As a result, Christianity monopolized the ideology, culture and art of medieval Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East at the same time, the gentry (similar to aristocrats) in the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties were divided: the southern gentry, because of their &quot;dress and clothes&quot;, had higher cultural and artistic accomplishments, and were known as elegant and weak. The northern aristocracy has a considerable part of the Hu people&#39;s ancestry, and their cultural and artistic standards are low, but their military force value is high. This supported the &quot;Guanlong military aristocracy&quot; of the Sui and Tang dynasties. In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, the northern aristocratic army conquered the southern gentry, and China entered the second era of great unification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unification promoted economic and social development, and culture and art also flourished. Although the cultural level of the northern aristocrats was low, they were still improving. Their huge wealth was enough to support and consume great masters such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Wu Daozi, Yan Liben, and Li Guinian. The prosperity of the Tang Dynasty created the peak era of national culture and art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of culture and art seems to inevitably lead to weak, hedonistic, decadent and even decadent lifestyles, both in the East and the West. In the East, the &quot;Huang Chao Uprising&quot; at the end of the Tang Dynasty completely ended the aristocratic era in China. To put it simply, all the nobles were killed, and &quot;the bones of the public officials were trampled on in the streets.&quot; Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been no aristocrats in China. It has entered the era of common people and landlords. The emperor and his relatives are also representatives of the common people and landlords. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France is similar. From after the &quot;Hundred Years&#39; War&quot; to before the &quot;Great Revolution&quot;, the French aristocrats were prosperous, extravagant and luxurious. They lived a paradise-like life on earth for hundreds of years and created astonishing world-class culture and art. At the same time, it burned up the national wealth and led to the social and economic collapse of France. In the end, the entire modern French aristocratic group was almost ended on the guillotine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Germany and England are the Anglo-Saxon branches of the Germanic ethnic group, and their medieval martial ethics lasted relatively long. The tradition of military aristocracy of these two ethnic groups even lasted until the middle of the 20th century. Until the two world wars, machine guns, cannons, tanks, bombers... ended a large number of British and German military aristocrats on the battlefield, and the modern aristocracy in Europe finally declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Kingsman: The Secret Service&quot; vividly tells this historical process: As a large number of military nobles died on the battlefield, the vast aristocratic wealth became ownerless property, CEOs (not Boss) promoted the modern transformation of European society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, the rise of the elite class is no longer the aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobility is identity politics and hereditary. The elite emphasizes non-identity politics, ability first, self-strength, and survival of the fittest. According to our ancient saying, &quot;If you are good at learning, you will become an official.&quot; But it is not enough to just study well. You must also be good at doing things, abide by laws and regulations, and be socially responsible. The elites of modern society: Most of them come from the civilian class, such as Elon Musk. Before he became successful, he also paved the floor in his garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern elite politics does not monopolize power like aristocratic politics, but breaks class solidification and opens up channels for individual advancement and dimensionality reduction, which is of great significance for preventing social rigidity and corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Musk, the world’s richest man with hundreds of billions of dollars, has some unscrupulous sons. If we cannot effectively inherit, pioneer, and enterprising, we will return to mediocrity and will not be able to enjoy the hereditary privileges of the nobility. This is the modern elite system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that everyone can cheer up and make progress as much as possible, produce as many elites as possible to promote social progress, realize self-worth, and have fewer aristocratic dreams. That concept has been eliminated by history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南方周末6件作品获广东新闻奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260282]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 17:29:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 8, organized by the Guangdong Journalists Association, The selection results of the 2022 Guangdong News Award and the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>; Golden Bell Award sponsored by the Guangdong Press Society have been announced. 381 works won the 2022 Guangdong News Awards, including 49 first prizes, 122 second prizes, and 210 third prizes. 10 comrades won the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>;, and 1 comrade won the 15th Guangdong Province News Golden Bell Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Six works of Southern Weekend Newspaper won the Guangdong News Award.

&lt;p>;On October 30, 2023, the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; held its premiere in Beijing. The film is directed by Japanese director Yojiro Takita and stars Zhang Guoli and Han Geng. This is the first time that Yojiro Takita has directed a Chinese-language film, adapted from Xin You&#39;s novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;. In the story, the Liu family has been making ice crystal cakes for generations, and it was passed down to the eighth generation Liu Jiansan. His father Liu Tingshen was still unwilling to reveal the secret recipe, and the two gradually became estranged. It wasn&#39;t until his father passed away that the secret recipe and the secrets accompanying it finally surfaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was finalized as early as 2018. After several twists and turns, the finalized poster was finally released recently, and it was officially announced that it will be released nationwide on November 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first film by Yojiro Takita to encounter setbacks. The highlight of his career, &quot;The Embalmer,&quot; was released after a year&#39;s delay after filming was completed. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; is adapted from &quot;The Diary of a Coffin Bearer&quot; written by Shinmon Aoki. The author compiled his many years of experience into a book. In the world narrated by the coffin bearer, the deceased and the undertaker completed the passing of human life from generation to generation at a certain moment during the funeral ceremony. The movie starts from this and unfolds a sad and melancholy story around the protagonist who performs rituals for the deceased&#39;s body. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and swept the Japan Film Academy Awards - a total of 13 nominations and 8 wins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro recalled that the protagonist of the movie dealt with corpses every day, and the Japanese were not willing to accept it, let alone face death. The subject of the film thus became taboo. No company was willing to release it for fear of not selling well. In 2008, &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won awards at China&#39;s Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival and Canada&#39;s Montreal Film Festival. The news spread back to Japan, and the film was only released in theaters (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;September 13, 2008&lt;/span>;) became popular and topped the box office. During the Oscar awards season, although the box office had declined and dropped out of the rankings, it returned to the top of the box office once the news of the award was announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Takita Yojiro&#39;s most famous work was &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 2001, starring Nomura Mansai and Hideaki Ito; and &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 1986, starring Yuya Uchida, Yumi Aso, and Takeshi Kitano. No Funny Magazine. The former is adapted from the &quot;Onmyoji&quot; series of novels by Dream Pillow Tapir, which tells the story of Abe Seimei, an onmyoji with superb magic skills in Japan&#39;s Heian period, who used his wisdom to exorcise ghosts and gods and solve difficult problems. The latter vividly reproduced many real events that occurred in Japan in 1985, revealing the dark side of society and condemning the media for its failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the publication of the transformational work &quot;Don&#39;t Funny Magazine&quot;, Takita Yojiro was once known as a &quot;pink movie&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; refers to a large number of Famous for movies that feature nudity&lt;/span>;). On December 4, 1955, Yojiro Takita was born in Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. In 1973, after graduating from Takaoka Commercial High School, he went to Tokyo to pursue his dream. At the age of 20, he joined Lion Film Production Company as an assistant director. In 1981, he directed his debut film &quot;Crazy Female Teacher&quot;. In the next five years, he filmed 21 pink movies mainly in the &quot;Crazy Train&quot; series. Although this type of film uses female nudity and male-female sex as gimmicks, its themes are diverse, including serious dramas, light comedies, and even suspense dramas. The whimsy and fun of Takita&#39;s works earned him the nickname &quot;Pink Movie Genius&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At that time, the sun was setting in the Japanese film industry, and audiences rarely went to the movies. Some people watched pink movies, but the market demanded that filming be completed quickly at a very low cost. Many people wanted to make movies but had nowhere to go. Those who could go joined the ranks. There are too many people in the world who are determined to make movies, and I am one of them.&quot; Takita Yojiro recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he worked 15 hours a day and was bored with 35mm film all day long. When he was young, Takita Yojiro often went to the cinema with his family, and movies would be shown in the school gymnasium. He would often watch and think, &quot;Isn&#39;t this movie about me?&quot; But he didn&#39;t know what it would be like to actually make a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256532&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Embalmer&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Even such a person who is full of anxiety and uncertain future I am willing to invest alone in the world. I believe that only those who are exposed to this world and discover something about themselves after going through hardships can survive.&quot; Yojiro Takita said, &quot;There are no rules to follow in anything. At that time, living in this world , can’t see dreams, and feels that having dreams is a luxury. All he can do is work hard to complete the things in front of him.&quot; He remembered the words of a senior director he knew well - he hoped that he would be entangled in film and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Being surrounded by film, I deeply understand the meaning of film and movies. As well as editing, I understand the importance of frame by frame. In these senses, the era of pink movies is My origin. Although it was very painful at the time, there were many happy partners. We cried together, laughed together, and drank together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro once described his works as &quot;Kintaro candy&quot;. Kintaro candy is a candy that Japanese children use on the Seven-Five-Three Festival (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Similar to Children&#39;s Day, celebrating the growth of children aged 3, 5, and 7 years old&lt;/span>;) The edible candies come in a variety of patterns, and are &quot;long, sweet candies&quot; that need to be cut off bit by bit to eat. No matter where this candy is cut, the cross-section pattern is the same, only the outermost layer is different in color. He believes that although his works have various themes, when you really cut them apart, they are all the same movies. In his conversation with Takita Yojiro, the writer Zhian summarized this similar core as: about how ordinary people can prove themselves and realize their own value through an action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also during that conversation that Yojiro Takita looked back on his career and lamented that he had always carefully selected job offers and rejected many works. Now he is more concerned about &quot;Why are you looking for me? What is the reason for choosing me to be the director?&quot; If there are consistent answers to the two questions, he will happily accept it. The next piece &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot; is the result of this thinking. This is a Chinese movie, with all Chinese actors, and he wanted to do something fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As a director, I need to run around and be busy, but at the same time, I am also observing myself objectively. For example, sitting here for an interview, there is actually someone I am standing on high, looking down at. I am thinking about myself. In my head, on the one hand, there is this objective consciousness of always reflecting on myself, and on the other hand, I am rushing forward like a wild boar, running straight towards the goal.&quot; said Yojiro Takita. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for filming, his wife did not say to him, &quot;Come back after making a good movie.&quot; Instead, she told him: &quot;Don&#39;t get angry in front of everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Movie Good or bad, people don&#39;t care.&quot; Takita Yojiro said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2019, we had the opportunity to watch an early version of the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; and interviewed Yojiro Takita. In the interview, he talked about his motivation for making Chinese movies and his understanding of the film. Views on traditional disorder, the film’s response to changes in the times and people’s hearts, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256533&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Onmyoji&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is a dialogue with Yojiro Takita:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A story about reconciliation and rebirth&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Just listened to the staff After reading the novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;, you felt that the story was actually a bit Japanese. What parts of it touched you and made you decide to film it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The family structure of China and Japan is very similar. The father is the backbone of the entire family, so daily life, father-son relationship, Cultural inheritance will also have many similarities. The original setting is a story that happened in a small town in China. This story can be copied to the Japanese countryside. This made me feel very familiar, and it was one of the motivations for me to try to make this film. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal favorite is that the father has been keeping secrets and sticking to himself, and his intentions were only felt by his son after he passed away. This misunderstanding, sadness, and ultimate mutual recognition is what captures my heart the most. In other words, this is a story about reconciliation and rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Like the novel, you still use the son&#39;s perspective to construct the story Why did you choose this perspective on the relationship between father and son? And why make such a movie in modern times? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was still thinking about this issue until yesterday. In fact, as we grow older, people’s way of thinking will become more and more fixed. and limitations, the scope of action may become narrower and narrower. The world of young people is more interesting, they have many expectations for life, there are incompleteness and immaturity, and the collision of various elements will lead to the development of the story. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this also depends on the background of the times and career settings. Japan has many old shops that have been inherited from generation to generation, and there are also many stories about craftsmen. The world of traditional crafts is a world where seniors and juniors fight, because values ​​​​are different from the times, and it is inevitable for juniors to want to surpass their seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wonder if it is the same in China. Therefore, this story is set before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The economy is growing rapidly, people&#39;s economic activities are becoming more and more important to the world, and in order to successfully integrate into the modern world, the traditional world is gradually losing order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of these? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think this is not a good thing from the perspective of changes in values ​​and the changes that follow. Everything is digital now and you want fast results. People always think that when they do something, the result is there and they can get there quickly. But traditional craftsman-style things are just the opposite. Through accumulation, various techniques are passed on, and ways of thinking and feelings are refined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, this 6cm×6cm camera (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;points at the photojournalist’s medium format film camera&lt;/span >;), it has existed a long time ago, 40 years ago, it is very rare, and it is still in use. There must be something in it that you want to stick to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan held the Olympic Games in 1964, which was very similar to China. It developed rapidly after that. It’s just that the speed of development was “additive” at that time, but now it feels like “multiplicative”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You graduated from high school a few years after the Japan Olympics. There are reports that you were faced with two directions at that time, whether to find a job directly or continue studying. So did you feel confused in the accelerating social environment? What was your state at that time, and why did you go to Tokyo? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because I didn’t pass the college entrance examination, it doesn’t matter if I tell you. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;laugh&lt;/span>;) I was very confused, and for the first time I realized, what have I been doing for so many years? I&#39;m very lonely. Like Jian San (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Jian San, the male protagonist of &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;&lt;/span>;), I also grew up in a small place, so I just wanted to stop staying there and go to Tokyo. I thought I would find something in the city. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I went there, the level of prosperity and the number of people were completely different, and there were no parents nagging you behind your back. It felt like heaven. So when I first started working as a director, I shot all the cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as I got married and had children, the entire film industry environment changed, and the depth and breadth of my interactions changed, I began to realize that my hometown before I was 18 years old was something I couldn’t forget, including &quot;The Embalmer&quot; also has the feeling of returning to a small town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are those unforgettable things? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The terraced fields, the smell of the river, the light miso soup, udon noodles, the smell of my parents’ house, my mother’s smell.

It was only after I entered this industry that I found it interesting. Everyone has always believed that the world of entertainment and movies, including singing, is the domain of a few or special people. About half a year to a year later, I discovered that this was not the case. Whether it was lighting or photography, they were actually just people who were passionate about something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, can I also make this thing?

Many people enter the film industry with aspirations, but once they arrive on set, they feel a lot of physical and interpersonal fatigue. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film industry has been in recession for a long time, with little funding, low income, no future, and hard work. But there are many things that even quitting can&#39;t do anything about. What can I do if I don&#39;t do this? I feel like quitting is just an escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a Japanese proverb, this industry is like water, and I happen to be a fish. I am in it like a fish in water, which is very interesting.

After the bubble economy burst, many major events occurred in Japan, such as the Great Hanshin Earthquake. So, for a while, people who were very driven became insubstantial. Nothingness, nothingness, in short, the belief that life and the world are nothingness. I will think about what we live for? The works from that time also wanted to ask what the meaning of survival is. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life can sometimes be a comedy. A person has many sides, depending on the perspective from which he is viewed. Sometimes the person is serious, like a school teacher, sometimes not. People in life always have both sides. I actually think everything can be a comedy depending on the content of the movie and the angle of editing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, I really like comedy.

This is not an escape, but another form of realization of the ideal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, when traditions are disappearing and have disappeared, historical dramas often focus on people’s beauty, traditions and etiquette.

The fellow pointed forward with his hand. Yang Ping asked again: &quot;Are there any paintings on the walls in the temple?&quot; Yang Ping&#39;s Shanxi dialect is a bit different from that of his fellow villagers, but it does not hinder their communication. He had to travel to every corner of Shanxi. Without such a language advantage, Yang Ping really couldn&#39;t take pictures of the &quot;paintings&quot; in the temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people talk about Shanxi murals, they always think of the exquisite Song and Yuan murals such as Yanshan Temple and Yongle Palace. However, many people don’t know that Shanxi villages, hidden among the mountains and rivers, preserve a large number of village temple murals. Compared with the protection, research and admiration that the murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties enjoyed, the murals in the village temples seem a bit lonely. They are generally relics from the Qing Dynasty. &quot;These Qing Dynasty murals are not even &#39;village protection&#39;, not to mention &#39;national security&#39;,&quot; Yang Ping said. They quietly serve as the background for the village god statues and are also a touch of interest in the lives of the villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the mural on the east wall of a temple in Nancao Village, Shuocheng District, Shuozhou City, Shanxi Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping has been photographing Shanxi murals for more than ten years. Like many enthusiasts who started taking pictures of murals, Yang Ping also took pictures of Song and Yuan murals at the beginning. After taking more pictures, she found that there were more murals hidden in small temples in the mountains and deserts in Shanxi. &quot;Many people took photos of the &#39;Provincial Protection&#39; That&#39;s all, but I&#39;m different, I want to go to the village,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping was the editor-in-chief of a travel magazine in her early years. After the magazine ceased publication, she focused entirely on murals and painted sculptures in Shanxi. Over the years, she has photographed more than 400 murals in Shanxi, of which more than 300 were from the Ming and Qing dynasties. &quot;I know about another 20 to 30 murals that I haven&#39;t photographed yet.&quot; &quot;See You Under the Painted Walls of the High Hall—Exploring the Ancient Mural Paintings in Rural Villages of Shanxi, China&quot; is her new book published in 2023. It contains 21 exquisite village temple murals, mostly from the late Qing Dynasty, many of which she discovered for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you open this little book, you will be greeted by an artistic temperament that is completely different from the ancient and grandiose murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. The bright colors, the images of gods full of life, and the small and compact compositions, It all shows that this is an aesthetic taste that comes from the grassroots of the folk. Yang Ping wrote 21 short stories for these 21 murals. Most of them were about her chats with the villagers, family stories, and old rural news. They were written in a relaxed and interesting way. However, in the interview, Yang Ping talked more about the behind-the-scenes of the shooting. The joys and sorrows, as well as her worries about the rural murals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The culture left over from each era reflects that era. Rural murals are not just a presentation of art, but also contain a lot of historical information. The implication of this book is actually beyond the murals. &quot;Yang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Almost all the films brought back were scrapped”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping’s hometown is Jincheng, Shanxi, which is famous for its ancient buildings. In 2003, Yang Ping spent 360,000 yuan of his own money to start photographing ancient buildings in Jincheng. After taking many photos of buildings, she gradually became interested in the murals inside the buildings. Although she now runs to the village all day long and looks disgraced, she said that she actually loves dressing up. She used to work in fashion travel magazines and liked beautiful clothes. She first fell in love with murals because of their beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Yang Ping got an opportunity to photograph murals and painted sculptures across Shanxi. At that time, she only knew about the murals that were on the cultural relics list. As for how many murals there were in Shanxi, she didn&#39;t know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having no experience in photographing murals at the beginning, Yang Ping cast a wide net in Shanxi: there were eleven prefecture-level administrative districts in Shanxi, and each administrative district sent a photography team with at least three people in each team, led by a photographer. Led by a well-known photographer, plus a light and a driver, they plan to take carpet-like photos of murals and painted sculptures throughout Shanxi. It was a huge project, expensive, but the results were disappointing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Almost all the films I brought back were scrapped.&quot; Yang Ping recalled his &quot;recklessness&quot; at that time and smiled unconsciously. The photographers hired by Yang Ping back then were all &quot;big names&quot; in the industry. &quot;They have their own understanding of how to take good-looking photos. If you say it looks like this, they think that will look good. And many of them don&#39;t look good.&quot; I won’t take pictures.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But faithfully recording and “photographing beautifully” are two different things. To faithfully record the entire picture and every detail of a mural, the pixels of each photo must be large enough, which requires photographing a mural in different areas. However, at least one of the murals printed on the book needs to be complete, which means that the photos taken of each part can be combined. This means that different parts of the same mural are photographed, and their shooting angles and pixels are , light, and exposure should be as consistent as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;520&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Full picture of the mural on the east wall of the main hall of Zhulong Temple. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the partial pictures taken are to be combined into a whole picture, hundreds of photos will be combined , the synthesis time takes half a month, and the size of the entire picture is often dozens of G. &quot;They have never filmed like this.&quot; Yang Ping said. The photographers worked on their own, and the photos they took back were of different styles. They were all beautiful, but they just &quot;didn&#39;t add up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some murals that are three to four meters high. If the ladder is not high enough, changes in the camera angle will cause distortion of the picture, and they will not fit together. &quot;When I saw that this picture didn&#39;t work, I went back to training and took another photo. If it still didn&#39;t work, I bought a lot of books for everyone to read...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unsuccessful carpet shooting cost Yang Ping a lot of money. The equipment, travel, and labor of the eleven photography teams were all wasted. Later, she realized that the more photography teams there are, the higher the efficiency will be. Mastering the shooting principles is the most important thing. She narrowed the camera team down to two, one of which was shot by herself. Facing a wall of murals, a relatively standard shooting process must be formed: ladders of different sizes must be provided, as well as infrared cameras for partitioning the walls, the lens is a standard Zeiss 50, and a small handheld camera is required. &quot;Many The statue is very close to the mural, so I had to put my hand in to take a picture.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to these general equipment, a shovel and a feather duster are also necessary for taking pictures of murals in the village. The latter is used to remove dust from the murals, and the former is a tool for road construction, &quot;leading to There are dirt roads in the village, so we can use them.” Once in a village in Luliang, the road conditions were so bad that the photographer used a shovel for more than an hour to shovel out a &quot;road&quot;. For the last three hundred meters, there was really no choice but to carry all the equipment, large and small, into the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“三十年前题记还在”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;走进杨平的工作室，首先看见的就是一整排山西寺观壁画的图册。 《岩山寺》《开化寺》《公主寺》……这些在壁画史上赫赫有名的寺观，杨平都相应做了极为精细的图册。这些图册是她十几年来拍摄壁画的成果之一。在她之前，当然也有人拍过它们，也出过很多图册，但她想要做的是把每个细节都拍清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像这本《岩山寺》就拍了三年，2013、2014、2015年，陆陆续续拍，每次都要补拍，出版的时候发现某块不够清晰，就重新拍。”杨平说。岩山寺的金代壁画被誉为壁上的《清明上河图》，人物繁多，细节丰富，浓郁的生活气息就隐藏在画面细节之中。杨平的要求是画面上每个人物的身份、每个佛道故事的典故，乃至对首饰名物的辨认，不仅要有清晰的图像，还要附有学术文字的解释。所以她做的图册比前人要厚很多，八开本的一大本《岩山寺》厚达三百多页。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到2013年冬天，像岩山寺、开化寺这样的“国保”“省保”，差不多都被她拍完了，杨平开始系统地拍摄村庙里的壁画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一开始，对于村庙壁画，杨平只是路过的时候顺手拍，但拍得多了，她慢慢意识到，村里的明清壁画，比起宋元壁画，自有它的价值，完全值得再去搜罗一遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;山西古村落里，民间信仰的庙宇有着很多常见的神祇，关帝庙、娘娘庙（三霄娘娘）、龙王庙、马王庙、东岳庙，它们可能会单独出现，也可能会“组团”出现——即在一个庙中分布于不同的配殿里。龙王保佑风调雨顺、娘娘保佑生育平安、关帝则保佑教育子女忠孝节义。 “生娃、教育、农业，都是老百姓的真实需求。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;山西某村庙北壁龙王母右侧的女官、两位四值使者和风婆（从右至左）。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一次，一尊庙里的东岳神挡住了去路。那个庙的主殿两壁都是精美的彩塑，殿中央却立着一尊不知道年代的彩塑，藏身在一个小小的木阁里，据说是后世的村民们给加上去的。杨平要拍两旁的彩塑，镜头却总是被这尊东岳神彩塑给遮挡，摄影师们去拍了五次，拍回来总是不好看。无奈之下，第六次拍摄时她和村里人商量：“能不能先把这尊神请到殿外？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旧时，这尊东岳神每年都要抬出来游街，近些年，这个仪式已经渐渐消逝，但村里老人还是担心，像这样不合常规地抬出来，会造成不祥。 “他们担心会引起暴雨。”杨平说。几十年没动过的木胎泥塑，移动稍有不慎，表面很可能就会碎裂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好不容易说服了村民，具体要怎么搬，杨平自己心里也没有底。几个人正围着神像急得团团转的时候，村里的一位老人站了出来，只见他拿着一根粗麻绳，用一种从来没见过的打结方式，快速将神像捆得四平八稳，四个人一抬，上下不会倾斜，左右也不会侧翻。 “要是没有这位老人的帮忙，我们真拍不到这样好看的照片。”杨平指着图册上的这页彩塑说。拍完后，东岳神被重新安放了回去，当然，村里也没有下起暴雨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时间在流逝，壁画和彩塑也随着时间在改变。很多壁画和杨平最初看到它们的时候已经完全不一样了。 “我知道的一堂宋代壁画，三十年前题记还在，现在某些题记已经模糊了。”而一些无人关注的清代壁画，已经再也看不到了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》里提到的罗圈堡村是其中幸运的一个。当时，当地文物局听从了杨平的建议，把村庙修缮一新，壁画也重新做了拼合。 2021年杨平回访的时候，罗圈堡的壁画都还完好。但是像罗圈堡这样的例子实在太少了。作为文物大省，山西要用到钱的文物非常多，村庙里的壁画，似乎还排不上号。 “山西文物部门经常开玩笑说，让他们开两家银行，可能也不够。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257557&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;罗圈堡村龙王庙壁画局部。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“文化是要滋养人的”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;到底要不要将村庙壁画出版，公之于众，杨平曾经犹豫过很久。 2016年，他们在太原附近的一个村子拍摄，摄影师被当地村民给撵走了。杨平非常理解老百姓的“警惕”：“文物贩子实在是太多了。”村庙里的壁画，一般连文保点都不是，官方的保护体系鞭长莫及，它们虽躲在深山，却躲不过文物贩子的“勤奋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某种意义上来说，杨平就是在和文物贩子赛跑，“你完全想象不到他们有多&#39;勤奋&#39;，十年前我去的山沟里，文物贩子都走过。”杨平的朋友圈本来是完全开放的，自己看到了什么、拍到了什么，都会发在朋友圈，但不会发具体地址。有一次，一位朋友从外省追了过来，和她打听，“杨老师，你朋友圈里的东西，能不能给我一个地址？”杨平随即警惕了起来，对那位朋友说：“我手里的东西，你一个石头也不能拿走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是在这本《高堂粉墙烛下见》里，很多村庙却写了详细的地址。杨平说，这也是她思考了很久之后的无奈之举。一方面，把它们隐藏得再好，可能也逃不过文物贩子的搜索，而且就算文物贩子没有找到，书中多数村庙都已经半坍塌了，这样隐藏下去，等待它们的命运也是逐渐湮灭。 “不如公开它们的状况，引起全社会的重视，唤起村民的保护意识。”杨平明确知道一个英国的银行家家里，收藏有一铺清代的壁画，“我们的研究者目前也大多关心更高古的宋元壁画，清代壁画无人关心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋晓丽是杨平这本书的读者，2023年9月，她沿着书中的路线，走访了书中的几个村庄。她发现，很多村民的保护意识，确实比杨平拍摄时提高了不少。比如在瓦窑头村的龙王庙，“村民们有了保护意识，他们用厚厚的塑料布遮挡着壁画，我们拍摄完毕后又原样子给挡上，这是令人欣慰的发现。”宋晓丽告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，也有不幸的例子。书中提到的北曹村壁画，有非常生动的“龙王行雨图”。 “北曹村的龙王庙修缮一新，庙前立了文保碑，但是龙王殿里东西壁的龙王行雨图丢失了，文保部门将两幅喷绘的展示图分别悬挂于东西两壁。”宋晓丽说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257558&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;北曹村兴龙寺壁画局部。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐村的三圣庙也难逃湮灭的命运。这是个明清时期集佛教与民间信仰为一体的庙宇，神殿三开间，供着不同的神祇。宋晓丽看到的景象和杨平书中的描写已经很不一样了，“整个北壁的壁画在雨水的侵蚀下漫漶脱落，露出地杖下一块块泥胚墙。西次间的墙壁上半部分已经坍塌，壁画无存。仅存的西壁壁画还算完整，然而西壁东北角却塌了好大的一个窟窿。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/22JV6GWSbSGTjjeMLrZqJnhVpgHOVHa8EFrUySFO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/22JV6GWSbSGTjjeMLrZqJnhVpgHOVHa8EFrUySFO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257559&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;三圣正殿西次间——龙王殿北壁的龙王母、五龙王、雨师等神像全图。该壁画已明显受损。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》卖得很好，有一点出乎杨平的意料。相对于她的整个出版计划来说，这本小书只展现了她工作的小小侧面。 “你做了这么多事情，没有人知道你在干什么，它老不冒火花，不冒泡。突然在这本书上红了。”书里的彩图，对于那些已经湮灭的壁画来说，是珍贵的记录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨平最花心力的一套大书，是即将出版的《山西寺观艺术全集》，“全集”包括《山西寺观彩塑全集》（十卷）和《山西寺观壁画全集》（二十卷），共三十卷。她多年来拍摄的所有彩塑和壁画，都会收录进去，这是真正第一种尽可能完整地收录山西壁画彩塑艺术的出版物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《全集》的受众是专业的研究者，《高堂粉墙烛下见》的受众则是普通读者，杨平希望这本小书可以成为一个支点，撬动一点公众的认知。 “其实我有一个发心，文化不仅要吸引文化人，还要吸引更多的普通人，文化应该要滋养人的。我们现在的文化只滋养了一小批人，这是不够的。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;该事件并非简单的公司之间的纠纷问题。随着更多细节披露，案件在11月8日迅速冲上热搜。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/06c5147bd39693df46185ad16eaff961.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;而令广大网友们“吃瓜”的重点有三：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一是陆家嘴怒告五家单位，其中更涉及江苏政府工作部门。陆家嘴在公告中透露，下属子公司因土壤污染问题，将江苏苏钢集团有限公司（以下简称“苏钢集团”）、苏州市环境科学研究所、苏州市苏城环境科技有限责任公司、苏州国家高新技术产业开发区管理委员会、苏州市自然资源和规划局告上法庭，近日收到了江苏省高级人民法院的书面案件受理通知书；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;二是陆家嘴索赔金额高达100亿元，据业内人士估算，该场官司的诉讼费用可能高达5000万；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;三是14宗严重污染的土地引起了市场关注。2016年陆家嘴买的地但直到2022年才发现有污染的土地，此时大批商业已经建好，其中污染物是否对建筑工人造成影响？工地作业长达6年为何没有发现污染超标的问题？提起诉讼前，是否尝试过其他处理方案？等等疑问随之而来&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;11月8日下午，陆家嘴公司证券事务部回复南都·湾财社称：“有关土壤污染纠纷事宜，我们在公告里都披露了，目前不接受采访。关于已交付的雷丁学校等项目情况，从信披角度我们不需要公开。后续事情有进展我们会做公告的。”南都湾财社也致电了上述5名被告，但截至发稿前，电话未接通。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;多位业内人士向湾财社记者表示，“毒地”背后牵扯到复杂的利益，沪苏两地政府相关部门应该理性处理相关问题，防范产生后遗症。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;斥资85亿竞价222轮，&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;陆家嘴买到14宗“毒地”？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;事情源于陆家嘴7年前“走出去”的战略决策。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2016年，陆家嘴指定控股子公司佳湾公司和佳二公司（通过信托计划）组成联合体在上海联合产权交易所联合竞得苏钢集团挂牌出让的绿岸公司95%股权，绿岸公司名下的主要资产为位于苏州高新区苏通路北、苏钢路东的17块土地使用权。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/6470f097007bb2896cb1498aab01a0d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;574&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;据当时公开报道显示，这场股权竞拍征集到30多家意向投资方，共有19家企业参与，经过了222轮竞价，吸引了绿地、保利、世茂、万科、招商等多家房企参与竞拍。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;陆家嘴最终以总价85.25亿元（成交报价68.4亿元，债务16.85亿元）竞得苏州绿岸房地产开发有限公司95%的股权。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;打败了一众实力房企的陆家嘴对本次竞拍成功也颇有信心。彼时集团公开表示，成功联合竞得苏州绿岸95%股权，有利于进一步增加公司土地储备，拓展公司发展空间，“通过积极实施&#39;走出去&#39;战略，进一步提升陆家嘴商业地产品牌影响力，增强公司持续经营能力和盈利水平。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;但陆家嘴大胆“走出去”的投资决策却并没有那么一帆风顺。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2021年，坊间传出苏州绿岸意外发现项目的部分地块存在严重污染风险的消息，同时已向当地政府部门做了报告。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年4月，江苏省人民政府官网公布的《中央第二生态环境保护督察组向我省移交的第六批信访事项办理情况》中提到，第三方检测机构检测结果显示苏州绿岸项目多处地块土壤中苯并芘、萘严重超标，不符合用地标准。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其中还提到，苏州高新区管委会高度重视，成立了工作专班，迅速开展工作，要求苏州绿岸公司切实履行主体责任，于当年6月底前，委托第三方机构完成土壤污染状况调查方案制定，并抓紧组织实施，后续视调查结果依法开展相关工作，其间，上述地块不得开展任何与土壤污染防治无关的活动。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;同月，陆家嘴也发布公告表示17块土地中，现已开发其中8幅地块。并意外发现已建设教育设施的2号、13号地块及尚未开发的3号、4号地块均存在严重污染风险，土壤或地下水中诸多元素大幅超标，不符合该等地块原对应的规划用地标准，4幅地块面积合计约11.8万平方米，截至2021年末，该4幅地块累计工程投入金额约为4.5亿元&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;由于被曝土地污染问题，陆家嘴的项目也不得不叫停。&lt;span>;公开信息显示，上述确定污染情况的2号土地和13号土地分别规划建设苏州雷丁学校和一家幼儿园。&lt;/span>;2022年被中央第二生态环境保护督察组点名时，这两幅地块已竣工。据媒体报道，因污染问题，苏州雷丁学校未能如期在2021年9月迎来首批新生，该校学生则在苏州科技城外国语学校过渡。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;公告指出，公司组织专门力量核查发现，在苏地2008-G-6号地块调规变性及出让过程中，不排除苏钢集团、环境检测机构等存在涉嫌一系列违法违规、弄虚作假等可能，导致存在严重污染的土地进入公开交易市场，并在挂牌转让苏州绿岸95%股权时隐瞒了相关信息。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;若土地污染鉴定造假，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;被告或面临三重风险？&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2023年，陆家嘴将有关涉事方告上法庭，11月4日其在公告中称法院已立案受理相关案件。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/157127c813d9d12713f2711324bbd4ff.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;同时，公司委托专业机构核查发现，在案涉土地的调规变性及出让过程中，各被告存在一系列违法违规、弄虚作假、不依法履职的侵权行为，共同导致了原告方受让存在严重污染的案涉土地。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;陆家嘴请求判令被告一向原告承担赔偿人民币100.44亿元（后续发现或明确实际金额高于该金额时将增加诉讼请求或另案提起诉讼）的侵权责任；请求判令被告二、三、四、五就第1项诉讼请求承担连带责任；请求判令本案诉讼费由各被告共同承担。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这场索赔金额高达100亿元的官司迅速引起市场的热议。有业内人士据此估算，按照0.5%的费用缴纳，陆家嘴的诉讼费用便可能超5000万。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot;

data-key=&quot;257630&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;对于陆家嘴起诉大额索赔的原因，北京金诉律师事务所主任王玉臣向记者直言，主要是其对建设项目所在土地存在的污染问题可能面临巨大的法律风险与法律责任，而此事件中的苏钢集团、鉴定机构等也会由此产生相应的法律风险、法律责任。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其进一步表示，就陆家嘴集团而言，根据目前的资料，其在案涉地块中建设规模大、项目类型多、资金投入更是不菲，而相关项目在建设、竣工、销售等各环节发现所在土地存在严重污染，建设暂停、竣工验收不合格、销售中止、整改修复、重新鉴定等都是陆家嘴集团正在或者后续需要面对的问题。而在这背后，仅在民事责任方面，就存在着和施工单位签订的施工合同和业主签订的购房合同等各类合同的违约风险。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;索赔100亿元，胜诉概率几何？&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;王玉臣向记者表示，如果苏钢集团在出让时即对相关地块土地污染情况知情、有知情的义务但没有履行、知情但故意隐瞒等，不仅可能会对之前的合同效力产生影响，也会面临相应的违约责任，而对陆家嘴集团需要承担的损失等，陆家嘴集团也有权向苏钢集团进行追偿；另外如果鉴定机构对案涉土壤污染情况存在鉴定造假的情况，其同样面临法律风险及责任。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一是会涉及民事赔偿风险，并可能会与苏钢等主体承担连带赔偿责任；&lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;二是会面临行政处罚的风险，可能会面临警告、罚款、没收违法所得、撤销相应资质等行政处罚；&lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;三是如果情节严重，相关责任人员还可能构成提供虚假证明文件罪等刑事犯罪，承担刑事责任。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;而广东华商律师事务所律师周争锋同样告诉记者，如果调查后证实案涉土壤污染情况存在鉴定造假的情况，陆家嘴可能会胜诉。但本案最终有可能会调解。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;当然，除了当下诉讼官司，这场案件后续更要拿出相应的解决方案，已开发地块如何处理等问题更值得关注。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“毒地”案背后的陆家嘴：&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;营收净利双降&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;除了对案件本身的关注，该事件同样引起网友对陆家嘴经营情况的担忧。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;截至11月8日，陆家嘴市值为447.6亿元，或由于案件影响巨大，公司当日股价下跌0.75%，报9.30元/股。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“赢了官司也收不回成本”“100亿索赔额度相当于市值的22%了”“是不是没钱开发了”针对该事件部分股民持负面态度，认为房地产下行周期下陆家嘴也面临经营困境；但也有部分网友持正面态度，“陆家嘴的态度还可以，发生这样的事情主动信息披露，投资者比较放心”“陆家嘴还算有良心，没有再出具一份假报告用来骗业主买房”。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;对于该案件是否会对公司经营造成影响的问题，陆家嘴在11月4日的公告中提到，本案尚处于立案受理阶段，暂无法判断对公司本期或期后利润的影响。据有关媒体报道，陆家嘴董事长徐而进在11月6日的业绩说明会上表示，公司专项工作小组正全力以赴开展处置、维权工作，推动相关责任方承担后续处置责任。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;徐而进还在业绩会上强调，对于未来，公司将密切关注长三角市场情况，择机参与，继续积极支持长三角一体化发展建设，持续做强做优公司主业。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;尽管公司对投资仍有信心，但不可否认的是，从数据方面来看，陆家嘴在营业收入及净利润方面已连续出现双降的局面。据财报，2022年，陆家嘴实现营收117.62亿元，同比减少15.21%；净利润10.85亿元，同比下降74.84%；2023年前三季度营收约57.75亿元，同比减少14.48%；归属于上市公司股东的净利润约8.37亿元，同比减少27.75%。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;陆家嘴业绩下滑与当前房地产市场仍处于低谷期不无关系。今年前三季度，全国房地产开发投资87269亿元，同比下降9.1%；商品房销售面积84806万平方米，同比下降7.5%。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“土地污染贬值，房地产市场下行，强行开发也无利可图。”有业内人士认为，本次案件浮出水面的主要原因是受多重因素的影响。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;该案件的出现也引发了房地产业内对土地开发的新一轮讨论。“从业近20年，还没有见过类似因为土壤污染而有的百亿的退地的官司。”镜鉴咨询创始人张宏伟表示，官司已经涉及两地政府，因此并不好处理。但“毒地”已经拖了7年之久，希望通过沪苏两地相关部门的协调，可以从根本上解决这个问题。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;易居研究院研究总监严跃进则猜测，该案件中或还涉及造假腐败等内容，显然需要严查。“此事也说明，在房地产激进发展的一些年份，一些地块出让没有遵循规范，违规出让，进而产生了很多问题，对于人民群众合法权益造成了侵害。”他进一步指出，行业需要对工业用地的安全性问题提高重视，企业应该对于一些有工业用地开发历史的要审慎，防范产生后遗症。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;母亲的魔力鞋。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更早的时候，我说的是她生病之前，她穿阿珍卖的艾力沛魔力鞋。其实那时候她已经感到不舒服了。她昏昏欲睡、拉肚子和发烧。也许癌细胞正在她的身体里野蛮生长，只是无人知晓。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她说那是双神奇的鞋子。一双卖两千两百块马币。阿珍允许她先把鞋子拿回家，试穿一段时间后再付钱。她很满意，也许还觉得自己占便宜了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是她穿着它们出门，到镇上吃早餐，去商店买东西，还穿着去台湾参加她儿子的婚礼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我差点跌倒！”她曾对我说。不知道究竟是因为当时的她太虚弱了，还是那双鞋子导致她的脚很不好受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我从来不在意那双鞋。那是个人们会相信豪猪枣、符水和降头术的地方。一双鞋子没什么大不了的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但那不是普通的鞋子。阿珍说那是带有超能磁的能量保健鞋，鞋底藏有精心调配的中药，能开启人体第二心脏，激发人体自愈能量环。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“健康是穿出来的”，鞋子的纸袋上写着。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等我见到那双鞋子时，她已经是一个骨瘦如柴，充满了怨毒的病人。她开始怨恨那双鞋子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说来吊诡，她的朋友秀丽也患癌症了。不过秀丽没有穿魔力鞋，她吃阿珍卖的胶原蛋白粉。她们俩每天都吃。那东西还挺麻烦的，得一起床就吃，而且越早吃越好。有一次，我们去西安旅游，天还没亮她就爬起来烧水沏胶原蛋白粉，喝完了就又回到床上睡觉。旅馆的烧水壶发出的嗡嗡声听得我和二姐心烦意乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她不想见到那双鞋子，于是叫我和妹妹到阿珍的理发厅退货。那天她去理发了，不过她不去阿珍的理发厅，也不去楼下阿莲的理发厅。她独自撑伞走到后面商店楼上的理发厅。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和妹妹硬着头皮走进阿珍的理发厅。阿珍一边替一个女人烫头发，一边和我们说话。她让我们看她和她女儿的鞋子。她们都穿着和母亲那双艾力沛魔力鞋一模一样的黑皮鞋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“看，我和我女儿都穿，我一天到晚站着工作，脚一点都不酸！”阿珍说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鞋子当然退不了。 “都穿过了，谁还会买？”阿珍拒绝了我们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几天后，夏木来乌拉港，母亲给他看那双鞋子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我告诉你这双鞋子怎样骗人，你写下来，登在你们的报纸。”她对夏木说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和夏木面面相觑，然后看了一眼那双沉闷、丑陋的鞋子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是她眼中的作家和记者应该做的事。她似乎分不清记者和作家的区别。在她看来，那都是读书人，是写字的人，应该用他们的笔替人发声，为民请命。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我跟你讲，你写下来。”当她告诉我她生儿子差点丧命的遭遇时，她就是这么说的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她自己就是这样的人，热衷于伸张正义和替人说话，和她的丈夫完全相反。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一段时日，她除了忙裁缝铺的活儿，还忙着替过港的穷人申请救济金。她从市议会拿了一沓申请表，派给那些生活困顿的人。遇到不识马来文的人，她就请她的马来朋友帮忙填表格，因为她自己也不太懂马来文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她还给报馆打电话，替她的朋友申请报馆的救济金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当她告诉我这些时，我对她的能耐与激情感到不可思议。我想起很久以前她说过的话。她说算命佬曾预言如果她继续上学的话，她会成为像李金狮那样的大人物。李金狮是我们从前的卫生部长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她很自豪。她像个乡绅，像个大人物那样在乌拉港走来走去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很快她的风光就烟消云散。她怨恨魔力鞋，怨恨她的妹妹，怨恨欺骗她的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在第一次化疗的前一晚，在医院附近的酒店里，凌晨时分，在把晚餐全都吐出来后，她对我娓娓道来一个女人的故事。那个女人通过她的帮助获得了救济金，但她发现原来她并不穷，她和她的丈夫在离乌拉港不远的镇子经营海产的生意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我还有她们的名片。”她说。她决定打电话给报馆揭发那个女人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不到一个月，她自己就成了等待被救济的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲说她可以申请救济金，她应该领救济金。于是市议会的人来了。那个男人也是母亲的朋友，一直以来就是他在处理母亲代人递交的申请表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿兹敏带着深深的理解与悲悯看着母亲。他当下就作出了决定，建议我为母亲拍张照片。母亲得躺在床上，这样才能将她的病态完完全全地展露出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没有为母亲照相。夏木也没有为她写揭露骗局的报道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很久以后，在她死了五年后，我才想到应该上网搜搜关于魔力鞋的介绍或新闻。我很快就看到了《南方都市报》的报道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是2016年的报道。那时她还没有生病。那时我还在学校教书。两年后，我不再是个老师，她成了一个注定会死去的病人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当她让我们看那双鞋时，为什么我们没有想到应该上网搜一搜？这不是我们这些读书人的本能和本领吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也许我并不在乎她花了多少钱买一双鞋子。也许我早已对她上当的事实司空见惯。那是一个人们相信豪猪枣、符水和降头术的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我尊重他人的信仰与生活，我总是这样说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我已经离开乌拉港很久了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们不需要救济金。”我们这几个孩子都这么想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没有为母亲照相。再说了，母亲也不情愿躺在床上，任由人为她拍下一张耻辱与绝望的照片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她死后，一个周日午后，二姐把那双魔力鞋退还给了阿珍。她用葬礼收到的帛金付给阿珍两千两百马币。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她死后，我在她的抽屉里发现了一张剪报。那是2014年11月29日的《星洲日报》关于“情在人间”助养儿童计划的新闻。剪报上有五个六年级学生的肖像，报道的标题是《以好成绩回报助养人，星洲助养学生UPSR获佳绩》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我还以为那都是过港的孩子，是她曾经帮助过的孩子。不是。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我知道为什么她收藏那张剪报。她喜欢这样的故事，那些关于奋斗、苦尽甘来和知恩图报的故事。曾经她的孩子也凭借优秀的成绩而获得社会的支持，她引以为傲，丝毫没有因为那里面深深隐藏着卑微的气息而面红耳赤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那双魔力鞋或许此刻就在某个女人的脚上。我们也不再提起那些往事。但我从来没有忘记它们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去我没有做一个女儿能够（应该？）做的事，于是现在我做一个作家应该做的事。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;2254&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot;

&lt;p>;南都湾财社记者注意到，上述通报案例中，地方政府要求国有企业垫资建设新增隐性债务的现象屡见不鲜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以陕西西安为例，通报披露，2019年8月至2020年12月，依据西安市政府专项问题会议决定，西安国际会议中心等项目建设资金由市、区两级财政承担。西安世园投资（集团）有限公司以西安国际会展中心展览馆等3个项目建设的名义向交通银行股份有限公司陕西省分行等5家银行贷款70亿元。截至2021年6月末，项目实际提款61.5亿元，其中26亿元用于西安国际会议中心项目建设支出，形成新增隐性债务26亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中共陕西省纪律检查委员会、陕西省监察委员会依纪依规组织对相关责任人予以问责。对时任西安市市长上官某某给予党内警告处分；对时任西安市副市长李某给予批评教育，并责令在年度民主生活会上作出说明和检查；对时任西安浐灞生态区管理委员会主任门某给予批评教育，并责令在年度民主生活会上作出说明和检查；对时任西安市财政局局长杨某给予党内警告处分；对时任西安市财政局局长李某某给予政务记过处分；对其他相关人员一并进行了处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再比如四川成都彭州，2021年1月，依据彭州市委、彭州市政府有关会议决定，以及彭州市濛阳新城建设领导小组办公室印发的《彭州市濛阳新城片区开发投资合作实施方案》，彭州市政府授权彭州市国有资产经营管理有限公司作为濛阳新城片区综合开发城市综合运营商，开展区域内基础设施、地产开发等项目的投资、融资、开发、建设及运营工作，并承诺以预期土地出让收入等作为项目投资回报来源。截至2021年9月末，该公司累计筹集资金4.32亿元用于新城片区建设，形成新增隐性债务4.32亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中共四川省纪律检查委员会、四川省监察委员会依纪依规组织对相关责任人予以问责。对时任彭州市委书记王某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市委副书记、市长陈某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市委副书记、濛阳新城建设领导小组组长张某某给予党内警告处分；对时任彭州市副市长、濛阳新城建设领导小组副组长胡某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市副市长、濛阳新城建设领导小组副组长龚某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市财政局党组书记、局长周某某给予警告处分；对时任彭州市发展和改革局党组书记、局长，濛阳新城建设领导小组副组长马某给予党内警告处分；对时任彭州市国有资产经营管理有限公司董事长覃某某给予诫勉；对其他相关人员一并进行了处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得一提的是，今年6月26日，审计署向全国人大常委会作《关于2022年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》中也提及这一现象，在审计的54个地区中，有49个地区通过承诺兜底回购、国有企业垫资建设等方式，违规新增隐性债务415.16亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巫蛊之祸真相：从倾国倾城之谶到“黄帝有子曰蚩尤”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260054]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;要问汉武帝时代有什么大灾难，达到了动摇国本的地步，其实没有争议，就是征和二年（前91年）的巫蛊之祸。——巫蛊是当时流行的一种用巫术诅咒别人的手段，常用的手法就是扎小木人埋在地下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这件事发生的时间，司马迁声明过不在《史记》的覆盖范围之内。即使是一百多年以后的班固，大概因为实在太敏感，也故意不把话说得太清楚，《汉书》在涉及的人物传记里，讲得东一嘴西一嘴的，拼起来才能看出个大概。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有个叫江充的人，疯狂诬陷太子，罪名是太子在用巫蛊之术诅咒汉武帝。太子没办法，只好起兵造反。汉武帝让丞相刘屈氂指挥军队和太子在长安城里大战，死了好几万人。太子战败逃走，最终在外面死掉了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁有两个好朋友卷入了这件事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个是任安，他当时是“监北军使者”，掌控着长安城里规模最大的一支军队。太子造反的时候，曾发兵符想调任安出兵，结果任安接了兵符后，来个闭门不出。这事被汉武帝认为“怀二心”，所以任安被汉武帝腰斩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个是田仁，他是丞相府司直（丞相府属官，负责监察不法，秩比二千石，属于高级官员），当时被分派去看守长安城南最东边的覆盎门。太子逃到这个门来，他让太子逃掉了。这个罪行当然更严重，也是腰斩。连开始替田仁求情的人，被汉武帝一责问，都吓得自杀了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;司马光的版本：奸人离间父子之情&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;司马迁当时就在汉武帝身边做中书令，但也只能眼睁睁看着朋友被处死，不敢多说什么话。其实《史记》里也有些极零碎的巫蛊案的记录，基本不讲事情本身，主要是涉案人员的结局之类。这些内容司马迁所写还是后人所补，一直众说纷纭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了一千多年后的宋朝，司马光写《资治通鉴》时，在班固那个梗概的基础上，终于提供给我们一份关于巫蛊事件的首尾完整、逻辑严密、情理圆融、冲突强烈、细节丰赡的叙述。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个故事讲的是一个雄才大略但比较残暴的父皇，和不那么有才能但很善良的太子的冲突。汉武帝希望在自己生前，把最棘手的事情都做完，留下一个需要休养生息的国家交给儿子去治理。这样刚好是最完美的组合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，那些专门帮助汉武帝去执行残暴任务的人知道，一旦太子即位，自己就完了。所以他们千方百计去破坏这个计划，这里面最凶恶的，就是那个江充。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝一次次希望和儿子达成谅解，但是奸臣和小人们却一边把太子往绝路上逼，一边传递给汉武帝错误的信息。终于大祸酿成。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;知道真相后，汉武帝惩办了奸臣，作思子宫，表达了对太子的思念。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是个非常哀婉动人，还很有教育意义的故事。设想一下，以班固的性格，如果能读到这个一千年后的故事，大概也是会表示赞赏，而不是去戳穿他。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近这些年，许多介绍汉武帝的书和电视节目，都是在司马光这个故事的基础上讲述的。有人甚至进一步延伸，比如把司马迁加进这个故事里来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后，这个奸人离间父子之情的版本，虽然可爱，但恐怕不可信。下文我们以史料为依据，结合对权力运作与人性的理解，抽丝剥茧，把巫蛊之祸的真相尽可能呈现出来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;刘髆：在刘据与刘弗陵之间&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;我们从汉武帝的儿子说起。汉武帝六个儿子，为了介绍他们，班固写了《武五子传》，司马迁写了《三王世家》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《武五子传》写了汉武帝的五个儿子，这是自然不过的。因为还有一个儿子就是汉昭帝，他继承了皇位，自然不应该和其他人放在一起。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《三王世家》只写了三个儿子，这就有点奇怪；而且这篇的内容也很不正常，只是抄录册封三位皇子为诸侯王时的相关文件而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么会这个样子，当然有很多争论。但《三王世家》这个题目，是司马迁自己定的，没有疑问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这篇写到的三位：汉武帝的次子齐王刘闳，三子燕王刘旦，四子广陵王刘胥。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没写到的三位是：长子卫太子刘据，五子昌邑王刘髆，幼子后来的汉昭帝刘弗陵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简单的解释，前三位是元狩六年（公元前117年）同一天封王的，不涉及其他人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但也可以作复杂点的猜想：班固是东汉人，自然清楚谁继位当了皇帝；司马迁是汉武帝时代的当事人，他写作《三王世家》的时候，不写的三个人，都有继承皇位的可能的，把谁写进世家来都不合适；即使写进来的三位，很多话也不方便说，只有抄抄公文，才是安全的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在很多人看来，只有刘据和刘弗陵才是重要的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长子刘据出生于元朔元年（公元前128年），很长时间里被视为理所当然的皇位继承人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;幼子刘弗陵出生于太始三年（公元前94年），最后摘取了皇位竞争的胜利果实。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;昌邑王刘髆的年纪，大致是比刘据小二十来岁又比刘弗陵大十几岁。 关于他的信息，即使在《汉书》当中都是近乎空白的。有人因为这大块的空白，认为汉武帝从来不重视他。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但空白也可能是因为敏感。毕竟，刘髆的母亲，是汉武帝最爱的女人李夫人，刘髆的舅舅，就是汉武帝疯狂给他砸资源和提供机会的李广利。还有，刘髆死的时间也很敏感，《汉书》不同的地方说法微有差异，反正要么是汉武帝临死前，要么是汉昭帝刚即位。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“金屋藏娇”实为政治婚姻&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;抛开“金屋藏娇”之类的民间八卦，只以《史记》《汉书》作依据，很容易得出这样的结论：汉武帝和他的第一个皇后陈氏，完全是政治婚姻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈皇后的母亲馆陶长公主，是汉景帝的姐姐，窦太后的女儿，拥有巨大的政治影响力。可以说，汉景帝的这些儿子，谁娶了馆陶长公主的女儿，谁就获得了重要加分项。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝的母亲非常聪明地抓住机会，促成了这门亲事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝即位初期，大权在奶奶窦太后手里，因为一次冒失的政治改革汉武帝几乎被废。他能够保住帝位，也和长公主有关。因为老太太最喜欢的就是这个女儿（所以后来“遗诏尽以东宫金钱财物赐长公主嫖”），她可以不稀罕这个孙子（反正有一大堆），但不能太伤害女儿的女婿（如果女儿、外孙女对他很满意的话）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以后来馆陶长公主可以很干脆地说：“帝非我不得立。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，汉武帝有一段时间，可以说是在陈皇后的庇护之下的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乾纲独断之后，对汉武帝这样一个雄才大略心高气傲的皇帝来说，恐怕想起这段往事，不是感恩，而是屈辱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈皇后偏偏完全不理解皇帝的心理不照顾皇帝的情绪。《史记》说她“骄贵”，《汉书》说她“擅宠骄贵”，这个宠恐怕不是宠爱的意思，而是地位高的意思。因为汉武帝的性格显然是，你因为我的宠爱骄纵一点，那没有关系；你仗着自己的地位骄纵，那就非常严重了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以皇后被废是早晚的问题，废皇后的那个案子，也要让张汤这样的酷吏来从重判刑，极力株连。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《史记》里介绍汉武帝的皇后，居然一上来就是卫子夫，然后用插叙的手法，告诉大家汉武帝还有过一位陈皇后，这体现的是汉武帝时代的氛围。《汉书》才老老实实按照时间顺序，孝武陈皇后、孝武卫皇后这么写下来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;太子刘据挺过第一轮挑战&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;按照《史记》的说法，汉武帝对第二个皇后卫子夫的宠爱，似乎也不过如此。在特定的环境下突然看见，特别喜欢，然后带进宫里，然后居然有一年多把她忘掉了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但卫子夫无疑是汉武帝的福星。她给汉武帝带来了三个女儿，一个儿子，但更重要的是还有卫青、霍去病两位耀眼的名将。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开始的时候，卫青因为是皇后卫子夫的弟弟，才获得了带兵打仗的机会；但没过几年，大概就变成了因为是大将军卫青的姐姐，卫子夫的皇后地位才没有被撼动了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卫青武功赫赫，无可替代；卫青又柔媚低调，善于和各方面处好关系。元朔六年（公元前123年），卫青挟两次大胜匈奴之余威，低声下气地把皇帝给他的赏赐拿出一半来，给汉武帝所宠爱的王夫人的双亲祝寿。显然，王夫人已经对卫子夫的地位构成了强有力的挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王夫人得宠的这些年，司马迁正在宫里做郎官。后来王夫人去世，齐地的方士少翁为汉武帝召唤王夫人的魂魄，司马迁也是近距离观察到的。王夫人有多么被宠爱，他显然印象特别深。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王夫人也是生不逢时，她在汉武帝心中的地位，也许已经超越了卫子夫，但她得宠的年代，正是卫青、霍去病对汉武帝来说不可或缺的时代。元狩六年（公元前117年），霍去病赶在自己去世之前，请求汉武帝封太子以外的三位皇子为王，汉武帝答应了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁以“好奇”著称，但写到汉武帝后宫的那点事，他嘴巴算相当严。所以有些细节要靠别人补：当时王夫人生病，汉武帝问她，你想我把你儿子封到哪里？王夫人说洛阳，汉武帝说洛阳是真不行，“关东之国无大于齐者。齐东负海而城郭大，古时独临菑中十万户，天下膏腴地莫盛于齐者矣”，就让你儿子做齐王吧。王夫人去世后，汉武帝还特别给了她一个齐国王太后的身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果褚少孙补的这段可信，王夫人提出把洛阳封给儿子，那若不是觉悟太低，那就分明是怄气；汉武帝则对王夫人似乎有些亏欠愧疚的样子，或许曾经答应过她什么但没能兑现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论如何，卫子夫和太子刘据挺过了第一轮挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“倾城倾国”的李夫人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;接下来李夫人最得宠的那几年，大致就是元封年间（前110年~前105年），司马迁在这期间结束了郎官生涯做太史令去了，和宫里的事拉开了一点距离。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从《史记》看不出李夫人受宠的程度。但班固写到李夫人，八卦的心简直要炸裂了：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一，班固说，汉武帝先赏识的是李夫人的哥哥李延年。李延年唱了这样一支歌：“北方有佳人，绝世而独立，一顾倾人城，再顾倾人国。宁不知倾城与倾国，佳人难再得！”汉武帝听了很感叹，说世上真有这么美的人吗。于是汉武帝的姐姐平阳公主（卫子夫也是她推荐的，这算她的职业）就向汉武帝推荐了李夫人。从此汉武帝宠爱得不得了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二，班固说，李夫人病重，汉武帝来看她。李夫人把自己蒙在被子里，说我病重很久了，“形貌毁坏”，不可以见皇帝，我的心愿就是皇帝能照顾好我的儿子和兄弟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝非常想见一见李夫人的脸，李夫人就是不肯，最后汉武帝很生气地走了。李夫人的姐妹责怪她，干吗这么惹皇帝生气？李夫人说，我不让皇帝看我现在的样子，是为我的兄弟好，“夫以色事人者，色衰而爱弛，爱弛则恩绝”，见不到现在的我，皇帝会一直记得我最美的样子；见到现在的我，那只会从此嫌弃我了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个经典案例，经常被引用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三，少翁召唤王夫人魂魄的那个故事，被班固拿过来安在了李夫人身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第四，班固说，见到李夫人魂魄之后，“上又自为作赋，以伤悼夫人”。这是一首很长也有很多难懂字词的作品，这里就不抄了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;八卦故事是所有人都有可能编的，替帝王写爱情诗，也是很多文人的爱好，所以班固所记的以上四点，断言是真的或者断言是假的，都很冒险。但还是那句话，关于李夫人的段子这么多，正说明人们心目中，李夫人才是汉武帝心目中最重要的女人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且，如果说上面的事真假存疑，那下面这两件事，班固这种级别的历史学家是绝对不会胡来的：一是李夫人去世后，“上以后礼葬焉”，她是皇后之礼下葬的；二是汉武帝去世后，霍光知道皇帝的想法，“以李夫人配食，追上尊号曰孝武皇后”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李夫人被当作皇后看待，那她的儿子应该是什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有就是那首“倾国倾城”的歌，怎么听都像是带着谶语的味道。众所周知，中国的史书有个特点，谶语可以是胡编的，但既然把这个预言写下来了，它就是会应验的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么李夫人倒是造成了什么灾难性后果，才配得上倾国倾城这么一个谶语？当然只有巫蛊之祸了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;卫氏外戚的凋零&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;其实在《汉书》里，班固另外留下了许多的蛛丝马迹，而这些记录，刚好是能和司马迁对之前的历史的叙述，完美衔接的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下面让我们回到庸俗的宫斗剧情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起王夫人，李夫人有个最大的幸运：不是卫子夫更加年老色衰了，而是卫青、霍去病这两个障碍已经不存在了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;霍去病于元狩六年（前117年）去世，卫青虽然活到元封五年（前106年），但后来一直没有带过兵。因为元鼎、元封年间，汉武帝面对的对手，已经不再是巅峰状态的匈奴。类似南越、东越、朝鲜这样的敌人，其他的将军们也足以控制局面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这不意味着障碍完全扫除，现在活跃的将军们也和卫青、霍去病关系密切。卫青带出来十几个将军，霍去病培养了两个。灭东越发挥重要作用的横海将军韩说，灭朝鲜的将军荀彘，还有公孙贺、公孙敖等人，当年都在卫青麾下。灭南越的主将路博德，生擒楼兰王的赵破奴，出自霍去病系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可见，所谓卫青不养士大夫，主要是指不养长安城里的名嘴、活动家还有游侠之类，打了这么多年仗，在军队里杀伐决断，当然还是要培养自己的班底的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的还有李广家族，尽管李广之死被认为和卫青有关，李广的儿子李敢更据信是死于霍去病之手，但是李、卫两家，还是迅速修复了关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李广的堂弟李蔡，是因为跟着卫青打仗，才拿到侯爵的；甚至李敢本人能够“赐爵关内侯”，也是在霍去病麾下。然后李敢的女儿成了卫太子宠爱的女人，李敢的儿子李禹也是卫太子宠信的部下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些人算一个政治集团吗？汉武帝在，太子的地位不动摇，就不算是，因为他们之间的关系也错综复杂矛盾重重；但如果汉武帝换太子了，他们就是：因为新太子要有新班底，他们就要给人家腾位子。就像当年，萧何、曹参之间的矛盾曾经很大，但一旦刘邦想废掉汉惠帝改立赵王刘如意，他们就又是在同一条战壕里的老兄弟。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;李氏外戚不争气&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;以下是我根据上述史料拟合的一个推测：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;元封（前110年~前105年）间的某一年，李夫人去世，从此以一个最美丽的形象，定格于汉武帝心中。汉武帝心中，李夫人才是皇后，他于是想改立昌邑王刘髆为太子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝此时五十岁上下，精力或许已经不如当年，但无疑更加深谋远虑手腕老辣。这么重大的事情，他不会急于表态，甚至于想法都不会流露出来多少。那会直接导致原来的军政体系失灵，无论如何是不值得的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太初元年（公元前104年），李广利被任命为贰师将军，指挥了一场耗时四年、使得全国上下都超负荷运转的战争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，战争是本来就要打的，但由李广利来指挥，说是“欲侯宠姬李氏”，还是说得轻了。只是想让李广利封侯，让他和赵破奴这样的将军合作，打一场类似征楼兰这样轻松的战争，封侯的理由就足够了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但李广利的指挥部里，赵始成、李哆、上官桀这些人的来历虽然不很清楚，但反正就是没有卫青、霍去病麾下的老将。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝在想培养一个由李广利主导的，和卫青、霍去病无关的新的军功集体。这样将来即使换太子，也不会引起太大震动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但李广利实在太不争气，征大宛是得不偿失的惨胜，打匈奴是一次又一次的惨败。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，今天的研究者可能会认为李广利的能力也没有那么不堪。后世的经验表明，中原王朝的力量向西推进的极限，就是帕米尔高原东麓，李广利征大宛超出了这个极限。和匈奴作战，此时的局势也和卫青霍去病时代完全不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个时代，汉朝的战略优势，对匈奴人来说是无解的，所以匈奴再怎么打胜仗都还是在寻求与汉朝和谈；但匈奴的战术优势对汉朝来说也几乎是无解的：征大宛之后，汉朝战马紧缺的问题不是缓解了而是极大加剧了，匈奴人的机动优势变得更大，所以面对出征的汉军，只需要躲避，窥探，跟踪……等到你不得不撤退，已经临近家乡也是最精疲力竭的时候，突然发动致命一击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以对汉朝来说最明智的选择就是防守，看着中原一天天好起来、匈奴一天天坏下去就可以了。但只要远距离出征，换其他将领也没什么好结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这些说法今天也不见得大家都会接受，汉朝人更不会这么想，还是拿李广利和卫青、霍去病比较，抚昔伤今比较符合人性。哪怕是当年看不上卫、霍的，现在的心理，也是“不需上溯文景世，回首获麟已惘然”吧？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝也在渐渐失去耐心。皇帝对一个女人的追恋，能维持这么久，已经是一个奇迹了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;天汉四年（前97年）春，李广利又一次征匈奴无功，夏，刘髆被封为昌邑王。虽然不能说这就是名分已定，但终究不是好兆头。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;刘弗陵出生与“尧母门”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;太始三年（前94年），钩弋赵婕妤为六十三岁的汉武帝又生了一个小皇子刘弗陵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;讲到钩弋夫人赵婕妤的故事，班固又开始放飞八卦的心：汉武帝巡狩过河间郡的时候，不是官吏而是“望气者”发现了这个奇女子。她的双手天生握成拳头无法张开，汉武帝就上去摸了摸，哇，美少女的手掌张开了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些都是班固清清楚楚写在《汉书•外戚传》里的，和《汉武故事》里的相关内容几乎一模一样。《汉武故事》假托是班固的作品，固然不可信，但要认为班固写的都是严谨精密的历史，其余作品都是荒诞不经的小说，截然对立起来，也是不现实的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后，赵婕妤怀刘弗陵的时间，据说长达十四个月。汉武帝说，听说尧也是在妈妈肚子里待了十四个月才生的。于是就把赵婕妤居住的地方，宫门命名为“尧母门”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尧可是上古圣王啊，把天下治理得那么好，当今世上居然又诞生了一个尧，不让他当皇帝，你不觉得可惜吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个地方，司马迁其实倒是蛮配合汉武帝的。关于尧的传说很多，《史记》采信的版本是，尧是帝喾的小儿子，挤掉了自己的全部哥哥继承了天子之位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，李夫人这颗当年心头的朱砂痣虽然还不至于变成蚊子血，但确实有一缕新鲜的白月光，照进了皇帝的生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，这时候紧张的不只有卫子夫和太子，也有命运和外甥牢牢绑定在一起的李广利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;往前看，太子的背影好像越来越远，往后看，那个当代唐尧正在快速逼近。要想不被后面那个人追上，最好是赶紧追上前面那个人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;赵地老乡走得近？&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;方诗铭先生是特别善于根据人物籍贯发现政治集团的前辈学者，传统社会里，人与人之间的关系，除掉血缘就是老乡特别重要。这个方法当然不绝对正确，但是确实能解释不少问题。他有一篇论文梳理出这样一条线索：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李夫人、李广利家是“中山故倡”，中山是被赵地包围着的，《史记•货殖列传》介绍天下风俗，也是把赵和中山放在一起说的。所以中山人和赵人，都是家乡人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么再看巫蛊之祸中，逼死太子的过程里发挥重要作用的人物有哪些：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先就是丞相刘屈氂，他是汉武帝的兄弟中山靖王刘胜的儿子——史书上那么多“中山靖王刘胜之后”，很难得，这个是真的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诸侯王的儿子到朝廷来做大官，其实是很不容易的事。《汉书》说“不知其始所以进”，但又告诉我们，刘屈氂和李广利不但是中山老乡，而且是儿女亲家。（《刘屈氂传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长安城里驻扎着胡人骑兵，汉武帝父子开战的时候，谁能得到这支军队的支持，就赢得了关键的筹码。帮助汉武帝杀掉太子的使者，夺得这支军队的指挥权的人，叫马通，也就是东汉伏波将军马援的曾祖父，是不久前，刚刚从赵国的邯郸搬到茂陵来居住的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且在对匈奴的战场上，马通和李广利协同作战，关系很密切。（《汉书•匈奴传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马通的哥哥马何罗，则和江充是好朋友。（《汉书•金日磾传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然还有咬太子咬得最凶，冲锋在最前列的江充，他也是邯郸人，而且他们家的特点和中山李氏一样，也是以歌舞见长的。众所周知，演艺圈里有自己独特的关系网。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反正可以肯定的是，征和二年（前91年）逼死了太子，征和三年（前90年）李广利又率军出击匈奴，走到渭桥，李广利就对送行的刘屈氂说：“愿君侯早请昌邑王为太子。如立为帝，君侯长何忧乎？”这场大灾难，他们是受益者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但也就在这一年，有人向汉武帝举报，刘屈氂的妻子在行巫蛊诅咒皇帝。汉武帝派有关部门调查审理，认为“罪至大逆不道”，于是刘屈氂全家族灭。在前方和匈奴作战的李广利听到了消息，知道回汉朝也是死罪，也就投降了匈奴。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这件事，听起来像是刘屈氂的妻子脑子进水。但事实可能是汉武帝知道了太子是被他们陷害的。但陷害太子的事归罪于江充没问题，归罪于丞相和贰师将军，一系列宫廷内幕勾心斗角都会揭发出来，连带滋生无数谣言，所以另找理由把他们收拾了，反正此时巫蛊这个罪名，就像今天说贪污一样，基本是百发百中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也不是臆测，实际上班固又是写到了的，后元元年（前88年），汉武帝身体已经快垮了，不经意间说了实话：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上报曰：“朕之不德，自左丞相（刘屈氂）与贰师（李广利）阴谋逆乱，巫蛊之祸流及士大夫……”（《汉书•车千秋传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“阴谋逆乱”如果是指刘屈氂行巫蛊，那此事并没有“流及士大夫”，只有理解为指他们陷害太子，才是合理的。颜师古注释《汉书》的时候，也是这么理解的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这么看来，这场太子和皇后丧命，几万人陪葬（《汉书》原文：“僵尸数万”），喋血京师的大灾难，策划者实际上是李夫人的哥哥李广利。按照“红颜祸水”的逻辑，当然确乎是应验了李夫人“倾国倾城”了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;卫太子是一个什么样的人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;比较容易判断的，是《汉书》里的卫太子形象和《资治通鉴》确实不一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《资治通鉴》说，太子“仁恕温谨”，“敦重好静”，这个形象《汉书》里是不存在的；“群臣宽厚长者皆附太子”这个局面，也和《汉书》的记述完全不符。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《汉书》里对卫太子的介绍，最重要的就是这句话：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上为立博望苑，使通宾客，从其所好，故多以异端进者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太子身边聚集着一大批绝不安分的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以事实上太子的团队行动能力相当强。觉得要被汉武帝的使者陷害，立刻就能做出反应，能抓的抓，该杀的杀，一点也不含糊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后组织武装力量也算相当有效率：太子抢占了长安城的武库，武装自己的宾客；调动皇后卫子夫居住的长乐宫的力量；再释放长安城的囚徒颁给武器。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外差点调动成功的还有：一、屯驻在长安东南的长水骑兵和屯驻于长安西南的宣曲骑兵；二、任安的北军。按照《汉书》的描写，汉武帝和卫太子对这两支队伍的争夺，输赢成败也真可谓电光石火一瞬间事：马通稍微晚到一步，太子的手下如侯（此人身份居然是个囚徒）就能调走胡人骑兵；任安是做过太子少傅的，他对太子的忠诚稍微再多一点点，就不会置身事外。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要不是早就对起兵造反做过预案，对长安城可以利用的军事力量做过深入全面的调查分析，有详尽的计划周密的部署，恐怕很难想象有这样的行动效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使失去了这两支劲旅，太子的军队仍然形成了很强的战斗力。汉武帝平叛的军队，应该是以郎中令、卫尉的精锐为骨干，配备着汉朝最尖端的令匈奴也心惊胆战的各种类型的弓弩（所以汉武帝强调不要近战），加上三辅的地方部队，可就是这样也大战了五天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，反应之敏捷，行动之迅速，作战之强悍，都表明卫太子不是人善被人欺的角色。和传说要造反却束手无策的淮南王刘安相比，刘安真应该发明一块豆腐把自己撞死。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;班固对太子还作了一番很有意思的评论。太子出生，“蚩尤之旗见，其长竟天”，所谓“蚩尤之旗”，是指天上拖着长长尾巴的彗星，古人认为这是兵戈灾祸的象征。汉朝对匈奴的战争开始了，太子出生了。之后仗一打就是三十年，“兵所诛屠夷灭死者不可胜数”，再然后就是这场京城里的大战乱。所以“太子生长于兵，与之终始”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本来读这句话，也只是让人觉得，班固在暗示：太子代表战火和杀意。公布的《清华简·五纪》中的一句话，才让人豁然开朗：“黄帝有子曰蚩尤，既长成人，乃作为五兵。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;班固明明是在说，太子就是蚩尤的化身。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而《史记》里关于太子的只言片语，也看不出司马迁对太子任何亲近感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;庸俗地想，太子和汉武帝决战长安的时候，司马迁大概还是宁可汉武帝获胜的，哪怕就是为了自己活命。他此时是汉武帝的中书令，说难听点就是帮助皇帝处理行政事务的一个宦官，如果太子赢，皇帝身边玉石俱焚，司马迁多半也跑不掉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁的朋友任安、田仁也不是严格意义上的太子党。田仁可以算忠于太子的，但他的职务却是丞相府的官员（要按照谍战剧的思维来理解，更应该说太子是个厉害人物了）；任安更可疑，接了太子的兵符不发兵，汉武帝说他“怀二心”，其实就是承认他并不算太子的人，而且也是雄猜之主对臣子要求高，照一般人看来，那个时候按兵不动，还是偏向皇帝多一些的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他和太子有关的人物：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁对卫青、霍去病的印象，众所周知是不好的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太子的老师石德，被有的学者拿来做“群臣宽厚长者皆附太子”的论据。其实司马迁对石德是有评价的：石家的祖上，能力才学不行，就是做人谨慎的品德很厉害，等到石德的爸爸去世之后，他们家“孝谨益衰矣”。这就离说石德一无是处不远了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有李广的孙子，“敢男禹有宠于太子，然好利，李氏陵迟衰微矣”，被太子宠信的李禹，在司马迁眼里是个庸俗的财迷，更是他敬爱的飞将军李广的不肖子孙。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太子和汉武帝之间矛盾爆发，说穿了就是两派政治势力的斗争而已，不存在什么“两条路线之争”，也没有什么道义和理想可言。只是逼到了这一步了，谁也退缩不得，争的既是至高无上的皇权，也是最卑微的生存。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这么说，司马迁不写巫蛊之祸，也不妨给一个文学性的解释：他那支豪情慷慨英雄气贯注的笔，没有办法面对这个时代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他笔下的太初之前的汉武帝时代，固然也充斥着凶暴与血污，但也豪杰辈出俊采星驰，哪怕他所憎恶的那些卑鄙无耻的人物，也精神昂扬气象恢廓，这种余晖，照耀进天汉年间，但到了太始、征和，就真的只剩下令人窒息的疯狂和算计了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不是因为哪个人死了世界才变了，而是今夜的寒风，吹落昨夜的星辰，那漫天的星斗，就是自然而然又无可挽回的黯淡了下去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个角度说，倒是宁可司马光讲的那个故事是真的，显得好歹有一点理想和亲情的温度吧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;
