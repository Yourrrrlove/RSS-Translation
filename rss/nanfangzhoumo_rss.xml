Citizens were jogging on the greenway around the lake. Hotels, restaurants, art centers, and Olympic sports centers were built around the lake. , entertainment clubs, etc. are waiting for guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lushui Bay is a ten-minute drive from the center of Zhangye. It used to be a mine left behind by sand mining. It is now a national AAAA-level tourist attraction and &quot;the most beautiful scenery in the development of ecological tourism in the Hexi Corridor.&quot; In July 2023, a &quot;Water Carnival&quot; was held here. Someone on the social media platform commented that &quot;it does not have the dust of the northwest, but has the feeling of beautiful mountains and clear waters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/f549fa2025.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/f549fa2025.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;An exhibition board near the Lushui Bay Scenic Area shows comparison pictures before and after construction. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the reputation, the artificial water surface in the scenic spot has never been issued a water abstraction permit-26 million cubic meters of water will be abstracted from the Heihe River in 2022 alone, which is equivalent to nearly half a year of life in Zhangye City Use water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The weak water in &quot;Three thousand weak waters, only take one scoop to drink&quot; is the Black River. The Heihe River originates from Qinghai, and Zhangye City is located in the middle reaches. It contains more than 90% of the cultivated land and population in the basin, and more than 80% of the water consumption and GDP. Lushui Bay is known as Zhangye&#39;s &quot;humidifier&quot;, but if too much water is intercepted, it may affect downstream water use. The Ejina Banner of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia in the lower reaches of the Heihe River is one of the origins of sandstorms in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye, located in the Hexi Corridor, is located at the intersection of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. It is a natural oasis on the Silk Road. The &quot;gold&quot; in the ancient name &quot;Jin Zhangye&quot; not only reflects the wealth of this place, but also shows that in this arid zone oasis, water resources are as precious as gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Including Lushuiwan Scenic Area, the inspection report showed that there are more than 30 artificial water surfaces in Zhangye City with illegal and illegal problems, with a total water area of ​​more than 6,000 acres. These artificial water surfaces, which have only appeared in the past ten years, also carry expectations for the transformation and upgrading of Zhangye&#39;s cultural tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zhangye City was designated as my country&#39;s first water-saving society pilot area by the Ministry of Water Resources as early as 2002, and has made many water-saving explorations. However, this time the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspectorate not only reported that Zhangye illegally extracted surface water, but also failed to control over-exploitation of groundwater. &quot;Zhangye City has not implemented the strictest water resources management system in place. Economic development and urban construction have not fully considered the water environment carrying capacity of the Heihe River Basin. The problem of inaction and random actions by some departments is outstanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1,248 acres of artificial The water is involved in &quot;building before approval&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangye Ganzhou is known as &quot;half city of reeds, half city of pagoda shadows&quot;. The name &quot;Lushui Bay&quot; may place its hope on recreating its historical features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with famous scenic spots such as Zhangye Danxia National Geopark, Lushui Bay is a new attraction. Before 2009, there was no open water landscape here, but rocky beaches, sand pits, stone quarries, and construction waste dumps, all of which were inaccessible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking from the map, the Lushuiwan Scenic Area is connected by three artificial lakes. To the northeast is the Zhangye National Wetland Park, which was built at the same time. The two together form the Lushuiwan Tourist Resort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fe1fabd75.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fe1fabd75.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260736&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye National Wetland Park. Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the Luchuiwan scenic spot is beautiful and crowded with tourists; in the wetland park, great egrets &quot;stand guard&quot; next to the water plants, and densely packed white mergansers, pintail ducks, Red-billed pochards are waiting on the water to hold a &quot;meeting&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development and construction of Lushuiwan tourist resort, the bungalows and shanties here were demolished, and lake-view community houses were built one after another. Song Xiaoyu, associate researcher at the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others have made calculations. In 2011, the average selling price of commercial housing within a 500-meter radius of Zhangye National Wetland Park was 3,232 yuan/square meter, rising to 4,147 yuan/square meter in 2021. square meter, excluding factors such as inflation and infrastructure construction, the landscape value premium of the wetland park is 715 yuan/square meter, and the total added value of the landscape reaches 32 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fed4194bd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fed4194bd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260737&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye National Wetland Park. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the past, there was a rock and sand quarry, and today we are an ecologically happy river.” The transformation of Lushui Bay has been promoted as a positive and typical case of ecological and environmental governance. However, as the core landscape in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area, the artificial water surface was notified by the inspection team as being built before approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau, the preliminary procedures involved in the artificial lake include: project approval, construction project land pre-examination opinion, environmental impact report approval, water resources demonstration report approval, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members said that almost none of these procedures were completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Zhangye Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the Lushui Bay Scenic Area project did not have a project approval from the development and reform department, and there was no environmental impact assessment of the construction project. &quot;The project approval is a birth certificate, otherwise it is &#39; Black households&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lushuiwan Scenic Area, which was built 12 years ago, has not gone through the relevant procedures, which is incredible. “Lushui Bay is so good that everyone is used to it,” said the above-mentioned person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The artificial water surfaces built before approval in Zhangye are not an isolated case. They also include 11 artificial water surfaces in the Olympic Forest Park (referred to as Orson Park) across the river from Lushui Bay, totaling 1,248 acres. Since the country strengthened the investigation and rectification of &quot;lake digging and landscaping&quot; in June 2020, two artificial lakes have been newly built in Zhangye Ruoshui Park, with a water area of ​​165 acres; the newly built artificial lakes in Baita Rainbow Park and the park on the west side of Zhangye Grand Theater have It also occupied 24.4 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Mine pit turned into park, lack of ecological restoration plan&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the artificial water surfaces reported by the inspector, the water intake area of ​​Zhangye Aosen Park is second only to the artificial lake in Lushui Bay Scenic Area, equivalent to half of the latter. Its story is also similar to Lushui Bay: restoration-planting trees-water diversion-development-development of tourism + real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before 2017, the original site of Aosen Park was a deserted Gobi desert with no grass growing on it. There were many large pits left by sand and gravel mining in the sand and gravel factory. The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Conservancy Bureau responded to Southern Weekend Reporters, diverting water from the Heihe River to build artificial water surfaces is an ecological restoration method that “kills two birds with one stone”: the mine pits are treated to prevent seepage and then filled with water, which is low-cost; the water storage can also provide water sources for the surrounding forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260738&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Olympic Forest Park. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Aosen Park is the largest artificial afforestation base in Zhangye - as of 2023, Aosen Park has completed 60,000 acres of afforestation and greening, and built 37 new water storage ponds and dams. 22.41 kilometers of river channels were dredged. According to its plan, it attempts to create an ecological leisure and health gathering area integrating tourism, health care, sports and entertainment. Aosen Park not only plans to build distribution plazas, sports fields and parking lots, but also supports Shenkeng Hotel, Heihe Water Ecology Museum, Forest Health Care Community, Forest Sports Town, etc. The investment is estimated to reach 2.86 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members believe that these mines should develop tailor-made ecological restoration plans in accordance with relevant national management regulations and scientifically demonstrate their ecological impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge of the Ganzhou District Heihe Forestry Farm, the unit responsible for the Osun Park project, said frankly that how to repair the more than 40 mine pits, whether to cover them with soil and then plant grass and trees, or to prevent seepage and then fill them with water , and no ecological restoration plan has been carried out independently. Finally, depending on factors such as the topography of the mine pit, some cover the area with soil and then plant trees, while others do anti-seepage and then inject water. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why not apply for a water abstraction permit? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Open the satellite map on your mobile phone. The green Zhangye is surrounded by the yellow Gobi Desert. Pieces of agate-like blue water are embedded in the territory of Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye is not rich in water resources. Zhangye has a temperate arid climate, with annual precipitation of only 100-250 mm, but annual evaporation as high as 1400-2700 mm. These artificial water surfaces are created mainly from the Heihe River flowing through Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/2dd96aa896.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/2dd96aa896.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260739&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it. Screenshot of the video of the inspection team&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there no water abstraction permits for these artificial water surfaces? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Ganzhou District Water Affairs Bureau of Zhangye City explained that the water in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area is diverted from the surrounding agricultural main canals. The water in the main canals has obtained a water abstraction permit. The water consumption of the artificial water surface in Lushui Bay is increased by the main canals. The water consumption for agricultural irrigation does not exceed the total water permit. However, members of the inspection team said that the permitted use of water in the main canal is limited to agricultural irrigation, and the artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area is ecological water and does not comply with the water intake permit regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only does Lushui Bay Scenic Area not have a water permit. The inspector reported that Zhangye Ruoshui Huahai Scenic Area has not applied for a water abstraction license from 2016 to 2021. After applying for a new license in 2022, it still drew an excess of 67,000 cubic meters of water from the Heihe River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260740&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Ruoshuihuahai Scenic Area. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The runoff of the Heihe River has been relatively low in recent years&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A bigger concern is whether diverting water from the Heihe River to create such a large-scale artificial water surface in the city will affect downstream water use And ecology? According to the Heihe River water diversion plan determined by the State Council in 1997, about 60% of the water volume was released downstream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau said that since August 2000, Zhangye City has continuously completed the water diversion tasks from the Heihe River. Especially in 2023, the precipitation will be 20% less than in previous years, and the annual runoff will be dry. However, The discharge task has still been exceeded, and the downstream Dongjuyan Sea has not dried up since 2004. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant people believe that Zhangye’s arid climate, high evaporation, and illegal construction of artificial water surfaces in the city have exacerbated water shortages. The performance may not be obvious during the wet season, but in recent years the Heihe River runoff has been relatively dry, which has already revealed ecological risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260741&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it. Screenshot of the video of the inspection team&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station introduced that since 2003, the Heihe River has entered a rare 18-year continuous wet season. Song Xiaoyu said that according to data from the Yingluoxia Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Heihe River, the multi-year average runoff entering the middle reaches is about 1.58 billion cubic meters. The average annual runoff from 2005 to 2020 exceeded 2 billion cubic meters, reaching a peak of 23.5 in 2017. One hundred million cubic meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ejina Banner in the lower reaches of the Heihe River feels the greatest changes in water volume. According to &quot;Ban Yue Tan&quot;, from 2016 to 2020, the number of days when rivers in Ejina Banner were closed was reduced from the previous average of 250 days to 55 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the runoff of the Heihe River has decreased in recent years. According to the Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station, the runoff during the 2023 dispatch period is only 1.38 billion cubic meters, less than 60% of the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past three years, the Ejina oasis ecology, which has already improved, has begun to &quot;cry thirsty&quot; again. Data provided by the Alxa League Water Conservancy Bureau to &quot;Half Moon Talk&quot; shows: Since 2020, the Ejina in the Heihe River Basin has The number of flow-free days in this section has been around 100 for three consecutive years. On May 20, 2022, the entire Ejina section of the Heihe River Basin was cut off. The East Juyan Sea has not received water supply for more than 10 months.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2023, respectively Year-on-year decreases of 0.39, 0.26, and 0.81 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, due to long-term large-scale extraction of groundwater, Zhangye City has formed 7 over-exploitation areas, all of which are restricted mining areas. The &quot;Groundwater Management Regulations&quot; stipulate that the provincial water conservancy department, in conjunction with the natural resources and other departments, organizes the delineation of groundwater prohibited and restricted areas within the administrative region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector also reported that since 2020, thousands of excessive water withdrawal problems have occurred in Zhangye&#39;s over-mining area, and the local water affairs department has basically failed to investigate and deal with them in accordance with the law. In the restricted mining area, 160 million cubic meters of groundwater was used beyond the permitted limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter, the relevant person in charge of the Zhangye City Water Affairs Bureau said that although some water wells drew more groundwater than allowed, other wells drew less water than allowed, and the total amount of groundwater drawn in the region was not. Exceeds total permitted range. The reason why there are no administrative penalties for thousands of excessive water withdrawals is because the local government implements a tiered water price mechanism. After exceeding the permitted water use, higher water fees can be charged and adjusted through market mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant analysts believe that this move is suspected of &quot;selling water&quot; and is not conducive to the management of groundwater overexploitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the State Council&#39;s &quot;Opinions on Implementing the Strict Water Resources Management System&quot; required that &quot;in areas where groundwater is over-exploited, new withdrawals of groundwater from agriculture, industrial construction projects and service industries are prohibited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector reported that since 2016, the local water department has illegally approved 20 wells including Zhiyuan Forestry Technology Co., Ltd. In January 2016, the Gansu Provincial Department of Water Resources required that all self-provided water wells within the coverage of the public water supply network be closed in 2016. Not only did Zhangye City fail to implement the relevant requirements, it even issued water abstraction licenses for 49 wells of enterprises in the Economic Development Zone. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the groundwater data provided by the relevant authorities in Zhangye City are confusing and contradictory. The 2015 groundwater water consumption data provided by the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau to the inspection team differed by more than 46 million cubic meters from the data provided to reporters. Southern Weekend reporters asked the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau for the reason, but as of press time, no reply has been received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector stated that this was not an isolated case. During the inspection process, due to the prominent cases of misreporting, concealment and false reporting by relevant competent authorities, the workload of on-site verification was greatly increased. For example, the inspection team reviewed the list of self-provided water wells covered by Zhangye City’s public water supply pipe network. The Municipal Water Affairs Bureau only provided a list of Ganzhou District, including the water wells of three companies. However, the inspection team went to the Economic Development Zone in Ganzhou District for on-site inspection and found that there were 49 water wells in dozens of companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Water conservation requires institutional reform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In winter, the Heihe River enters the dry season. When driving on the Zhangye Heihe River Bridge, the river bed under the bridge has dried up, exposing yellow soil and gray sand and gravel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260743&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;At the end of November 2023, in the Zhangye Heihe River section in winter, some rivers had dried up. Photo by Southern Weekend Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The per capita water resource in Zhangye City is only 1,250 cubic meters, which is 60% of the national average. As a large agricultural city, the average water quantity per mu is only 511 cubic meters, which is only 60% of the national average. Thirty percent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye’s water resource shortage is inseparable from its economic structure. In 2022, Zhangye&#39;s three industrial structure ratios will be 29.3:20.4:50.3, with agriculture accounting for a larger proportion of the economy than industry. Agricultural water accounts for about 90% of the city’s water use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to climatic advantages such as long sunshine hours and large temperature differences between day and night, Zhangye is rich in high-quality agricultural products. The &quot;Wujiang tribute rice&quot;, which has been famous since the Tang Dynasty because the rice grains do not stick together after being cooked, has been significantly reduced due to the water-saving rice planting area. On the large tracts of farmland near Lushuiwan Scenic Area and Aosen Park, billboards proclaiming &quot;100,000 acres of vegetable base for Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao&quot; were erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seasonal distribution of water resources in the Heihe River is uneven, and the timing of incoming water and agricultural water use is not completely coordinated. Song Xiaoyu told Southern Weekend reporters that the Heihe River water resources come from glaciers, frozen soil, snowmelt water and rainfall. The precipitation is mainly concentrated from July to September, and from March to June when agricultural water is most urgent, 60 to 70% The water needs to be supplied by glaciers, frozen soil, and melted snow. Winter snowfall and snow contribute 20%-25% of the water source to the Heihe River runoff in the second year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu said that Zhangye, located in high latitudes and high altitudes, is a sensitive area greatly affected by climate change. The temperature is increasing at a faster rate. The glacier area has decreased by about 20% in the past 50 years, and the snow line is also rising. From October to December 2022, the snowfall in Shandan, Minle and Sunan counties in Zhangye was 70% less than the average of the past ten years. The decrease in surface runoff has also led to an increase in groundwater withdrawals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such economic, social and climatic conditions, Zhangye urgently needs to further improve water resource utilization. Song Xiaoyu believes that Zhangye City has gone through long-term exploration of water conservation work, and the current irrigation efficiency is already at a high level. The next step is to make breakthroughs in institutional mechanisms, such as further deepening the reform of agricultural water rights and water prices, improving the water rights trading system, and continuing to promote High-standard farmland construction, accelerating industrial structure adjustment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu and others have conducted research on Ganzhou District of Zhangye City and found that optimizing the water rights allocation model, high-standard farmland construction and industrial structure adjustment can respectively increase the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources by up to 1.87%. , 8.72% and 3.06%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For local authorities, institutional reform faces many challenges such as funding, technology, and talent. However, in order to continue to optimize water resource management and improve water resource utilization efficiency, this work is imperative. .&quot; Song Xiaoyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[裁判文书里出现“安徽省南京市”？深圳福田法院通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261903]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:05:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Situation Report&lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, some media pointed out Our court has corrected the misstatement of &quot;Nanjing City, Anhui Province&quot; in the enforcement ruling.

The &quot;Notice&quot; focuses on six aspects of work requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;First, attach great importance to the common prevention of multiple diseases. &lt;/strong>;Fully understand the current work situation and significance of epidemic prevention and control in winter, adhere to bottom-line thinking and common prevention of multiple diseases, and respond to the possible overlapping epidemic periods and alternating epidemic peaks of multiple epidemic diseases, Make scientific and effective responses according to the time and situation, and solidly implement various prevention and control measures to protect the lives, health and safety of teachers and students to the greatest extent possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The second is to strengthen monitoring and early warning intervention. &lt;/strong>;Strengthen the construction of the epidemic monitoring system, focusing on the implementation of morning and afternoon inspection systems for primary and secondary schools and kindergartens, infectious disease epidemic reporting systems, and tracking and registration systems for absences due to illness. Regarding the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in local schools, proactively consult with the health and disease control departments to strengthen information exchange, collaboratively carry out risk analysis and prediction and early warning, and guide schools to achieve scientific and accurate responses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The third is to strengthen daily health education. &lt;/strong>;Carry out full-coverage, multi-form publicity on prevention and control knowledge of COVID-19 infection and other winter epidemic diseases. Teachers and students should be guided to deepen the concept of &quot;everyone is the first person responsible for their own health&quot;, wear masks scientifically, wash hands frequently, ventilate frequently, pay attention to cough etiquette, participate in appropriate exercises, and improve health literacy and self-protection capabilities. Strengthen family epidemic prevention guidance, and cooperate with relevant departments to promote and guide children and adolescents on influenza, pneumococcal and other vaccinations. Instruct teachers and students with symptoms such as fever and cough to take protective measures, seek medical treatment promptly, standardize treatment, use medicine scientifically, and attend school without illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The fourth is to strengthen services for sick students. &lt;/strong>;We will improve the response plan, ensure an orderly connection between online and offline teaching, and guide students who are absent from school due to illness to use rich online teaching resources to study at home. There are no strict requirements for students’ homework during their illness. Based on the characteristics of the course of respiratory diseases, parents are guided to allow sick students to receive adequate treatment and rest, and to make practical and scientific arrangements for returning to school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The fifth is to provide material support. &lt;/strong>;Work with the health and disease control departments to scientifically predict possible epidemics, dynamically adjust epidemic prevention material reserves, ensure the supply of medical and daily supplies, and improve the level of medical service security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sixth, we must pay close attention to the implementation of responsibilities. &lt;/strong>;Work with the health and disease control departments to strengthen the organization, leadership, supervision and inspection of the prevention and control of winter epidemic diseases, coordinate the advancement, and work together to ensure that all prevention and control measures are implemented in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2022年全国教育经费总投入首次超过6万亿元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261901]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 14:28:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Ministry of Education, the National Bureau of Statistics, and the Ministry of Finance recently released a statistical announcement on the implementation of national education funding in 2022.

Photo by Xun Hang&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On National Day this year, Xun Hang completed the 480th roller coaster check-in in Europe. As a high-risk amusement equipment, roller coasters have a history of more than 100 years since their birth in the 19th century, and have been introduced to China for nearly 40 years. To some extent, they have become a reference for measuring the configuration level of an amusement park. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I don&#39;t have the most, some friends have more than 800.&quot; Xun Hang, 32, has been riding roller coasters for ten years. &quot;. He could not remember the details of his first roller coaster ride as a child. He only remembered that &quot;it felt like I was going to fly. It was very exciting and very happy.&quot; Since then, I have wanted to go to an amusement park every holiday, and every time I go to an amusement park, I must ride the roller coaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Among the many projects in amusement parks, most equipment is highly homogeneous, but roller coasters can be infinitely varied.&quot; In order to have a better and more experience It’s a rollercoaster. When he was a student, Xun Hang visited many cities in China. After working as an adult, he expanded his footprints to North America, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is difficult to explain to outsiders why my hobby is riding roller coasters. Around 2010, Xun Hang found several roller coaster fans like himself through some forums and forums. In order to keep warm and share information, they formed a fan group called &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot;. Thirteen years later, this small team, which started with just a few people, now has nearly 150 members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 27, 2023, an accident occurred at the roller coaster &quot;Snow Eagle&quot; project in Shenzhen Happy Valley. A roller coaster broke down after going uphill along the track. It slipped and collided with another roller coaster that had arrived at the station and was discharging passengers, resulting in 4 serious injuries and 13 minor injuries. In November, the State Administration for Market Regulation deployed a nationwide special investigation and management of hidden dangers of roller coaster accidents to resolutely prevent the recurrence of roller coaster accidents like the &quot;10·27&quot; roller coaster accident at Shenzhen Happy Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Despite major negative events, the enthusiasm of roller coaster fans has not diminished. Xun Hang noticed that most members of &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot; regarded the above-mentioned accidents as sporadic cases and regarded them as &quot;small probability events.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73962&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70753&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/86d66a1897.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111461504461.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On October 20, 2021, tourists at the Shenzhen Happy Valley roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; kept screaming while playing.

The track length of the car is 887 meters, with the highest point reaching 60 meters. It is one of the tallest and longest catapult roller coasters built in China. It can run at a speed of 135 kilometers per hour. It is also one of the fastest roller coasters built in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We didn&#39;t believe it at first, but later we realized it was true.&quot; Yang Kaichun, a member of &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot; said that the reason why he was surprised was because &quot; &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has the &quot;very safe&quot; elements recognized by experienced players - brand parks, large-scale equipment and first-tier manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;23-year-old Yang Kaichun has experience riding nearly 200 roller coasters. The first time he rode a roller coaster, he was in sixth grade at Lotte World in South Korea. He was timid and reluctantly got on the roller coaster with the encouragement of his mother and the companionship of his younger brother. &quot;I sat down and took a lap and found that it was different from what I thought. Not only was it not scary, it was also very exciting. After sitting there, I was still unsatisfied and wanted to wait in line again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;This experience made Yang Kaichun have a strong interest in roller coasters. What is the control system of this unpowered car? How are the track paths designed? How to grasp human physiological limits during tumbling and spinning? How relevant is the human riding experience to the overall design? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to satisfy his curiosity, Yang Kaichun not only searched for roller coaster-related materials on the Internet, but also visited various parks at home and abroad. He even chose to go to college. majored in mechanical engineering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Roller coaster is a niche hobby, but Yang Kaichun has found many like-minded friends. In addition to sharing his experience on roller coasters, he also enjoys discussing the mechanical principles and control systems of roller coasters with like-minded people. &quot;It was a very pure and selfless exchange. Everyone didn&#39;t care whether they offended others. They just quarreled over an issue, but it didn&#39;t affect their feelings at all. Everyone purely loved roller coasters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the &quot;October 27&quot; roller coaster accident at Shenzhen Happy Valley, a heated discussion started in the &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot; WeChat group. &quot;The discussion started mainly at the technical level, and everyone speculated that there might be a problem with the anti-retraction device.&quot; Xun Hang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xun Hang said that among the members of &quot;Roller Coaster Dream&quot;, some may reduce the frequency of riding similar roller coasters from the same manufacturer in the near future, but overall, &quot;the It’s time to go to the amusement park to visit the amusement park.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past ten years of riding experience on hundreds of roller coasters, these roller coaster fans claim that they have never encountered personal safety incidents, which makes them believe that roller coasters The safety is very high. &quot;If the probability of an accident on an airplane is much lower than driving to the airport (the probability of an accident), then the probability of an accident on a roller coaster is also much lower than driving to the amusement park.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xunhang brushed 480 cars. He only experienced a bumpy ride caused by the uneven track of the roller coaster, which &quot;knocked his knees red&quot;; fans both (pseudonyms) brushed the cars More than 320 vehicles have never experienced a &quot;risk situation&quot;, but they encountered service personnel buckling their shoulders but not wearing seat belts when riding in a car, and did not carry out &quot;double insurance&quot;; Yang Kaichun brushed 200 vehicles and experienced this in the United States. During a &quot;hanging parking&quot;, the car climbed to the highest point and got stuck. Finally, under the command of the park management staff, everyone collectively &quot;jumped&quot; forward before continuing to &quot;start&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The safety of roller coasters reflected in individual experience also has some objective basis. According to statistics from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions in October 2023, the probability of people being injured on amusement equipment is about 3.7 times per million people, which is lower than playing football, swimming, cycling, etc. Based on a three-year average, the probability of someone being injured on a fixed theme park ride is one in 17 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;If the vehicle hovers in the preset area, or encounters collisions, etc., these are common problems that will not cause safety issues for passengers. Not only are we not afraid , such as hovering, sometimes I hope to experience it and enrich the riding experience.&quot; Xun Hang said. Other roller coaster enthusiasts interviewed were similar to Xun Hang in their identification of roller coaster safety risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, in the eyes of professionals, hovering is not always a &quot;common problem&quot; even if it does not cause casualties. &quot;Under normal circumstances, if passengers hover in a normal position, there will be no safety problems. However, if the hovering time is too long, or if the hovering is upside down with the head down, many parks will pay special attention to it, and even if the situation is serious, Report it to the national competent authority,&quot; said Han Zhiyi, a well-known theme park executive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Huanjie, president of the China Theme Park Research Institute, reminded that whether it is a small problem or a major accident, tourists should maintain their safety when riding a roller coaster and encounter unexpected situations such as hovering. Stay calm and wait patiently for guidance and rescue from the staff. Do not shake the car violently out of excitement and panic. &quot;Because people&#39;s excessive reactions may affect the equipment&#39;s ability to handle emergency situations according to the design plan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73963&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70754&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/dcbccc433c.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;VCG111454610890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;September 17, 2023 local time, A roller coaster at the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Every car has a new experience” &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the short-lived stimulating experience that ordinary tourists occasionally ride on a roller coaster, The experience gained by these experienced players from high-frequency car brushing seems to better capture the designer&#39;s intention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I think roller coasters are the epitome of contemporary human wisdom. Whether roller coasters are excellent or not often tests the artistic aesthetics, manufacturing technology, scientific and technological level of designers and manufacturers, and even medicine. Common sense.&quot; Xun Hang said. He believes that the wonderful thing about roller coasters is that almost every car has a new experience, and even the same car has a different feeling every time it is ridden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the National Day holiday this year, Xun Hang rode a catapult-type spinning roller coaster in Belgium. In his opinion, this car not only combines two seemingly unrelated elements of spin and electromagnetic ejection, but also relies on the up and down track to allow riders to experience ejection one after another. &quot;The car body is always spinning irregularly, and you never seem to know what the next spin will feel like.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This roller coaster also has an electromagnetic section In the ejection area, the vehicle travels to the second section. Relying on a vertical undulating slope section, the roller coaster accelerates while losing weight. There are also tumbling elements interspersed in the middle, making people feel like they are in a washing machine. The overall feeling was hearty and comfortable, so much so that Xun Hang &quot;swiped it 8 times a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Compared with the feeling of pushing back and explosive power, I especially prefer the feeling of weightlessness brought by roller coasters. The heart feels like being pulled up, and people will experience a kind of weightlessness. The ultimate pleasure.&quot; Xun Hang said. This ride experience in Belgium greatly satisfied his preference for weightlessness, so it became his &quot;favorite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for Yang Kaichun, in addition to the ultimate riding experience, he also hopes to know what is happening and why. All aspects related to the roller coaster riding experience will become his exploration issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of the appearance of the track, the material used is often hard steel, but when it forms the winding and circling track of the roller coaster, it appears smooth and smooth, and the overall appearance A kind of beauty that combines strength and softness. The track construction of some large-scale parks can often become landmark buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a vehicle without power, the riding experience of a roller coaster is often closely related to the direction of the track. Under different logics, designers need to consider not only whether the passengers will The physical safety of being dropped also needs to consider what physiological reactions a person will have as their physical position changes under a given sprint, rotation or gravity acceleration, and explore the safety margin of this reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Under a given acceleration of gravity, a person&#39;s body may be suspended in the air, or as if he is flying, or as if he is climbing on top of a boulder... I am very curious about this kind of How do you create a safe, moderate but exciting feeling?&quot; Yang Kaichun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Both like the ups and downs of riding a roller coaster, and can also immerse themselves in the fun of different themes. Parks in different countries will have different themes when building roller coasters. For example, most Chinese parks will incorporate some traditional cultural elements, while European and American parks will be linked to Disney, Marvel and other styles. Along with lighting, VR, water spray and other effects, riding a roller coaster is often like experiencing a &quot;fantasy journey&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More often, they simply like the happiness brought by roller coasters. This kind of happiness is not only brought by physical stimulation, but also by the excitement surrounding them. A happy atmosphere. &quot;Whether you are watching the roller coaster or riding the roller coaster, everyone is very happy. Seeing so many happy smiling faces makes you happy too.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73988&quot; group- id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70779&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e246b49bf9.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG230.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;In 2016, the roller coaster &quot;El Toro&quot; at Six Flags Great Adventure in the United States.

Such equipment must be submitted to China&#39;s special equipment testing agency for review during the design stage. Place an order for production, and a dedicated person needs to be assigned to supervise on-site during the production process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the roller coaster is installed, it needs to complete a certain hour of testing in accordance with the manufacturer&#39;s requirements, and then conduct an idling test and load test again in accordance with China&#39;s national standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the equipment declaration and operation stage, the regulatory authorities will not only review the filing materials, but also conduct on-site testing of the equipment. After completion, the trial operation qualification will be issued first. During this period, no safety problems will occur, and then the formal operation qualification will be given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the official operation, in addition to regular inspections such as daily inspection, monthly inspection, and annual inspection, the roller coaster will also conduct safety management and maintenance of the equipment in accordance with the requirements of the manufacturer. Welcome the random inspection by the superior unit of the park and the corresponding regulatory department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Corresponding to the aforementioned security defense lines, there is a series of institutional documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewees mentioned that when it comes to the management of roller coasters, China’s safety standards are stricter than those in countries such as Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea. &quot;For example, when we play in China, we are generally not allowed to bring backpacks, mobile phones, keys and other items, but in European and American countries, they are more casual and don&#39;t care much.&quot; Yang Kaichun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Huanjie believes that safety problems in roller coasters are generally related to front-end design flaws, mid-end detection loopholes, and inadequate follow-up operation and maintenance. In reality, &quot;it is difficult for a large-scale accident to occur if there is a simple flaw in a certain link. Safety problems are often caused by the accumulation of layer-by-layer failures in multiple security inspection links.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the interviewees related to the operation and management of the park said that the safety issues of roller coasters in the real environment are often related to whether the operator strictly follows the Provisions are made to implement inspection, maintenance and upkeep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For example, in order to save money, some operators do not replace some parts that should be replaced, do not repair those that should be repaired, and do not repair some equipment that should be overhauled; Some problems are also related to unprofessional operators, who cannot detect problems, or it is difficult to strictly enforce regulations during peak seasons.&quot; A professional close to a special equipment testing agency revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In November 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation launched a nationwide safety inspection of roller coasters, which emphasized the need to consolidate the manufacturing, operation and use of large-scale amusement facilities. The main responsibility for unit safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, whether the management and operation of the equipment are professional and standardized is also related to the scale and conditions of the park where the equipment is located. Many interviewees said that in some cities, small parks, street parks, carnival venues, etc., because most of the equipment are non-first-line brands, and there are fewer passengers, the management and operation are also relatively loose. In comparison, the stability of the equipment and poor security. Respondents do not recommend riding roller coasters in some overseas countries that rely on human traction, roller coasters that are old and rusty in appearance, or roller coasters that have a high rate of bumps and complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When safety incidents occur on roller coasters, passengers sometimes bear some responsibility. &quot;It happened once before. Because there was a lot of cash in the bag, a tourist took the bag from the locker on the platform to the foot of the car at the moment of departure after depositing the bag. As a result, when the car flipped over, the bag was hit upside down. Passengers in the back.&quot; Han Zhiyi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the aforementioned professionals also introduced that the roller coaster track is equipped with multiple highly sensitive sensors, and sometimes small objects dropped by passengers can be broken into as foreign objects. Identification, affecting the regular operation of the roller coaster. However, Lin Huanjie said that among the many roller coaster problems, the probability of them being triggered by tourists is extremely small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xun Hang believes that some people currently have some misunderstandings about roller coasters, such as equating roller coasters with extreme sports, or equating excitement with danger, but &quot;this project It’s about experiencing excitement, not looking for conventional comfort.” In his opinion, in most cases, riding a roller coaster is safe and can bring people some ultimate pleasure. &quot;We hope that everyone can understand it more comprehensively and enjoy it more relaxedly.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多近的关系，才应该给份子钱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261890]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there has been a lot of talk about molecular money.

It was built only 9 years ago and has three buildings. All of them have been identified as Class D dangerous buildings. More than 300 households have been forced to rent houses or stay with relatives and friends for four consecutive years. It is still difficult to move back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Xinhua Viewpoint&quot; reporters learned from the investigation that the conversion of sheds into dangerous buildings exposed the loopholes in local supervision of housing construction safety. At present, Mingshui County is accelerating the demolition of dangerous buildings in the shantytown-renovated communities involved, and plans to complete the reconstruction before the end of 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&quot;There were cracks in the wall in the second year after the move back.&quot; The relevant responsible persons have been taken compulsory measures in accordance with the law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;This It didn&#39;t work after the building was completed, and there were cracks in the walls the second year after we moved back. From then on, the problems became more and more serious until we left,&quot; said Liu Xiquan, a resident of the Harmony Home Community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some residents interviewed told reporters that the quality problems of the houses in the Harmony Home Community emerged very early. Some floors have seriously sunk, some have uneven floors with a height difference of more than 5 centimeters, and some can feel significant vibrations even when they stomp around the room. &quot;The government&#39;s supervision is not in place, so this &#39;bastard project&#39; actually passed the completion inspection.&quot; said a resident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter saw outside the Harmony Home Community that the entire community was surrounded by barbed wire and could not be entered, and no one could be seen inside. The community is divided into three buildings: A, B, and C. The first and second floors of Building A and B are commercial service areas, and the third to sixth floors are residential. The first floor of Building C is a commercial service area, and the second to sixth floors are residential areas. Residential. Some unit doors in the building were open, and there was a lot of garbage and discarded household items scattered on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/ba83a083d7fac522dc55f79d1438bcaa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/ba83a083d7fac522dc55f79d1438bcaa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260708&quot; >;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On December 1, the Harmony Home Community surrounded by barbed wire, photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Qiang Yong &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jian, deputy magistrate of Mingshui County, introduced that the Harmony Home Community was completed and accepted for occupancy in 2010. In July 2019, after receiving reports from the public that there were quality problems in the buildings, Mingshui County commissioned Heilongjiang Coldland Building Research Institute and other third-party institutions to conduct safety appraisals on the community multiple times. The appraisal concluded that three buildings in the community were Class D dangerous buildings. , it is a construction quality accident and it is recommended to dismantle and rebuild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the Mingshui County Public Security Bureau launched an investigation into the harmonious homeland dangerous building case and determined that the actual construction contractor and relevant supervisors were suspected of committing the crime of major engineering liability accidents. Compulsory measures have been taken in accordance with the law, and Transferred to Mingshui County People&#39;s Procuratorate for review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, the total construction area of ​​Harmony Home Community is 20,991 square meters, the total investment is approximately 21.25 million yuan, and there are 331 households and businesses. The construction unit of the community is Suihua City Qinggang County Great Wall Construction Engineering Co., Ltd., and the supervision unit is Suihua City Supervision Company Mingshui Branch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Xiaoning, the head of Mingshui County, said that for the quality accident of the Harmony Home project, the main body of responsibility is Qinggang County Great Wall Construction Engineering Co., Ltd.; the development company Qinggang County Jianxing Real Estate Development Co., Ltd., and the construction unit Qinggang County Great Wall Construction Engineering A limited company is the subject of liability for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2021, the Mingshui County Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee established an investigation team to investigate and collect evidence on the performance of relevant units and staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, it was found that the then director of the Mingshui County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, the director of the Quality Supervision Station, the person in charge of the supervision company, and the project supervision personnel had derelict in their duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;“The government quickly found people to identify dangerous buildings, but later failed to demolish them.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Originally The shantytown renovation project that benefited the people has now become a &#39;sad project.&#39;&quot; &quot;It has been more than four years since the dilapidated buildings have been demolished, let alone rebuilt.&quot; In the Harmony Home Community, some residents pointed to the uninhabited buildings. told reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2019, after the relevant departments of Mingshui County initiated the eviction of the residents of the Harmony Home Community, the demolition and resettlement subsidies were implemented in accordance with the shantytown reform policy. The party is responsible for the responsibility. While residents are waiting to be relocated back to their original places, temporary resettlement allowances of 4,800 yuan per year will be provided to residents, and businesses will be provided with annual suspension of production and business losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The government quickly found people to identify dangerous buildings, but later failed to demolish them.” Liu Xiquan said. Some relocated residents said they had visited the county Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and other departments to learn about the situation over the past four years, but had not received a definite answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Finance has issued 101.03 million yuan in general bond funds to Mingshui County for the work of relieving dangerous buildings in the Harmony Home Community. This money has been received in September 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Hui, chief clerk of the Mingshui County Finance Bureau, said that in December 2021, because the demolition and reconstruction project of dangerous buildings in the Harmony Home Community had not yet started, in accordance with the &quot;Local Government General Debt Budget Management Measures&quot; issued by the Ministry of Finance, etc. According to relevant regulations, with the approval of the Standing Committee of the County People&#39;s Congress, the bond funds have been adjusted in the budget and have been used for public welfare expenditures such as local road reconstruction. After the budget adjustment, the county finance will support the continued implementation of the demolition and reconstruction of dangerous buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;“I hope there will be no more problems and we can move back smoothly next year”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The interviewed Mingshui County cadres said that Due to the impact of the epidemic, as well as factors such as the lack of experience at the grassroots level in dealing with dangerous buildings, the long judicial process, and the lack of ability to do mass work, the reconstruction of dangerous buildings has been slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Xiaoning said that because the development companies are temporarily unable to rebuild, the government has advanced funds to implement construction. Before starting the demolition, a compensation agreement, an entrustment agreement and a demolition application form should be signed with the residents and property owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I have never encountered anything like this.” Many grassroots cadres said frankly that handling the demolition and reconstruction of dilapidated buildings involves a large number of legal issues, and every step must be handled with caution, often requiring the government’s legal advisers, local judicial Government agencies, housing construction and other departments jointly study and conduct repeated demonstrations to ensure that the government&#39;s actions and procedures such as advance funds are legal and compliant. Due to insufficient understanding of judicial procedures and insufficient preparation for some preliminary requirements, the progress of reconstruction failed to meet people&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dangerous building incident also exposed the shortcomings of the local authorities&#39; organizational capabilities and ability to do mass work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beginning in August this year, residents in the community were required to sign a compensation agreement, an entrustment agreement and a demolition application form; because the signature rate was not high enough, there was a situation where temporary resettlement fees were not paid if they did not sign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We cannot accept the resettlement fee without signing an agreement. This approach is unacceptable to us.” Some people said that the reconstruction design plan for Building C had not yet come out at that time, and it was unreasonable to sign an agreement without understanding the situation. In addition, since the new building requires a new fire escape and the installation of an elevator, some residents believe that the shared area will increase and are unwilling to sign the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recently, we have set up a special team to promptly respond to issues of concern to the masses and further strengthen communication.&quot; Zou Xiaoning said that the public area of ​​​​the new building does not exceed 30%, and the old building and the new building will be based on 1:1.1 The proportion of compensation to the residents was fully explained, and the signing of the agreement became smooth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jian said that the feasibility study preparation and project approval of the Harmony Home Dangerous Building Project have been completed, and construction drawing design is in progress. It is planned to start demolition of dangerous buildings before the end of December 2023, and start construction before the end of April 2024. The construction will be completed and the relocation will be realized by the end of December next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I hope there won’t be any more problems and we can move back smoothly next year.” Some community residents said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
