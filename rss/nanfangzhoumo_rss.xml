It plans to recruit 39,600 people. Candidates can log in to the &quot;Special Website for Civil Servants Recruited for the 2024 Examination of Central Agencies and Their Directly Affiliated Agencies&quot; from 8:00 on October 15 to 18:00 on October 24 (http://bm.scs.gov.cn/kl2024) Register online and the public subject written examination will be held simultaneously on November 26 in all municipalities, provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals and some larger cities across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recruitment of civil servants in this examination mainly has three characteristics: First, political standards should be put first and the political requirements of newly recruited personnel should be highlighted. Among them, the content of the written test and interview highlights the political attributes of civil servants, focusing on testing the ability to use the party&#39;s innovative theory to guide analysis and problem solving; testing comprehensively understands the candidates&#39; morality, ability, diligence, performance, and integrity, focusing on understanding political quality and moral conduct , compliance with laws and regulations, etc. Politically unqualified candidates will not be hired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that recruitment policies and recruitment plans are tilted towards grassroots front-line workers and college graduates. Set up 26,000 plans specifically to recruit fresh college graduates, serve and promote the employment of college graduates. Nearly 27,000 plans have been supplemented to directly-affiliated agencies at the county (district) level and below. The application conditions for grassroots positions in difficult and remote areas will be appropriately adjusted based on actual conditions such as academic qualifications, majors, working years and experience, so as to further enrich the grassroots civil servants. More than 3,000 targeted recruitment programs have been set up to serve grassroots project personnel and retired soldiers who have served in the military for more than 5 years as college graduates, encouraging and guiding talents to flow to the grassroots and actively participate in national defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to adhere to classified examinations for recruitment. The examination content is set according to the characteristics of different job categories and different levels of agencies. The interview method and content will be determined by the recruitment agency based on the nature and characteristics of the position being recruited, with emphasis on reflecting the performance requirements. Some recruitment agencies test and evaluate candidates&#39; professional abilities. 9 departments organize written examinations of professional subjects during the written examination stage, and 40 departments organize professional ability tests during the interview stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the National Civil Service Bureau reminds candidates to register with integrity, prepare with integrity, take exams with integrity, and keep promises with integrity. This recruitment does not publish or specify exam tutoring books, nor does it hold or entrust any institution or individual to hold exam tutoring training classes. Regarding civil servant examination training, websites or publications in the society, candidates are requested to be vigilant and treat them rationally to avoid being deceived and prevent damage to their rights and interests. The National Civil Service Bureau will work with relevant departments to strengthen management and supervision, crack down on cheating in exams, investigate and deal with violations, and create a fair, just, safe and orderly exam environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州野生动物放生规定来了，随意放生或负刑责！这些动物在列]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Guangzhou Wildlife Release Management Regulations&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Regulations&quot;) will be implemented on November 1, 2023 Effective from today. It is understood that the &quot;Regulations&quot; combine the actual conditions of Guangzhou to establish a practical management system for the release of wild animals to protect biosecurity and the ecological environment. It is the first local regulation in China to specifically regulate the release of wild animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set specific penalties for the illegal release of overseas wild animal species, the random release of domestic wild animals that may or has caused serious consequences, and the release of domestic wild animals in other places outside the release area. . Before citizens can legally release animals, they must register information three working days in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The legislation aims to scientifically regulate the release of animals&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Prevent the invasion of alien species&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote >; &lt;p>;The No. 1 Central Document in 2023 proposed to severely crack down on the illegal introduction of alien species, implement key actions to prevent and control major harmful invasive species, and strengthen the standardized management of the trade and release of &quot;exotic pets&quot;. This is also the first time that the word &quot;release&quot; is mentioned in the No. 1 Central Document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Releasing animals to pray for blessings is a traditional Chinese folk culture. However, in modern society, due to the diversity and complexity of released species and their source areas, inappropriate release behaviors have brought many problems to the environment, ecology, biology, society and people themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/741a7c92d83c7e54f97f570272efd5d7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/741a7c92d83c7e54f97f570272efd5d7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253993&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula). Image source: Scientific fish release expert team of China Fisheries Society&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the release of alien species of wild animals may harm the local ecosystem. If non-native wild animals are released into the local environment, the new species may compete with native species for food and living space. Alien species with strong reproductive capabilities or ferociousness will threaten the living space of native species and harm the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/8648eebe1467d4bd9bdabcac4172d2be.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/8648eebe1467d4bd9bdabcac4172d2be.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253991&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The short-capped fat carp (Piaractus brachypomus), commonly known as freshwater pomfret. Image source: Scientific fish release expert team of China Fisheries Society&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, poisonous, ferocious or unquarantine wild animals may cause personal and property damage to others after being released. If poisonous, ferocious or unquarantined wild animals are released into the wild environment, they may attack humans or other animals, and the viruses and bacteria they carry may also spread through waters or other channels, causing harm to other people&#39;s personal property and the ecological environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, wild animals that have not been trained for rewilding can easily lead to death when released into the wild. If wild animals that have not been trained for rewilding are released into the wild or into a wild environment that is not suitable for survival, they may not be able to survive and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee, in 2022, the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee conducted a law enforcement inspection on the implementation of the “Wildlife Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China”. During the law enforcement inspection, it was found that release activities are common in some places, but there are no corresponding management regulations. In particular, there is a lack of effective management measures for the release of invasive alien species such as alligator gar and scavengers, which seriously damages the balance of the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that the current national laws and regulations on ecological protection and wildlife protection, such as the &quot;Biosecurity Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Wildlife Protection Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, only allow the release of wild animals. Principled provisions have been made, but there is a lack of operable norms. In order to scientifically regulate the release of wild animals and prevent the invasion of alien species, special legislation is necessary. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress will include this regulation into the 2023 legislative work plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Releasing wild animals at will may result in fines or even criminal liability&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Citizens must register information three working days in advance to legally release wild animals&lt;/strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;In order to standardize the release behavior and prevent the invasion of alien species from damaging the local ecosystem, the &quot;Regulations&quot; clarify that overseas wild animals cannot be released unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to let the public know clearly which animals cannot be released, the &quot;Regulations&quot; also lists some of the more common exotic wild animal species, such as alligator gar, leopard catfish, Tilapia tilapia, Freshwater pomfret, mosquito fish, Egyptian frogfish, Thai dace, giant snapping turtle, red-eared turtle, American bullfrog, etc. Not only this, but other overseas wild animals not listed here cannot be released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/f0308e5e31f51a3c1bcbf2b0304c521a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/f0308e5e31f51a3c1bcbf2b0304c521a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253992&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Red-eared turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans).

Image source: Scientific fish release expert team of China Fisheries Society&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that when wild animals are released, local species suitable for survival in the wild should be selected, and the normal life and production of residents must not be interfered with. Causing personal or property damage to others or endangering the ecosystem. The list of local species suitable for survival in the wild at the release site will be formulated and published by the Guangzhou Forestry Department and the Guangzhou Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department and updated in due course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Releasing wild animals at will is an illegal act, and one must bear corresponding legal responsibilities.” The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that for the act of releasing wild animals at will, laws and regulations distinguish three situations and stipulate them respectively. The first is to stipulate penalties for illegally releasing overseas wild animal species. It will be handled mainly in accordance with the relevant provisions of laws and regulations such as the Biosafety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the Wildlife Protection Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set specific penalties for situations where the random release of domestic wild animals may or has caused serious consequences. That is to say, it is stipulated that if any person may or has caused personal or property damage to others or harmed the ecosystem, the relevant department shall order him to capture it within a time limit; if he still fails to capture it after the expiration of the time limit, and may or has harmed the ecosystem, the district forestry department and the district agriculture and rural department shall Those who capture or take measures to reduce the impact on their behalf shall bear the costs required by the releasing organization or individual; if the ecosystem has been harmed, a fine of not less than RMB 10,000 but not more than RMB 100,000 shall be imposed; if it causes personal or property damage to others, the releasing organization or individual shall Individuals shall bear corresponding civil responsibilities in accordance with the law; if a crime is constituted, criminal liability shall be pursued in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set penalties for releasing domestic wild animals in places other than the release area. That is, if the animals are not released at the prescribed location, the district forestry department or the district agriculture and rural department will impose a fine of not less than 2,000 yuan but not more than 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the &quot;Regulations&quot; also provide guidance on legal release behaviors. The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that citizens must comply with three regulations when releasing animals legally: Before releasing animals, citizens must select animal species suitable for release based on the local species list published by relevant departments. At the same time, information such as pictures, types, quantities, sources, release time and location of wild animals need to be uploaded to the wild animal release information management platform three working days in advance, and the release should be carried out based on information feedback from relevant departments and scientific and standardized release guidelines. When releasing wild animals, citizens need to go to the wild animal release areas designated by the government and release them according to the guidelines and registration information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为灵活就业准备了四年，还是进了职场丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258569]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/5LO0wHjrJvdtDnMmt7mMmUUSFK4Y9RXb9dsvDl40.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;833&quot; height=&quot;781&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/5LO0wHjrJvdtDnMmt7mMmUUSF K4Y9RXb9dsvDl40. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253999&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256675 &quot; title=&quot;&quot;Flexible employment&quot; graduates, and a round of targeted verification&quot;>;&quot;Flexible employment&quot; graduates, and a round of targeted verification&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest idea of ​​starting a business It came out on a tropical afternoon in 2017. At that time, I was at the largest market in Yangon. Its name was changed to Aung San Market in 1948. The foreign name used during the colonial period is unknown. The change of name did not bring about a change in architectural style. The colonial ocher-colored roofs and smooth cobblestone paths are easily reminiscent of George Orwell&#39;s years as a police officer in Burma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entire market counter is occupied by wood, amber, emerald, ruby ​​and a golden pearl. At that time, my senior intern at the newspaper office took me to the shop of a timber owner with both Chinese and Burmese ancestry. The wood she and her husband operated, in addition to the local Burmese rosewood, small-leaf rosewood and old sandalwood came from next door. of Indian neighbours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t imagine why so much precious wood is allowed to be cut down, but she once described to me in broken Chinese that there is a dense and compact rosewood forest on the border of India and Myanmar. The level is sufficient to meet the needs of the Chinese people. After all, Westerners are often attracted by the national costumes and paintings of young painters in Aung San Market. These shops are located on the periphery of the market, in large sheds set up casually under ocher roofs. Only the Chinese would delve into the heart of the market in search of treasure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hard-working Burmese people process the wood into chopsticks and beads. Even if you observe carefully under the sun, you will notice that many beads are like pebbles, thinner or fatter, and not beautiful. Round. But it cannot be said that it is cheap. As long as it is brought back to China, the price can be doubled several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before returning to China, I emptied my suitcase and left many unused books and medicines with my friends in Myanmar. In the end, I returned to China with a suitcase full of wood, and quickly sold it within a month. I brought a few classmates with me to make a small profit, and I continued to purchase goods two or three times in the next six months. Until Myanmar introduced strict timber import and export laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charm of business lies in negotiation, and bargaining is an art of gaming. This process can be extremely relaxing, especially when customers think about your products over and over again. You will feel that the early research and search are worth the money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, three years of graduate school life made me think about selling tea again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was in Chengdu at the time, and the strong local tradition of drinking tea made me think I had discovered a blue ocean. It would also be a good idea to bring the Pu&#39;er tea from my hometown to Chengdu and serve as a supplier to some teahouses. In addition to taking classes, I hung out in various teahouses in Chengdu every day, made friends, and held tea parties. After casually reading a few tea-related books, I started a tea class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once thought that this would be my future life. Your daily job is to chat with customers, and then think about stories for your products one after another. Occasionally, during the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, prepare souvenirs for customers in advance, visit them one by one, control the quality of the tea, and be vigilant. The emergence of competitors. Most of the people in this circle are introverted. Some people get rich suddenly, but no one spends lavishly. Most of them live in poverty, and the standard of living can be very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important thing is that making tea gives you the freedom of poverty. Even if you are a teahouse owner with a mediocre business, you will still travel to tea mountains in various places during the spring tea season and stay in tea farmers&#39; homes. The cost for tea farmers to receive customers exceeds the cost for customers to buy tea. However, in the next spring tea season, tea farmers will still catch fish and kill chickens every day to entertain guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when I was applying for a job at a cultural company, I told the manpower that I could live with low desires, but the manpower refuted it. If you have no desire, then you are inefficient for the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, I have successively written several articles related to employment. When communicating with college students who intend to find flexible employment or even slow employment, I can see myself in the past, the kind that always The desire to remain longing for the possibilities of life and not want to be absorbed by a standard, modern corporate system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, most students with a journalism background know that recruitment by news organizations often begins in the second semester of their senior year or third year of graduate school. When the classmates around you who want to go to big Internet companies get their acceptance notices in the fall, a person who is determined to work in journalism will fall into the worry of having nothing to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just before the end of that autumn, the things I was thinking about were still doing things I like and doing things that make life infinitely possible. When I sent a resume to a start-up company with a strong literary and artistic atmosphere, I also wrote this paragraph: Looking for a job naturally requires some self-hypnosis skills, especially when a group of people in the same dormitory have already gone to Shenzhen to do annual salary work. 300,000 yuan, a teacher who claims to be able to buy a house in the urban area within 5 years; or working as a salesperson in a real estate company with a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan, I kept silently saying to myself: don&#39;t worry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in fact, before spring comes, this lack of urgency has disappeared. The first time I felt peer pressure was one night when my old dormitory friends came back to school to get together. When the others learned that I had not even received the interview notice, they who had already found a job took a breath unconsciously, and there was a look in their eyes. Show compassion. I wanted them to stop looking like that right away, so I told them that the recruitment for news organizations hadn’t started yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I thought about it and realized that this sentence was meant for myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I believe that nowadays, if you only look at the data on flexible employment in some colleges and universities, then peer pressure may no longer exist. When people around you are in flexible employment or slow employment, graduation is a long time. A small part of the power to collect vacations is in one&#39;s own hands, and the other part is controlled by an abstract and intangible existence that can be called &quot;society&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For students who truly intend to find flexible employment, they are more surrounded by entrepreneurial myths from the 1980s or 2010s. Not long ago, a post-00s friend asked me seriously how to sell tea through short videos. This was his wish after graduation, but he had no idea about the short video editing methods, the method of starting the number, the script structure, and the benchmarking account. learn. After I introduced them all, he said that it was too complicated and was there something simpler? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elders in Yunnan in my hometown have a very traditional idea, that is, after graduation, even if they cannot find a good job, they have to find a temporary job in a small company. Otherwise, in Yunnan dialect, People are floating. Flexible employment may make you rich overnight, and slow employment may bring you endless possibilities in life, but the real world is changing rapidly. After three years of online classes, being included in an organizational system, isn’t it a way to understand the real world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for me, the last time the Burmese timber boss I met sent me a message, she said she was going to India to see the endless red sandalwood forest and reduce the purchase cost. This was already five years ago. conversation years ago. Before getting the job offer notice, several Chengdu teahouse owners whom I knew well had already changed careers. They fell in love with essential oils, massage and traveling respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the real world that flexible employment needs to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七堇年：时间不多，玩了再说]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258583]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/dmLaXWsd6pjuYLL4Gpq3kyJRZS9iLevOWd5FyXOJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/dmLaXWsd6pjuYLL4Gpq3kyJRZS9iLev OWd5FyXOJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253689&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is easy to be alone, but it is hard to escape social interaction when sharing the air with others for a long time. I have been publishing works since I was in high school, and I am still living a seemingly unemployed life in my thirties. I always feel embarrassed when faced with inquiries from strangers. When she went to the barber shop and lay down to wash her hair, sooner or later a routine question came from the top of her head: &quot;What do you do?&quot; Sometimes she answered the teacher, sometimes she said it was sales, she said whatever came to her mind, but she couldn&#39;t tell the truth, and sometimes she said it was sales. There are no pre-programmed complete answers. Once the other party asked, she was helpless and allowed the sound of running water to flow by awkwardly. If you can’t answer it, I won’t make it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The funniest time in my memory came from a fellow traveler I met when I was paragliding. The other person asked you what you were doing? Qi Jinnian answered in Sichuan dialect, &quot;I work in publishing.&quot; Since the pronunciation was similar, the other party then asked sincerely, &quot;How much does the best kitchen board cost per meter now?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This encounter made me even more sad. Qi Jinnian is convinced, &quot;Publishing or books are something that is far away from normal people, let alone saying that you are a writer. I would think it would be too weird to tell others that you are writing.&quot; She lives her life like a covert spy. In bustling Chengdu, I write in the morning, read in the afternoon, and sometimes go to the gym to exercise, and then come back in the evening to watch movies and read books. I don’t cook, but it’s hard to tell my friends from out of town about restaurant recommendations. She is used to blanching vegetables over high heat, and then ordering takeout from a limited number of restaurants that suit her taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253688&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hiking everywhere&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t matter whether you stay home or not , &quot;We really don&#39;t care.&quot; She is more concerned about the world outside the dozens of square meters of space. When the weather is nice, I go paragliding alone, and during holidays I go caving and rock climbing with my teammates. She joined the Shanshui Nature Conservation Center a few years ago and also threw herself to different Hengduan Mountains during the COVID-19 epidemic. The older she gets, the more animalistic nature emerges in her heart. Her yearning and primitive desire for nature have become a stronger attachment than emotion.

First of all, my freelance career may be different from the life of many office workers (when I get together with other freelance working friends, we never talk about social security); in addition, my peers around me may have already gotten married and had children, which is very important to me.

&lt;p>;邻里间往往会因某些琐事引发矛盾。比如，有人爱养宠物，但宠物嬉戏、吵闹可能会影响他人。从报道看，楼下邻居反馈该男子家中动静较大，男子已送走猫、铺地毯，尽最大可能减少对邻居的影响。如果其认为该男子家中动静仍对其生活造成影响，可以向物业、居委会反映，请其居中协调解决。也可据此向法院提起诉讼，但需拿出对方侵权的真凭实据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，该女子采取的方式是到别人家砸门咒骂，视频中，该女子还用脚踢门，并且拿出棍状物砸门。据当事男子反映，自家门因此损毁严重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;显然，该女子以他人动静干扰其生活为由，在近一年时间砸门咒骂，不仅会给当事男子生活造成严重影响，还涉嫌损毁他人财物，其行为也影响其他邻居。正因如此，不堪其扰的男子向警方报警。但四五十次报警，女子行为仍未被有效制止，反映出当地警方的处理失当。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》第九条规定，对于因民间纠纷引起的打架斗殴或者损毁他人财物等违反治安管理行为，情节较轻的，公安机关可以调解处理。经公安机关调解，当事人达成协议的，不予处罚。经调解未达成协议或者达成协议后不履行的，公安机关应当依照本法的规定对违反治安管理行为人给予处罚，并告知当事人可以就民事争议依法向人民法院提起民事诉讼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果说，男子当初报警，警方认为该女子的行为情节较轻，尚可仅仅调解了事。但这位邻居并没有接受调解，而是继续骚扰乃至损坏他人财物。显然，其行为已不属于情节较轻的范畴，警方应当依法对其进行处罚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对此事，警方在处理过程中至少应做到两点。首先，在刚开始的调解过程中，向当事双方宣明各自在法律范畴内的应享权利和应遵义务，男子有不被骚扰的权利，女邻居如果认为男子家中动静干扰其生活，可据此向法院提告。同时，警方应阐述对此事采取调解方式的法律依据，并正告这位女邻居，如不能接受调解，继续砸门等行为，将面临怎样的法律后果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，当调解一而再无效，男子报警、女子不接受调解继续砸门的恶性循环继续，警方应果断按照《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》赋予的执法权限，对其进行处罚。连续四五十次报警却阻止不了该女子的行为，且不说让当事男子产生依法维权难的无力感，也是对警力的极大浪费。同时，在该女子眼中，警方反复出警却始终不对其行为进一步约束，更易助其“法律能奈我何”的张狂。或许，正是因为当地警方一次又一次的无所作为，让该女子行为升级，从咒骂到砸门，如果再不加以处理，该女子后续行为不定会演变成怎样的暴力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于此类事件，警方调解无效之后果断处罚该女子，是保护受害者权益的关键。如果警方不能及时依法追责，只会助长违法行为，甚至导致事态进一步恶化，引发更多的社会问题。同时，这也将对其他人产生误导，使得他们误以为此类行为没有法律红线，可以肆意而为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对此类事件，警方果断处理，对违法者问责，不是没有先例。据时间视频2023年5月报道，在北京朝阳区一小区，居民楼经常半夜传来敲墙声，导致居民睡不好。民警经过调查，锁定了住户刘某。据刘某交代，因为房屋隔音效果差，与邻居有过矛盾，为了报复，刘某选择了敲墙。因为刘某的行为扰民，又持续时间长，涉嫌寻衅滋事，被公安机关依法予以行政拘留。如果警方没有对刘某处理，恐怕居民仍将长期被其滋扰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有关邻里扰民事件，往往是“公说公有理、婆说婆有理”，有些当事人可能对法律理解不足，这些因素都可能影响警方调解的效果。但是，这并不意味着警方可以放松对法律的执行，尤其是不要因处理对象性别、年龄等区别对待。如果上述事件中是男子近一年时间砸门，女子反复报警，警方是否会容忍此类事件继续？事实上，警方在处理时一视同仁，以事实而非其他因素作为执法依据，方能体现司法公正，更是在全社会范围内维护秩序和公平，让违法者明白法律的严肃性和不可侵犯性。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;宣判后，各被告人未明确表示是否上诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;法官释法：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考试作弊破坏考试制度和人才选拔制度，妨碍公平竞争，破坏社会诚信，败坏社会风气，具有严重的社会危害性。特别是利用信息技术手段实施的有组织的考试作弊活动，危害尤其严重。为此，在《刑法修正案（九）》中增设了组织考试作弊罪、非法出售提供试题、答案罪和代替考试罪等规定，严肃惩处考试作弊犯罪。此后，两高又发布《关于办理组织考试作弊等刑事案件适用法律若干问题的解释》（以下简称《解释》），进一步对考试作弊犯罪的定罪量刑和法律适用作出具体规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本案涉及的全国硕士研究生招生考试是法律规定的国家教育考试，是我国选拔高层次专门人才的重要渠道，社会关注度高、影响大、涉及面广，属国家级重要考试。 《解释》第二条第（一）项将“在普通高等学校招生考试、研究生招生考试、公务员录用考试中组织考试作弊的”，直接规定为“情节严重”。本案各被告人明知考生参加全国硕士研究生招生考试，仍参与其中，组织作弊，属于“情节严重”。根据《刑法》第二百八十四条之一的规定，组织作弊，情节严重的，处三年以上七年以下有期徒刑，并处罚金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从实践中来看，考试作弊犯罪在一定程度上存在再犯可能性，为防止罪犯“重操旧业”，本案依据《解释》第十二条的规定，依法对张某等9名被告人宣告职业禁止，即禁止9人自刑罚执行完毕之日或者假释之日起五年内从事与教育、考试、培训相关的职业；同时，对被判处缓刑的被告人在缓刑考验期内依法宣告禁止令，即禁止其在缓刑考验期内从事与教育、考试、培训相关的活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“十年寒窗苦，一朝翰墨香”，考试公平是社会不容触碰的底线。考试作弊不仅破坏考试公平，还影响社会公平，严重损害考生个人和国家利益。 “法网恢恢疏而不漏”，组织者不要心存侥幸，也希望每位考生严格遵纪守法，诚信考试，拒绝作弊，用自己的辛勤付出换得满意的答卷。 &lt;/p>;

The experience of Mr. Su Jing, the author of &quot;Thirty Collectors of Modern Books&quot;, is legendary in itself. For details, please refer to Zou Zhenhuan&#39;s &quot;The &quot;Paradigm Shift&quot; of Chinese Book Publishing - Reading Su Jing&#39;s &quot;Casting to Replace Engraving: Missionaries and the Changing Situation of Chinese Printing&quot; 》, I won’t go into details here. Going back to &quot;Thirty Modern Book Collectors&quot;, when the Taiwanese biographical literature edition was published, only two biographers of the thirty names recorded in the book were still alive. One of them was Zhou Shutao (1891-1984) who passed away the following year, and the other It was Pan Jingzheng (1907-2003) who passed away 20 years later. It is unknown whether Mr. Zhou Shutao has seen &quot;Thirty Collectors of Modern Books&quot;. However, Mr. Pan Jingzheng did read the Taiwanese version of &quot;Thirty Modern Book Collectors&quot; and commented on it in a letter to Mr. Shen Xieyuan. In 1995, the first issue of Nanjing Normal University&#39;s &quot;Cultural and Educational Materials&quot; compiled an album of information on Pan Jingzheng. In addition to Xu Xiaoman&#39;s article &quot;Mr. Pan Jingzheng, the bibliographer&quot;, the other two articles were &quot;Pan Jingzheng&quot; signed by &quot;Shu Lu&quot; &quot;Biography of Mr. Jing Zheng&quot; and &quot;Catalogue of Writings of Mr. Pan Jingzheng&quot;. From Mr. Pan Jingzheng&#39;s letters, the author quite doubts that &quot;Shu Lu&quot; is a temporary pen name created by Mr. Shen or him and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently sorting out the remains of Mr. Shen Xieyuan, I found more than ten handwritten notes from Pan Jing and Zheng Zheng to Shen Xieyuan, mainly written from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Most of them were written with brushes and paper. , seal, which are identical to the letters collected by &quot;Pan Jingzheng&quot; (edited by Wang Guichen and Wang Dawen), the first volume of the &quot;Scholar&#39;s Ink Collection&quot; published by Guangdong Education Press in June 2022. I would like to select Shutong and briefly reveal his abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Previously, the author wrote in &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/255656&quot; title=&quot;Old friends smile more than the trees in the courtyard: Shen Xieyuan and Qu Fengqi As mentioned in the article &quot;An old friend smiled more than the tree in the courtyard: Shen Xieyuan and Qu Fengqi&#39;s interaction&lt;/a>;&quot;, Gu Tinglong, Pan Jingzheng, and Qu Fengqi all once collected the &quot;Er Golden Butterfly Hall Seal&quot; for Mr. Shen Xieyuan. inscription. Letters from Mr. Qu Fengqi were also forwarded through Mr. Pan Jingzheng. In an existing letter from Mr. Pan Jingzheng dated October 13, 1982, he once mentioned a sentence: &quot;It belongs to the seal of Uncle Bazhuo, and is compiled into short words for correction. If it is not applicable, throw it into the toilet for correction.&quot; This was related to this matter. Mr. Pan Jingzheng inscribed &quot;Er Jindie Hall Printing&quot; and first filled in the words &quot;Unforgettable&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Before the wind and rain, I am afraid of chasing after others and looking for claws, and check the confusion. The wealthy family destroyed the painted building, and the swallow curtain replaced the beam. The lonely traveler&#39;s thoughts, caressing the broken bag. Early calamity dream. A hundred years old, the shadow of two golden butterflies has gone through many vicissitudes of life. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The long grace is protected now, and the iron pen is overflowing with fragrance. Wherever you hit, look at the pear. It’s a good companionship and the fragrance of the heart. I only feel ashamed and graffiti, which detracts from my appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Repost &quot;Unforgettable Meaning&quot;.

He relied heavily on sound throughout his life, and he continued to do so until he was old. Mr. Wei Li obtained a kind of &quot;Inscriptions on Letters Written by Qing Dynasty People in Inkstones&quot;. Mr. Pan wrote a line of words for almost every letter, which is a good proof. Especially in his later years, Mr. Pan Jingzheng preferred to write lyrics in rare ancient books instead of inscriptions and postscripts. This tendency of using rhyme instead of prose is somewhat similar to that of Gu Wenbin, the owner of Guoyun Tower. Gu Wenbin said that rhyme is better than prose, so he exploits his strengths and avoids his weaknesses. The reason why Mr. Pan Jingzheng is like this, I think, he considers himself a poet with romantic feelings and literary temperament from beginning to end. The poem &quot;Unforgettable&quot; is prefaced by Zhu Wenfang Yin - &quot;I am also a lyricist in Wuzhong&quot;, which can be called a portrayal. Mr. Shen Jin recalled that the title of Mr. Pan Jingzheng&#39;s article was &quot;A Piece of Ice Heart in a Jade Pot&quot;, which was really appropriate and can be said to be insightful. There is a long postscript after the poem &quot;Unforgettable Meanings&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My friend Shen Junxieyuan came from his old home in Yuyi to acquire the work of Mr. Zhao Shushu. The inscription is eighty-two, the dress is in a bow, and the treasure is left in the office of Qian Wu Hufan&#39;s uncle. Compared with Shanghai, it is a metaphor, which means &quot;Hongzhao&quot;. Most of the prints in the book were engraved by Shen Yunchu and Wei Jiasun, and some were engraved and consumed by themselves. There are two seals carved by the ancestor of Zheng&#39;an, one is a large square seal with three characters &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; and the other is a rectangular seal with three characters &quot;Hanxueju&quot;, both of which are exquisite works.沈、魏与先生皆至契，宜诸印无一不佳。 I have collected fifty or sixty stones of Mr.&#39;s seals, and they have all been returned to the Shanghai Museum. The collections of Shen and Wei are no longer traceable. Hundreds of years of vicissitudes, gathering and dispersing smoke and clouds, make me feel sad. The word &quot;Yuan&quot; is added to &quot;Wu&quot; to repay one&#39;s fate. In his declining years, his writing and writing are desolate, and I feel ashamed. In the eighth month of Renxu, Zheng Shi, Pan Jing, Wu County, was seventy-six years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/ItRTBT8LILpgcO8CZQa2l3odtDKoYp1KAZoIShjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 756&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/ItRTBT8LILpgcO8CZQa2l3odtDKoYp1KAZoIShjL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Mr. Pan Jingzheng mentioned above that the fifty-six stones of the seal carved by Zhao Zhiqian for Pan Zuyin in the Pan family&#39;s collection have been returned to the Shanghai Museum. This is proved by the fact that the seal used by Pan Zuyin is on display in the Seal Hall of the Shanghai Museum. The seal &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; is clearly visible, which is true. In the past, the Suzhou Museum held a special exhibition &quot;Planning the Ancient World: The Collection of Pan in Suzhou during the Qing Dynasty&quot;. They tried to borrow the giant seal &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; for the exhibition but failed. They had to replace it with a seal titled &quot;Wuxian Pan Boyin&#39;s Life and Authentic Appreciation&quot;. Breathless. As far as the author knows, there are at least four giant seals of the Zhai name used by Pan Zuyin. In addition to &quot;Pang Xi Zhai&quot;, there are also three seals of &quot;Pangu Lou&quot;, &quot;Zheng&#39;an&quot; and &quot;Plum Blossom Happy God&#39;s Pavilion&quot;. According to Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s recollection, after Mr. Pan Jingzheng wrote the postscript for &quot;Er Golden Butterfly Hall Yin Cun&quot;, he gave a piece of paper with the seal number of Pan Zuyinzhai as a gift, which was not found in the &quot;Yin Cun&quot;. It was bound. I wonder if it is still in the book? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard from Mr. Shen Xieyuan more than once before that in addition to the ink ink of Mr. Pan Jingzheng in his collection, there are also two handwritten lyrics written by him. It was not until September 2012 that I had the opportunity to see them in Shen Zhai, Xitang North Lane. However, within a few years, these two pieces were scattered among the people. Now that I think about it, I still feel very regretful.二幅自作词，一横一竖，竖者用素纸，款署“《青门引》书赠雪园姻兄教正。戊辰元月，潘景郑，时年八十有二”，并钤“荥阳宗老”“宰相玄孙少宰曾孙翰林之孙”“潘景郑印”“原名承弼”四印，其词云：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;梦影留图府。 The flow of ordering business is flowing.

Obviously, &quot;Eternal Life&quot; is four years earlier than &quot;Qingmen Yin&quot;, but both are later than &quot;Unforgettable&quot; in 1982. However, among the three, &quot;Longevity&quot; was written to celebrate Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s 60th birthday, so its significance is naturally extraordinary and comparable. Although the three poems were created at different times and have different names, they all use the word &quot;Linlang&quot;, which makes people sigh involuntarily. This is a coincidence, but I believe it is not an accident! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;二&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The relationship between Mr. Shen Xieyuan and Mr. Pan Jingzheng may have started in the 1940s and ended after 2000, about half a century ago, but the existing Pan Jingzheng Mr.’s letters only include part of the last twenty years. The earliest one is from January 16, 1976:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xie Yuan About my brother: I have learned from you over a long period of time, and have a deep connection with you. But the daily life is Sui Sheng, the business is diligent, and the talisman is chanted. My brother is recovering from his illness, and he is still working in the ancient books group in the picture above. Recently, the 721 University has been established, and he is looking for some teaching materials in terms of editions. I know that your library has compiled a book called &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot;, and I would like to make great efforts to find a copy for you to study. You need to pay a certain amount of cost and postage. Please let me know and send it to you immediately. You are welcome. I hope that my brother will be able to show me what kind of studies he has recently devoted himself to, and that he will be able to make some achievements in order to enlighten his ignorance. I also heard that Nan Tu compiled a &quot;Bibliography of Rare Books&quot;. Was it the result of great efforts? Return to Yuwu and beg and send it to our apartment at No. 1, Lane 181, Xikang Road, Shanghai. Because there are so many departments in the library, there may be a loss in mail delivery. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, in Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s suicide note, I found a set of mimeographed copies of &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot; from Beijing China Bookstore. It has the same name as the book Pan Zhazhong requested. Is it this book? , cannot be determined at this time. Since the original signature does not have a year, we relied on the records in &quot;Haineng Baichuan&amp;nbsp;Knowledge Navigation: Collected Works to Commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Shanghai Library&quot;. On December 26, 1975, after three months of preparations, the Shanghai Library established the &quot;Seven 21 &quot;The university offers four classes: basic library knowledge, English, Japanese, and ancient books. The ancient books class has been out of work for one year. &quot;Most of the ancient books students have stuck to their majors and have become the ancient books management and research team of the Shanghai Library. For example, Chen Xianxian became an ancient books expert at the Shanghai Library, and Yan Zuozhi became the director of the Ancient Books Research Institute of East China Normal University. &quot;. Regarding the situation of the &quot;721&quot; University, I once called Mr. Shen Jin who was far away in the United States. According to his recollection, there were 15 students in the ancient books class at that time, and the class leader was Zhu Binyong, who later worked in the library of Fudan University. The teachers who teach include Gu Tinglong, Pan Jingzheng, Qu Fengqi, Ruan Henghui, Chen Shiming, Chen Bingren, Ren Guangliang, Wu Zhi and Shen Jin. Among them, Mr. Pan Jingzheng teaches the most frequently. The course lectures he is responsible for include &quot;Engraved Editions of Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties&quot; and &quot;Manuscripts&quot;. &quot;History&quot;, &quot;School-based Lecture Notes&quot;, &quot;Stone Carving Lecture Notes&quot;, &quot;Dharma Notes Lecture Notes&quot;, etc. It is unknown whether the mimeograph version of &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot; was used for reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that as early as 1957, when Xinhua Bookstore in Jiangsu Province held a training class for managers of Xinhua Bookstores in the province, Mr. Shen Xieyuan was invited to teach the history of Chinese books. In May 1965, he was invited to teach the ancient part of Chinese calligraphy history to a training class for amateur university library staff in Gulou District, Nanjing City (mainly librarians in colleges and universities). Since then, related activities have been suspended due to various reasons. In 1975, Jiangsu Province re-organized a study class for ancient books staff, and he was invited to teach about the Song and Yuan editions. After entering the 1980s, he was invited to teach ancient book editions in 1985 as a national training course on ancient book restoration commissioned by the National Library Administration and organized by the Shanghai Library. In June 1986, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture commissioned the Nanjing Library to hold a seminar on the regulations for recording Chinese ancient books in Jiangsu Province, and he was invited to give lectures on the cataloging of ancient books.此后，又为南京师范大学、南京大学相关专业学生讲授版本目录学课程。 Although we have not seen the complete lecture notes left by Mr. Shen Xieyuan during this period, among his belongings, we still found some manuscripts of lecture notes on edition and bibliography, some written with brushes and some with hard pens, and they are not too long. It is very large. If I have the opportunity to sort it out in the future, it can be used as a supplement to the &quot;Collected Works of Shen Xieyuan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time that Mr. Shen Xieyuan and Mr. Pan Jingzheng were invited to teach versionology in the ancient literature major of Nanjing Normal University, Mr. Pan Jingzheng was hired as a part-time professor by the Ancient Books Department of East China Normal University and taught graduate students. On February 2, 1983, Mr. Pan Jingzheng wrote in a letter saying:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I would like to ask the director of Tianzhen Museum on my behalf. I was given a volume of the great work &quot;Yangzhou Poetry Bureau Examination&quot;. Since my brother is giving a lecture for postgraduate students, I can use it to supplement the materials. I am particularly grateful if I can send it immediately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is to ask Mr. Shen Xieyuan to ask Mr. Pan Tianzhen for the article &quot;Miscellaneous Examination of Yangzhou Poetry Bureau&quot; newly published in the 1983 issue of &quot;Library Science Newsletter&quot; as a reference for teaching edition science . On January 17, 1990, Mr. Pan Jingzheng sent a letter to inform him that &quot;after my retirement this year, I will not be able to go out. Recently my blood pressure is high and I have to take a rest. Four people have graduated from the Normal University this year and they will no longer be Feng&#39;s wife.&quot; &quot;Exactly.&quot; It can be seen that when he retired from the Shanghai Library, he no longer served as a graduate tutor at East China Normal University. At this time, Mr. Pan Jingzheng was already eighty-four years old. Among the graduate students taught by East China Normal University, the student that Mr. Pan Jingzheng admires most is Lin Shenqing, the editor of &quot;Seals of Ming and Qing Bibliophiles&quot; and &quot;Seals of Chinese Bibliophiles&quot;. The publication of the 1989 edition of &quot;Seals of Ming and Qing Bibliophiles&quot; was the result of strong recommendation from Mr. Pan Jingzheng. Among the letters written by Pan&#39;s inkstones and friends, only &quot;The Letters of Zhang Taiyan&quot; have been compiled and published in the 17th volume of &quot;Xue Ji Lin&quot;, and the letters of Guo Moruo have been included in the article &quot;The Posthumous Letters of Guo Moruo and &quot;Guanzi Collection&quot;&quot; Library Journal, Issue 3, 1999, the authors are all Lin Shenqing, which shows that Mr. Pan Jingzheng held him in high esteem. Unfortunately, Lin died young and was unable to complete the collection and research of the letters written by friends in Yanlou. , which is regrettable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Pan Jingzheng, like Gu Tinglong and Qu Fengqi, are very supportive of Mr. Shen Xieyuan’s collection and arrangement of Huang Pilie’s inscriptions and postscripts. He once mentioned in his letters that &quot;it will be beneficial to write Huang&#39;s postscripts. I hope Mr. Gu can help me with my essays such as those on the Bo.&quot; It is undeniable that &quot;the previous letter of courtesy is based on the information of Huangxunpu. Because the matter is too long and nothing has been gained, it cannot be replied.&quot; If you see anything, you will be notified in a letter, such as the letter on October 18, 1981:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xie Yuan My brother asked: I sent you a copy ten days ago, and I want to go to the record room. The information on Xicheng Garden published in Taiwanese publications has been borrowed from Yang Junkanen of the Academy of Social Sciences on behalf of him, and was copied by Comrade Shen Jin, who agreed to receive it that morning.兹有恳者，弟拟订购《江苏图书馆工作》，希便中代为洽订，最好自去年第一期起（现已出版至第七期）。 Because it is issued internally, there is no way to place an order here. If you need a certain amount of money, please ask for instructions and it will be remitted immediately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person mentioned in the above letter as &quot;the information on Xicheng Garden has been included in Taiwanese publications&quot; should be Hong Kong scholar Luo Bingmian&#39;s &quot;Research on Huang Pilie&quot;. This article was included in the 1976 edition of Taiwan Food Publishing House. Luo&#39;s &quot;Collection of Qing Dynasty Scholars&quot;. In Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s case, there is a copy of the article, which has been bound into a volume with a kraft paper cover. There is a &quot;Shanghai Library Reproduction Fee Receipt&quot; in the volume, and the payment unit is filled with &quot;Shenjin&quot;. Next to it is Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s ink note &quot;Printing on behalf of &quot;Research on Huang Pilie&quot;&quot;. On September 18, 1981, he copied 57 pages of A4 paper for a total cost of 14.25 yuan. It seemed very expensive at the time and the price was not small. It can be inferred from the time and the person who made the printing that Mr. Pan Jingzheng was referring to this immediately when he mentioned copying. It can be seen from the letter that Mr. Pan Jingzheng borrowed Luo&#39;s &quot;Academic Treatise on the Qing Dynasty&quot; from Yang Kangnian of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Yang Kangnian is the same age as Mr. Shen Xieyuan and also graduated from Wuxi National College. However, he graduated a few years earlier and the two were not classmates.

I have also received the journal of the society and would like to express my gratitude on my behalf. If the order for 1982 is awarded, the order fee will be remitted immediately. I feel so relieved and refreshed. Attached are two lost poems by Xun Weng, whose dates can be traced. If you have any income after that, you should continue to send it.

One is father, marriage and family; It is private property rights and market economy. Because these two constitute the two indispensable cornerstones of human civilization. Our ability as humans to enter a civilized society really depends on this. This article explores the origin and evolution of these two species from the perspectives of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Father&quot; is a product of cultural construction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Scholars in the pre-Qin era realized that in the distant &quot;ancient&quot; period, there was no such role as a father. &quot;Zhuangzi: Robber Zhi&quot; states that &quot;in the days of Shen Nong, the people knew their mothers but did not know their fathers.&quot; &quot;Lu&#39;s Spring and Autumn Annals: Reliance on the King&quot; said: &quot;In ancient times, there were no kings. The people lived in groups and knew each other.&quot; &quot;The mother does not know the father&quot;, that is, there was no father&#39;s role in the &quot;ancient&quot; period, so there was no stable dual family and the corresponding ethics between various relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Wu Fei said that in &quot;Etiquette·Mourning Clothes Biography&quot;, &quot;Shang Jun Shu·Kaisa&quot; and &quot;Lu Shi&quot;, as well as &quot;Jiao Shi Yi Lin&quot;, &quot;Baihu Tong·Hao&quot; and &quot;Lunheng&quot; in the Han Dynasty • Documents such as &quot;Qi Shi&quot; and &quot;He Tu Ting Zuo Fu&quot; all record the situation of &quot;knowing the mother but not knowing the father&quot; in ancient times (Wu Fei: &quot;The &quot;Disintegration&quot; of Human Relations: Anxiety about Family and Country in the Tradition of Moral Theory&quot;, Sanlian Bookstore , 2017, pp. 163–166). As a kind of collective memory, as well as field observations of &quot;savages&quot; in the pre-Qin era, we all realize that the role of fathers comes with the development of civilization. This is a consensus among people since the pre-Qin and Han Dynasties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of the Later Han Dynasty·Xunli Biography&quot; also noted from the perspective of field observation that the people of Luoyue in the south at that time &quot;had no wedding ceremony laws, and they had no suitable match due to their promiscuity and lust.&quot; This state of no stable duality obviously does not produce the role of a father (in a social and cultural sense). Through civilized discipline and education, biological men in nature are transformed into fathers who fulfill family and social responsibilities, thus forming a stable family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a stable family structure, bloodline inheritance is clearer, which can encourage fathers to be more actively involved in family and parenting responsibilities. With the father&#39;s active participation, the child&#39;s survival probability is higher, a stable parent-child relationship is formed, and the child can be with the child for a longer period of time. As a role in this pole of civilization, knowledge that requires longer education and accumulation, including hunting, martial arts, farming, and even a large amount of &quot;tacit knowledge&quot; such as managing a tribe, will be taught to students in the original &quot;family learning&quot; way. child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To borrow the terminology of the Austrian school of economics, the emergence of the father&#39;s role and the dual family, as well as the imagination of the patrilineal ancestral community formed on this basis, are actually the product of super overcoming time preference. In an era without father figures, people consider the time dimension more briefly and often make judgments based on moments or short-term passions. The emergence of the role of the father, as well as the continuation of stable families and families, have made the lines of time extremely long, and people&#39;s investment and gaming models also tend to consider the longer future. At this point, savings become more valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People saved grain and raised livestock instead of consuming it immediately. Through savings, children can obtain stable property inheritance. The continuation of private property allows people to &quot;have perseverance and perseverance&quot;, overcome time preference, and develop the virtue of accumulating for the future. Whether it&#39;s working hard to save wealth, or doing good deeds to build a family&#39;s reputation, these are the foundations of civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blood relationship between children and their mothers is natural and does not need to be demonstrated through cultural imagination, but the father is a product of cultural construction and imagination. To imagine community through &quot;patrilineal&quot; requires both the ability to imagine beyond time and abstract cultural construction. Through this model, people who were destined to forget each other in the past can be formed into an imaginary community, creating a close division of labor and collaboration. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Patriline and Aristocracy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Once this kind of family organization is produced, it is destined to have an extremely powerful advantage among the scattered people everywhere who &quot;know their mother but not their father&quot;. Many archaeological materials can show that the first to establish a stable dual family order was the earliest aristocratic class. Not only did they create the means of imagining and sustaining community through the patriline, but they also created the earliest surnames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;生&quot; in &quot;surname&quot; is a phonetic symbol. The ancient sound of the word &quot;surname&quot; is in the heart mugeng part, and the archaic sound of the word &quot;生&quot; is in the birth mothergeng part. The dental sounds overlap and the pronunciation is basically the same. Therefore, the word &quot;surname&quot; is not interpreted literally as &quot;born by a woman, representing the maternal line.&quot; The &quot;female&quot; is only used to label women in the paternal family with &quot;surname&quot;, while men in the family use &quot;surname&quot;. The &quot;生&quot; in the surname is just a phonetic symbol, and the &quot;surname&quot; is just a function of distinguishing between patrilineal families with the same origin and non-intermarriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paternal surname creates a long family tree, which can connect different distant family branches, forming a greater ability to mobilize and cooperate. Therefore, it can be seen that early nobles often prohibited civilians from establishing surnames and did not allow them to establish family trees. For example, in ancient Hawaii, &quot;ordinary civilians were not allowed to record their lineages, and they were prohibited from approaching the supreme chief who was a professional person who recorded the noble lineage. This made the chief and the A sharp separation line was formed between civilians&quot; (Chen Chun: &quot;Exploring the Origins of Civilization and Early States: A Comparison of Chinese and Foreign Theories, Methods and Research&quot;, Shanghai Bookstore Press, 2007, p. 246). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The aristocrats and civilians in the Shang Dynasty&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an archaeological point of view, many people in the early days did not have stable paired families, and it was a common phenomenon to not know their mother but their father. For example, in tomb K82.5 at the Wajiaping site of Lintao of the Qijia Culture, an adult woman was buried with a baby under her breast, and the remains of a seven or eight-year-old child. The Qinghai Minhe Lajia F4 abandoned house burial tomb of the Qijia Culture also contains a single woman buried with a child in her arms (Li Xinwei: &quot;Rediscussing the Abandoned House Burial in Prehistoric Period&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot; 2007 Issue 5, No. Pages 50-56). These single mothers buried alone with their children are a vivid portrayal of the early era of &quot;knowing your mother but not knowing your father&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Xiajiadian Dadianzi tombs, there are no couples buried together, and mothers and young children are often buried together. For example, in tomb M30, a mother was buried with two young children, and in M205, a mother was buried with a child. Young children were buried together, M358 was buried with a mother and a child, M675 was buried with a mother and children, M787 was buried with a mother and two infants, and M1246 was buried with a young child (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Dadianzi: Lower Xiajiadian Cultural Sites and Cemetery&quot; Excavation Report&quot;, Science Press, 1998, pp. 228-231). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the ancient sarcophagus burials of southwestern Yi, there are also tombs in which couples are buried together (Luo Kaiyu: &quot;Research on Sarcophagus Tombs in Western Sichuan and Yunnan and Eastern Tibet&quot;, &quot;Acta Archeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1992, p. 426 ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering early civilization, nobles had stable couples buried together, but civilians still did not have stable couples buried together. For example, the couple&#39;s tombs M303 and M225 of Da Sikong in the Yin Ruins are side by side, 2 meters apart, and they are buried side by side. They are both from the fourth phase of the Yin Ruins, and there are rammed earth buildings on the upper floors (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Excavation Report of Da Sikong M303 in the Yin Ruins &quot;, &quot;Acta Archeologica Sinica, Issue 3, 2008, p. 388&quot;), this noble tomb has a clear dual relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Xianwu pointed out that two-thirds of the tomb owners in Yinxu did not have a legal spouse during their lifetime. There were not many truly monogamous families. Most of them still lived in unstable couples and incest marriages, so they died. Afterwards, there were no exclusive spouses buried together (Meng Xianwu: &quot;A Review of the Excavations of Tombs in the Southern District of Yin Ruins&quot;, &quot;Central Plains Cultural Relics&quot; Issue 3, 1986, p. 80). Some scholars also pointed out that the phenomenon of &quot;burial in different caves&quot; for stable marriages is rare in the Yin Ruins. Throughout the pre-Qin period, single burials of men and women were the main burial method (Yang Baocheng: &quot;Research on Yin Ruins Culture&quot;, Wuhan University Press, 2002, pp. 80-83). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From these comprehensive points of view, the common people in the Shang Dynasty still mainly lived in a state without stable couple marriages, while the aristocracy showed a relatively stable couple family. In other words, aristocratic families in the Shang Dynasty had a clear role of &quot;father&quot;. The genealogy of the Shang king family in &quot;Historical Records·Yin Benji&quot;, as well as the genealogy of the Shang king family presented in the oracle bone inscriptions, and even other signs of noble genealogy found in the oracle bones, such as the famous &quot;Shang Sanjubing&quot; family tree inscription, are all It shows the ability of the aristocracy at that time to construct a community organization in the cultural imaginary way of patriarchy. Although the ties of the ancient clan society had not yet been completely disintegrated at that time, in the oracle bone inscriptions, the children of the Shang family referred to their biological father&#39;s brothers of the same generation, that is, uncles, as &quot;father&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot;. In addition, the Shang king and queen of Yinxu were also buried in different family cemeteries. &quot;This is probably related to the fact that the blood ties of the clan have not been completely disintegrated.&quot; (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;1976 Northwest Xiaotun, Anyang&quot; &quot;Excavation Briefing&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1987, page 374). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But no matter what, the Shang royal family and other aristocratic families can actually identify their respective biological fathers, and the later the father dies, the more the son succeeds, and the situation of brother&#39;s succession is decreasing. . Among the sacrifices, the sacrifices for the biological father are also more solemn. This also shows that the role of &quot;father&quot; in the culture of the royal family and aristocracy of the Shang Dynasty has become more and more clear, while in contrast is the vague civilian class, the mainstream living situation among which is still knowing the mother but not knowing the father. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zhou Civilization and Confucius&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By the Zhou Dynasty, the situation of the civilian class had not changed much, while the civilization level of the aristocratic class had further evolved and improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, it was said that &quot;propriety is not inferior to common people&quot;, that is, the aristocratic class maintained the father and stable couple marriage family structure through civilized &quot;propriety&quot;, while the common class continued to know their mother and their father. For example, among the Jin tombs in Chengcun Village, Linyi, Shanxi, among the third-level civilian tombs, couples are rarely found buried in the same cave. &quot;This shows that the burial custom of couples being buried together in caves has not become popular among lower social classes&quot; (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, etc.: &quot;Linyi Chengcun Cemetery&quot;, China Encyclopedia Press, 2003, p. 258 pages). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars pointed out that compared with the Shang Dynasty, it was more common for couples of nobles in the Zhou Dynasty to be buried together in tombs (Zhang Mingdong: &quot;Inspection of Joint Tombs in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Ancient Civilization&quot; Volume 7, Cultural Relics Publishing Society, 2008, p. 185). This also shows that with the development of ritual and music civilization, the civilizational achievements carried by &quot;rituals&quot; more generally covered the families of the aristocratic class at that time. Stable and clear pair marriages, as well as the role of the father, were the further development of civilization in the Zhou Dynasty. important results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This background actually helps to understand more deeply why Confucius, who lost his father since childhood, had to hold a grand funeral ceremony at the Five Fathers Road after the death of his mother Yan Zheng, and then put her there. He was buried in Fangshan and buried with his father (&quot;Historical Records·Confucius Family&quot;). Because through this act, he can publicly show that he is the child of the aristocratic Kong family, not a &quot;savage&quot; class without a father, but a low-level nobleman with clear parents buried together in the tomb - a scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an orphan, Confucius never met his father. In fact, what has the greatest influence on him is precisely the maternal family with natural blood connections, that is, his grandfather Yan Xiang and his mother Yan Zheng are in these maternal families. Among the students of Confucius, there were the &quot;Eight Faces of Confucius&quot;, namely Yan Lu, Yan Hui, Yan Xing, Yan Gao, Yan Zu, Yan Zhimu, Yan Kuai, and Yan He. Among them, Yan Lu was probably his mother&#39;s nephew, that is, Confucius&#39;s cousin in his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui, as the son of Yan Lu, was Confucius&#39;s nephew in his mother&#39;s family. Confucius&#39; feelings for Yan Hui were often intertwined with the deep emotions of his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui also regarded Confucius as someone as close to him as his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of natural emotions, Confucius actually had the closest relationship with his mother&#39;s family, but he knew that the civilized class could not only know its &quot;quality&quot; but not its &quot;culture&quot;. &quot;You love his sheep and I love his etiquette.&quot; Although my father is far away, he is a symbol of etiquette and civilization. Without the symbol of father, he would remain at the level of knowing his mother and not knowing his father. Therefore, Confucius chose to publicly bury his mother and father together, declaring that he was the successor of Uncle Liang He, the official of Zouyi, and inherited and continued his father&#39;s &quot;Kong&quot; surname. The origin of the patrilineal imaginary community can therefore be traced back to the monarchs of the ancient Song Dynasty, and even the more distant Shang royal family, and all the way back to the emperor Ku and other figures in the ancient mythological era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucius&#39; recognition of his ancestors opened a path to encourage the common people to imitate the nobility, to go beyond knowing their mother and not knowing their father, and to establish a clear father&#39;s family like the aristocrats. Confucius not only recruited a large number of elite children of civilians, but also spread aristocratic knowledge to them. Confucianism in later generations also encouraged civilians to learn etiquette, become civilized people, become qualified fathers, and imitate the nobles in establishing surnames, family trees, and family temples. The establishment and recognition of the father&#39;s symbol is an important springboard to civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small communities and private property rights&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By clarifying the role of the father and the cultural construction of the family, it provides an accumulated foundation for the development of communities and private property. The family is the foundation of private property rights, and private property rights are an important cornerstone of civilization. Only on this foundation does it make sense to save and develop for the future. It is on the basis of private property rights that the principle of &quot;differentiated love&quot; can bring into play the interactive effect of communities of different circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Private property rights are not actually &quot;private&quot; as understood by Yang Zhu&#39;s atomic individuals. In a private property society, various forms of property sharing are actually practiced within families. The traditional primogeniture system in Western Europe retains the integrity of family property, although the second son can only receive an annuity provided by his elder brother, or even has no property and can only go out to explore the world. However, the family property is not &quot;privately owned&quot; by the atomic individual of the eldest son, but is the custodian between the ancestors and descendants of the blood community, so the property still belongs to the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the Chinese are more inclined to divide property. In addition to other scholars, according to the law of the Song Dynasty, &quot;a woman can marry half of a man&quot;, and daughters can also get the right to inherit family property. On the one hand, Confucians encourage the formation of clan communities with more levels of property distribution without dividing families, or by establishing family common property trusts such as &quot;Fan&#39;s Yizhuang&quot; and &quot;clan fields&quot;, &quot;sacrifice fields&quot; and &quot;school fields&quot; that are common in South China. &quot; and so on, maintaining various forms of common property of small communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of private property rights is mainly the defense mechanism that must be in place when facing public power representing the greater community. That is to say, the property rights of small communities such as families and families cannot be infringed on in the name of a large community or a society of strangers. In the face of public rights, private property rights are embodied as &quot;private&quot;, but within small communities, they are mostly represented as &quot;public&quot; with various tender feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the British Victorian era, which was criticized by some people, while the market economy and industrialization were highly developed, family values ​​remained strong, providing warmth and a haven to escape the cruelty of society. The song &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; written by John Howard Payne in 1822 has been popular in the English-speaking world for more than a hundred years. It sings: &quot;Home, home, sweet, sweet home! There is no place like home in the world. A better place”. The popularity of this song just shows that the high development of the market economy at that time did not destroy family values. On the contrary, it highlighted the &quot;privacy&quot; of the family as a small community and its positive role in protecting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The development of market economy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the basis of private property rights, especially with the further development of the industrial and commercial economy, there is a need for rich exchanges and cooperation between strangers from all over the world. At this time, the market economy based on private property rights was nurtured and developed, and through various business models such as games and cooperation based on property rights, the lowest-cost method of cooperation between strangers in a complex society was realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a free market economy, various small communities can divide labor and collaborate more effectively. With the expansion of the market order, the number of groups absorbed has further increased, and the division of labor has been continuously refined. Efficiency has increased while costs have decreased, forming a positive-sum game effect, and people can benefit together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the collaboration model of the market economy, people have also learned to trade and collaborate in ways that go beyond traditional small communities. With the improvement of life and the abundance of commodities, more ordinary people have the opportunity to have access to the culture and art of past elites at low cost. Ludwig von Mises said: &quot;If an argument is needed, it is only necessary to point out how serious music has become popular in the past few decades, especially among those who are busy in business. That&#39;s enough. There has never been a time in history when art has been brought so close to the hearts of so many people&quot; ([Austrian] Ludwig von Mises: &quot;Socialism: Economic and Sociological Analysis&quot;, Translated by Wang Jianmin et al., China Social Sciences Press, 2008, p. 406). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, classical books were extremely expensive in China, and there were many records in the literature of &quot;poor families without books&quot;. According to the &quot;Book of the Northern Qi Dynasty: Du Bi&#39;s Biography&quot;, his grandfather was the governor of Huainan and his father was the county magistrate, but his family was still &quot;poor and without books&quot;. &quot;Yan&#39;s Family Instructions Encouraging Learning&quot; specifically emphasizes, &quot;If you can always keep hundreds of volumes of books, you will never be a villain for thousands of years.&quot; As long as the family can keep some precious books, the class will not fall, but can always be Stay in the elite class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the advent of the Song Dynasty, driven by the market economy, commercial book engraving began to rise and flourish, and a large number of high-end classical books began to enter the lives of ordinary people. Su Dongpo mentioned: &quot;When I met the old Confucian Mr. Yu, I said that when I was young, I wanted to get &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Han Shu&quot; but could not get them. Fortunately, I got them. I wrote them by myself and read them day and night, for fear of not being able to catch up. In recent years, people in the city have turned around. The books of hundreds of schools of thought were copied from each other, and thousands of pieces of paper were passed down every day. The books written by scholars were numerous and easy to produce&quot; (&quot;Li&#39;s Shanfang Collection Secretary&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, it is precisely because &quot;city people&quot; &quot;copied&quot; driven by commercial interests that caused the rapid popularity of classical books, and a large number of classical books entered the world of ordinary people. In the past in Europe, Stoic books and Rococo art were limited to a limited number of aristocratic elites and out of reach of ordinary civilians. However, with the development of market economy and industrialization, production costs have been greatly reduced, and ordinary workers can also hang a print of a Leonardo da Vinci or Van Gogh painting at home, or collect an industrially produced classical book. The market economy allows the aristocratic culture and elite rituals and music that were once aloof to enter the families and lives of ordinary people more efficiently, raising the average level of civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that from the perspective of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history, the emergence of the stable dual family, the role of &quot;father&quot; (in the cultural sense) and the marriage system, as well as the emergence of the marriage system based on this Private property rights and market economy are the two cornerstones of a civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列外交人员家属遇袭，北京警方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258597]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 20:54:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At about 14:00 on October 13, 2023, in front of a supermarket in Zuojiazhuang, Chaoyang District , a family member of an Israeli diplomat (male, 50 years old) was stabbed by a foreigner.
