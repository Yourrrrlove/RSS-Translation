The award will also announce the winning projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Several of this year’s alternative Nobel Prizes just announced are related to human health and life. First, the Public Health Award goes to Stanford urologist Park Seung-min for his invention of the Stanford toilet: a &quot;smart toilet&quot; that can monitor health conditions such as urinary tract infections, diabetes and others by analyzing a user&#39;s urine and feces. signs of disease. Additionally, toilet-mounted sensors can identify users based on the unique characteristics of each person&#39;s anus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second prize in medicine was awarded to the team of Natasha Mesinkovska, a dermatologist at the University of California, Irvine. He and his team members carefully observed the noses of human corpses and determined whether there were the same number of nasal hairs in each nostril. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Alternative Nobel Prize has been awarded since 1991. It is an interesting imitation of the Nobel Prize and rewards achievements in 10 aspects. Its name comes from the combination of Ignoble and Nobel Prize. The organizer is the scientific humor magazine &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; (Annals of Improbable Research), and some of the judges are real Nobel Prize winners. The aim is to select studies that &quot;make you laugh at first and then thought-provoking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2023 Alternative Nobel Prize for Public Health is not just laughable, but indeed innovative and practical. Disease prevention is better than disease treatment, this is the consensus of everyone. Annual physical exams are just a means of prevention. But even this kind of physical examination is considered daunting by many people, because it is not only troublesome to draw blood, defecate and defecate (urinate and defecate), but also requires a special visit to a hospital or physical examination company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the invention of smart toilets may solve these problems and make physical examinations easier, especially for urine and feces examinations, which can predict and predict people&#39;s physical conditions and what diseases may occur. sign. Urine itself can reflect various conditions of the urinary system. When inflammation, stones, tuberculosis, tumors, kidney transplant rejection, renal failure, etc. occur, the composition of urine will change; when certain diseases cause changes in blood composition, Corresponding changes in the composition of urine may also occur, such as diabetes, pancreatitis, jaundice, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stool can reflect more conditions of the body. You can know whether there is inflammation and infection in the digestive tract and the bile ducts leading to the digestive tract, including parasitic infections; There is no bleeding caused by lesions, and when colon tumors or ulcerative colitis occur, bloody stools are the main symptom; the fecal occult blood test (chemical method or immunological method) can detect bleeding that cannot be identified with the naked eye, and can also be used as the first step in the general screening of digestive tract tumors. Screening means; through bacterial culture or microscopy, the intestinal tract can be checked for pathogenic bacteria (such as typhoid bacilli, salmonella, dysentery bacilli) to prevent and treat intestinal infectious diseases; it can assist in the diagnosis of certain hepatobiliary diseases, such as obstructive jaundice The stool is clay-colored, and small stones can be detected in the stool when suffering from cholelithiasis; the digestion status of food in the gastrointestinal tract can be understood. For example, oil droplets in the stool indicate maldigestion and absorption of fat, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The smart toilet comprehensively detects and quickly analyzes human excrement through a series of high-end technologies such as test strips, computer vision systems, cameras, and image recognition. It also combines artificial intelligence, so it can detect the size of a person. It&#39;s fast and convenient. However, what needs to be confirmed is whether the detection results of this smart toilet are accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This detection is similar to the original invention to detect cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA is a DNA fragment discharged into the blood by human cells, with a length of about 167 base pairs. The content in the blood is very low, and it mainly comes from dead somatic cells. Cancer patients have higher cfDNA content in the blood, which comes from dead tumor cells in their bodies. These cfDNA from tumors are called circulating tumors (ctDNA), which can be used as one of the biomarkers for detecting cancer. Now many medical examination companies have also launched ctDNA testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another function of cfDNA is to detect fetal abnormalities. Human embryos will also discharge some DNA into the blood, called cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), which enters the maternal blood circulation through apoptotic trophoblast cells shed from placental tissue. In 1997, Professor Lo Yuk-ming from Hong Kong, China, discovered that cffDNA could be extracted from the blood of pregnant women to diagnose fetal malformations, such as congenital dementia (Down syndrome). He is also known as the founder of non-invasive DNA prenatal testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;non-invasive prenatal diagnosis&quot; (NIPT) technology invented by Lu Yuming has been widely used in more than 60 countries and regions around the world for many years. Because this kind of test is simpler and more user-friendly, it does not require a large amount of blood to be drawn or amniotic fluid puncture, which saves pregnant women a lot of trouble and risks. For this reason, Lu Yuming was awarded the &quot;2022 Lasker Clinical Medicine Award&quot;. This is one of the most prestigious awards in the medical field, known as the &quot;Nobel Weather Vane&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the smart toilet that won the Alternative Nobel Prize this year can accurately diagnose urinary tract infections, diabetes and even tumors by analyzing the user&#39;s urine and feces, it will undoubtedly be the first Alternative Nobel Prize in recent years. The trend is that this award will become more and more practical, not just what people think of as &quot;funny&quot;. As for whether it will become another benchmark for the Nobel Prize, that is another matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又丧气又温暖，这纪录片真神奇]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;In 2021, Martin Scorsese once He teamed up with Netflix to produce a biographical comedy documentary &quot;Pretend This Is a City.&quot; The film stars Martin&#39;s longtime friend, writer and critic Fran Lebowitz. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fran, who has a strong intellectual aura, is enough to make those who love her happy when she walks on the streets of New York.

Among them, the &quot;Basic Funeral Services&quot; refusal to trade dispute case involves the identification and legal liability of public enterprises&#39; refusal to trade, which is worth mentioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the basic facts of this typical case are: Quanzhou Licheng Lisheng Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Lisheng Company), which is mainly engaged in funeral intermediary services, sued for the prosecution of Quanzhou Jiying Funeral Service Co., Ltd. (Jiying Company) is a public enterprise that provides basic funeral services such as cremation of remains. Because Lisheng Company reported that Jiying Company charged illegally, Jiying Company refused Lisheng Company to apply for cremation services on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, which violated the regulations. In accordance with the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly, we requested a court to order Jiying Company to resume handling relevant business for Lisheng Company and to compensate for economic losses of 80,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled to reject all claims of Lisheng Company. Lisheng Company was dissatisfied and appealed, claiming that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal was an abuse of market dominance prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. The second instance of the Supreme Court found that Jiying Company, as a public enterprise with a monopoly position in the basic funeral service market in central Quanzhou, refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, constituting a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law, and ruled that Jiying Company Compensate Lisheng Company for losses of RMB 80,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trial process of this case is very interesting. In the first instance, Lisheng Company held that Jiying Company&#39;s refusal to trade with it violated the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law prohibiting administrative monopoly. The court of first instance held that Lisheng Company failed to prove that Jiying Company was the executive entity of the administrative monopoly regulated by the Anti-Monopoly Law, so it rejected Lisheng Company&#39;s appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what are the provisions of the Anti-Monopoly Law on administrative monopoly? According to Chapter 5 of the Anti-Monopoly Law, administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to exclude or restrict competition. From a legal perspective, the implementing entities of administrative monopoly should be “administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs.” On the surface, Jiying Company is an enterprise, not an administrative agency, and is not authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs. It does not seem qualified to be the subject of administrative monopoly. So what kind of company is Jiying Company? After digging through the layers, it was discovered that Jiying Company is a state-owned company 100% controlled by the Quanzhou State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. More importantly, Jiying Company operates the only funeral parlor in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, funeral parlors in other places are generally public institutions affiliated with the civil affairs department, but Quanzhou City hands over the operation of funeral parlors to a state-owned enterprise. This state-owned enterprise is responsible for providing basic funeral services, including cremation of remains, in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou City. This is the only funeral home in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou that can provide cremation services. According to the reply letter to the CPPCC members&#39; proposal published by the Quanzhou Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in 2019, the funeral business in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou was transferred to Jiying Group for management. In other words, Jiying Company’s monopoly on the basic funeral service market in the main urban area of ​​Quanzhou is the result of administrative transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it legal for a state-owned enterprise that provides basic public services, which is in a monopoly position due to administrative orders, to refuse to trade with a downstream enterprise because it reported that it charged excessively? The court of first instance rejected the plaintiff&#39;s petition on the grounds that the defendant was not a qualified subject of administrative monopoly. There seemed to be nothing wrong with the procedure. However, it objectively maintained Jiying Company&#39;s monopoly status and made it impossible for the plaintiff to carry out normal operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, during the appeal, Lisheng Company changed its strategy and claimed that Jiying Company’s refusal was an abuse of market dominance and refusal to trade. The Supreme Court also held in the second instance that Jiying Company is a public enterprise with an exclusive position in the local basic funeral service market, and the basic funeral services it provides are specific services that are indispensable for the downstream funeral intermediary companies to carry out services, and the downstream funeral agencies There is no alternative to the agency. Jiying Company refused to handle relevant business for Lisheng Company, which resulted in Lisheng Company being completely excluded from the funeral agency service market in downtown Quanzhou, excluding and limiting competition in the funeral agency service market, and damaging its reputation as a countermeasures company. The interests of consumers’ relatives of the deceased in the sense of the Monopoly Law constitute a refusal to trade prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law. Therefore, it was ruled that Jiying Company should resume Lisheng Company’s application for the cremation business on behalf of the relatives of the deceased under legal and compliant conditions, and compensate them The refusal to trade caused a loss of 80,000 yuan to Lisheng Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant judgment documents published on the China Judgment Documents Network, the cause of the incident was a business of renting ice coffins to store remains in October 2019. The plaintiff believed that the defendant had illegally charged an extra 200 yuan in rent. Complaints to market regulatory authorities. After that, the defendant no longer accepted the plaintiff’s application to the defendant for cremation of remains on behalf of the deceased’s family. In order to protect their rights and interests, the plaintiff complained to the Quanzhou Municipal Market Supervision Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and National Development and Reform Commission, and took the civil affairs, municipal supervision and other departments to court many times for administrative inaction. However, these complaints and lawsuits all failed without exception. Even in the first-instance civil lawsuit heard by the intermediate court in another place, there was still no support. It wasn&#39;t until he appealed to the Supreme Court that he was finally supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar phenomena are not uncommon. Some local governments transfer the responsibility of certain basic public services to state-owned enterprises, which is called marketization and actually forms an administrative monopoly. These state-owned enterprises have an absolute monopoly in this field of public services and may even be assigned some management functions that should be the responsibility of the administrative department. Their leaders are often close to the regulatory authorities. Therefore, these state-owned enterprises are often arrogant when facing downstream enterprises or consumers. Once downstream companies or consumers mess with such state-owned enterprises, they will be put in the shoes of others. Just like in this case, because Lisheng Company complained about Jiying Company&#39;s excessive charges, Jiying Company used the excuse that Lisheng Company violated laws and regulations during the funeral process and refused to allow Lisheng Company to handle the cremation business on behalf of the family of the deceased. However, it is very difficult for downstream companies or consumers to safeguard their rights. Locally, they will basically encounter obstacles everywhere, and they can only be solved at a higher level or even at the central level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this kind of public service provision by enterprises designated by administrative power does not comply with the legal provisions on &quot;administrative monopoly&quot; on the surface, it is essentially the same as administrative monopoly. They both rely on administrative power to monopolize the market. Put on a pair of &quot;corporate&quot; white gloves. These &quot;public enterprises&quot; with monopoly status should not be viewed with caution against administrative monopolies to prevent them from using their monopoly status to harm the interests of upstream and downstream enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在德国小镇，偶遇“乱世佳人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257446]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/2xLRyrFir4VYv8Pl4SihiUfphbeTRVncavXAsDeI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/2xLRyrFir4VYv8Pl4SihiUfphbeTRVncavXAsDeI. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251388&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Portrait of Barbara and herself when she was young&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meeting Barbara and her story was a completely unexpected gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally just came to see an old friend. She settled in Rothenburg, Germany, a small town that even Germans are not very familiar with. After not seeing each other for many years, my friend and I wasted no time chatting, and the topic somehow ended up on her German mother-in-law, Barbara. My friend really wanted me to talk to this old lady. Before I could ask why, she couldn’t help but introduce Barbara’s life: she was born into a wealthy manor family, and later became a refugee. It was like the movie &quot; Scarlett in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had already smelled the flavor of the story. It happened to be that Friday, and my friend made an appointment to go to my mother-in-law’s house, so I quickly followed. The walk to Barbara&#39;s house was short, just through the garden from the back door of a friend&#39;s house. The kitchen door opened, and a silver-haired old man walked out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ewe46mb8M527fPetxAplol6ggihKhOi2qtw1apBB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ewe46mb8M527fPetxAplol6ggihKhOi2qtw1apBB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251386&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara&#39;s family&#39;s manor&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First meeting with Barbara Bara, I can&#39;t help but marvel: This old lady is so tough! He walks steadily and has a loud voice. He doesn&#39;t look like he is 93 years old. After her husband&#39;s death, Barbara lived alone for more than ten years. Not only did she take care of her own daily life and food, but she also took care of the two-story house and large garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seeing me as an unexpected guest, Barbara generously invited me in. A friend suggested that we sit at the dining table and chat. Barbara pretended to be angry and shook her head: &quot;How can we sit comfortably?&quot; She moved the brewed tea and small cakes to the coffee table at the end of the living room. The room was a little dark, so Barbara turned on the light, turned to the room, took out two photo albums, and placed them in front of me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/OcMHVTXqMHcQe2kwEIEp8f4ukEVBp6ihHTZqqzLr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/OcMHVTXqMHcQe2kwEIEp8f4ukEVBp6ihHTZqqzLr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251390&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The three Barbara sisters and their mother&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This It’s my old home,” Barbara said. She pointed to a black and white photo in the center of the album&#39;s home page. The pixels were very low and a bit blurry, but I could still tell that it was a large castle-like house that could accommodate at least a dozen luxurious suites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara, who was born in 1931, has lived in this big house with her two sisters since she was a child. Her family is very wealthy, and the town where the manor is located, whether it is farmland, shops or churches, is all Barbara&#39;s family property. They hired thousands of employees to take care of everything in the manor. Barbara&#39;s childhood was pampered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But such a privileged life came to an abrupt end when Barbara was 14 years old. In 1945, Germany was defeated and the country was occupied by partitions. Barbara&#39;s family estate was located on the border of East and West Germany, and was transferred to East Germany at the last minute. If they were ordinary people, they might not be affected too much. The prominence of the Barbara family and the &quot;corrupt farmer life&quot; they lived made them the target of public criticism. On the eve of the end of the war, the Soviet army that took over captured Barbara&#39;s father and gave orders to other family members to pack up and leave within 4 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/yoMl9Fb7ylFmYAlyagMxakIViKgJyJrPZuxY4mGV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/yoMl9Fb7ylFmYAlyagMxakIViKgJyJrPZuxY4mGV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara&#39;s Little Bear&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night During this time, Barbara was reduced from an aristocratic lady to a refugee. Fortunately, thanks to my mother&#39;s bravery and resourcefulness, the family of five was able to reunite safely. They climbed onto the train in the dark, crossed the border, and hid with relatives in West Germany. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, Barbara not only had to take care of her own life, but also had to learn farm work from scratch. When I asked Barbara if she ever felt particularly miserable, she smiled. She is always smiling, and when she talks about the past, it feels like she is describing someone else&#39;s adventure story, without any resentment or sadness on her face. She even looked like a child, her shoulders curled up when she was happy, and she leaned on the sofa with a smile on her face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara said that she did not feel bitter at all, but felt extremely lucky. After all, the family was intact. She only remembers the ruins of post-war towns, or the happy times she spent laughing in the rice fields with her family. Later, they came to settle in the small town of Rothenburg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war delayed Barbara&#39;s studies, but she has always had a dream to become a flight attendant, because her mother said that being a flight attendant allows her to experience different cultures. At that time, Germany had very high requirements for flight attendants, and you had to master two foreign languages ​​to apply. In her early twenties, Barbara decided to go abroad. Her family contacted a family in Sweden who needed a nanny for her, and she set out alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara stayed in Sweden for three years and met her future husband, who was also German. Her husband wanted to return to Germany, so Barbara&#39;s dream of being a flight attendant ended. She settled down to become a housewife and raised four children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/iUpQf4uhYGqNGZWs078ZkOGV7cdJHXt16OvID5OU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/iUpQf4uhYGqNGZWs078ZkOGV7cdJHXt16OvID5OU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Barbara in her garden&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Children&#39;s words/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up In the 1970s, Barbara&#39;s family contacted the East German government. After numerous lawsuits, Sister Barbara finally received some compensation. The former manor is now managed by a government foundation. The pastoral scenery and splendor of the past can only be recorded thanks to the photos taken by Barbara’s mother during her lifetime. If no one asked, Barbara rarely told her story to outsiders. She just typed out an &quot;autobiography&quot; of more than thirty pages on a typewriter and left it to her four children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The epic story of nearly a hundred years was condensed into one afternoon&#39;s narration, which I found intoxicating and exciting. I asked Barbara if there was one item that she still regrets leaving in her home at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Barbara spent a few minutes thinking, and I guessed that the answer might be related to gold and silver jewelry. Unexpectedly, she answered: &quot;My little stuffed bear!&quot; She pointed behind her seriously. Said: &quot;So I sewed one for myself!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hearing this, my friend and I burst into laughter. Barbara explained a little embarrassedly: &quot;I was only a 14-year-old child at the time...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving, Barbara took out a small notebook and asked me to leave a message in it. I wrote in Chinese and Swedish respectively: Dear Barbara, I wish you health and happiness forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电影《流水落花》：努力将生活这张旧报纸展平]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257533]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The veteran escort for the Best Actress who has failed nine times finally stepped onto the podium. At the 41st Hong Kong Film Awards, Sammi Cheng, who won the Best Actress Award, couldn&#39;t hide her excitement: &quot;I want to thank God for not letting me have a smooth journey. It is these lack of smooth sailing that have taught me to be humble and gentle... (At this moment) I can’t be gentle. I’m really happy tonight. I finally don’t have to run silently with you on the track, and I can finally cross the finish line with my head held high.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, 2023, nearly half a year after winning the award, Sammi Cheng &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;, the film&#39;s best-selling novel, has finally been released in mainland China. But in the movie, the honors on the awards podium disappear along with the ambition. People saw that Sammi Cheng appeared on the screen without any appearance and almost gave the most &quot;light&quot; performance in her career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6iHG1ya14BlHIBF5Hl1mIeOOZ3W0uzIhzOHXLmqu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6iHG1ya14BlHIBF5Hl1mIeOOZ3W0uzIhzOHXLmqu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sammi Cheng (left) in the movie &quot;Falling Water&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; is not complicated. Tianmei, played by Sammi Cheng, was originally a car rider on the school bus. As a caretaker, due to a change in the school bus route, she quit her job and returned home to be a temporary mother in a &quot;foster family&quot;. Together with her husband, Bin, who drove for her boss, she raised the children from social welfare institutions in stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children come from different family backgrounds: some have fathers in jail, and some are waiting for adoption due to their own illnesses. Life revolves around children again, and the hidden pain belonging to this family slowly emerges: a few years ago, Tianmei and Bin&#39;s young child died. Being a foster parent is also filling the void of &quot;parent&quot; status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To some extent, Tianmei, Bin and the passers-by in this family are all &quot;aphasic&quot; in society. When this family decided to become a foster family, they began to encounter scrutiny from the so-called healthy operating system. Every time the social worker asked to come to the door in half an hour, Tianmei felt like she was facing an enemy. According to regulations, one of the couple must stay at home with the child during the parenting period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bed and table should be as tidy as possible, cigarettes are an absolute taboo, and even the smell of cigarettes must be dispersed, which is regarded as a sign of &quot;unhealthy&quot;. But for such a couple who have been silently enduring the shadow of the loss of their child for a long time and living a difficult life, they really can&#39;t imagine a healthier way to resolve it - those moments when they are discouraged, worn out by daily life, and scattered and need to be sorted out. It needs to be dispelled by a silent cigarette. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Movies that focus on people at the bottom of society or on the margins can easily tend to over-emphasize their social side, as if people’s situations have become props to display social problems; the other extreme is an excess of warmth that overwhelms people. The details of getting along too warmly with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; tries its best to stay in the middle ground. It never gives up on capturing tender moments. A foster boy was injured and sent to the hospital for injuries while he was alone at home. The social worker then questioned &quot;Aunt Tianmei&quot; and &quot;Uncle Bin&quot;, and he cleverly excused them - Aunt Tianmei was not at home and had gone to buy medicine for herself. They spent the Spring Festival together, watching the fireworks bloom over the city, and their emotions were intimate and harmonious. But almost the next second, the life of this relationship in the image came to an abrupt end. A new foster child has arrived. There were no ostentatious farewells or overly bitter farewells. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot; has a vague flavor of Japanese movies. When it needs concentration, it often falls into a sentimental and mournful atmosphere. For example, Tianmei was sitting on the balcony eating cake, letting the rain and wind splash into her territory, leaving water stains on her pants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She often stood alone on the bridge, waiting for the sunlight to move inch by inch over the narrow water channel, taking away the darkness from her side. &quot;I don&#39;t like to express my feelings with open and wide expressions, but I like to observe things from a detached and cold perspective, so the film may be the same.&quot; Director Jia Shengfeng said in an interview with the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no narrative ambition in the movie, and some exciting sequences seem to be just making up for the excessive static of life itself. When the mother of a foster boy came to her door feeling out of control, the social worker apologetically told Tianmei that she would immediately help find a new foster family. Tianmei therefore expressed dissatisfaction: He is not a commodity and can be moved around at any time. This is obviously not the first time a similar situation has occurred. The boy had just established trust with them, and they were about to be separated again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c78u1GrqVdJMyQ3r85w3y4ocTJQqFYq0t5q7onpZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c78u1GrqVdJMyQ3r85w3y4ocTJQqFYq0t5q7onpZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the foster children, Tianmei once considered adopting a girl with cleft lip and palate. But the social worker told her that adoptive families do not have the right to choose their children. According to certain assessment standards, the best adoptive parents for a girl with cleft lip and palate are an American couple, implying that Tianmei and Bin are economically disadvantaged. Tianmei rarely expressed anger: Have you asked your children for their opinions? How to judge the best? At that time, the girl with cleft lip and palate already called Tianmei &quot;mom&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, turbulent past events emerge suddenly and briefly, such as during bedtime conversations or invitations for intimate behavior. Her husband repeatedly proposed having another child, but Tianmei retorted: What should I do if there is another genetic disease this time? The conversation stopped there, with no further emotion. They accepted the death of their son tacitly, and had no intention of chewing, sorting out, or repeating their grief. Their life is like an old newspaper that is constantly being rubbed by fate. The purpose of living is just to flatten it bit by bit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the title of the film &quot;Falling Flowers in Flowing Water&quot; suggests, foster children are like flowers that have fallen temporarily, and life has temporarily brought them to Tianmei&#39;s family. Some netizens commented: In the first half of the film, the children are like falling flowers and the foster families are like running water. In the second half of the story, the foster family becomes the fallen flower, and the children are the running water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed. Looking at it, after losing their children, Tianmei and Bin&#39;s lives have almost come to a standstill. The life they have been practicing year after year cannot see many changes. When the children arrived, the family just regained some vitality and was full of dynamics - the children&#39;s childhood naughtiness was left in the form of graffiti on the wall. Pencils marked the gradually rising height lines and pasted them on the mirror to teach the children to smile more cheerfully. The flower stickers were put on and then taken off, and a pair of siblings who loved skipping classes wrote on the wall: Jia Xi Jia Lang is here for a visit. These connected graffiti show the flow of time within this family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Flowing Water and Falling Flowers&quot;, there is a scene that illustrates the director&#39;s intention to capture the true form of time - in Tianmei&#39;s imagination and memories, the children who have been in this family stand in rows according to their size. Arranged like cell phone signals. The first little boy to come to the foster home was the shortest and was in a stage where he would wet his pants in fear; while the last boy to stay in this family, 17 years old, was already able to help Tianmei carry rice and thread needles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven foster children have stopped in this family. With age groups ranging from elementary school to middle school to high school, &quot;Falling Water&quot; shows all the parenting issues a couple might encounter. In this design, the film erases the particularity that trauma brings to this family and restores a more universal family situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the parent fun day in primary school, like all normal parents, they helped their children participate in sports competitions and encouraged their children to regain their confidence; when the 17-year-old boy expressed that he wanted to stay at home forever, he was calm Accept that your child will eventually go out into the larger world. In this sense, the director filled a warm base under the cold and distant film style. After all, for Tianmei and Bin, this may be the best ending in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[病儿为何大额捐赠自家？儿慈会明星项目“冲配捐”调查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257557]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 17:59:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/24/928a05c694.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 24/928a05c694.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251850&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers of 99 Charity Day They introduced matching donations. (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a charitable organization with strong fundraising capabilities, the China Children’s Charity Aid Foundation (referred to as Children’s Charity Society) has recently fallen into disarray. In the midst of the donation turmoil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, Ke Mouxiao was accused of using the Children&#39;s Charity Society&#39;s &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Assistance&quot; project (hereinafter referred to as 9958) to defraud families of seriously ill children out of nearly 1,000 yuan. 10,000 life-saving money was detained by the police. The Children&#39;s Charity Association publicly stated that Ke Mouxiao was not its staff and had only served as a volunteer in the Hebei Langfang Team Cooperation Organization of the 9958 Project. But the controversy has not yet died down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many parents of children who were deceived said that they participated in the &quot;matching donation&quot; initiated by Ke Mouxiao and transferred the funds to Ke Mouxiao.

Because this kind of &quot;matching donation&quot; is a normal operation mode in the charity sector, and families of seriously ill children are accustomed to it, there is no doubt about the authenticity of the project initiated by Ke Mouxiao.

Southern Weekend reporters discovered that deficiencies in the management and operation of charitable organizations provide a breeding ground for the alienation of matching donations. The more money is raised, the more matching donations are made - with the same goal, the people who need the money most take their money out of their pockets, boosting the charity&#39;s fundraising figures. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Who dares to do it if you can’t get the money back?”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It’s the 99 Charity Day in September every year. Li Shan (pseudonym) from Guangxi I want to raise more life-saving money for my daughter who is suffering from leukemia. He decided to participate in &quot;matching donations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;99 Charity Day is a national charity event jointly launched by Internet companies and hundreds of charity organizations, enterprises, and celebrities. September 9, 2015 is China&#39;s first Internet Charity Day. In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers introduced a popular foreign method-matching donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Matching donation is matching donation. After one donor donates a sum of money to a charity organization, another donor (usually a company) will randomly or according to Donate a certain percentage of money to the same charity organization. The original intention of the matching donation model is to encourage the public to participate in donations. According to its original intention, the donation amount including corporate matching should not be used for the donor himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Charity Law also clearly stipulates that when a donor and a charitable organization agree on the purpose and beneficiaries of donated property, the donor&#39;s interested parties shall not be designated as beneficiaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan has never heard of the above regulations. On the eve of the 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan opened a &quot;Donate Together&quot; charity matching donation project for each of the three charity matching projects launched by the Children&#39;s Charity Society: &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot;, &quot;Girls in Need Guarantee Plan&quot; and &quot;Aiding Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot;. ” fundraising link and named it after his daughter, who has leukemia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Donate Together&quot; is a charity game launched by Tencent Charity Platform. Users click the corresponding button on the public welfare project homepage and fill in the target amount and sponsor information to generate a link. Donors open the link and enter the amount to donate. Subsequently, this donation information and the corresponding matching donation will be recorded in the initiator&#39;s &quot;Donate Together&quot; and can be publicly queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the public information and implementation plan of the project, the recipients of &quot;Sunflower Guarding Children in the West&quot; are children in need in the western provinces under the age of 18. &quot;Girls in Distress&quot; The &quot;Guarantee Plan&quot; will provide long-term assistance to girls in need across the country, and the goal of &quot;Assisting Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot; is to allow children in need to go to school with peace of mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I really don&#39;t understand this.&quot; On September 17, 2023, Li Shan listened to a reporter from Southern Weekend introduce the above three projects and said that he neither I don’t know who these projects are aiding, and I don’t know whether my behavior counts as a donation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But before that, in the three days from September 7th to 9th, Li Shan raised more than 210,000 yuan for these three projects through &quot;donate together&quot; , including several &quot;donations&quot; worth 3,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan. According to the rules, Tencent will donate more than 22,000 yuan for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan explained to Southern Weekend reporters that these &quot;donations&quot; were all his own money. &quot;The people who &#39;donated money&#39; were some relatives and friends. I gave the money to them first and then asked them to donate it to the project.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan said frankly , for the more than 200,000 yuan he &quot;donated&quot;, he had no intention of using it to aid children or girls in need in the west. &quot;We are all short of money ourselves.&quot; He believes that the money &quot;donated&quot; and matched by enterprises will eventually come back to him. &quot;Who dares to do it if he can&#39;t get (the money) back?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that during the three days from September 7th to 9th, a total of 12,000 people participated in the above-mentioned activities in the form of &quot;donate together&quot; For the three projects, they &quot;donated&quot; a total of more than 8.86 million yuan. Each &quot;donate together&quot; raised an average of 45,900 yuan, and the largest single &quot;donation&quot; was 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/9658c1749b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/9658c1749b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251851&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A &quot;Donate Together&quot; link initiated by a parent of a seriously ill child for the project of &quot;Aiding Children in Distress to Dream of Going to School&quot;.

Li Shan began to form this understanding in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, he was hospitalized in Dongguan with his daughter. In order to seek medical treatment for his daughter, who has not yet entered elementary school, he claimed to have spent at least 700,000 yuan in two years. He remembers that day, the patient next to him took out 2,000 yuan and asked him to &quot;donate&quot; the link he had opened for him, and at the same time help answer the questions (according to the rules of the platform, those who answer the questions will have a chance to get more matching donations). The patient told him that after doing so, the platform would randomly match an undetermined amount of matching donation, and &quot;after certain procedures,&quot; the patient would not only get the matching donation, but &quot;the principal can also be returned.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the eve of 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan joined a &quot;matching donation group&quot;. He said that the organizer of the group is a staff member of the 9958 Tai&#39;an team, and the group members call him &quot;teacher&quot;. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to confirm whether the organizer was an official staff member of the Children&#39;s Charity Society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tencent Foundation has provided a matching donation of 299.99 million yuan for all charity projects participating in the 2023 99 Charity Day activities. According to the matching donation rules announced by the platform, starting from 10:00 am on September 7th to 9th, every user donation greater than 1 yuan may receive a random amount of matching donation. The daily matching donation amount is on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last. Together with the funds donated by donors, it will be transferred to the donated charity projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan’s understanding of “matching donation” is obviously different. &quot;He (the group organizer) told us when to start investing, and then we started donating money.&quot; Li Shan recalled that through mutual communication among patients in the group, he learned that as long as he launched the &quot;Donate Together&quot; fundraising link in the designated project , find someone to donate money and help answer questions, the &quot;teacher&quot; can apply for a &quot;matching donation&quot; for him, and the principal can be returned through &quot;relevant procedures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the start of the 99 Charity Day, the &quot;teacher&quot; announced the &quot;quota&quot; in the group, and he signed up in the group; after signing up, he sent it to his relatives and friends Transfer money; at 10 o&#39;clock on the day of the event, while there is still a matching donation quota, you must &quot;raise it yourself as soon as possible, otherwise you will not be able to vote later and the link is full&quot;; after the event is over, wait for the refund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Within three days, Li Shan &quot;donated&quot; more than 200,000 yuan to three projects initiated by the Children&#39;s Charity Association. &quot;No parent asked why he donated to these projects. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public information of the project shows that a total of 54 people initiated &quot;Donate Together&quot; within three days of &quot;Assisting Children in Distress to Dream of Going to School.&quot; Two years after the project was launched, it has completed its fundraising goal and raised 4.35 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of press time, &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot; has reached the public fundraising goal of 5 million yuan.

(Internet screenshot/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be seen from public information on the Internet that during the 99 Charity Day, most of the link names of &quot;Donate Together&quot; are named after children.

Wang Qiang (pseudonym) who once worked in a local team of 9958 said that after the 99 Charity Day, parents would send screenshots of &quot;Donate Together&quot; named after their children to the financial staff of the 9958 local sub-center, who would then make statistics on each donation. How much money did each parent actually invest? The &quot;Donate Together&quot; page will display the funds raised by parents and the amount matched by the platform. The self-raised portion will be returned to parents after the 99 Charity Day. “This is the money in the account of the Children’s Charity Association.” The matching donation portion will have to wait until the platform transfers the matching donation funds to the Children’s Charity Association, “and then through the local people’s charity.” It will not be returned to parents through organizations or other channels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Qiang also explained to Southern Weekend reporters that when allocating the matching donation amount, parents need to provide the staff with an invoice that is consistent with the total allocation amount of the foundation, &quot;For example The principal is 50,000, and the matching donation is 20,000. Parents must provide an invoice with a face value of 70,000 to the foundation, otherwise the accounts will not be balanced.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The content of the invoice provided by the parents of the children must be related to the child&#39;s condition. Invoices for hospitalization, outpatient services or purchased medicines are all acceptable.&quot; Wang Qiang further mentioned . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 17, Li Shan said that he had not received the refund yet. After the Ke Mouxiao incident was exposed, he was worried that he would not be able to get back the money he invested. &quot;(The staff) didn&#39;t say when they would give us the money. Before the incident, they said we would submit the child&#39;s information and wait for the foundation (Children&#39;s Charity Society) to give us the money back, but now we are in a panic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Southern Metropolis Daily, some parents who have successfully received &quot;matching donations&quot; have presented bank transfer slips, and the payee was the Children&#39;s Charity Association. However, Sun Dandan, director of the platform communication department of the Children’s Charity Society, said that some parents received funds from the Children’s Charity Society not because of “matching donations”, but because they met the rescue standards of the 9958 project, and local teams or rescue stations submitted the funds for their children. If the information and situation are evaluated and meet the rescue standards, the rescue funds will be released according to the rescue process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tencent Charity reported on September 13 that although Ke Mouxiao’s behavior did not occur on the Tencent Charity platform, based on the platform operating rules, industry self-discipline conventions and user-oriented principles, the following was made: Decision: Suspension of fundraising for all 9958 projects pending official investigation results. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The team calls on parents to donate large amounts&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Does the Children&#39;s Charity Association know about Li Shan&#39;s &quot;matching donations&quot;? A WeChat group communication record obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that it was at the call of staff and volunteers that many parents of seriously ill children actively participated in the so-called &quot;matching donations&quot; on the 99 Charity Day in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This group is called &quot;Core Personnel of the Four National Branch Centers of the Children&#39;s Charity Society Project&quot;, with a maximum number of more than 70 people. The leader of the group is Wang Yu, whose name is the deputy secretary-general of the Children&#39;s Charity Society, Director of the 9958 Rescue Center of the Emergency Rescue Department. Almost all the 9958 project staff shown in the 2022 annual report of the Children&#39;s Charity Association are in the group, in addition to the &quot;responsible persons&quot; of various 9958 local teams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Emergency Relief Department is also known as Project Department 4. According to the official website of the Children&#39;s Society, the 9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Relief Center is established under it. The 2022 annual report of the Children’s Society shows that the 9958 Rescue Center of the Emergency Rescue Department has 16 staff members, which is the largest department in the Children’s Society. Its 9958 children&#39;s emergency rescue project was established in 2012 and is an independent brand project of the Children&#39;s Charity Association. Over the years, this project has established 25 relief sub-centers across the country in Weinan, Henan, Shanxi, Tai&#39;an, and Shijiazhuang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since August 2023, the staff member whose group nickname is &quot;9958-Cao Lifang&quot; has frequently shared information and reminders related to 99 Charity Day in the group. According to the WeChat public account &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Rescue&quot; and the 2022 annual report of the Children&#39;s Charity Society, Cao Lifang is the director of the fourth project department of the Children&#39;s Charity Society and also serves as the director of the 9958 Rescue Center. During the 99 Charity Day, he was also the coordinator of the 9958 project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 23, Cao Lifang informed the group that &quot;the platform is conducting a donation matching test&quot; and asked staff to make small donations to participating projects and experience the event process. . &quot;It is not recommended to allow parents to participate in the test. It is impossible to determine the amount of parents&#39; investment, which will take up the remaining fundraising space of the project.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 29, she said again Reminder, &quot;Participating children should pay attention to whether the disease type is consistent with the project. If the disease type is not specified, the project will treat it as all diseases. If the project specifies autism, premature infants, and congenital heart disease, the team will ask the parents to respond accordingly. Disease type, if the item is for girls, please ask the team to check that boys do not use it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Two days later, she shared with everyone the matching donation for 99 Charity Day Understand the rules. For example, if you need help from friends to answer the question &quot;Whether you answer correctly or not, you will have a chance to get a matching donation,&quot; parents can follow the training materials of the Children&#39;s Charity Association to learn to improve their charity status, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The team can directly call on parents to donate large amounts, and 80% of the donations must be completed on the 7th.&quot; Cao Lifang said in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A charity figure who once worked in 9958 explained to Southern Weekend reporters that on the 99 Charity Day, many parents of children with children will invest money in multiple projects. , the platform has a high probability of matching the most funds to the project with the largest donation amount. &quot;A friend can only help the parents of the same seriously ill child once a day, and large donations will get the most matching donations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 4, Cao Lifang informed everyone in the group: &quot;Parents who participate in 99 Charity, please transfer money to relatives and friends in advance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the matching donation started on September 7, the group nickname was shown as &quot;9958 Platform Development Department-Xu Jiawen&quot; (the annual report showed that this name&#39;s position was &quot;9958 Relief Center Project Officer&quot; ) notified in the group, &quot;Public donation is a voluntary and free act. Please mobilize and regulate management to jointly protect the credibility of the industry.&quot; But more than half an hour later, the group nickname was &quot;Jia Zhen, 9958 Platform Development Department&quot;. Said, &quot;Parents with high allocation should hurry up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned charity person explained that &quot;high allocation&quot; refers to the platform&#39;s matching donation ratio on that day is relatively high. &quot;Hurry up.&quot; &quot;Reduce&quot; is because after the matching donation starts, the amount of matching donation will be smaller as the time goes by, until the matching donation quota for the day is completely used up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At around 19:00 on September 7, &quot;9958 Platform Development Department-Xu Jiawen&quot; released statistical results in the group. On that day, the fourth project raised more than 82.44 million yuan and received allocation. Donated more than 5.61 million yuan. The Shijiazhuang team raised a total of more than 29.64 million yuan (including 1.82 million yuan in matching donations), ranking first among the 17 local teams; the Tai&#39;an team raised a total of 19.51 million yuan (including 1.16 million yuan in matching donations), ranking second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 23, Southern Weekend reporters called the mobile phone numbers reserved by Cao Lifang and Jia Zhen on the public platform, but no one answered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6e635b278e.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;717&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/6e635b278e.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251853&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, the fundraising rankings of various local teams were released in the &quot;Core Personnel of the National Branch Centers of the Four National Branches of the Children&#39;s Charity Project&quot; group. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; Volunteers&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”, execution fees, fundraising rankings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than 80 million yuan raised in one day, confirming the success of Erci In recent years, it has left people with the impression that it has super fundraising capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Public financial reports show that 714 million yuan in donations will flow into the Children&#39;s Charity Association in 2022; this number will be 838 million yuan in 2021 and 838 million yuan in 2020.

This means that the higher the amount raised by an organization, the more matching donations it will receive from the platform, and the more incentives it will ultimately receive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, during periods other than matching donations, each fundraising organization can receive up to 2 million yuan in unrestricted donations as incentives. This part of the incentive payment is first come, first served, and the institution does not have to use it for project execution. At around 15:30 on September 7, Xu Jiawen informed everyone in the group: &quot;The backstage non-matching rewards have reached 2 million (ten thousand), and no new incentives will be obtained.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this matching donation controversy, The Children&#39;s Charity Association stated that it has never entrusted Ke Mouxiao to personally raise funds for the 9958 project. Ke Mouxiao is not a staff member of the association, but a volunteer of the 9958 Langfang team cooperation organization. However, Wang Qiang and the above-mentioned charity people said that this kind of personnel cooperation mechanism is common in the Children&#39;s Charity Society. Many people who organize fund-raising in the name of &quot;9958 staff&quot; are not official staff of the Children&#39;s Charity Society, but they are raising funds Although he has greater authority, he is also under the pressure of fundraising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters that after he joined a local 9958 team as a staff member, he did not sign a labor or labor contract with the Children&#39;s Benevolent Society or the local 9958 rescue center. He said that his usual salary is paid by local non-governmental organizations or enterprises, and the same is true for his colleagues around him. In a sense, Wang Qiang&#39;s identity is the same as Ke Mouxiao, and he is also a &quot;volunteer&quot;, but in external publicity, he is called the operations specialist of the 9958 team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Wang Qiang cannot be considered a volunteer in the strict sense. According to the &quot;Volunteer Service Regulations&quot;, volunteer services should follow the principle of free payment. Some legal scholars once suggested that the behavior of raising funds for patients and collecting execution fees is more like the professional fundraisers commonly seen in foreign charitable relief. It is only because the current domestic fundraising system is imperfect that all parties call this group &quot;volunteers&quot; &quot;. (For details, see Southern Weekend’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/203083&quot;>;Suspicions about “matching donations” among “fundraising volunteers”&lt;/a>;”)&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; During the several years of working in 9958, Wang Qiang felt that he was &quot;like a businessman.&quot; If you only do your job, your monthly income will not exceed 4,000 yuan. If you want a higher income, you need to find more families with seriously ill children and help them raise funds publicly on several Internet platforms as &quot;volunteers.&quot; Wang Qiang described the fundraising link as an &quot;online project&quot; and claimed that he could get an execution fee of 3% or more of the total fundraising amount, but he did not produce a transfer voucher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with public donations without specific beneficiaries, parents of seriously ill children have a stronger motivation to raise funds and can help &quot;volunteers&quot; reach their fundraising goals faster. In fact, Ke Mouxiao himself may be a parent of children with serious illnesses. Information about his fundraising for children with blood cancer in 2021 can be found on the Internet, as well as bank statement receipts in which he is the payee and a charity organization is the payer. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Some parents are so pitiful that they will kneel down and beg you for a fundraising project.&quot; Wang Qiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even different teams will compete for &quot;business&quot;. The aforementioned charity worker who worked at 9958 told Southern Weekend reporters that he had previously worked with a seriously ill child in a cancer hospital and had collected the child’s information and was preparing to take photos of the child, write fundraising copy, and upload it to the Internet the next day. , &quot;As a result, the parents refused to let me take the photo the next day, and asked me for a letter of authorization (for the agency) to publicly use the child&#39;s photos before I left. Later I found out that someone from another team had snatched the child away.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9958 will also conduct internal team fundraising rankings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 20, 2023, the group nickname was &quot;9958 New Media~Sun Shuo&quot; (the annual report showed that the name and position were &quot;9958 Rescue Center&quot; &quot;Project Officer&quot;) published in the work group the ranking of the amount of funds raised by teams from various regions on the Kuaishou platform from August 11 to August 18: the Beijing team raised 51,000 yuan, the Guiyang team raised 5,320 yuan, and the Anhui team raised 5,320 yuan.

Xu Jiawen reported the data of the 9958 project in the group over the past three days: the total fundraising received in the three days exceeded 134 million yuan, and the total matching donations received exceeded 11.81 million yuan. She also attached a ranking chart of the total fundraising of each local team from high to low: the Shijiazhuang team ranked first, raising more than 36.4 million yuan; the Tai&#39;an team ranked second, raising more than 28.04 million yuan; the Weinan team ranked third, Raising more than 27.36 million yuan; Shanxi team ranked fourth, raising more than 20.74 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Thank you to all the teachers for their efforts during the event. Teachers have worked hard.&quot; Xu Jiawen said in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters were unable to obtain the list of local teams established by 9958 through public channels. However, according to the above chat records, there are at least Shijiazhuang, Tai&#39;an, Shanxi, Guangdong, There are 17 teams in Shanghai, Weinan, Qingdao, Lanzhou and Baoding. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Vague information disclosure&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How the funds raised by the Children’s Aid Society from the many projects of 9958 will be used. According to regulations, it needs to be disclosed, but it is open to the public. To varying degrees. The death of female college student Wu Huayan in 2020 once plunged 9958 into controversy over insufficient information disclosure and over-age rescue. (For details, see Southern Weekend’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/174760?source=131&quot;>;&quot;Wu Huayan&#39;s death&quot; triggers reflection by public welfare individuals&lt;/a>;&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The disclosure of vague project information has created convenience for donations and matching funds to return to the hands of Li Shan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Take the projects Li Shan participated in as an example. Among the three projects that Li Shan &quot;donated&quot; under the organization of the 9958 Tai&#39;an team, &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot; and &quot;Guarantee Plan for Girls in Distress&quot; have not yet entered the implementation disclosure period, and &quot;Assisting Children in Distress to Go to School Dream&quot; (referred to as &quot;School Dream&quot; ) project has been established for nearly two years, and it has disclosed several aspects such as project progress and finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The information disclosure of public welfare projects is related to their own scope of assistance. For example, medical assistance projects should disclose the list of recipients, types of diseases, and information about medical institutions. and rescue standards. However, there are contradictions between the existing public information of &quot;School Dream&quot; and its own purpose of assistance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The project introduction states, &quot;A donation of 10 yuan can support a child to buy a set of school supplies. A donation of 50 yuan can support part of a child&#39;s living expenses. &quot;. However, its 2022 financial disclosure details stated that the more than 2.06 million yuan allocated to recipients were all medical subsidies for recipients, and the corresponding living allowance was not announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The student aid program provides tuition fees, which are usually recorded as &#39;living allowances&#39; in financial terms, unless the children being rescued need medical treatment at the same time.&quot; Enyou Finance co-founder Zhou Zaoying found it difficult to understand the problems with this detailed list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;School Dream&quot; has disclosed the financial expenditure invoices for 2022 on the Tencent Charity Platform. In June, October and December, the Children&#39;s Association will realize the dream in Tai&#39;an City The Public Welfare Development Center (referred to as Tai&#39;an Dream Realization) allocated 3.39 million yuan, 1.63 million yuan, and 270,000 yuan respectively, and indicated that nearly 1.292 million yuan came from the &quot;School Dream&quot; project.儿慈会2022年审计报告也显示，泰安圆梦作为“大额支付对象”，接收了中华儿慈会一笔128.7万元的救助活动费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但“上学梦”公开介绍的执行方是9958北京向阳组救助中心，南方周末记者并未发现泰安圆梦与之存在公开业务关联。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;儿慈会拨给泰安圆梦的发票信息显示，泰安圆梦的复核人与收款人都是李蒙蒙。根据泰安圆梦2022年年报，李蒙蒙是机构的理事长，游国保是行政负责人。按9958微信公众号发布的内容，上述二人同时也是9958泰安团队的主任。南方周末记者还发现，李蒙蒙的微信昵称、头像与上述儿慈会工作群中“泰安团队蒙蒙”的一致。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月23日，南方周末记者拨通了李蒙蒙的电话，对方称不接受采访，拒绝透露这笔拨款具体的性质和去向。南方周末记者拨打了儿慈会平台部、传播部和儿童紧急救助的热线电话，均无法接通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“李蒙蒙作为9958泰安团队的主任募集了资金，同时也作为泰安圆梦的法人代表执行这个项目，从乐观的角度说，&#39;上学梦&#39;是一个全国性的公益项目，她如果熟悉泰安的情况，在当地可以执行得更高效。”周早英说。但从悲观的角度来看，“项目不够公开、难以解释的信息，可能导致公众对公益行业的信任危机”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/7a90c82ab7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/7a90c82ab7.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“捐赠必须是自愿、无偿的，如果家长以返还捐款、获取配捐资金为前提，往公益项目里投钱，就连捐赠都算不上。”上海复恩社会组织法律研究与服务中心理事长陆璇向南方周末记者解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有观点认为，一些大病患儿家长也是需要公益救助的对象，以自捐自用的方式套取配捐资金无可厚非。但陆璇不这样看。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“非常恶劣。”陆璇分析，慈善组织的公益性决定它的使命宗旨是要帮助社会中不特定的对象。项目工作人员如果鼓励大病患儿家长往项目里捐钱才安排拨款，就成了帮助“特定对象”，除了构成违反诚实信用原则的套捐行为之外，也违背了一个慈善组织的公益性，不符合慈善法规定的项目受益人选择应遵循的“公开、公平、公正”原则。这可能让更需要救助的困难人群得不到救助资金，也让慈善组织的整体社会评价受到贬损。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;北京师范大学法学院副教授马剑银同样不认为“先往公益项目投钱，再从基金会拿钱”的行为属于捐赠。 “这是为了套取配捐而进行的虚假捐赠，如果证据链完整，就是一种&#39;骗捐&#39;。”马剑银分析，这个行为中被骗者是拿出资金来进行配捐的主体，“他们可以向组织方追究责任，也可以向民政部门举报。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;需要找公益机构求助的大病患儿家长往往收入有限，也不具备强有力的社会关系，可能是社会中的弱势群体。一位研究社会组织的法律专家向南方周末记者分析，这一群体如果得知可以通过机构做“套捐”，会有非常强的参与动力，“因为会觉得自己是受益人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但这种行为会伤害更多潜在的、同样需要帮扶的对象，让其他困难群体得不到本可能属于他们的公众支持。另外，也会使资源本就匮乏的公益机构难以发展。业内普遍呼吁，慈善募捐应该坚持募、用分离。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月4日，曹丽芳曾把一份名为《儿慈会99公益日自律公约》的文件发到上述工作群中，并要求各团队负责人签字、按手印。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这份自律公约第七条写道，“杜绝任何形式的套取配捐行为”。如有违反，“将承担因此产生的所有责任及后果，接受中华儿慈会对此的一切处理”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“发了内部规定，机构就没有管理责任了吗？”陆璇分析，即便各地团队的工作人员与9958不存在直接的劳动或者劳务关系，但这些人实际上已经为9958提供了服务。通过机构间的资金往来，可证明几个主体之间存在一定的合同关系。 “如果9958的地方团队犯了错，到头来只是让地方团队自己承担责任，说不过去。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;前一天，一架F-35B“闪电”II型联合攻击战斗机在例行演练中突发事故，飞行员在紧急情况下选择弹射逃生。此后，该战机以“僵尸状态”继续飞行，并在南卡罗来纳州上空失联。为了找回失踪的F-35B战机，美国多军种和多部门联合出动，并在社交媒体上发布“寻机启事”，向民众公开征集线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一起大规模寻找战机的离奇事件在网上引发热议，不少人觉得不可思议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南卡罗来纳州联邦众议员南希·梅斯在社交媒体质问：“怎么搞的，你们怎么弄丢一架F-35？为什么会没有追踪设备？还得请求民众帮忙找到战机并上交？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“空军训练基地一般建立在城市郊区，雷达部署不可能面面俱到，当飞机失速后处于较低飞行高度时，雷达探测不到目标并不罕见。更何况F-35B战斗机具有出色的隐身功能，其雷达反射面积极小。”前海军军官王群怀告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，战斗机在无人状态下自行飞走并不是没有先例，曾有战机在脱离驾驶员掌控后长途飞行近千公里，直到燃料用尽后在异国坠毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“战机去哪儿了”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“如果你有任何可以帮助我们找到F-35战机的线索，请致电基地防御行动中心。”当地时间2023年9月18日，美国查尔斯顿联合基地在社交平台上发布了一则“寻机启事”，引发舆论关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失踪的战斗机隶属于美国海军陆战队第二航空联队第501战斗机攻击训练中队，该中队主要负责飞行员训练。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月17日下午，一名美军飞行员驾驶F-35B“闪电”Ⅱ型战斗机，从查尔斯顿联合基地起飞，执行训练任务。但不久后，战机突然出现意外事故，飞行员在生死关头选择弹射逃生。下午2时左右，该飞行员在被查尔斯顿社区安全落地，随后被送往医院，但其所驾驶的F-35B却下落不明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;查尔斯顿联合基地一名发言人告诉美国全国广播公司，飞行员弹射跳伞后，战机处于自动驾驶模式，使得追踪变得更加复杂。法新社报道称，该战机将以所谓“僵尸状态”继续飞行，直至坠落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，事发时另有一架F-35战机伴随飞行。但飞行员并未继续跟踪无人驾驶飞机的踪迹，而是选择返回基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;战机失联后，美国军方迅速联合海军陆战队、海军以及美国联邦航空局、民用空中巡逻队和南卡罗来纳州当地执法部门，围绕北查尔斯顿市以北的莫尔特里湖和马里恩湖一带，从空中和地面展开立体搜索。 9月18日傍晚时分，数架搜寻飞机在威廉斯堡县斯塔基镇附近一片树林和农田地区盘旋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天一夜的搜寻过后，美国海军陆战队发言人证实，在威廉斯堡县一片田野中找到了F-35B战机残骸。坠机地点距离查尔斯顿联合基地约129公里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“F-35B兼具隐身、短距起飞、垂直降落等诸多优点，具有高水平的通用性和互操作性，是世界上最先进、最受欢迎的战斗机之一。”英国知名防务媒体网站“谢泼德传媒”评价称。但就是这样一款被誉为“未来空战主力杀手”的先进战机，却在美国掀起了一场“战机去哪儿了”的网络群嘲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国广播公司新闻撰稿人、退休上校史蒂夫·甘亚德吐槽说，“尽管它是一架隐形飞机，但如此昂贵、如此复杂的飞机竟然会消失，这确实很荒谬。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“雷达捕获隐身战机其实并没有人们想象中那么容易。”王群怀指出，一方面，对空警戒雷达仰角偏高，发射的电磁波基本上是直线传播，战机要飞到足够高度才能被有效识别；另一方面，F-35B战机最高飞行速度最高可达每小时上千公里，几分钟就可以飞行上百公里，一旦应答器失去作用，雷达基本上看不见，就只能靠肉眼搜索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;F-35战机加装有龙勃透镜，王群怀表示，这就是为了故意增大反射信号，在降落时便于被空管雷达发现，“当然在需要隐身飞行时，龙勃透镜会被收起”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，美国军方将该事故认定为严重等级最高的A级事故，但并未透露涉事飞行员的名字，也没有公布事故发生的原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，这不是F35-B战机第一次发生A级事故。四个月前，驻日美军一架F-35B战斗机在飞行训练中发生零部件脱落，该战机随后返回岩国基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;米格-23横穿欧洲&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;先进战机的离奇失踪让人诧异，但这并不是史上头一遭。三十多年前米格-23战机的“僵尸飞行”经历，比F-35B更为传奇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1989年，横亘在东、西德之间的柏林墙仍然高高伫立，以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织和以苏联为首的华沙条约组织在欧洲紧张对峙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据公开记载，7月4日早晨，刚刚结束休假的尼古拉·斯库里丁上校像往常一样坐上米格-23战斗机，从波兰科沃布热格附近的巴吉兹空军基地起飞。对于这位驾驶经验丰富的飞行员而言，这不过是极为寻常的一次飞行训练，没想到这一天会被载入世界航空史。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当斯库里丁驾驶飞机爬升至150米高度时，他突然发现发动机加力燃烧室推力骤减，意识到飞机开始下坠的斯库里丁立即向地面指挥中心报告了发动机故障问题。在接到塔台弃机跳伞的指令后，他果断按下紧急抛盖按钮，米格-23战斗机座舱盖脱离机身，斯库里丁被安全弹射出座舱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但出人意料的是，这架无人驾驶的米格-23战斗机并未如预想中那样葬身波罗的海，反而在弹射作用下突然抬起头向上爬升，并很快恢复了正常飞行姿态，从波兰北部上空向西飞去，并横跨当时的民主德国（东德）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管驻扎在波兰境内的防空雷达识别出了该战机，但误以为是常规训练，其飞行轨迹并未受到干扰。不到半个小时，米格-23战斗机进入联邦德国（西德）境内，被北约部署在汉堡的警戒雷达发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北约军事指挥部在收到警报后，紧急出动驻扎在荷兰境内的两架美国F-15战斗机进行拦截。与美国战机的严阵以待相比，这架米格-23战斗机没有做出任何规避动作，保持着既有速度平稳飞行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当已做好空战准备的美国飞行员逼近米格-23战斗机时，他们发现该战机没有座舱盖，也没有飞行员，更没有携带弹药。于是，北约军事指挥部解除拦截指令，命令两架F-15战机尾随米格-23战机。随后，米格-23战机一路西行飞跃荷兰领空，并进入比利时。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地时间上午10时30分，在距离比利时首都80公里处，油料耗尽的米格-23战斗机坠落在比利时西部科特赖克贝勒海姆镇一所民宅，在家中睡觉的19岁少年维姆·德拉尔不幸遇难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而此时，苏联正在波罗的海寻找米格-23战斗机的残骸。直到看到西方媒体的报道，苏联才知晓自己的战机在无人驾驶状态下继续飞行了79分钟，跋涉逾900公里，横穿波兰、民主德国、联邦德国、荷兰以及比利时五国，最终在比利时坠毁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月6日，比利时就飞机坠毁事件向苏联提出抗议。最终，苏联向比利时支付了约62.5万欧元的赔偿金，其中大部分补偿给德拉尔的家人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;玉米田轰炸机&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”绝地逢&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;生&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;美国俄亥俄州代顿市是飞机发明者莱特兄弟的故乡，这里有着世界上历史最悠久、规模最大的军事航空博物馆——美国空军博物馆。据官网介绍，该博物馆收藏着自一战以来的约400架航空航天飞行器。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在美国空军博物馆展出的各类飞机中，其中一架采用大三角翼设计、机身呈蜂腰型的F-106战斗机似乎并不显眼。但其劫后余生的传奇经历，被一代又一代的美国飞行员口口相传，他们将其视为幸运战机，并亲昵地称它为“玉米田轰炸机”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1970年2月2日，飞行员加里·福斯特中尉驾驶着这架尾号为580787的F-106战斗机腾空而起。与此同时，另有3架F-106伴随起飞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是发生在美国蒙大拿州马尔姆斯特罗姆空军基地的一次例行战术对抗训练。按照原计划，福斯特中尉将和其中一名飞行员组成一队，和另外两架F-106战机展开对等空战演练。不过，由于其中一架飞机阻力伞出现问题，原定的双机对抗项目变成了一场“一对二”的“战斗”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但当福斯特中尉驾驶F-106战斗机快速升至万米高空时，战斗机突然失速陷入极其危险的水平旋转状态，随后急速下降至约3657米高度。福斯特多次尝试旋转恢复程序，但均未成功，随后将自己弹射出飞机驾驶舱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于飞行员弹射后导致战机重量减轻，重心发生变化，再加上座椅冲出飞机的爆炸力将飞机的机头向下推，F-106战斗机摆脱了旋转，在无人控制的情况下进入稳定滑翔状态，以每小时三百多公里的速度平稳直线飞行。而这正好是F-106战机正常状态下进行着陆的进近速度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;挂在降落伞上的福斯特只能眼睁睁看着自己的座机越飞越远。随后，他降落在附近山区里，被当地居民&lt;span>;用雪地摩托&lt;/span>;救了出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而他所驾驶的F-106战斗机则在飞行一段距离后，安全着陆在蒙大拿州大桑迪附近的一片玉米田，它甚至在滑行过程中完美绕开了田地中央的岩石堆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当地警方赶到降落点时，飞机发动机仍在正常运转，雷达还保持扫射状态。一小时四十五分钟后，F-106战斗机燃料耗尽，发动机自动熄火。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后，加利福尼亚州麦克莱伦空军基地后勤中心的技术人员抵达现场，他们惊讶地发现除了机腹几米长的擦伤外，整个战机受损程度很小。一名救援官员甚至表示，如果损坏程度再轻一点，他就会直接驾驶该战机返回基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在王群怀看来，有人战机在无人操控的情况下自行降落是万中无一的事，基本很难实现。 “飞机降落是飞行中最危险的环节之一，需要通过减速和下降来保持合适的速度和高度，还要调整机身姿态和推力来适应跑道位置和气流情况，任何一个环节出现问题，都可能对飞机降落造成威胁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过“战争历史在线”网站称，地面上厚厚的积雪为战机轻盈着陆提供了缓冲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;F-106战机被运回加利福尼亚州后，空军工作人员对其进行修复，该战机后续又重新投入使用。 1979年，福斯特再次驾驶这架战机飞上蓝天，在佛罗里达州廷德尔空军基地参与训练。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1986年8月，这架编号为580787的F-106战机退役，随后被捐赠给美国空军博物馆。几年后，F-106战机全部从美国军队退役，并于21世纪初彻底告别历史舞台。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;视频一开始是两段话的剪接。第一段是他16岁时对父母的喊话：“本来最希望我留在北京的是你们，你们应该为此（买房）努力”。第二段是他现在说“生活上我已经很满足了，也没有什么欲望。如果我真需要什么的话，给我爸打个电话就好了，他们还欠着我一套北京的房子，到现在也该值一千多万了，（记者：他们愿意给你吗？）不愿意又怎么样，不愿意也得愿意”，然后露齿而笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;剪接的意图有些明显。果不其然，看了之后许多人对张炘炀的言论与价值观大加挞伐。随着讨论深入，越来越多的人发现事情有很多的秘辛，对他则多了一份同情与扼腕长叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在采访中，记者问他是不是神童，他说不是，显得很谦虚。不过，记者问他智商是什么样子的，跟韦神、柳智宇比如何，他说140左右，“应该是同一水平，比他们稍稍低一点”，对自己的智力还是非常自信的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张炘炀究竟是不是神童？我认为是的。他从小就显示出了过人的智力天赋，随后不断跳级，10岁就考上了大学，但考分只能上二本。而他的父亲似乎有一个执念，太希望证明儿子是神童，太希望儿子维持神童的人设，居然不同意他复读以上一个985大学，似乎晚一年上大学，这神童的光彩就暗淡了、这人设就保不住了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;记者问“假如你不是这么小就考大学，你有没有可能考到清华北大”，他答“可能性不大，恰恰是因为按照我这个智力，就即使在一个理想状态下，大概率也就是一个985高校”。这个回答非常谦虚。他如果晚几年等到心智更成熟时再高考，考上清华北大应是可能的或者去中科大少年班也是很好的选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，这样才可以让自己的知识体系更完备、更扎实，才有可能考得更好。其次，智商高，在知识上可以较同龄人高出一大截，但对世事与人性的理解及社会化生存技能一般没法提前习得，只能随着年龄增长逐步增进，这不仅对人际关系与个人心理健康至关重要，对高考来说也并非无关因素。比如高考作文要写好得有这方面的体悟，10岁的孩子智商再高，社会化程度与跟其他18岁的同学没法比，很难写出高分作文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张炘炀，10岁读大学，上的天津工程师范学院；13岁读硕士，上的是北京工业大学；16岁读博士，上的是北京航空航天大学。本科学校挺负责任，对他着重培养，导师帮他联系德国学校读研，“他们可能对天才的培养要比我们更好一些”，因为德国学校规定14岁才能独自上学，“我们就劝他父亲（等一年）”，但似乎在他父亲看来，等一年会导致神童失格，坚持要让他大三后直接读研。试想，要是张炘炀14岁时去了德国，人生道路会完全不一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后要求父母买房+16岁读博士在2011年闹得沸沸扬扬，他父亲要求他毕业后留在北京，所以他反要求父母买房，“本来最希望我留在北京的是你们，你们应该为此（买房）努力”让舆论哗然，大家觉得一个天才思想境界怎么这么低呢。说出这话，反映张炘炀对世情人性的理解不及他的智力。提出反要求，其实是他对父亲过度操控他人生的一种反叛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自此以后，对父亲作为的反弹、反叛与反噬一发不可收拾，8年才读完了博士。如果他有足够动机的话，恐怕早就读完了。对父亲的怨恨及心态上的放弃与躺平，令他失去了上进的动机，这是张炘炀本人的悲剧，也是一个家庭的悲剧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，张炘炀这样说：“12年前我热衷北京的户口房子，现在完全反过来了，就是我完全没有买房的想法了，无业无房无贷一身轻不好吗？你以为房本上的名字是你的，这房子就真的是你的家吗？”躺平与激愤的心态一览无余。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他在采访中控诉父亲对他的极度控制，并表达将来如何培养自己的孩子：“我轻易不要孩子，一旦决定要了，一辈子资助到底，只要不违反国家法律，他愿意做什么就做什么，他如果强烈表现出我当时的表现，那我也会让他走这条路的。”这与其说是展望未来，倒不如说是对他父亲的控诉，及对心目中理想父亲的画像。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张炘炀的博导张耀辉曾说过：张炘炀确实是他学生里面成绩最好的一个，但是他的升学太快了，导致他的心智和心理都不是太成熟，如果他可以定下心来做学问，在某一个领域肯下苦功，那么将来肯定会有很大的成就。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张耀辉觉得张炘炀受到了太多挫折，很是怜悯，并给出一个忠告：“这个年纪不能再犹豫了，该干啥要决断。如果不干別的，就把（数学）这个大问题解决了。假如江郎才尽，那可以去做生意，说不定也能闯出片天来，千万不要躺平。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题是，张炘炀超高的智商仍在，但那股心劲儿不见了。人是意义的动物，没有精气神，就好比失去灵魂。希望张炘炀能放下过往的一切不堪，找回自己的存在意义，重新激发出强劲的动机来，有所作为，不枉费自己的天赋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时也希望天下的父母给孩子自由成长的空间，怵惕那种病态的控制心。孩子是天才也好，众人也好，每一个孩子都有他来到这个世界的意义，别过度干预与操控。唯有如此，孩子的人格与灵魂才不会受到伤害，才会焕发出应有的美丽光环。 &lt;/p>;

They are halls and places for worshiping ancestors, worshiping gods, or establishing images of meritorious sages. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ancestral halls first appeared in the Warring States Period. In the Han Dynasty, they were only tomb temples. From the Wei and Jin Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, family ancestral halls appeared in the Song Dynasty, and after the Yuan Dynasty, ancestral halls for worshiping ancestors appeared.
