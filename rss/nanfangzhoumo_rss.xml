Many students are feeling unwell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After preliminary investigation, the school’s student Yang Moumou (&lt;span>;female, 13 years old&lt;/span>;) and his classmate Zheng Moumou (female, 13 years old) took advantage of the physical education class that morning. Returning to the classroom, he poured the cleaning and bleaching mixture into the water cups of his classmates, causing many students to become uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant students were sent to the hospital for treatment and were discharged that night and have now resumed normal classes. Currently, the police are working with the education department to conduct further investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/04bed165965be3c00268163257c169f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/14/04bed165965be3c00268163257c169f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250759&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当买不起LV包的年轻人入手了百元高奢包装袋]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256534]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/12/3075a924c16abd1190831eba2b7d2279.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/12/3075a924c16abd1190831eba2b7d2279.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250402&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo/图）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wearing the latest Chanel jacket, putting on a collector’s edition Cartier watch, picking up the Hermès “Dream Love Bag”, and feeling the refreshing fragrance of Guerlain perfume, it was officially Stepping out of the house - this is the &quot;luxury&lt;/span>;urban dream&quot; in the hearts of countless boys and girls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, a post &quot;Zhejiang people spend 1.8 billion a year on Chanel&quot; sparked heated discussion. Sales of the Chanel store in Hangzhou Tower reached 1.8 billion yuan last year. Many luxury goods, including Chanel, are advertised as &quot;rich&quot;. Netizens joked: &quot;Poverty limits my imagination. There are so many rich people, why can&#39;t there be one more for me?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“There are not many people in ordinary shopping malls, but there are long queues in luxury stores.” Many netizens have this feeling about luxury stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking across the country, whether in Beijing, Shanghai, or other cities, the stores of luxury brands such as Hermès, Chanel, and Gucci are often overcrowded. When new products are released, they are comparable to large-scale &quot;ticket check-in&quot; scenes, which are different from ordinary stores. Compared with the twos and threes of customers in the brand store, it can be described as a world of ice and fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China’s luxury craze: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Thousand-layer tricks to attract attention and attract money&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Luxury goods are recognized internationally It is defined as &quot;a kind of consumer goods that are unique, scarce, rare and beyond the scope of people&#39;s survival and development needs&quot;, also known as non-living necessities. However, the sluggish consumption environment does not seem to affect the enthusiasm of &quot;die-hard fans&quot; for this &quot;non-necessities of life&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, a Louis Vuitton handbag&lt;/span>; sells for 17,000 yuan in France and 24,000 yuan in mainland China. Yuan. In addition to the long queues outside the store, a group of people silently opened the page of the overseas purchasing platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an important force in the world’s luxury consumption, the Chinese market is indispensable for brand expansion. The &quot;2022 China Luxury Goods Report&quot; shows that Chinese luxury goods market sales will reach 956 billion yuan in 2022, a slight decrease of 4% year-on-year, accounting for 38% of the global luxury goods market. Its importance can be imagined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only are they expensive, the prices of luxury goods are also soaring. In November last year, Chanel raised the prices of all products by 3% to 11%. According to statistics from the fashion website Purse&lt;span>;Bop, the average annual increase for low-end luxury goods is about 4%, and that for high-end luxury goods is between 15% and 18%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although prices are &quot;rising and rising&quot;, they cannot resist the enthusiasm of buyers, and snapping up luxury goods has become a highly sought-after fashion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/3e55eb820dad92ee5310bf926fa491c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2831&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/3e55eb820dad92ee5310bf926fa491c8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250401 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Behind the &quot;pursuit of luxury&quot; is the multi-pronged strategy of &quot;attracting attention&quot; and &quot;attracting money&quot; created by luxury brands&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the popularity of the &quot;Metaverse&quot; concept, many brands have turned their attention to this new way of playing. Gucci once cooperated with the gaming platform Roblox to open a Gucci pop-up store and launched a digital version of the Gucci Bacchus bag, which was sold for US$4,100, US$700 higher than the physical bag. Balenciaga also makes virtual costumes for multiple characters in the game &quot;Fortnite&quot;, and players can wear &quot;genuine skins&quot; for $8. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“It’s not money that is wasted. If you can’t afford it in real life, just enjoy it in the game.” Ronaldinho, a senior gamer, talked about his views on buying “skins” mentioned at the time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Not only that, brands such as Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Burberry have all tested the &quot;Metaverse&quot;. This wave of operations inevitably led to ridicule from netizens: &quot;The leeks in reality&lt;/span>; are endless, and we have to cut the leeks in the &#39;metaverse&#39; again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Breaking the consumption dimension wall is not enough, &quot;it is economical&quot; Luxury goods are also indispensable for the hot trend. As the saying goes, &quot;pampering comes with the owner,&quot; many cats and dogs enjoy a luxurious cat/dog life under the &quot;absolute love&quot; of their owners. A traction rope worth 5,000 yuan, a pet carrying case worth 20,000 yuan, a pet bed worth 17,000 yuan... The pet products launched by Hermès focus on &quot;gold and preciousness&quot;, &quot;These days, dogs are richer than me.&quot; Pet. Zhu Xiaofang commented on social media, &quot;Why are even pets involved? I cried.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /09/12/11101fec82b3cfae0de0403e6b42fd04.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/12/11101fec82b3cfae0de0403e6b42fd04.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250405&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, luxury brands will not let go of any potential consumers. In addition to traditional items such as bags, clothing, and jewelry, small items such as mobile phone cases, earphone cases, and keychains are also quietly emerging. A certain grassroots blogger wrote on Xiaohongshu: &quot;Can&#39;t afford a five-figure Louis Vuitton bag, and also can&#39;t afford peripherals? Go, go, go!&quot; I don&#39;t know how many buyers were attracted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking through the catalogs of luxury brands, you can also see many novel products: coffins, body bags... rich in styles and expensive. Netizens&#39; imaginations ran wild: &quot;Is this the &lt;span>;legendary &#39;die gracefully&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/09/12/d79f42d88a980d5c9755b3b6e5f06bec.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;808&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/09/12/d79f42d88a980d5c9755b3b6e5f06bec.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250403&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>; (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;IC pho&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;to / picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Young people play high-end luxury: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Second-hand buying and selling , Big-name samples&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The level of luxury goods consumption is inseparable from the city&#39;s economic strength. The &quot;2019 Luxury Goods Industry Insight Report&quot; shows that Beijing and Shanghai ranked first and second respectively in the ranking of cities with luxury goods consumption levels in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 53 Hermès stores across the country, excluding a total of 20 stores in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, Beijing and Shanghai have 5 stores each, accounting for nearly 1/3 of the number of stores in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among these buyers, high-net-worth groups (mainland Chinese with assets of tens of millions of yuan) are the &quot;top-tier&quot; consumers. They and &quot;luxury goods&quot; are like the best partners going both ways. However, nowadays, luxury consumers are not just traditional &quot;high-end buyers&quot;, but also a huge number of young people who can become buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report shows that the post-90s generation in China’s luxury goods market has become the main force in luxury goods consumption, accounting for 50% of the overall market consumer population. At the same time, Bain Luxury Research Report has predicted that by 2025, Millennials and consumers under the age of 25 will become the main force in the luxury consumer market, accounting for 65% to 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As young people with potential, luxury brands have made a lot of efforts in digital marketing to reach them - 68% of young people will be &quot;planted&quot; by content posted by celebrities or bloggers , and then generate purchasing behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/e5c0fce6c515d725e8f04f8432c32e6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4537&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/e5c0fce6c515d725e8f04f8432c32e6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250409&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, not all young people have amazing financial resources. Young buyers can also enjoy luxury goods by buying second-hand goods with &quot;exquisite poverty&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;China&#39;s Second-hand Luxury Goods Industry Overview 2021&quot; shows that more than half of second-hand luxury goods consumers are under 30 years old, and the reasons for more than half of consumers&lt;/span>;&#39;s purchases The price is lower than new products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buy and sell, sell and buy, &quot;out-of-print&quot; goods on the market can be found second-hand, and both parties enjoy the joy of luxury goods circulation in the transaction. According to statistics, more than half of the users in the market choose to &quot;buy and sell at the same time&quot;, and there is a significant trend of &quot;integration of buying and selling&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 Circular Fashion Industry Trend Report&quot; shows that the domestic second-hand luxury goods market reached 17.3 billion yuan in 2020, and is expected to reach 38.4 billion yuan in 2025. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Buyers hunt for goods in a variety of categories, mainly in the fields of luggage and leather goods, clothing, shoes and hats, high-end watches and jewelry accessories. Due to the wide audience and high value retention, luggage Leather goods have become the first choice for second-hand luxury goods consumers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Facing high-end luxury cosmetics that are easy to wear, there is a more affordable &quot;big brand sample&quot; method. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“You can enjoy big-name brands at a two- or three-digit price, why not?” Xiaotian, a junior student, is a makeup novice and works with many beauty experts. Similarly, she has collected all kinds of big-name foundations, lipsticks, perfumes, and skin care products. The only difference is that hers are all &quot;samples&quot;: &quot;I don&#39;t wear makeup more than ten times a month. It&#39;s a waste to buy formal clothes. Worry about being cheap, big brands will feel more at ease.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Driven by the huge consumer market, businesses have sensed business opportunities. Not only are &quot;samples&quot; sold individually, but repackaged versions of big-name cosmetics are also highly sought after. On the e-commerce platform, the official price of 100ml of Chanel Gabrielle Natural Perfume is about 1,690 yuan, and its 10ml &quot;sample&quot; only costs about 130 yuan. However, most of these products are sold by stores named &quot;XX Purchasing Agency&quot; or other stores whose legitimacy is difficult to judge. The products are mixed and it is difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/395ada715de24f8838c649ee3df1a1a7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1074&quot; height=&quot;3659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/395ada715de24f8838c649ee3df1a1a7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250408&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, there is also the method of &quot;making the most of everything&lt;/span>;&quot; that was once popular. Platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu have launched a trend of packaging reform. Some bloggers have transformed packaging bags or packaging boxes with brand logos into tissue boxes, jewelry boxes, and take-out bags, which has quickly accelerated the purchasing trend of luxury packaging. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Currently, there are still many people selling luxury goods packaging on Xianyu, ranging from tens of yuan to hundreds of yuan, and there is an endless stream of people coming to inquire. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/81d34f1a3f06b0fefb0cfdf0094fee02.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/81d34f1a3f06b0fefb0cfdf0094fee02.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250406 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;IC photo / picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;&lt;strong>;Luxury goods controversy:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;The quality of genuine products is worrying, and the fake rate reaches 80%&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;No&lt;/span>; However, luxury goods remain The public&#39;s impression is not only that it is expensive, but also a product that is deeply involved in controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, almost every year, the Internet takes turns to ridicule the &quot;legendary&quot; items launched by certain luxury goods. For example, the &quot;woven bag for moving&quot; that appeared in the fashion week, the sneakers covered with green grass, the same fake bangs of the &quot;Buried Love Family&quot;, and the hole-in-the-wall umbrella that &quot;shelters from rain and loneliness&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the designer did it intentionally or not, the marketing effect is so good that even if the whole network complains, it cannot stop a group of people from secretly placing orders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, luxury shopping has been described by various bloggers as a &quot;magical&quot; experience. &quot;Wearing cheap clothes and being looked down upon after entering the store&quot; &quot;The shopkeeper looks down on ordinary people&quot;...Such shopping reviews are flooded with short video platforms, and the amplification of the Internet has made many people fear luxury stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the quality of luxury goods has been criticized. In February this year, Ms. Zhang from Fujian spent 20,000 yuan to buy a Chanel handbag while traveling in Chengdu. However, the chain broke after just 15 minutes of carrying it. Such problems are common, and there are endless complaints about luxury goods on the Black Cat complaint platform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is a widely circulated joke on the Internet: If&lt;/span>; the luxury bag you buy has problems such as fading, there is no doubt that it must be genuine. It is particularly strong and wear-resistant, so be careful as it may be a fake. &quot;Key customer data&quot; shows that in channels other than the brand&#39;s official channels, the rate of fake products is as high as over 80%. In the current Chinese market, the number of fake luxury goods is six times that of genuine goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/98b41035a658c2ee30e3fce4924cce4f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;4178&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/98b41035a658c2ee30e3fce4924cce4f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250410&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What is even more nerve-wracking&lt;/span>; is the frequent plagiarism of luxury goods in recent years. Last year, Dior launched a mid-length skirt that collided with the traditional Chinese dress &quot;horse face skirt&quot;, but the brand called it &quot;Dior&#39;s signature silhouette.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, with the aftermath of the &quot;Horse Face Skirt&quot; incident still lingering, Dior has launched a 2022 autumn and winter series of clothing, with the original Dior winter garden pattern once again colliding with the Chinese traditional painting &quot;Flowers and Birds&quot;. In the face of successive acts of plagiarism, the voice of resisting &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; has become increasingly louder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the world-class luxury goods that are currently highly sought after still mainly come from overseas. On the other hand, my country&#39;s local brands still have huge room for growth on the road to becoming the world&#39;s business card. We also look forward to the international success of local brands&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[教育部启动首届全国大学生职业规划大赛]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to launch the first National College Student Career Planning Competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first National College Student Career Planning Competition, with the theme of &quot;Building Dreams and Aiming for Youth in All Places, Planning to Start Careers and Lead the Future&quot;, was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Education and the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Government.

As soon as the regulations of this department were promulgated, they attracted concern from all parties, especially training institutions and their employees and even parents, who wanted to know where the legal and illegal boundaries of off-campus training were drawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most common consensus among everyone is that in-service teachers should not engage in off-campus training. Article 16 of the above-mentioned measures stipulates that if the parties involved &quot;are in-service teachers in primary and secondary schools and the training content is subject-based off-campus training&quot;, they shall be severely punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been cases like this: a teacher did not teach well in class, and then mobilized students to participate in paid private training organized by him, and even put small shoes on students who did not participate. This is undoubtedly against professional ethics. Public school teachers, teaching is their main job, and they have to be worthy of the salary they receive. How can they charge students a second time for the content that should be taught in the classroom? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what are the core contents and provisions of this regulation? The following three points deserve attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, Article 2 of the Measures stipulates: If a natural person, legal person or other organization recruits preschool children, primary and secondary school students over 3 years old from the society, and illegally conducts off-campus training, and shall be given administrative penalties, these Measures shall apply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, if a natural person or institution enrolls infants and young children under 3 years old, it is almost equivalent to day care. It is okay for the children in day care to play educational games and recite Tang poetry. It will be considered as off-campus training or illegal off-campus training. Indeed, logically, only when a child goes to kindergarten or school can there be &quot;school&quot;, and only then can there be &quot;outside school&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for this article, the General Provisions do not define &quot;illegal off-campus training&quot;. Among the various types of penalties, specific circumstances of &quot;illegal off-campus training&quot; should be punished. The basis for the document&#39;s definition of &quot;illegal off-campus training&quot; is: the 2021 &quot;Opinions on Further Reducing the Homework Burden and Off-Campus Training Burden of Students in Compulsory Education&quot; issued by the two offices in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;double reduction&quot; programmatic document defines the boundaries of off-campus training as follows: for training institutions, &quot;all localities will no longer approve new subject-based off-campus training institutions for students in compulsory education. All discipline-based training institutions are uniformly registered as non-profit institutions, and the original registered online discipline-based training institutions are changed to an approval system.&quot; For training content, &quot;Establish a training content filing and supervision system, and formulate and release training materials for off-campus training institutions. &quot;Management Measures&quot; &quot;It is strictly prohibited to exceed the standard and advance training, it is strictly prohibited to engage in subject-based training by non-disciplinary training institutions, and it is strictly prohibited to provide overseas education courses&quot;; for students and teachers, &quot;Online training must pay attention to protecting students&#39; vision, and each class period shall not exceed 30 minutes. The interval should be no less than 10 minutes, and the training end time should be no later than 21:00. &quot;The hiring of foreign personnel within the country must comply with relevant national regulations. It is strictly prohibited to hire foreign personnel abroad to carry out training activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this measure stipulates that the &quot;off-campus training competent department&quot; shall enforce the law and punish &quot;illegal off-campus training&quot;. Article 6 stipulates that administrative penalties for off-campus training shall be implemented by the off-campus training authorities of governments at or above the county level, and the off-campus training authorities shall be determined by provincial governments in accordance with relevant national regulations. So, is the “off-campus training authority” the local education bureau or education committee? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This regulation is formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Education, which also authorizes provincial governments to determine what is the competent authority for off-campus training. There is a trend in administrative law enforcement: instead of allowing each department to enforce the law on its own, a comprehensive law enforcement agency will be established to ensure that law enforcement is carried out within legitimate substantive matters and due procedures, and to reduce the number of departments that rely on the weak and the weak. Create space for rent-seeking to reduce nuisance to natural persons and enterprises and improve the business environment. Therefore, it remains to be seen who will enforce the law on &quot;illegal off-campus training&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, this measure is very strict. It must control and punish &quot;illegal off-campus training&quot;. The subjects include not only institutions, and the identification standards for institutions are strict, but also natural persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strict standards for the identification of institutions. Article 17 of the Measures stipulates that if a natural person, legal person or other organization conducts off-campus training without approval and meets these three conditions, (1) there is a special training venue for offline training, and a specific website or application for online training, (2) Having more than 2 training practitioners, (3) having corresponding organizational structure and division of labor constitutes &quot;organizing off-campus training institutions without authorization&quot;, and will be ordered to stop organizing, refund the fees charged, and impose a fine of more than double the illegal income A fine of up to five times. This means that a mom-and-pop shop or a partnership shop between friends that handles training and operations, with as few as two people, may be recognized as an &quot;off-campus training institution.&quot; Once recognized as an &quot;off-campus training institution&quot; and without approval before opening, it may It constitutes organizing off-campus training institutions without authorization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strict control over individuals engaged in subject training. Article 18 of the Measures stipulates that natural persons, legal persons or other organizations carry out off-campus training in subject areas in disguise, but do not meet the conditions stipulated in Article 17 of these Measures and commit any of the following acts: (1) Through instant messaging, online conferencing, live broadcast platforms, etc. (2) Using residential buildings, hotels, cafes and other places to organize paid off-campus training such as &quot;one-to-one&quot; and &quot;one-to-many&quot;; (3) Using consultation, cultural dissemination, quality development, For paid off-campus training in the name of competitions, thinking training, housekeeping services, family education guidance, live-in teachers, crowdfunding private tutors, study tours, study tours, winter and summer camps, trusteeship, etc., the punishment can range from an order to make corrections and a refund of fees to a fine. A fine of not less than 50,000 yuan but not more than 100,000 yuan is imposed. In theory, college students who serve as tutors will also be subject to supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Landlords or business premises that provide premises will also be subject to joint penalties. Article 19 of the Measures: If a natural person, legal person or other organization knows or should know that illegal off-campus training activities exist, but still provides a place for them to carry out off-campus training, the punishment can range from being ordered to make corrections within a time limit to being given a warning or a notice of criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This measure began to solicit opinions in November last year. Now that it has finally been implemented, it will definitely have a profound impact on the form and pattern of off-campus subject training. If implemented to the letter, it will greatly reduce the space for parents to rely on external forces to help their children. Of course, it remains to be seen how much this will shake the parents’ determination and motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[仅仅多一项选择，外卖平台就显著减少了污染]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256558]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 8, 2023, the magazine &quot;Science&quot; published a report by the University of Hong Kong, Peking University, etc. The results of the research team, “Green Boosting Reduced Disposable Tableware Use: Evidence from China’s Takeaway Industry.” This paper studies the impact of the green promotion practice of changing the cutlery selection user interface of the Ele.me food delivery platform on the consumption of disposable tableware (SUC) and the reduction of plastic waste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This new study of 10 major cities in China shows that making &quot;no cutlery&quot; the default option when placing orders on food delivery apps and rewarding customers who choose not to use plastic cutlery can significantly reduce the number of orders The waste of sexual tableware. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, the fact that the results of a study involving environmental protection, business, psychology and economics can be published in a world-class journal is enough to show the importance of this research. More importantly, this study answers an important question and provides an idea and method to solve the problem, that is, environmental protection not only requires green promotion, but also requires joint efforts online and offline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as September 2017, the Chongqing Green Volunteer Federation took Meituan, Baidu Waimai and Ele.me to court on the grounds of causing waste of resources and environmental pollution. Volunteers believe that the defendant did not provide users with the option of &quot;whether to use disposable tableware&quot;, causing the system to default to distributing disposable tableware, causing huge waste of resources and ecological damage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is first of all focusing on offline environmental protection to online ordering. In response to the green volunteers’ complaints and facing severe environmental protection issues and huge responsibilities, food delivery industry giants have responded positively. In 2018, Meituan and Ele.me launched environmental protection programs such as the &quot;Qingshan Plan&quot; and &quot;Blue Planet Plan&quot; respectively. When ordering meals, users can choose &quot;no tableware required&quot; to help environmental protection. In addition, some takeout platforms encourage merchants to use environmentally friendly paper bags instead of plastic bags for takeout packaging to reduce environmental pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if these food delivery companies responded at that time, some people still suspected that it was not easy to solve the pollution problem derived from food delivery. The food delivery platform alone had limited effect and had to go through food delivery merchants and food delivery platforms. Only through the joint efforts of multiple relevant parties, including lunch box manufacturers and consumers, can the problem be alleviated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the results of scientific research have provided a preliminary answer to these questions and doubts. As long as we do and take action, even if it is just one link of effort, it is possible to reduce plastic pollution and improve the environment, and the results will be Significant, significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the research results of Chinese and foreign research teams, Alibaba’s online food ordering platform Eleme (similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash) has made adjustments in the application using the concept of green promotion: 1. Add a pop-up window that requires customers to explicitly select the quantity of disposable cutlery in their order; 2. Set the default value of the pop-up window to &quot;no cutlery&quot;; 3. Provide a small non-monetary reward to those who choose not to use cutlery --Some &quot;Ant Forest Green Dots.&quot; These green points can be redeemed for planting real trees in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An analysis of detailed customer-level data on the ordering history of 197,062 randomly selected users in 10 major cities in China from 2019 to 2021 found that these green boosts significantly reduced the use of disposable tableware. The proportion of orders without cutlery increased by 648%. If implemented across China, such an intervention could save more than 21.75 billion sets of disposable tableware, reduce 3.26 million tons of plastic waste, and save 5.44 million trees each year, without affecting the business performance or revenue of Alibaba or individual restaurants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This result is a win-win for all, but it is not just a win-win for all. It provides a feasible measure to reduce plastic pollution that can be used as a reference, especially for countries with large populations and countries that use a lot of plastic products. effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a February 2022 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), global plastic production increased from 2.34 million tons to 460 million tons from 2000 to 2019. The generation of plastic waste has more than doubled, reaching 353 million tons in 2019. According to the United Nations Environment Program, plastics account for at least 85% of total marine debris. In 2019 alone, 22 million tons of plastic were released into the environment, with 6 million tons ending up in rivers, lakes and oceans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, 32% of the world&#39;s plastics were produced in China; more than half of the plastics came from Asia. China&#39;s production alone accounts for 1/3 (32%) of global production. China is also the world&#39;s largest producer and consumer of disposable tableware. In 2022, more than 753 million users will be active users of takeout services, and more than 50 million sets of disposable tableware that have not been fully recycled or processed are consumed every day, including Plastic bags, plastic forks, plastic spoons, wooden chopsticks and napkins. Therefore, reducing disposable tableware is an urgent and important mission. Moreover, China has also set a goal of reducing the use of disposable tableware in takeout food delivery by 30% by 2025. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now it seems that as long as the online ordering platform scientifically sets up the program, it can greatly reduce the use of disposable tableware, and it will not reduce the order volume and the income of the platform and restaurants. This is of course an online platform. It can only be accomplished by the joint efforts of both online and offline. However, there is also a scientific basis for implementing such measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The changes to the user interface of the Ele.me food ordering app reflect the concept of &quot;nudging&quot; in behavioral economics and social psychology, that is, changing the choice environment (or choice architecture) or providing indirect information to influence individuals Methods of behavior and decision-making. The key characteristic of nudges is that they do not limit the choices available to an individual, nor do they alter monetary incentives, but they can provide some kind of boost or promotion, such as environmental protection. Moreover, nudges have been used in many social fields. From this concept, online and offline actions can greatly reduce the use of disposable tableware, thereby protecting the environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the green promotion of the food ordering platform is not perfect, and there are also shortcomings that need to be improved. First, although customers choose &quot;no cutlery required&quot; when ordering, some businesses still provide disposable cutlery. The reason is that this happens when merchants are too busy to check orders one by one or worry that consumers may have chosen the &quot;no cutlery required&quot; option by mistake; second, customers often waste their green energy or fail to accumulate enough green energy. energy to plant trees; third, the impact of the green boost was most evident in the first few months after implementation but declined slightly over time, suggesting that some customers later decided to change the default “no cutlery required” option . This is consistent with previous research on the attenuation effect of default options. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, to solve these problems, more efforts must be made offline. Of course, if green boosting can be tried and promoted on all domestic food ordering platforms, as well as food ordering platforms in other countries, such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, global plastic waste will be greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[幼儿园教师，过剩还是不足？村小撤并与否，有更好的选择吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256611]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/D4VRVbviuSjP6bayt9oNVvccC0GF7KviP5EGKVGV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1116&quot; height=&quot;730&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/D4VRVbviuSjP6bayt9oNVvccC0GF7KviP5EGK VGV. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250676&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 8, 2022, a kindergarten in Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou City. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, participated in a training for teachers in small rural schools. A principal told him that the local government was once willing to open small rural schools, but now almost all of them are not in favor of it and believe that they should be withdrawn and merged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Education Statistical Yearbook&quot;, the number of rural primary schools in China dropped from 416,198 in 2001 to 90,603 in 2018, a decrease of 325,595. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major background for the decrease in the number of rural primary schools is the declining birth rate. The results of the seventh national census show that the proportion of China&#39;s population aged 0 to 14 is 17.95%, which is lower than the standard of 20% of the total population defined by the narrow concept of low birthrate. Correspondingly, the number of kindergarten-age children has also decreased, posing challenges to the development of preschool education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the birthrate continues to decline, how should preschool education respond? With declining birthrate and urbanization, where will small rural schools go? On September 7, 2023, the &quot;Transformation of Education in the New Era&quot; seminar and the &quot;China Education Observation (2022)&quot; new book preview event hosted by the 21st Century Education Research Institute were held in Beijing. Many participating scholars focused on these educational issues. discuss. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When there are less than&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;56 students, the kindergarten cannot maintain operation&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;If To maintain operations, kindergartens must have a certain scale.&quot; Liu Shanhuai, a professor at Northeast Normal University&#39;s China Rural Education Development Research Institute, came to this conclusion after conducting calculations on an inclusive kindergarten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The calculation results of that kindergarten show that the monthly education fee for each student is 390 yuan, which is charged for 9 months a year. The government subsidizes kindergartens for 12 months per year at a rate of 365 yuan per student per month. When there are fewer than 56 students, the kindergarten cannot maintain operations. The number of students must be no less than 115 to maintain a good operating level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/zUMeLPqzg70UpAQAOwyp6UDApU0HhqicX4vtgBhx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;855&quot; height= &quot;570&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/zUMeLPqzg70UpAQAOwyp6UDApU0HhqicX4vtgBhx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250675&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, Beijing, Professor Liu Shanhuai (middle) of the China Rural Education Development Research Institute of Northeast Normal University shared at the seminar. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the impact chain of declining birthrate, preschool education is the first to bear the brunt. Xiong Bingqi believes that the government should increase investment in preschool education and “should not plan future development according to the existing resource guarantee model.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He further suggested that preschool education should be guaranteed in accordance with compulsory education standards, that is, compulsory education should be extended to 12 years, which is conducive to building a child-friendly society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the number of students entering kindergarten is decreasing, Feng Wanzhen, associate professor at the Department of Education of Beijing Normal University, noticed that the number of kindergarten teachers in China has nearly tripled in 2020 compared with 2010, with an increase of 3.349 million teaching staff. , the number of full-time teachers increased by 1.769 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the growth data, she found that some areas already have a surplus of kindergarten teachers, but in some areas there is still a serious shortage. As of 2020, there are still 11 provinces including Guangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan where the ratio of the total number of children in kindergarten to the total number of full-time teachers has not reached the minimum standard for large class configurations stipulated in the &quot;Kindergarten Staff Staffing Standards (Interim)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Feng Wanzhen’s view, faced with the imbalance of teacher resources, reasonable coordination should be carried out to supplement the structural shortage of kindergarten teachers. In some areas with abundant teacher resources, we can explore the integration of daycare and kindergarten teachers and divert kindergarten teachers into the team of daycare teachers who are in short supply. At the same time, combined with its own actual conditions, the kindergarten&#39;s service forms will be expanded and the benefits of existing teacher resources will be brought into play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the number of teachers has increased significantly, kindergarten teachers have a high turnover problem due to low salary, insufficient staffing and other reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to the above issues, the &quot;Draft Preschool Education Law&quot;, which has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress for first review in August 2023, stipulates kindergarten teachers&#39; salaries, benefits, staffing, etc.: Private kindergartens should refer to local public kindergartens The salary income level of similar teachers should reasonably determine the teacher&#39;s salary standard, and social insurance should be paid in accordance with the law; kindergarten teachers enjoy the same treatment as primary and secondary school teachers in terms of professional title evaluation, job appointment (employment), etc.; local establishment departments at all levels follow the basic establishment standards for kindergarten teachers and staffing standards, the number of teaching staff in public kindergartens is approved and dynamically adjusted, and the local education department, in conjunction with the human resources and social security department, promptly replenishes teachers in public kindergartens. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is difficult to achieve &quot;small but excellent&quot; in rural schools&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Unlike preschool education, which has begun to face the impact of declining birthrate in recent years, small-scale rural schools also have to face the impact of urbanization. The challenges of globalization and the existential crisis come earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If rural education has higher quality, the school-age population will not have to flow into urban areas to choose high-quality education.” Liu Shanhuai believes that the positive interaction between education and population should be achieved by improving the allocation of educational resources. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During research in a county-level city in Northeast China, he learned that the city will have more than 1,200 people born in 2022, and will lose another 300 to 400 people when they enter primary school six years later. The first-grade school-age population will only be There are 800 to 900 people left. This means that “if the distribution of students is not considered, (the city only needs) one primary school is enough.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, students are scattered. When students move from rural to urban areas, the supply of educational resources will not necessarily be more adequate. But it is foreseeable that the number of students in rural schools will become smaller and smaller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Shanhuai believes: &quot;In the future, small-scale rural schools will be the norm, and more and more central schools will become small-scale schools, and more and more teaching points will disappear.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;In his view, some scholars’ expectations for “small but excellent” rural schools are difficult to realize based on the existing resource allocation, and whether they can offer a complete range of subjects is also a question mark. He gave an example. According to the teacher-student ratio of 1:19, a certain school has 12 students distributed in three grades. &quot;One teacher is simply not enough.&quot; This will lead to low-quality and inefficient operation of small schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the quality of teaching will be affected, Liu Shanhuai is worried that if the number of students in the school is too small, it will also affect students&#39; social development, mental health and communication skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of rural schools is indeed continuing to decrease. During the question and answer session, a reporter shared her findings from interviews in a county in Henan. The county will close a total of 70 rural schools in 2023. According to the plan, schools with less than 50 students will be merged this year, schools with less than 100 students next year, and schools with less than 200 students the year after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liu Shanhuai’s view, simply using the number of students in a school as the criteria for merging schools is too single and unreasonable. The reduction in the number of schools is more convenient for administrators, but it increases the distance for students to go to school and also brings inconvenience to parents. &quot;The distribution of rural schools should be determined according to the natural population distribution.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The decline in students is difficult to reverse. How to improve the quality of rural schools? Liu Shanhuai believes that public funding standards based on the number of students cannot meet the actual needs of rural schools, and the funding structure should be improved to ensure the economic foundation for the development of rural education. At the same time, we will consolidate diverse supplementary channels for rural teachers through targeted training of rural teachers, special post plans, and retired teaching support. In the information age, the application of information technology can also help improve the level of rural education. The configuration of hardware facilities and the construction of digital resources in rural schools should be further strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2012, the number of compulsory education schools in rural areas was significantly reduced, which led to longer distances for some students to go to school, increased traffic safety hazards, increased financial burdens on students’ families, and caused a shortage of boarding schools in rural areas and some urban To address issues such as excessive school class sizes, the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Regulating the Adjustment of the Layout of Rural Compulsory Education Schools.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opinions call for resolutely stopping the blind dismantling of rural compulsory education schools. At the same time, the layout of rural compulsory education schools should ensure that students need to go to school nearby. In principle, villages with relatively concentrated populations should set up village primary schools or teaching points. Sparsely populated, Teaching points should be reserved or set up in remote and inaccessible places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the aforementioned training for teachers of small rural schools, several principals from Henan once again strongly called for an end to the one-size-fits-all approach to withdrawing and merging schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After conducting grassroots research, Liu Shanhuai found that in practice, whether to withdraw and merge small schools faces conflicts among many parties, and &quot;there is no best choice.&quot; Education department staff reported to him that the original withdrawal of schools was due to the consideration of integrating educational resources. Criticisms emerged after the merger, arguing that students have to travel further to school and that the cost of education for families has increased. But now many small schools have been retained, and there are different opinions that students do not develop as well as in county schools and township central schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Shanhuai said that in the face of this conflict, there is currently a lack of scientific standards. He suggested comprehensively considering various factors such as the comprehensive development of students, education costs and educational equity, and issuing operational guidelines at the national level to provide reference for various places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广西通报“中学小卖部一年经营权卖224万元”：已中止合同，今后不再对外承包]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256607]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-14 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In response to the issues related to the contracting of the canteen operation rights by Hezhou No. 5 Senior High School that netizens are concerned about, Pinggui District United The investigation team conducted an in-depth investigation and now reports the relevant situation as follows:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After investigation, the procedures for outsourcing the operation rights of the canteen of Hezhou No. 5 Senior High School did not comply with relevant regulations, and both parties have terminated contract.

The &quot;two highs and two ministries&quot; will carry out a one-year special work to promote the increase in the rate of second instance hearings of criminal cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a great benefit for lawyers.” Mao Lixin sighed. Five months ago, he participated in a seminar on the difficulties of opening a second trial. At the meeting, he said that except for the cases he represented in the first instance, he basically did not take on criminal second-instance cases. &quot;If there is no trial, there is very little room for lawyers to perform.&quot; This statement resonated with the lawyers present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Lixin plans to start acting as an agent in second-instance criminal cases if the difficulty of opening a second-instance trial cannot be alleviated. &quot;At least I will have a starting point for my work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/NT944p2PXwAmylBUIwd2Dp1SLgMdA2liQC4Aqe5T.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;865&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/NT944p2PXwAmylBUIwd2Dp1SLgMdA2liQC4Aqe5T.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250674&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 19, 2023, the second trial of the &quot;Wu Xieyu Patricide Case&quot; opened.

However, since 2017, this figure has dropped below 20%, showing an overall downward trend year by year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The COVID-19 epidemic has also affected the rate of second instance hearings to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, the Henan Provincial High Court issued a reply to the proposal of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. It mentioned that local courts usually give priority to ensuring the hearing needs of first-instance cases and death penalty, suspended death, and second-instance protest cases. The court hearing resources of other second-instance cases have been squeezed out, and the second-instance hearing rate in some prefectures and cities has dropped by nearly 10% compared with before the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters noticed that since 2023, before the issuance of the above notice, the local court has begun to explore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public reports, on February 14, 2023, Hao Zhuo, deputy director of the Fourth Criminal Division of the Henan Provincial High Court, went to Pingdingshan Intermediate Court to investigate the situation of the second criminal trial; on March 8, Hao Zhuo et al. People also went to Puyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court to conduct special research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the investigation, Hao Zhuo mentioned that the work of increasing the rate of second instance hearings is based on the work arrangements made by the Central Committee and the Supreme People&#39;s Court on the reform of the criminal litigation system. &quot;The court session is an exception&quot; principle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 25, 2023, the Xuchang Intermediate Court of Henan Province published an article, which mentioned that the Xuchang Intermediate People’s Court and the Xuchang Procuratorate jointly signed an &quot;Opinions on Increasing the Hearing Rate of Criminal Second Instance Cases&quot; 》. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the Supreme People&#39;s Court, since 2023, as of August 31, the second-instance hearing rate of criminal cases in Henan, Shaanxi, and Hunan courts has increased by more than 75% year-on-year, and the rate of second-instance hearings in Fujian, Chongqing, and Heilongjiang courts has increased by more than 75% year-on-year. 50%, and the courts of Beijing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Gansu, and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps increased by more than 10% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;change rate&quot; is low, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;the actual effect remains to be seen&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This notice points out that investigation and research must be carried out. Analyze various reasons that affect the low rate of second-instance hearings, take effective measures to reduce the adverse factors that affect the second-instance hearing rate, and ensure that the rate of second-instance hearings increases steadily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2020, the Jinhua Intermediate People&#39;s Court admitted in response to the suggestion of a National People&#39;s Congress deputy that the reason for the decline in the rate of criminal second instance hearings is that the number of defendant cases has increased significantly in recent years. It is difficult for police personnel to meet the needs of court sessions; prosecutors cannot meet the needs of second-instance criminal trials; and post judges are under heavy pressure to open trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Yuan, associate professor at Tianjin University Law School, has been engaged in trial work in grassroots, intermediate and above courts for more than ten years. He also found in his research that, faced with increasingly heavy case-handling pressure, second-instance judges tend to make the choice not to hold court sessions. When hearing criminal cases of second instance, a collegial panel should be formed, and the number of second-instance judges is relatively limited. In order to form a collegial panel, one has to frequently go to the civil court, commercial court, or administrative court to &quot;recruit reinforcements.&quot; Naturally, the effect of the case hearing and subsequent collegial proceedings will be greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Yi, dean of the Law School of Minzu University of China, has also previously written an article calling for the second instance of criminal cases to be heard. After seeing the notice jointly issued by the four departments, he believed that the statements contained in it are relatively principled, and specific details still need to be issued on how to implement it in practice. For example, Han Yi believes that there needs to be supporting policies to follow up on the allocation of judges. In addition, in practice, &quot;the circumstances under which a second instance hearing must be held and under which circumstances do not require a hearing need to be further refined, which will also be more conducive to implementation by the grassroots courts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some lawyers also believe that given the low rate of criminal cases being revised and remanded for retrial (referred to as the &quot;reissue rate&quot;), it remains to be seen what the actual effect of the second instance hearing will be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the Supreme People&#39;s Court, in the first half of 2023, the rate of change of first-instance criminal judgments in courts across the country was 1.65%, a year-on-year decrease of 0.22 percentage points. This means that among 100 criminal cases, the average number of cases whose sentences were changed after the first instance was less than 2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 15, 2023, &quot;Ban Yue Tan&quot; published a report, pointing out that for a long time, courts in various places have used the low reissue rate of cases as an important indicator to evaluate the quality of cases handled by courts and judges, prompting the second-instance courts to Cautious changes to judgments and strict remands lead to &quot;not changing the sentences that should be changed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If we don’t increase the rate of reform, the value of supervision and check in the second instance will still not be realized.” Han Yi also believes that the issuance of this notice is worthy of praise. At the same time, the policy should also be paid attention to in subsequent practice. Whether the implementation is effective. In addition to the low reissue rate, Han Yi also mentioned that attention should be paid to avoid blindly focusing on increasing the second-instance hearing rate. “This may cause the second-instance court to choose to hear some relatively simple cases, while choosing to hear major and complex cases. No court session.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从初代网红到二次出狱：郭美美曾说“不想以这种方式出名”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256605]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;Slowly understand the world and slowly update yourself.&quot; On September 12, Guo, who has been silent for nearly three years, Meimei updated her personal social media account to show that she may be released from prison again.

During this period, Guo Meimei also helped Wang Zouya order and pay Zhao, and jointly sold 4 boxes of slimming candies, receiving RMB 2,796. After the incident, the public security organs detected sibutramine in the diet candy seized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the first-instance trial, a relevant person from the prosecution revealed to Nandu reporters that before the trial, Guo Meimei had signed a confession of guilt and punishment. However, during the trial, Guo Meimei defended whether she “subjectively and knowingly” knew that the weight loss pills sold contained sibutramine. &quot;Whether this behavior constitutes &#39;repentance&#39; and whether it will be considered as a sentencing circumstance needs to be determined by the judge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;First arrest&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Guo Meimei was detained by Pudong police in accordance with the law, she was She was released from prison in Changsha only 607 days ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2014, Guo Meimei and others were criminally detained by the Dongcheng Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau on suspicion of gambling crimes. After investigation, Guo Meimei confessed to the illegal and criminal facts of participating in gambling and organizing gambling during the World Cup football match, and also confessed to the criminal facts of long-term participation in gambling activities and opening gambling bureaus for making huge profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long-term gambling began in 2010, long before the &quot;Guo Meimei incident&quot; that made it famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police found that between 2010 and 2014, Guo Meimei traveled to and from Macau, Hong Kong and surrounding countries for gambling more than 60 times. At the end of 2012, Guo Meimei met Kang, a foreign professional Texas Hold&#39;em gambler, at a Macau casino.

Affected by this, one month after the incident, the charitable donations received by the Red Cross societies across China dropped sharply, and their credibility was questioned. Other official charities were also implicated. The amount of donations received by charitable organizations dropped by 86% from June to August. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 4, 2011, Guo Meimei apologized in tears on a TV show, saying that she certified the &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot; out of vanity and comparison mentality, and emphasized that everything had nothing to do with the Red Cross Society. . However, a charity trust storm has formed, and a round of discussion on charity system reform has arisen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Nandu reporter in the same year, Guo Meimei said that before the incident happened, she &quot;didn&#39;t know much about charity&quot;. She only heard about &quot;godfather&quot; Wang Jun at a dinner in March and April. The name &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot; was mentioned. One afternoon in April, Guo Meimei saw the Weibo posts of friends she followed. The certification information said president and general manager, “But I know there are a few people who are not. One of them, a classmate in our class, just took 100,000 yuan to register.

Influenza, this familiar “old friend” will also arrive as scheduled. Most people don&#39;t think of the flu as a serious illness. The typical symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, and muscle aches are often the same as a bad cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the COVID-19 epidemic, influenza was the first infectious disease to be monitored globally by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO statistics, seasonal influenza kills 290,000 to 650,000 people every year. Part of the reason why influenza is so destructive is that the virus mutates quickly, and people who have been infected with influenza viruses in the past cannot develop defenses against new viruses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, influenza is a seriously underestimated infectious disease. A large number of people are infected with influenza every year, and the health risks and disease burden it brings are far greater than imagined. A meta-analysis by scholars on the results of influenza epidemiological surveys conducted in different cities in my country in different years concluded that the annual number of influenza cases in China from 2011 to 2019 was approximately 84 million to 144 million. From the 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 epidemic season, there were an average of 88,000 excess deaths from influenza-related respiratory diseases in my country every year, of which 80% of the excess influenza-related deaths among the elderly over 60 years old accounted for the entire population. The risk of illness in children is about 1.5-3 times that of adults; pregnant women infected with influenza during pregnancy increase the risk of severe illness and stillbirth. A systematic review analyzed the economic burden caused by influenza in my country. Among them, outpatient cases in all age groups were 768-1,000 yuan/person, inpatient cases averaged 9,832 yuan/person, and direct medical care for children 5 years old and under and elderly people over 60 years old for inpatient cases. The cost is much higher than other groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many new infectious diseases, influenza scientists are already very familiar with it. The World Health Organization updates the antigenic components of influenza vaccines every year based on global surveillance and provides candidate strains for vaccine preparation. , for industry to develop the latest influenza vaccines. Although the mutation of new strains causes fluctuations in the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccination is still the most cost-effective way to prevent influenza and complications. WHO recommends that countries set vaccination rate targets for recommended vaccination groups such as the elderly. 75%. In my country, the influenza vaccination rate is only 2%-4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The status of influenza vaccination in my country is very unsatisfactory.” Peng Zhibin, associate researcher at the Infectious Disease Management Division of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, disclosed at the 2022 National Vaccine and Health Conference that during the 2021~2022 influenza season, vaccines The vaccination rate was only 2.46%, a year-on-year decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the vaccination rate is too low, the annual scrap rate of corporate influenza vaccines is as high as 20%-40%. How to improve the vaccination rate of influenza vaccine in my country and protect the public health has been a difficult problem that has long troubled public health researchers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three major factors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, the team of Professor Feng Luzhao, deputy dean of the School of Group Medicine and Public Health of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, conducted a study on influenza vaccination in my country. The current situation and problems are summarized, and a series of strategic suggestions are put forward to promote influenza vaccination in my country. This article was published on September 12, 2023 as the output of the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; project at Duke Kunshan University . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What factors influence the low influenza vaccination rate? Professor Feng Luzhao’s research pointed out that three factors affect my country’s influenza vaccination rate:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, vaccine hesitancy caused by cognitive misunderstandings about influenza viruses and influenza vaccines. The survey shows that &quot;thinking that you are in good health and do not need to get a flu vaccine&quot; and &quot;even if you get the flu will not cause serious consequences&quot; are the main reasons for people&#39;s flu vaccine hesitancy; more than 40% of public health personnel believe that the flu will not cause serious consequences. disease, 18% of public health workers and 45% of medical workers said they lacked confidence in answering questions about influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the cost is closely related to the influenza vaccination rate. In my country, the influenza vaccine is a non-immunization program vaccine and needs to be vaccinated at your own expense. In recent years, some provinces and cities have included influenza vaccines as local free services, which has greatly increased the vaccination rate in some areas. According to a survey by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccination rate of people in areas with free influenza vaccination can exceed 50%, and the medical insurance reimbursement policy can also increase the vaccination rate to a certain extent, while the vaccination rate of self-paying people is only 1.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the current vaccination system does not match actual needs. It is the best time to vaccinate against influenza before the epidemic season. my country’s annual vaccination work is concentrated between September and December. At present, influenza vaccination services mainly rely on vaccination clinics of the children&#39;s immunization program. Most vaccination sites only provide influenza vaccination for 1-2 half days on working days, which is not suitable for the annual concentrated vaccination demand. From the perspective of vaccination services, demand exceeds supply and it is difficult to make appointments for vaccination services, resulting in poor accessibility and convenience. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 1918 influenza pandemic struck with almost unimaginable intensity and speed - infecting one-third of the Earth&#39;s population One (about 500 million people). Since then, all countries have been actively establishing public health systems to prevent influenza and exploring effective promotion measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting people to take the initiative to get vaccinated is the top priority of public health actions in all countries. As of 2021, 65% of WHO member states (128 countries and regions) have included influenza vaccination for high-risk groups such as the elderly and medical staff in national immunization plans or public health projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Feng Luzhao was a member of the WHO Advisory Committee on Immunization (SAGE) Influenza Vaccine Working Group and currently serves as an expert on the WHO New Influenza Vaccine Comprehensive Value Assessment Advisory Group. He studied influenza vaccination promotion strategies in many countries and found that many countries have rich experience in policy advocacy, improving vaccination accessibility, motivating vaccination service providers, and monitoring influenza vaccination behaviors and social drivers. The successful experience of the intervention measures effectively increased the influenza vaccination rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research found that many countries have included influenza vaccines in national immunization plans or introduced compulsory vaccination strategies. For example, in order to reduce the risk of infection among medical workers and patients, the health administration departments of the United States and Canada require medical workers and nursing home staff to receive influenza vaccines compulsorily. Secondly, we should vigorously increase the number and convenience of vaccination service points. In North America and European countries, influenza vaccination points have covered pharmacies, supermarkets, private clinics, hospitals and other places. Implementing incentive policies for service providers is also an effective means. The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc. use the influenza vaccination rate of key groups as a performance evaluation indicator for medical personnel. The United Kingdom provides general practitioners with influenza-related educational materials and implements a performance incentive strategy to encourage medical staff to achieve the established influenza vaccination rate target and provide financial or material incentives to promote medical staff to vaccinate and recommend influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, some innovative incentives can also increase the willingness of medical staff to be vaccinated. In 2017, institutions such as Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital in the UK implemented a vaccination campaign. When a medical staff completed the influenza vaccination, Medical institutions will donate 10 tetanus vaccines to children or mothers in developing countries through UNICEF. This measure has enabled the influenza vaccination rate of medical staff in these institutions to reach 95.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the procurement challenges caused by the uncertainty of demand for influenza vaccines and the diversity of strains, the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; once summarized the experience of developed countries and found that through quantity commitments during the procurement process, etc. The method of linking quantity and price is often conducive to lowering prices. For example, the UK allows manufacturers to give different quotations based on different purchase quantities during the bidding process (often the larger the purchase quantity, the lower the price), thereby effectively utilizing economies of scale and reducing manufacturer risks. The Canadian government will require each province or region to estimate its demand before awarding contracts to manufacturers, and requires each province or region to purchase at least 75% of its estimated amount, thus forming a quantity guarantee for manufacturers. At the same time, the government uses long-term contracts to reduce manufacturers&#39; risks, lower the price of vaccine procurement and increase the stability of vaccine supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the public, extensive scientific and educational propaganda is also indispensable. The status of influenza vaccination in 15 European countries reminds that government departments&#39; monitoring of influenza vaccination rates and sending text message reminders for free vaccination are important factors in promoting vaccination among target groups. The United States, through media propaganda, not only increased the influenza vaccination rate among the elderly by 8%, but also advanced the vaccination time by 1.8-4.1 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These state-led measures have achieved remarkable results. Taking the elderly as an example, Brazil’s vaccination rate is as high as 89%; the UK’s vaccination rate for people over 65 years old has remained above 70% since 2004; the United States has maintained a vaccination rate of more than 70% for many years. Maintained above 60%; Canada, Spain, and New Zealand are about 60%-70%, and France, Australia, and Japan are about 50%-60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Influenza vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of influenza and complications, and effectively reduce the number of outpatient and emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths from influenza-related diseases. , the cost-effectiveness is very obvious. Since 2020, scientists have monitored and found that influenza and the new coronavirus are showing an alternating epidemic trend. Multiple studies have confirmed that co-infection with the new coronavirus and influenza virus will increase the risk of hospitalization and complicate the patient&#39;s condition. For years, scientists have emphasized the importance of influenza vaccination, but increasing vaccination rates remains difficult. In view of the low influenza vaccination rate in my country, Professor Feng Luzhao&#39;s team put forward the following strategic suggestions for policy makers to refer to:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccine hesitancy has left many groups who should have received influenza vaccines in a &quot;streaking&quot; state. &quot;Health education should identify effective ways to target the public&#39;s misunderstandings about influenza and vaccines, especially for the elderly, primary and secondary school students and other groups covered by free programs, study the influencing factors of vaccination and effective intervention measures, and carry out precise publicity and science popularization .&quot; In the view of Professor Feng Luzhao, all localities should actively improve the public&#39;s understanding of influenza and enhance vaccine confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For key groups, the study recommends gradually promoting free influenza vaccination for the elderly, primary and secondary school students, medical staff, etc., and striving to include influenza vaccination within the payment scope of basic medical insurance. They also encourage medical institutions at all levels to set up adult vaccination clinics, continuously strengthen the public health and prevention responsibilities of medical staff through continuing education, vocational training, etc., explore the right of medical staff to prescribe vaccines, and incorporate vaccination work into the evaluation system of medical institutions. Increase the enthusiasm of medical staff in recommending influenza vaccination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in view of the high scrap rate of influenza vaccines every year, we can learn from international experience and sign long-term (such as not less than five years) contracts for influenza vaccines with enterprises, purchase in quantities, and ensure supply based on quantities. , not only can share market risks, but also ensure the stable growth of enterprise production capacity. Avoid the situation of annual production and large amounts of scrapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People don’t know when we will encounter another influenza pandemic, but it cannot be ruled out that it will happen again. As the WHO says: At the heart of an effective pandemic response is a strong, well-resourced health system. These include well-trained health workers; effective water, sanitation and hygiene systems; quality rapid diagnostic laboratory services; access to medical products, including vaccines; and reliable systems for tracking and reporting disease cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated the 2023-2024 influenza vaccine ingredient changes and vaccination recommendations, reminding the public that it is best to get vaccinated in September or October. In China, the 2023-2024 batch of influenza vaccines have arrived in various places and are open for reservation. According to the CDC surveillance data, the positive rate of influenza virus testing in some southern provinces has been rising slightly since the end of July. For individuals, facing the seasonal epidemic of influenza, proactive protection and vaccination to minimize the harm of the virus are practical choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[店员控住偷窃女子：这不是执法权而是公民扭送权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen shot and uploaded a video:&amp;nbsp;On September 7, in Joy City, Xidan, Beijing, A woman was caught shoplifting in a cosmetics store. Two men (presumably both clerks) grabbed her arms and controlled her. The woman struggled hard and tried to escape and shouted &quot;Help&quot;. When a man called the police as if to call the police, the woman Once she broke away, the second man immediately hugged the woman&#39;s waist. At this time, an aunt who was watching stood up and asked, and the second man replied &quot;thief&quot;. The aunt yelled, &quot;Thieves are human beings too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media platforms, many netizens believe that store clerks or security guards have the right to catch thieves, but aunts are not alone. There are also voices on the Internet that &quot;security guards or store clerks have no law enforcement power and have no right to restrict women&#39;s personal freedom.&quot; For example, some netizens said: &quot;Auntie is right. Although thieves are hateful, these two men are not law enforcement officers. There should be boundaries in their behavior. The behavior seen so far can easily cross the boundary and get themselves into trouble.&quot; This is a very representative point of view, so it deserves analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is correct that only law enforcement officers authorized by law have the power to enforce the law, but it does not mean that ordinary people have no right to defend their natural rights such as life, property and freedom. Going back to the above case, if these two men are the owners of the store, they are blameless in protecting their property; if they are not the owners, as employees (clerks or security guards) of the store and shopping mall, their duty is to protect the store. Or the goods in the shopping mall are protected from theft, which means that the owner of the goods authorizes them to protect the safety of the property. The cosmetics sold in such stores in shopping malls are generally expensive. If the store staff neglects to take precautions and protection, or just sit back and do nothing when they see someone stealing goods, then they will not only be derelict in their responsibility, but may also be required to bear the cost of the goods. loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people may say that if you see someone stealing cosmetics, just let them keep the cosmetics and then let them go. Why not forgive them? If you do this in a single incident, it seems that the store or shopping mall has no losses, but it undoubtedly creates an incentive: if you steal something from this store or shopping mall, as long as you are not caught, it is yours; if you are caught, it will only be yours. By leaving something behind, the individual can escape unscathed. The mathematical expectation of stealing is positive, which calls the thief to &quot;be stupid, have plenty of money, and come quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, store clerks, security guards or ordinary passers-by can control existing thieves, restrict their personal freedom, and either call the police and wait for the police to deal with them, or transfer them to the police. This is not the so-called &quot;law enforcement power&quot; , but the right of citizens to transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the current Criminal Procedure Law stipulates: Any citizen may immediately transfer a person to the public security organ, the People’s Procuratorate or the People’s Court for handling under the following circumstances: (1) While committing a crime or immediately after committing a crime Being discovered; (2) being wanted; (3) escaping from prison; (4) being hunted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, if the above-mentioned woman stole valuable cosmetics, she might fall into the first situation. Article 264 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever steals public or private property in a relatively large amount, or commits multiple thefts, burglaries, thefts with weapons, or pickpockets shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, or surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined... …The &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Theft&quot; stipulates that theft of public and private property worth more than 1,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan shall be deemed as a &quot;large amount&quot; as stipulated in Article 264 of the Criminal Law, and also That is to say, the threshold for imprisonment is one thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case where the above-mentioned woman was caught stealing and suspected of a criminal offence, anyone can exercise the citizen&#39;s right to surrender. During the implementation process, the woman&#39;s personal freedom and freedom of movement will inevitably be restricted, which is also the proper meaning of the citizen&#39;s right to transfer. If a woman &quot;voluntarily&quot; goes to the public security organ or waits for the police to come to her door under the supervision and escort of everyone, the two clerks can certainly behave in a more polite manner, but no matter how &quot;gentle&quot; the clerk&#39;s behavior is, it is based on the fact that the woman&#39;s personal freedom has been temporarily suspended. based on restrictions. A woman is more &quot;gentle&quot; if she cooperates with the clerk, and less &quot;gentle&quot; if she doesn&#39;t cooperate with the clerk. In the final analysis, there is a certain reciprocal relationship between the actions of both parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, a store or shopping mall has the right to formulate and implement rules within its property scope, which is a manifestation of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if the zoo requires visitors not to feed the animals, otherwise they may be asked out on the spot and blacklisted for refusing transactions. Shops or shopping malls require customers not to make loud noises or cause trouble and disrupt the peaceful shopping environment. Do not listen to the advice. You may be asked to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These situations also inevitably involve restrictions on customers’ freedom of movement or forced eviction, but this is not a “law enforcement power” but a manifestation of “property rights” because businesses only restrict “their freedom of movement”. The freedom of movement of customers who break the rules &quot;within the property&quot;, that is, refusing such customers to continue to stay &quot;within the property&quot; is like saying to someone who is causing trouble in your home, &quot;Please leave, you are not welcome in my home.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, businesses that restrict the personal freedom of criminals currently in the store or hand them over to the police for processing, or expel unwelcome customers are not exercising the so-called &quot;law enforcement power.&quot; Law enforcement power often involves restricting personal freedom and freedom of movement. However, when restricting the personal freedom and freedom of movement of others, it may be law enforcement officers exercising &quot;law enforcement power&quot;, it may be good citizens exercising their legitimate private rights, or it may be criminals. To commit a crime, as this article demonstrates, we must understand the essential difference between exercising legitimate private rights and committing a crime, and we cannot equate stopping a crime with committing a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
