My pronunciation is actually Japanese pronunciation, because they are almost the same as the pronunciation of &quot;Dunhuang&quot; and &quot;Kumaroshi&quot; when I learned about it more than 20 years ago, so I was very impressed. This impression originated from a documentary produced by Japan&#39;s NHK TV station that I saw at that time: &quot;Silk Road&quot;. I am ashamed to say that before that, I had no understanding of either Dunhuang or Kumarajiva. Later, I gradually learned that Dunhuang has an extraordinary status in the hearts of Japanese people. In October 2018, I went to Dunhuang for the first time due to a meeting. After transferring in Xi&#39;an, I found that I was on the same plane with a Japanese tour group, and the TONKOU images in my memory flashed back frame by frame. At that time, I secretly sighed: Japan’s “Dunhuang Fever” is indeed well-deserved. Speaking of the origin of &quot;Dunhuang fever&quot; in Japan, this book published in 1943 is undoubtedly one of the initiators. Since this book is a &quot;novel&quot;, to avoid spoilers, the content will not be mentioned here. However, readers must have realized by now that it might be a pity to read this book as a novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73794&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70583&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/6ddafb8163.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Killing Season.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1484&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/6ddafb8163.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260274&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;《 &quot;Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Genocide 1965-1966&quot;, written by [Additional] Robinson, translated by Xie Kankan and Roger, World Knowledge Press, June 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the six months starting from October 1965, approximately 500,000 members of the Indonesian Communist Party and its affiliated organizations were killed, becoming the leader of the twentieth century. One of the most famous massacres in human history. What was the cause of this massacre? What is the identity of the executioner who carried out the massacre? What role did the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other major powers play in this tragedy? These may be some questions that our general readers will think of. The author of this book is a well-known expert on the politics of Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, although this book is titled &quot;History&quot;, it is not a general straightforward narrative, but has clear analytical features. The author carefully depicts the distribution of the huge energy that triggered the massacre along several cracks within Indonesia such as ideology, military-political relations, religious beliefs, and ethnic identity. Of course, because it involves many complex and sensitive issues such as religion and race relations, the author writes with different shades of ink, which can be said to be prudent; however, the almost rare silence of the countries involved on this incident has been overshadowed by this excellent historical research Totally shattered. The people want the truth, and that is what true learning is about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73795&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70584&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/bda9db9a0d.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Real and Virtual.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1591&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/bda9db9a0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260275&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Reality and Virtuality: Philosophy in the Post-Truth Era&quot;, by Jin Guantao&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, CITIC Publishing Group, July 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The word &quot;philosophy&quot; in the subtitle of this book actually refers to &quot;philosophy of authenticity&quot;, and the core part of this book can be positioned as &quot;philosophy of science&quot; &quot;Epistemology&quot; or &quot;theory of knowledge.&quot; Having said that, we understand that there is a high threshold to cross in order to read this book. However, the book&#39;s argument is unusually clear because the author has a consistent model throughout. This model is very simple: authenticity R (X, M, Y) is a structure composed of subject X, control means M and object Y. The &quot;authenticity&quot; of object Y only depends on the universal repeatability of M. . So, isn’t this just a repetition of the basic methods of modern scientific research? Not so; the author realizes that authenticity should be divided into three incommensurable fields: science, individual and society, and therefore wants to establish a unified theory for this purpose. In this book, such as the theoretical blind spots of Kuhn, who was famous in the field of scientific philosophy in the 20th century, the &quot;kingdom of lies&quot; spun by humanistic intellectuals who regard themselves as academic leftists in European and American circles, and the opinions of great physicists such as Einstein on mathematical abilities. &quot;Surprised&quot;, and even the properties of gauge field theory and superstring theory, which are the most cutting-edge in theoretical physics, the author has given his own very unique and bold views, which can be said to have great philosophical ambitions. In the process of reading this book, I would often compare it with my own experience gained from studying and researching in recent years. Although the results are similar and different, they all made me think deeply. This can be said to be due to the author&#39;s strong and clear extreme thinking ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73796&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70585&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/5c87f2a91e.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Mathematics Concept.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1566&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/5c87f2a91e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260276&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong >;&quot;Truth and Beauty: Qiu Chengtong&#39;s Views on Mathematics&quot;, written by Qiu Chengtong, Jiangsu Phoenix Literature and Art Publishing House, August 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I just finished reading this book, I had a &quot;delusional&quot; thought: Is there a channel for at least all junior high schools, high schools and universities in the country to Have all math teachers read this book? After years of reading, I can see that such original Chinese works that are full of vitality are extremely rare. Reading them makes me feel refreshed. This makes me sigh from time to time: Mr. Qiu is really a powerful gentleman and a great scholar in the world. This great strength is not only reflected in his courageous advancement in mathematical research, but also in his outspoken criticism of the low academic style that takes fame and fortune in the academic world. It is also reflected in his enthusiasm for cultivating students. It is also reflected in the fact that he has a secret that is not easily known to others. The psychological mechanism: &quot;Study the relationship between heaven and man, understand the changes of ancient and modern times, and become a family.&quot; This is the famous saying of Tai Shigong, and I don&#39;t know how many scholars have been inspired. I have seen criticism of him on the Internet, to the general effect that Yau Shing Tong is domineering; for some details of the story, please refer to &quot;My Geometric Life: The Autobiography of Yau Shing Tong&quot;. At that time I thought: Well, as long as the critics can point to one of the above four points, I will accept it; otherwise, please listen to your instructions. In fact, if we look at the Chinese people who have left their names in the history of human science since the 20th century, one of their teachers is Chen Shengren, Yang Zhenning is another, and the third one is Yau Shing-tung. However, in terms of being able to make decisions for real academics and scholars, there may be no one at the moment who can surpass them. Master once said: &quot;Virtue is never alone, it must have neighbors.&quot; Good readers of this book will definitely agree with this statement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73797&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70586&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/30/254212bb7b.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Conquest and Culture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1622&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/254212bb7b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260277&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Conquest and Culture: A History of the World&quot;, written by&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;[&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;US] Sowell, translated by Jiang Lin, CITIC Publishing Group, October 2023. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The author of this book is a famous black economist, thinker and public intellectual in the United States, and is also labeled as a &quot;black conservative&quot; . Knowing this background, it will be easier to understand the tepid style of the book: although the author is outspoken about the evils caused by the conquest of the major Western colonial empires in the nineteenth century, such as the slave trade and the massacre of Indians, he does not High-profile accusations. His economic perspective gave him an awareness of &quot;conquest and culture&quot; from the perspective of human natural history. For example, the situation of black people on plantations in the United States in the 19th century was better than that on plantations in Latin America. The reason was that the price of purchasing slaves in the United States was relatively high. Naturally, slave owners did not want their property to suffer losses easily, so there was a trend of preferring to hire slaves. Irish immigrants doing dangerous jobs. So, how does the author view the issue of &quot;colonial conquest&quot;? It can be said that the violent conflicts in the current world are still a continuation of this helpless natural history of mankind. The pace of progress of human civilization seems increasingly slow and heavy today. Because of his special ethnic identity, the author&#39;s relatively gentle and tolerant reappearance of this period of history, as well as his quiet criticism of &quot;tribalism&quot;, make his expressions and thoughts more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The author is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science, East China Normal University)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作为文本的茶馆丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV10jWfkJLuh9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/k7XSaOnKmcU72AMhUa66c91RrEJSV 10jWfkJLuh9. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di at Heming Tea House in Chengdu People&#39;s Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.infzm.com/contents/257991&quot; title=&quot;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&quot;>;Wang Di: Historian in the Teahouse&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di’s generation in Chengdu When people meet, they like to say, &quot;I eat three flowers in my mouth.&quot; &quot;Kouzi&quot; means &quot;Jiekou&quot;. &quot;啖&quot; means &quot;to eat&quot;. Su Dongpo&#39;s famous sentence &quot;Eating three hundred lychees a day&quot; will be pronounced more accurately in Sichuan dialect. This is easy to understand. The term &quot;Three Flowers&quot; requires experienced Chengdu people to explain it in detail before they can understand it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Wang Di, I proposed to sit in a teahouse. Wang Di said, let’s meet at Heming Teahouse in People’s Park. At Heming Teahouse, as soon as we sat down, Wang Di explained what &quot;three flowers&quot; were. &quot;When I was a child, I drank third-grade flower tea, which is the most popular tea. I went to the United States in 1991, and when I returned to Chengdu in 1997, I went to a teahouse to drink tea. The tea waiter asked, what kind of tea should I drink? I said, &#39;Sanhua&#39; &#39;. He said that the worst ones now are &#39;special flower&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Special Flower Tea&lt;/span>;).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;From &quot;three flowers&quot; to &quot;special flowers&quot;, it seems to conform to a certain &quot;law&quot; of &quot;rising&quot; along time. Wang Di said that maybe the &quot;Special Flower&quot; now is the &quot;Sanhua&quot; back then, but the name has just been changed. Older Chengdu people say &quot;eat tea with your mouth in mind&quot;. At that time, there was not even the word &quot;三花&quot;. An author signed by &quot;Follower&quot; made a somewhat pessimistic prediction in a Chengdu newspaper in 1942: &quot;As long as society progresses and a replacement for the teahouse appears, it will definitely decline or even cease to exist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Wang Di wrote at the end of &quot;Teahouse: Public Life and Microcosm in Chengdu, 1900-1950&quot;: &quot;A few hours later, they will still open the door of the teahouse just like they did on the first day of the century fifty years ago. They were unloaded piece by piece, but they didn’t know that together with this city, they had entered a completely different era that, although vigorous, no longer belonged to teahouses and tea guests.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to write this Teahouses in different eras, thus &quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Renaissance of Public Life in Chengdu, 1950-2000&quot;. Wang Di was born in 1956 and has more personal experience of Chengdu teahouses during this period. These two books constitute a century-old history of teahouses in Chengdu. &quot;Although the theme of this century-old history is teahouses, it is also a century-old economic history, a century-old social history, a century-old cultural history, a century-old popular history, a century-old history of daily life, and even a century-old Chinese city&#39;s history seen from the microcosm of the teahouse. The history of character.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di&#39;s years of writing about teahouses earned him the second biennial (2018-2019) &quot;Best Book Award&quot; from the American Urban History Society. The award citation said: &quot;This book adopts a multi-disciplinary research orientation, adopts anthropological and sociological research methods and theories, and mines various historical documents, including newspapers, diaries, personal records, and oral data of teahouse culture, so that This research is very in-depth.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For media professionals, Wang Di’s works have a lot to learn from. How to think big from the micro? How to see the times from ordinary people? How to find new ideas from numerous materials? These are common problems we face. Wang Di took me to many places. The feeling of telling history on the spot is extraordinary. It allows people to see three-dimensional and rich details, and naturally compare teahouses and tea guests in time and space. Everything is emotional. The collision and fusion of opinions and rational thoughts will form complex and fresh texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Texts, or &quot;fragments,&quot; written by specific individuals provide new perspectives on history. Everyone adds their own text to history itself, so that history will be richer and more visible, and it will continue to get closer to the &quot;reality&quot; itself. There is no overall history, only ever-expanding history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[短剧制造者：哪有什么一夜暴富？不过是流量的打工仔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The shooting scene in Xuanpingli, Dahan, Xi&#39;an.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays are popular, but what are short plays? There are many descriptions in the industry: &quot;small local drama&quot;, &quot;mini program short drama&quot;, &quot;vertical screen drama&quot;, &quot;paid short drama&quot;, &quot;one-minute short drama&quot;... These words are put together to form the legendary &quot;short drama&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a video-based novel. You have to jump to WeChat, Douyin, and Kuaishou mini programs to watch it. The first few episodes are free, and then one yuan per episode, one minute per episode, and one episode is about 100 episodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, it is more expensive than watching a movie, and the box office is about the same as a movie. Industry insiders have speculated based on internal data released by Douyin that annual sales can exceed 30 billion. By comparison, the national movie box office in 2022 will only be 30.067 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past month, this kind of imagination has made capital excited, and stocks related to short dramas have experienced skyrocketing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 22, 2023, Tianwei Video and Chinese Online have both increased by more than 140% within the month, and Gravity Media, Guangbo Shares, Jiayun Technology, etc. have increased by more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The unfinished story of capital is that this business looks very &quot;rich&quot;, but in fact it is difficult to make money. Many industry insiders told Southern Weekend reporters that the profit rate will not exceed 10%. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;90% of the income is used to pay for advertising on Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat. They are the driving forces behind the short drama’s popularity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a short drama platform told a Southern Weekend reporter that the life of short dramas is given by traffic. It can make you rich overnight, or it can make you lose money overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said, just like e-commerce and merchants, &quot;If we don&#39;t support you to go online, your goods will sell hundreds of thousands a month, but if we support you, it will be tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An industry insider explained that according to Douyin’s traffic bidding mechanism, the cost of acquiring customers for short dramas is actually the result of competition with e-commerce, live streaming, games and other industries. Short dramas can acquire customers at a lower cost. Guest, this is the fundamental reason for its rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the ability of other industries to pay for traffic is weakening, and their ability to pay for traffic affects the future of short dramas. &quot;If live broadcasts become popular again next year, or those live broadcast rewards are at the top of the list, If guys are willing to pay for gifts again, they will steal more traffic with higher bids, and this will truly end the future of short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right now, the leaders in the industry are deploying their own apps in order to seize this period of time and keep users on their own platforms, thereby getting rid of dependence on traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late November, the wild growth of short dramas ushered in a new round of supervision, and the State Administration of Radio and Television once again launched a one-month special rectification work on online micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Major short video platforms have removed a large number of illegal micro-short dramas from the shelves and banned a large number of accounts that have illegally published micro-short dramas. The micro-short drama &quot;Black Lotus&#39; Handbook for Ascension&quot; produced by Mi Meng&#39;s team was removed from the shelves for &quot;exaggerating the bad values ​​of extreme revenge and using violence to counter violence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A short drama platform founder told Southern Weekend reporters that supervision had begun as early as November last year, and starting from March 2023, the platform will also require &quot;review before broadcasting.&quot; In the past year, &quot;Every episode will be reviewed. After review, you will be given clear instructions whether you have passed the review or not, such as too many intimate scenes, etc.&quot; The founder has also had one or two dramas abandoned due to too many revisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since a large number of companies in the industry have transformed from online novel platforms, most companies are equipped with &quot;self-reviewers&quot;. &quot;Overall, it does not have a big impact on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, supervision is a good thing. Now everyone is waiting for the &quot;Detailed Rules for the Creation, Production and Content Review of Online Micro-Short Dramas&quot; formulated by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. With it, the waste of investment caused by failure to review will be reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has launched a special rectification work on online micro-short dramas since late November 2022, and has removed from the shelves more than 25,000 short dramas, totaling 1.36 million episodes, and &quot;small-format dramas&quot; that contain illegal content. Programs&quot; 2420. From March 2023 to the present, more than 350,000 episodes (strips) of vulgar and harmful online mini-drama have been cleared, and 429 related &quot;mini programs&quot; and 2,988 accounts have been dealt with at different levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sorry, my voice is hoarse.&quot; Li Tao has to meet more than a dozen people every day, &quot;Chen Ou flew to Xi&#39;an yesterday, just to gather beautiful and beautiful people. As for Chen Ou, some state-backed companies also came to me to see if there was any possibility of cooperation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao is the founder of Fengxing Studio, which was originally a little-known film and television company. Previously, it mainly produced information flow advertisements and occasionally hosted weddings. I just started filming short plays last year when I couldn&#39;t get any work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin releases an advertising consumption list every week. Being on the list is considered a hit. In the past year, Li Tao filmed 14 short dramas, 9 of which were on the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially &quot;Wushuang&quot;, which was online for 24 hours, had a top-up of more than 50 million, and consumed 100 million ads in 8 days. It became this year&#39;s &quot;King of Dramas&quot; and Feng Xing became a &quot;hot star&quot; in the industry overnight. Fried chicken&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Tao was doing information flow advertising before, Xi&#39;an gathered more than half of the country&#39;s information flow advertising shooting team. After the short drama became popular, Xi&#39;an also transformed from an information flow advertising production base to a short drama center. Li Tao said, &quot;Sometimes, nine out of ten hits on the list come from Xi&#39;an.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao moved his office to Xi&#39;an Silk Road Center at the beginning of this year. There is a floor-to-ceiling window with a 270° panoramic view, overlooking the entire Chanba Ecological Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He regards this place as his blessed place. &quot;After moving here, the drama started to explode.&quot; More and more people came to him. He added a large coffee table, prepared a complete set of tea sets, and learned Acting like a southern businessman, he made Kung Fu tea for the guests. &quot; I want to feel happy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What people who come to drink tea are most concerned about is whether there is a password for the popular product? Li Tao&#39;s answer is &quot;book&quot;. A good script plus good production equals a big hit. A good script plus poor production equals a small hit. A bad script plus good production may not necessarily lead to a hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone re-filmed &quot;Wushuang&quot;, &quot;I just changed the character names, even the actors&#39; sentences were the same, and the result was still a hit, which shows that the script is really good,&quot; Li Tao said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He can read dozens of scripts a week and has developed a skill. &quot;After watching the first episode, I can guess the content of the next dozen episodes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these production teams, only by making hits can they have the opportunity to select good scripts. Only by selecting good scripts can they have the opportunity to make more hits. In order to get a good script, they are even willing to advance funding for filming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what kind of book will explode? &quot;This is a metaphysics.&quot; Li Tao is more confident about how to present a good script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I found the feeling of filming a short play was during the Spring Festival this year. At 3 a.m. on the sixth day of the lunar month, he checked the surveillance on his mobile phone and found that two shareholders were working overtime in the office to edit a film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengxing has six shareholders, all of whom have been friends for more than ten years. Li Tao felt uncomfortable, &quot;My brothers are working overtime, and I am celebrating the New Year at home. This is not going to work. I called the others and said, Let’s go to the company and work overtime together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around four in the morning, six people were editing a film in the company. The first episode was cut out to 3 minutes, but the pace was not fast enough and the impact was not strong enough. Everyone started arguing while talking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One side believed that the story should be complete and the main line should be clearly explained. The other side believed that the pace should be fast and the impact should be strong. No one could convince anyone. The final decision was that &quot;one person would cut one version and compare it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After comparing the two versions, the controversy disappeared. &quot;The audience will definitely know what this is about through two short sentences.&quot; Li Tao explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The core of the short play is The rhythm, if it is very long, it will be over if you feel relaxed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short dramas need to subvert many concepts in the past. The experience of the traditional film and television industry has become a burden for short dramas. Now, compared to mature actors in the traditional sense, Li Tao prefers actors with experience in short plays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Xi&#39;an has become a center for short dramas.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Luo Huanhuan&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Between being happy and not happy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wu Shuang&quot; tells the story of the male protagonist Chu Qing who helps his wife make a comeback. After the wife becomes famous, she dislikes her husband and wants to divorce. But she didn&#39;t know that Chu Qing&#39;s other identity was the supreme master of the Dragon Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama has never explained what the Dragon Palace is, why it has supreme power, why Chu Qing needs to conceal his identity, he has to prove his identity, why can&#39;t he just say it...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Tao’s experience is that there is no need to pursue logic and rationality. “Many themes are fictitious. You don’t need to worry about which dynasty it is, or trace whether it is from the Song Dynasty or the Tang Dynasty. It is just a costume drama, the Three Palaces and Six Dynasties.” The courtyard is a matter between the emperor and his concubines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the short drama is to control the audience&#39;s emotions and keep them in a state of &quot;between being happy and not yet happy&quot;. A small hook must be left at the end of each episode to make everyone want to read on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first and paid episodes are the key to a short drama. Li Tao&#39;s experience is that people must be retained in the first episode, and paid episodes are usually set before the biggest suspense is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On average, editors at Fengxing Studio edit 1.6 episodes of short dramas a day, including the first episode and paid episodes, which usually take 5 to 15 days. Editor Er Pang told Southern Weekend reporters that their requirement is that &quot;every frame must be meaningful&quot; and there is no way to add water to a short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao described that a good screenwriter can stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions, set a hook every time, and untie the hook reasonably, so that the suspense is still there and the audience will not lose patience. For example, the male protagonist has been suppressed for two episodes, and his emotions are almost suppressed. A small reversal is interspersed to stabilize the audience&#39;s emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of high-reversal, high-frequency, fast-paced plot is designed to stop the brain from thinking. &quot;As soon as you think about it, I fail,&quot; a short drama producer told a Southern Weekend reporter , &quot;When you think about it later, you will wonder whether the money was worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao introduced, &quot;We meet the needs of users in minutes,&quot; which is faster and more exciting. It is denser, has more reversals and fuller emotions. He believes that short plays have created an unprecedented form of film and television. &quot;I have never seen anything so dramatic in the history of film. No matter how good the film is, it cannot be cut into one minute.&quot; Sell ​​by the minute.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the professional shooting team in Hengdian, these &quot;people on the margins of the film and television industry&quot; in Xi&#39;an have an advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They once visited Hengdian for inspection and found that they still use traditional film and television techniques to shoot short dramas. The sound and pictures are recorded separately, the picture quality is 4K, and large machines are used to shoot on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production team in Xi&#39;an can sometimes shoot a 100-minute drama in four days. In order to improve efficiency, the picture and sound are recorded at the same time. The picture quality is 2K. All shooting machines are handheld and no large machines are used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some traditional film and television people will also come to Li Tao to communicate. He obviously feels that, &quot;From the other side&#39;s heart, they don&#39;t like short dramas, and they feel that they are doing big dramas. But this does not exist Many big teams looked down on dimensionality reduction at first, but then they wanted to do it but found that they couldn&#39;t do it. This is a very common phenomenon in short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year, this office that brought good luck to Li Tao was already overcrowded. On the day of the interview with Southern Weekend reporters, Li Tao had just found a new office, &quot;more than a thousand square meters.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The protagonist is either a security guard or a delivery person”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Wang Xiaoshu started filming short plays in 2021, no one was optimistic about the short plays. “The first batch of people who filmed short plays , taking me as an example, they may all be losers.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, he founded Jia Shu Technology, a free novel platform. &quot;The business will not close, but it is not very good either.&quot; Seeing the story experts on Kuaishou, he felt that it was very similar to online novels. &quot;If we produce novels such as Son-in-law and God of War, which we are good at, there should be a market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2021, he filmed his first short drama &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot;. He didn&#39;t use a film camera, just a camera. &quot;It&#39;s a bit too much to call it a drama. You can&#39;t imagine how crude it is.&quot; The budget was 30,000 yuan to shoot for 100 minutes. &quot;I didn&#39;t even accept weddings, saying it was too cheap.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He remembered that, including Jia Shu Technology, there were maybe four short drama companies at that time. &quot;The protagonist of the short play is either a security guard or a food delivery guy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found a Kuaishou expert in Tongnan, Chongqing. &quot;In Tongnan, one led one by one, and there were several teams specializing in photographing security guards. Their names were all very crude, and they were called &#39;shooting jokes&#39;.&quot; &#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to film a story, Wang Xiaoshu flew from Shanghai to Chongqing Jiangbei Airport, then took a three-hour bus ride, and finally met his heroine in a remote town - a story with millions of fans. Blogger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This business is also very magical to me, and I don’t know how to shoot it.” Wang Xiaoshu asked the expert to shoot the popular content on Kuaishou again. “At that time, I can’t say that I was polishing it. , I can only say that in order to extend the time, enrich the dialogue, and add a bit of conflict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose is to leave space for recharging. &quot;Users have to watch about 10 minutes before paying, and the whole show is only 30 minutes. It feels bad to pay. For fifty, sixty, seventy or eighty episodes, users The recharge space will be larger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything is very primitive, there are no actors, &quot;her grandfather, grandmother, and cousin came to help&quot;, and the venue did not cost any money, &quot;just in front of a factory that has stopped production.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was very hot in Chongqing in July, so I had to take a break after taking a photo. Wang Xiaoshu squatted in front of the factory with an umbrella and finished the photoshoot in four days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party also suspected that he was a liar and asked him to pay the money in one lump sum. The reason was: &quot;A similar story has been published on Kuaishou. If you shoot it again, will anyone see it?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu actually had no idea, &quot;it was too shoddy&quot;, but he soon discovered that he was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Middle-aged and elderly people love to watch it&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He bought 100,000 yuan of traffic for &quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; on the WeChat public account, and then played it on the mini program after on-demand viewing. The reason why we choose mini programs is that it is much easier than promoting apps. After all, the cost for users to download and install is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platform charges a channel fee from the recharge he withdraws. The channel fee for the WeChat mini program has risen to 5-8 yuan per 100 yuan, while Douyin only costs 1-2 yuan, but WeChat is still the big one. &quot;Short drama&quot; The audience is more accustomed to using WeChat to pay, and Douyin needs to be redirected, which will create an additional payment obstacle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot;The Strongest Female Security Guard&quot; has returned about 100,000 in almost 20 days,&quot; which gave Wang Xiaoshu a premonition that this model could work. &quot;There are still people watching this crude production, so let&#39;s make it better. You can get your money back.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short dramas that became popular at first were all security dramas, and their audience was also summarized as the &quot;three guarantees&quot; personnel, &quot;security guards, cleaners, and nannies.&quot; However, Wang Xiaoshu discovered through the backstage that these people were not necessarily low-income groups. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After accumulating tens of millions of fans, Wang Xiaoshu made user portraits and found that half of them were over 45 years old. “Most people may think that when people get older, they stop reading. We found that when people get older, It’s very impressive to see.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting his business for more than four years, Wang Xiaoshu interacts with this group of people every day. He feels that the entertainment life of middle-aged and elderly people is very lacking. &quot;Young people have many activities and do not need to consume online. These dramas are not cheap. An episode costs about 60 cents, and 100 minutes costs 60 yuan. Middle-aged and elderly people have both money and leisure.&quot; Moreover, young people are very familiar with the Internet. &quot;You can find pirated copies if you search casually, and it is difficult to pay for short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entry threshold for short plays is also very low. &quot;No need to think, no need to read, no need to think, everything is placed in front of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It completely follows the classification system of online articles, which is divided into male channels and female channels according to the gender of the audience. The consumption psychology of the two groups is also different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female video drama consumers are all grandmothers or mothers, and the most popular themes are sadomasochism and sweet pets. Wang Xiaoshu felt that they were &quot;still very eager and longing for love.&quot; Their marriage may have been like this. They had never been in love when they were young, and they longed to be cared for. &quot;It should be said that people need to be loved throughout their lives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More men watch short dramas than women, and the male dramas dominate. God of War is the most popular theme, followed by son-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The self-media &quot;Short Drama Study Room&quot; found based on the statistics of the streaming list released by Douyin that among the popular short dramas from January to July 2023, the theme of God of War accounted for 32.98%, ranking second. It is a female video drama with a sadomasochistic theme, accounting for only 9.42%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;God of War&quot; refers to a person with a powerful identity who hides his identity and transforms into a small person. He is bullied by the villain and finally reveals his identity to fight back against the opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu said that security guards or couriers will make the audience feel more involved. &quot;In reality, these groups are not respected, but in dreams they are very powerful and have status.&quot; It empathizes with the suppression and is released from the protagonist&#39;s counterattack. &quot;Dignity is something that many men lack on a daily basis.&quot; Wang Xiaoshu believes that short dramas can satisfy them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Short plays are used to create dreams. What does a dream look like? The dream is when he threatens you with &#39;bad reviews&#39;, and you suddenly laugh and say, &#39;Actually, I am a rich second generation, I will Being a delivery boy is just about experiencing life, but has it suddenly changed?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wushuang&quot; combines the elements of God of War and son-in-law. &quot;The male protagonist conceals his identity and becomes the son-in-law, not because he is not strong enough. It&#39;s because I like that woman, and her strong identity will always be made public.&quot; Li Tao feels, &quot;People who are suppressed by their wives or mother-in-law in life can be greatly released here.&quot; &lt;p>; com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/30/e2488df4d8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260288&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wushuang&quot;, online for 24 hours recharge With over 50 million, he became this year’s “King of Dramas”. Picture source: Video screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unexpectedly small profits&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After March 2022, Wang Xiaoshu suddenly discovered that the entire industry began to skyrocket. “In two or three months, the company’s revenue scale went from several to One million suddenly increased to tens of millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin and WeChat became interoperable at the end of 2021, and short dramas became the beneficiaries. Wang Xiaoshu said that in the past, when buying traffic from official accounts, 40% might be recovered on the first day. After Douyin allowed jumping to the WeChat mini program, “the recovery on the same day was 100%.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin also invited short drama platforms to stream in March 2022 (that is, merchants pay to increase traffic), which brought a huge turnaround to the industry. At its peak, Douyin’s short dramas invested in Stream consumption is 80 million a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaoshu believes that the first year of short dramas is 2021. In June of that year, the WeChat ecosystem opened up short dramas for streaming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there had been a large number of micro-short plays before that. For example, Tencent Video’s “Please! &quot;Don&#39;t Spoil Me&quot;, the amount of the split account in the third season reached 32.49 million yuan, and it is known as the &quot;King of Drama&quot; in the split account short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these short plays are not paid short plays. Their commercial realization relies on platform subsidies, and the bulk of the investment is still production fees. &quot;please! The production cost of &quot;Don&#39;t Spoil Me&quot; is as high as 20 million, and the advertising cost is only a few million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, these short dramas still follow the business model of long videos. The broadcast platform splits the bill with the producer based on the click rate of 1,000 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paid short drama adopts the business model of online novels. The monetization path is for users to pay for on-demand viewing, but more than 90% of the income must be used to pay advertising fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This business model is completely rooted in the CPS model of online novels, that is, the copyright owner opens the promotion link to distributors, and the distributors create secondary creations of the materials and publish them through Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat official accounts. Attract users to recharge, and both parties will split accounts according to the recharge amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the top short drama companies have been in the novel business before, such as Chinese Online, Dianzhong, Peanuts, etc., all have their own online distribution systems. They are the core of the industry, the copyright holders, and hold the most important resource - the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its upstream is connected to producers such as Fengxing Studio. The copyright owner will give the other party some guaranteed fees. The part of the shooting cost that exceeds the guarantee must be borne by the producer himself, and the profit will be divided in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its downstream is the distribution distributor. The copyright owner provides technology and content and takes 15% from the recharge. There are also short drama companies that do their own distribution. Jiuzhou Culture is a company that is famous for its castings, with a casting team of 300 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Distribution is the lowest level of the short drama industry, and it is also the most mysterious and low-key group of people. Mou Changqing is very familiar with several leading short drama platforms. He is the founder of the short drama community &quot;28 Push&quot;. The main members of this community are the platforms, distributors and producers of short dramas. , script side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Most of the well-established distributors keep a low profile and never show off their cakes because they are afraid of being poached.&quot; When he saw some media reports claiming that the short play was created by a team of e-commerce brushing orders, he believed this was inconsistent with the facts. “The mainstream short drama platforms I know of include their main distributors, and none of them used to do e-commerce brushing orders. of&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Distribution is a resource-hungry industry. &quot;Most of the good distribution is due to a good relationship with the platform.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rate of return on traffic refers to the money that users recharge after buying traffic. Mou Changqing said, &quot;If the information provider invests in streaming, if it is a private e-commerce company, it would be good if it can repay 60% to 80% of the cost on the same day, because the private sector relies on follow-up to slowly repay the cost. If the live broadcast does not repay the cost on the same day, it will lose money. &quot;The return on investment must reach 150% to make money. In comparison, short dramas can reach 130% if done well.&quot; Mou Changqing said that short dramas are also one of the few projects that can return the money on the same day. Many powerful distribution companies They all chose to do short plays, &quot;thinking they can grab this piece of cake.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min, the founder of &quot;Short Drama Expert&quot;, has also done short drama distribution business. He and Mou Changqing have different views. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the return rate of a short drama must reach 120%. It&#39;s not easy. &quot;A drama that can achieve such a rate of return can be regarded as a &#39;magic drama&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is actually very difficult to make money from short drama streaming. Yan Min said, &quot;As long as the return rate exceeds 105%, I will continue to invest. 100 yuan of advertising, 105 yuan of recharge, and 5 yuan paid to Tencent , labor is actually a loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that the core of investment is to start with volume. If you recharge 100 million yuan, the profit rate is only 1%, and you can still make 1 million yuan. There is no minimum amount. After recharging 100,000 yuan, the profit margin is 10%, and the profit is only 10,000 yuan, which is still a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyin’s streaming system can set the rate of return. For example, if you invest 100,000 first, the return rate will be 110%. Only if the user recharges 110,000 will the next round of investment be triggered. Distributors will expand their scale as much as possible without losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min said that distribution is an industry with high labor costs and thin profit margins. “For a small team of fifty or sixty pitchers, no one will care about you at all. If you have more than 200 pitchers, profitable&quot;. In the entire industry chain, distributors have the lowest threshold and the thinnest profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Content is king in short plays, and the copyright owner has the highest threshold, and they are the main ones who can make money. They can only provide technology and content and let distributors bear the cost of distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The producers also bear risks. Wang Xiaoshu said, &quot;To shoot 30 dramas a month, the content cost is 10 million. If the box office is not 100 million, wouldn&#39;t it be a loss? This does not include the platform&#39;s own manpower expenses and other expenses, but only the content cost. Most platforms still lose money. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The real winner is only the traffic side&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Short dramas are already a red ocean. Wang Xiaoshu calculated an account. According to the daily consumption calculations previously announced by Douyin, the monthly short drama sales It’s about 2 billion, corresponding to about 700 new dramas. The production cost of a drama is about 300,000 yuan, and the average revenue per unit is 3 million yuan, which means it is just profitable. In fact, the hits took most of the share, and most of the short plays were less than 3 million, which means they lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mou Changqing said, &quot;Many media think that if you recharge 30 million, you can earn 30 million. If the return rate is set to 110%, the gross profit will be only 3 million.&quot; After deducting various costs, The profit is only 1 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Min believes that &quot;those people deliberately make it so easy, just to cut leeks and let others invest.&quot; Some bosses in traditional industries mistakenly believe that investing hundreds of thousands can generate tens of millions in income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real winner in the short drama industry is only the traffic side. Most of the revenue goes to Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat, leaving only about 10% of the industry’s profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Producers generally need to pay for filming. &quot;I have paid a little too hard recently, and now I am a little scared.&quot; Li Qiang, the boss of Xi&#39;an Gewu Qianfan, told Southern Weekend reporters that he has already paid for a movie. The skit has more than 1 million posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the guaranteed production fee given by the copyright owner, the purpose of their payment is to improve the quality. &quot;It makes no sense for me to earn your 108,000 or 80,000 yuan production fee. What I want is to split the account,&quot; he asked. Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;50,000 or 5 million, which one do you want?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has been in the short drama circle for less than half a year. This is the first short drama he has invested in. &quot;I see this. &quot;Definitely win&quot;, if you can&#39;t win, it&#39;s just paying for your hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, Li Tao is more cautious than the newcomers, &quot;I am not willing to shoot a short drama with a production cost of more than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.&quot; He made some calculations, &quot;If you shoot a drama with more than 300,000 yuan, you can make a profit by recharging it to 3 million. For 600,000, you need to recharge 7 to 8 million to make a profit. How many dramas can have a recharge of tens of millions?&quot; What?&quot; He hopes to make some more stable money, &quot;I can make 200,000 yuan per movie, and I can do 50 movies a year, and I will still make a good profit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Nan, the boss of Xi’an Muniu Liuma Film and Television, has released three hit movies. “Not even the third one on the list, but the first and second ones.” However, he told Southern Weekend reporters that he is in a difficult situation now. The capital chain is broken, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can survive until next month.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film or online drama industry, teams are often formed temporarily, but short drama production companies need assembly line production. Chen Nan has four shooting teams with more than 40 people. Not counting rent, &quot;each The monthly salary is two to three hundred thousand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tao said frankly, &quot;I can responsibly say that less than 10% of people in this industry can actually make money, and 90% are losing money.&quot; He used himself as an example. They filmed nine After a short play, the first hit came out, &quot;But everyone only saw &#39;wolf eating meat&#39;, not &#39;wolf being beaten&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Chen Ou announced that he was actively watching short dramas. A month later, he told Southern Weekend reporters that he was &quot;still in the learning and research stage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 26, the famous Hong Kong director Wang Jing appeared at the opening ceremony of a short drama. This may be the first opening ceremony held by the short drama industry. You know, vertical screen short dramas Cast and crew names never appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[监察官等级首次确定工作全面完成]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261626]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of mid-November, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps City For the first time, the work of determining the grade of county-level supervisors has been completed. This marks the successful conclusion of the first determination of the national supervisory officer level, which will be carried out since 2022. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Doing a good job in determining the level of supervisors is an important measure to deepen the reform of the national supervision system. It is a practical need to build a high-quality professional discipline inspection and supervision iron army. It is also important for building supervision with Chinese characteristics. It is of great significance to strengthen the official system, uphold and improve the party and state supervision system, and promote the high-quality development of disciplinary inspection and supervision work. Under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission took the lead in carrying out the work from top to bottom and level by level. Local party committees, disciplinary inspection commissions and supervisory commissions resolutely shouldered their political responsibilities and strictly followed the &quot;Procurators Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and &quot;Measures for the Management of Supervisory Officer Levels (Trial)&quot; and other relevant regulations to steadily and orderly advance the work of determining the level of supervisors for the first time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Each provincial-level Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Committee took the initiative to report to the party committee at the same level and put forward suggestions for overall planning and promotion plans. The main leaders of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee presided over two meetings to study the determination of the level of supervisors; the Deep Reform Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee will promote the determination of the level of supervisors into annual work points and monitor the whole process; the main leaders of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee issued instructions twice, requiring careful attention Organize and implement meticulously. Under the leadership of party committees at the same level, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jilin, Jiangxi and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps studied and issued work guidance opinions, detailing the scope of personnel, approval procedures, disciplinary requirements, etc. The Guangdong production and hair production work template provides key reminders on links or matters prone to errors; Hainan establishes a problem ledger to study and solve existing problems one by one to ensure accurate grasp of policies, standard work procedures, and strict disciplinary requirements. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Considering the determination of the level of supervisors as an important task, the disciplinary inspection and supervision agencies at all levels conscientiously organize and implement it and advance it prudently and steadily. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission issued 2 questions and answers on the first determination of supervisory officer levels, carefully answered inquiries from various places, promptly summarized and published the experience and practices of the completed provinces, and promoted exchanges and mutual learning. Provincial Discipline Inspection Commissions and Supervisory Committees, based on actual conditions, generally adopt methods such as issuing question and answer sessions, holding special training courses, and carrying out policy presentations to strengthen guidance and standardize procedures. The Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Tianjin, Yunnan, Chongqing, Anhui and other places have established a working mechanism in which the main responsible comrades take the lead, the leaders in charge are responsible, the organizational departments organize the implementation, and the functional departments closely cooperate, and set up special work teams , take the initiative to strengthen communication and docking with the Party Committee Organization Department, institutional establishment and other departments, and work together to study and solve problems. Guizhou has selected some municipal (state) Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions to conduct field surveys to study and solve existing difficult problems; Qinghai has organized special dispatch meetings according to different time nodes; since November, Ningxia has insisted on &quot;daily reporting&quot; to solve policy confusion encountered and process control and other issues; Shanxi summarizes the progress of the province&#39;s work every month, provides &quot;point-to-point&quot; supervision and guidance for slow progress, and ensures that the work determined by the inspector for the first time is advanced in layers and carried out in an orderly manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Insist on putting political standards first, strictly standardize conditions, and strictly review and control. Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committees at all levels strictly compare the conditions for serving as supervisors, conduct a comprehensive survey of institutions, personnel, establishment, etc., comprehensively consider the performance of cadres&#39; moral integrity, job grades, etc., and scientifically and rationally determine grades in accordance with regulations and laws. Together with organizations, public security, economic and credit and other units, we will review the cadres’ academic qualifications, annual assessments, party conduct and clean government, credit reports, spouses and children’s immigration abroad (overseas), etc., and will not confirm those who do not meet the conditions. At the same time, we actively explain policies, provide ideological guidance, and take the initiative to have heart-to-heart conversations with cadres to ensure the ideological stability of the team. Fujian will review and judge one by one the establishment status, job rank, length of service, assessment rewards and punishments, academic qualifications, personal matters, party style and integrity of the cadres to be included in the determined scope; Tibet will establish accounts and list specific lists according to the cadre management authority. Check carefully and confirm again and again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Taking the opportunity of carrying out the first determination work, efforts will be made to promote the construction of a team of high-quality professional inspectors. Constitutional oaths, targeted training, knowledge competitions and other forms are commonly used in various places to educate and guide cadres to faithfully perform their legal duties and obligations, continuously enhance the awareness of the rule of law, procedures and evidence, and improve the level of standardization, rule of law and formalization. Combining thematic education and educational rectification, we should deepen the internalization and transformation of the party&#39;s innovative theories, highlight practical training and practical exercises, and vigorously improve the political quality and disciplinary and legal literacy of inspectors. Beijing compiled the &quot;Handbook of What Inspections and Supervisors Should Know and Should Meet&quot; and made public examinations a necessary process for determining the level of inspectors; Guangxi organized knowledge tests on party discipline and laws and regulations; Xinjiang relied on the online learning platform of the discipline inspection and supervision system to organize learning for disciplinary inspection and supervision cadres Relevant policies: Hunan guided 14 cities and states to hold ombudsman constitutional oath ceremonies to enhance the sense of professional responsibility and honor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“In the next step, we will guide all localities to carry out the regular determination and promotion of the level of inspectors in accordance with the provisions of the Inspectors Law and the Measures for the Administration of Levels of Inspectors.” Central Commission for Discipline Inspection National Relevant comrades from the Organization Department of the Supervisory Committee said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以自伤自残来控制对方也是家暴：应确认成年人自负其责原则丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261570]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme Court released a number of typical cases against domestic violence. One of the cases was: Li repeatedly threatened his wife Wang by jumping off a building and drinking pesticide in front of her at her workplace. In order to ensure personal safety, Wang applied to the court for a personal safety protection order. The court held that: Li&#39;s self-injury behavior would cause Wang to feel nervous and fearful, which was a mental violation. Wang&#39;s application met the legal conditions for a personal safety protection order. Ruling: Li is prohibited from committing domestic violence against Wang; Li is prohibited from harassing, stalking, and threatening Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The typical significance of this case is expressed as: &quot;The harm of mental violence is not less than the harm of physical violence. In this case, although the respondent did not commit any acts such as beating or mutilation, the applicant The person causes physical injury, but his self-injury and self-mutilation behavior will definitely make the applicant feel nervous and fearful, causing the applicant to be mentally unstable and act according to the applicant&#39;s will. This behavior is mental violence.&quot; &quot;Clearly adopted The behavior of harming oneself in order to control the other party is also considered domestic violence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, this case should establish the following rules: Either one of the spouses will cry, make trouble, and hang themselves, or threaten the other party to commit suicide. Injuring yourself to require the other party to meet your specific requirements (whether the request is reasonable or not) is an act of mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the other party, so the other party will receive judicial relief. Of course, it is necessary to ensure that men and women enjoy equal judicial protection, that new rules apply to both men and women, and that the principles of equal rights for men and women and equal rights and responsibilities for each party are respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, this case has received a lot of concern, discussion and questioning. It is necessary to ask questions: The man threatens the woman by jumping off a building or going to her workplace to drink pesticides. What is the content of the threat? The basic facts of the case only state that &quot;both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; The content of the dispute and the positions of both parties are crucial to determining who is right and wrong. From the &quot;frequent disputes&quot; between the two parties to the &quot;self-injury&quot; of the man, the conflict has an escalation process. How is this escalation completed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of this case is: &quot;Wang&#39;s application for a personal safety protection order case - threatening others through self-injury and self-harm is domestic violence&quot;, and the set keywords are &quot;self-injury, self-harm, mental control&quot;. The logical chain from self-injury to mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence is: one party says &quot;If you don&#39;t agree to my request and don&#39;t act according to my will, I will hurt myself&quot; + this means that the other party &quot; Produce tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot;not be free mentally.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, there are two points that may deserve further discussion. First, according to this logical chain, many different types of &quot;verbal violence&quot; by one party should also be recognized as mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence, because they can also cause the other party to &quot;generate tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot; The spirit is not free.&quot; For example, one party devalues ​​the personality, dignity and achievements of the other party through habitual and persistent complaints or derogatory and insulting remarks, in order to lower the other party&#39;s self-evaluation and thereby better manipulate the other party; or one party Make ridiculous or harsh demands, make exaggerated or false accusations against the other party, force the other party to give up their rights and self-esteem, and hand over control of their property and income, in order to control the other party mentally and financially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the above case, some netizens asked: &quot;Both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; So during the dispute, did the woman commit &quot;verbal violence&quot; or mental violence against the man? If the man unilaterally and continuously engages in mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the woman through self-mutilation, why not file for divorce? In current judicial practice, domestic violence is a very sufficient cause for divorce. From the above details, it is difficult to see the necessity of maintaining this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this we might as well extend our thinking: In a relationship between a lover or a couple, if one party injures himself or herself, does the other party need to be held responsible for this? The answer is self-explanatory. Because self-injury persons, as persons with full capacity for civil conduct and adults of sound mind, should bear their own responsibility and bear all the consequences of their actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a court in Inner Mongolia decided a case, which caused huge controversy. The prosecutor alleged: On September 28, 2020, E Moumou drove his wife Chao Moumou to the Tongug Nur Pastoral Area of ​​Bayanhot Town to visit their daughter in a car. The two had a quarrel and dispute over whether they needed to go to the pastoral area to visit their daughter. While the vehicle was driving, Chao suddenly opened the rear door of the vehicle and jumped out of the vehicle. He died of severe brain injury after landing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports are more specific: The man drove his wife to see their 3-year-old daughter. The two of them kept quarreling over the issue of &quot;eating hot pot&quot; on the way... The wife said that she just wanted to eat hot pot now and didn&#39;t want to see the children. The man insisted on seeing the child first. When the wife saw that her husband had no intention of turning the car around to take her to eat hot pot, she became angry and made an unexpected move: she opened the door and jumped out of the car while the car was still running. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the court held that the man&#39;s &quot;overconfidence&quot; caused the death of one person, constituting the crime of negligent death, and sentenced the man to two years in prison and three years of probation. The problem is that the woman did not give any warning before jumping out of the car. According to the rules and legal principles established by the above-mentioned typical cases of the Supreme Court, jumping from a car is like jumping off a building or taking pesticides. It is an act of self-harm. The person should also know the consequences of his actions, and there is no reason to hold the other party responsible. Article 66 of the Road Traffic Safety Law also stipulates: Passengers... shall not act in a manner that affects the driver&#39;s safe driving. It is impossible to establish such rules and legal principles: In the relationship between husband and wife, if one party harms himself or threatens the other party to obey, if he does not die, he will exercise mental control/mental violence/domestic violence on the other party. If he dies, it will be the other way around, and the other party will be responsible. criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the only correct rule is that adults and no one else should be held responsible for their actions. To &quot;strive to make the people feel fairness and justice in every judicial case&quot;, the rules and legal principles presented in each case in judicial practice should be reasonable, consistent and systematic, so that the people can have stable expectations and Sense of fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 18:25:17 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“并案处理”应被精细化对待丨法眼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261628]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/LAZyzv4x2zmzMca5us0hEL7XM29DdGTculyOSKr5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/LAZyzv4x2zmzMca5us0hEL7XM29DdGTculy OSKr5. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260149&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the &quot;anti-gang and evil&quot; campaign, cases often appear to be merged. The picture shows that on October 28, 2019, the public security organs of Wuhu City, Anhui Province held an exhibition of the results of the special struggle against gangs and evil. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In criminal cases, a case often goes through its own set of proceedings alone. However, under special circumstances, &quot;consolidated case processing&quot; will also occur, that is, multiple cases will be merged together for processing. According to the relevant provisions of our country, for cases in which the same person commits multiple crimes, joint crimes, or related crimes, the public security organs, people&#39;s procuratorates, and people&#39;s courts can handle the cases together. The original intention of consolidating cases is to allow judicial staff to handle cases more efficiently, and it has produced good results in practice. For example, it can better discover the truth, ensure consistency in sentencing, and generally improve the efficiency of litigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in anti-gang and anti-telecommunication fraud cases, there have been huge cases involving hundreds of parties and spanning several months. At this time, some merged cases have not been handled as expected. Although it produces good results, it exposes some new problems that require urgent attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unrefined systems and practices&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the whole, my country’s handling of consolidated cases lacks clear provisions in the Criminal Procedure Law, and at the same time, the provisions on judicial interpretation are at a low level. Defects such as overly general regulations and overly general provisions make the system not only less authoritative in judicial practice, but also less operable. This will inevitably affect the rights and interests of the parties after the case is merged, the choice of procedures, and the quality and duration of case handling. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the rights of the parties concerned are not adequately protected. Case-handling agencies such as the police, prosecutors, and courts have greater decision-making power over whether and how to consolidate cases. Sometimes, some case-handling agencies will bring their own case-handling needs into decision-making. Whether and how cases can be consolidated often depends on whether it can make handling the case more convenient, and whether it will affect the rights of the parties is rarely considered. This results in that in practice, it is sometimes difficult for the same party in the same case to realize the rights that he should have had when the case was not consolidated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in some combined cases, evidence will be used universally, and some evidence that was originally used only in one case will be used in another case. Some parties often make innocent confessions in order to get rid of the accusations against themselves, but these confessions may contain information that proves the guilt of others. In the absence of consolidated cases, once the defendant obtains a not guilty verdict, he is only a witness in other people&#39;s cases. At this time, he could refuse to appear in court to accuse other defendants due to immunity from testifying by relatives or other reasons. However, when the cases are combined, he essentially has the identity of the defendant in both cases, and the evidence proving the guilt of others in the innocent confession can be used in the entire case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that the parties’ right to choose procedures is unduly affected. With the continuous development of consultative criminal justice, our country&#39;s criminal proceedings have given parties the right to make voluntary choices in some special procedures. When certain conditions are met, the parties can choose whether to apply summary procedures and expedited adjudication procedures, and can also make a judgment on whether to appeal. However, these options will be affected when cases are consolidated. According to my country&#39;s current litigation rules, the application of these two procedural diversion mechanisms must obtain the consent of all defendants. When there are differences of opinion between defendants, some defendants who wish to have a trial as soon as possible may not be able to use summary procedures or expedited adjudication procedures. Similarly, the second instance procedure in my country&#39;s criminal proceedings also stipulates that in cases of joint crime, as long as some defendants appeal, the entire case must be reviewed and handled together. A defendant who has no intention of appealing will be forced to enter the second instance procedure because other defendants file a second instance. For these defendants who had no intention of appealing, they could have obtained an effective judgment immediately after the first instance, but the mandatory second instance procedure extended the time they had to wait for the judgment. During this time, they suffer from the uncertainty of the final verdict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, merging cases without an upper limit will affect the quality of case handling. In practice, sometimes large cases involving dozens or even hundreds of defendants will be consolidated. Compared with splitting into multiple cases, giant cases require coordination among more parties and take up more time in preparation and trial procedures. Case handlers have to deal with the process of determining the facts and convicting and sentencing each person being prosecuted. The balance also requires more energy than ordinary cases, and improper handling will have a negative impact on the quality of case handling and the fairness of the results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, it may delay the handling of the case. The Criminal Procedure Law does not clearly stipulate the calculation of the time limit after the merger of cases, and the judicial interpretation only provides principled provisions on the time limit for joint trials, requiring that cases that &quot;may cause excessive delay in trial&quot; should avoid joint trials. But in fact, there is no operational standard for what constitutes “excessive delay.” Some case-handling agencies are not efficient in their work and are more willing to delay the litigation time. They will use cases with long remaining periods as the basis for the deadlines of newly merged cases. This leads to the fact that when the deadline for handling previously accepted cases is approaching, some case handlers will use newly incorporated cases as a reason to extend the deadline. As a result, merging cases has become a means for some investigators to extend the time of handling cases. It is a pity that the current system for combining cases has not yet identified and standardized this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Refined systems promote refined practices&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order for merger processing to better fulfill its original value and intention, it needs to be improved within the existing institutional framework. We believe that the handling of combined cases should focus more on the protection of the rights of the parties. Large cases need to be split reasonably, the time limit for handling the case should be strictly limited, and the parties should be given more room for procedural choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must pay attention to the protection of the rights of the parties. Our country&#39;s merger of cases is dominated by public power, and some unreasonable phenomena have appeared in the protection of the rights of the parties. In order to change this situation, efforts need to be made from two aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that the parties concerned enjoy the same rights when the case is consolidated as when the case is not consolidated. The International Criminal Court&#39;s &quot;Rules of Procedure and Evidence&quot; stipulate that for cases tried jointly, the parties should enjoy the same rights as if they were tried separately. Inspired by this, it is necessary for our country to emphasize in the litigation rules that regardless of whether the cases are merged or not, the parties have the same rights and treatment in the litigation - the rights enjoyed by the parties in the division of cases cannot be limited because of the merger of cases. reduce. Regardless of whether cases are merged or divided, and no matter what other purposes are pursued, the rights of the parties to a fair trial need to be protected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, it is necessary to establish the parties’ right to apply and improve the parties’ right to object. In terms of the right to apply, in addition to being decided by the public authority, case consolidation can also be initiated upon application by the parties. This can allow the parties’ demands to be taken more seriously during the merger process. In terms of the right to object, we must take seriously the objections raised by the parties to the merger procedure and protect these objections from being expressed smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the parties need to be given more choices. In criminal proceedings, the lengthy proceedings themselves are a kind of torment and a kind of punishment. In order to minimize the burden of litigation, parties should be able to enjoy the same right to choose whether to merge cases or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, in the pre-trial conference system, the right of the person being pursued to choose when combining cases should be emphasized. Since the actual trial has not yet entered, pre-trial conferences can effectively resolve and prevent some procedural issues. However, the relevant judicial interpretations in our country do not emphasize that &quot;whether there are objections to the merger and division of cases&quot; is something that can be discussed during the pre-trial conference stage. This situation should be added to the relevant provisions of the pre-trial conference to expressly indicate the pre-trial conference This stage allows the parties involved in the case consolidation to express their opinions on the case consolidation. If the person being pursued cannot reach an agreement between the summary procedure, the expedited procedure and the ordinary procedure, it is necessary to discuss and consider the possibility of dividing the case at the pre-trial conference stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to explore a divisible system for the second instance of combined cases. In our country, not all criminal cases are indivisible at the second instance stage. The Supreme People&#39;s Court has stipulated in its judicial interpretation that in cases with multiple defendants, the criminal facts of some defendants are unclear, the evidence is insufficient, or there are new criminal facts that need to be prosecuted, and the relevant crimes are not related to other co-defendants. , the people&#39;s court of second instance may handle these defendants separately based on the circumstances of the case. The second-instance rules for case consolidation can refer to this provision. When special circumstances similar to this provision occur during the case-consolidation process, unrelated defendants can also be separated in the second-instance procedure to avoid &quot;partial appeal, full appeal&quot;. case review” thereby depriving the parties of their right to appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, giant cases must be split up reasonably. When the handling costs of giant cases exceed a certain limit, it may consume too much judicial resources and have a negative impact on the fairness and efficiency of judicial decisions. To this end, two steps can be taken to promote the reasonable division of my country&#39;s giant cases from concept to technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first step is to clearly establish the awareness of rational division of large cases. Article 136 of the International Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence stipulates that when combining cases has a greater negative impact on the fairness of the case than dividing the cases, even if they are jointly accused, they need to be tried separately. This concept of division of cases can be transplanted in our country&#39;s judicial practice. The highest judicial authority can use guiding cases or typical cases to encourage localities to conduct pilot trials of reasonable division of giant cases under the guidance of the principles of fairness, efficiency and proportionality, and gradually establish the relationship between the case-handling agencies and case-handling personnel. Awareness of reasonable division of cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to improve the provisions on the reasonable division of cases system in relevant judicial interpretations based on the aforementioned work. The current judicial interpretations related to case consolidation do not stipulate whether and how cases that are no longer suitable for consolidation as the litigation activities of this department advance. Once case handlers decide to combine cases, even if unreasonably large cases arise, they rarely make adjustments to the division of cases. Therefore, relevant judicial interpretations need to be supplemented, requiring the case-handling agencies to still handle separate cases as necessary after merging the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the time limit for handling the combined cases must be limited. In order to prevent the &quot;borrowing period&quot; of case handling, it should be prohibited to extend the case handling period by merging cases. That is to say, merging cases will not automatically lead to the extension of the case handling period. When the case handling period is insufficient, the case handling agency should apply for a legitimate extension for approval. procedures to extend the deadline for handling the case. At the same time, it is necessary to make it clear in the case-handling responsibility system that delaying litigation in the name of merging cases is an unreasonable way of handling cases, and case-handling personnel must bear corresponding case-handling responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author Liu Renwen is a researcher at the Institute of Law, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Qin Han is a lecturer at the Law School of Zhejiang University of Technology)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“基辛格不会有第二个，但基辛格的担忧却会不断重复”丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 15:11:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to Xinhua News Agency and other media reports, on November 29, 2023 local time, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissing Gerard died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just two months ago, Kissinger was still mediating the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, local time, according to the &quot;Ukrainian Pravda&quot; report, Ukrainian President Zelensky met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger during his visit to the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Andrei Yermak, director of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, posted the above news on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Kissinger visited China in July and also attended the Bund Financial Summit online on September 23. The Southern Weekend has launched the &quot;Confusion of Russia and Ukraine, Centennial Kissinger&#39;s achievements and controversy | Think Tank Viewpoint&quot;, which is now pushed to show commemoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Why is Kissinger still active &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Today the world is facing huge risks, which is different from all risks after the Cold War. The previous risks, whether they were sold in Afghanistan or Iraq, have occurred between the world&#39;s great powers and small and medium -sized countries, and the possibility of risk upgrades is not much. This time, it became a counterpart between the world&#39;s great powers and a strategic confrontation that occurred between nuclear powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the one hand, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Big Western game behind it have a strong impact on the world order after the Cold War. The Russian conflict marks the severe challenges of the world order after the Cold War. On the other hand, this is also the first indirect opponent after the Cold War between Russia and the American Western camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Yermark&#39;s description, Kissinger said to Zellezki when he met, &quot;Before this war, I opposed Ukraine to join NATO because I was worried that this would start. We will see it now. The process (the outbreak of conflicts). Now, this process has reached this level, and in this case, the idea of ​​keeping Ukraine&#39;s neutrality is no longer meaningful. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is not the first time Kissinger mentioned Ukraine to join NATO. On May 17, &quot;Economist&quot; published an interview with Kissinger. In an interview, Kissinger said that he supported Ukraine to join NATO. He also said: &quot;Ukraine should continue to be protected by Europe, rather than becoming an isolated country that protects itself.&quot; For Russia, Kissinger said, &quot;If I talk to Putin (Russia), I will tell him Ukraine stays in NATO, and he will be safer. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; conflict against Russia, Kissinger calls on all parties to sit down to carry out diplomatic negotiations. He warned that there is such a risk now, that is, the military relations of large powers dominate their geopolitical considerations. The Russian -Ukraine conflict may therefore develop into a global conflict, and diplomatic negotiations will be &quot;increasingly important.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other hand, Sino -US relations have undergone qualitative changes from the Trump period, and conflict began to replace cooperation, becoming a theme in Sino -US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the relationship between the world&#39;s great powers represented by China -US -Russian relations is very dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this context, Kissinger is increasingly worried about Sino -US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Xinhua News Agency on June 16, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that Sino -US relations are on the &quot;cliffs&quot; and &quot;the current relationship trajectory must be changed.&quot; Later, Kissinger also said that the Cold War between China and the United States is now &quot;walking on the mountain road.&quot; Kissinger believes that China and the United States &quot;both are convinced that the other party constitutes a strategic threat. We are moving towards a big country.&quot; This is a process of &quot;should not continue&quot;. Once a conflict between China and the United States, it will be comparable to the First World War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, Kissinger actively mediates the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and dragging the old body to visit China, which is trying to exert its heat in stabilizing Sino -US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Why is Kissinger? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the United States, there are also many influential strategists. There are not a few people who are worried about the international situation and try to promote the improvement of Russia -Ukraine relations and Sino -US relations. But why is Kissinger instead of others? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the one hand, Kissinger has a superstition to the United States for worship and mission. As a German Jew who escaped the Nazi regime, to hold a high position in the United States is an example of an American success story. This also makes him always grateful to the United States. He once wrote: &quot;I can&#39;t find the same generous spirit and no malicious things anywhere in anywhere.&quot; This kind of almost emotional gratitude and worship of the United States has made him serve the United States at all of his diplomacy, and is committed to Maximize the national interests of the United States. To this end, he sacrificed his personal beliefs, and regardless of his personal reputation, he reached the height of &quot;the life and death of the country, and because of the disaster and blessing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other hand, Kissinger&#39;s diplomatic achievements are more than half in Sino -US relations. Kissinger is an eyewitness and operator of America&#39;s transformation from decline to prosperity. If President Nixon had not accepted his suggestion, destroyed the Sino-Soviet alliance, and shifted the strategic focus of the United States from Asia to Europe, it would have been difficult for the United States to win the Cold War in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When he entered the American politics, the United States was experiencing the lowest valley after World War II, while experiencing a triple crisis of foreign strategies, economic and social. The United States cannot extricate itself in the Vietnam War; economic difficulties, the US dollar loses the ability and reputation of payment of gold; domestic society is chaotic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Kissinger left American politics, the United States had successfully transformed China from the United States to the United States into the United States&#39; &quot;friendly African alliance&quot; against the Soviet Union. Although the US dollar can no longer be free to fulfill gold, it has been tied with oil trade again, achieving the upgrade from the US dollar to the international monetary currency. The US dollar has changed from the intermediary of the world&#39;s economic and trade to the real hegemony currency, and it becomes an international currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; All these make Kissinger unique and is the myth and legend of the diplomatic community. His status and influence in international politics, especially in Sino-US relations, are irreplaceable. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The symbol of the era &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On June 16, 2023, according to Xinhua News Agency, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that the American politics polarization, &quot;Excessive attention&quot; itself now itself, itself, itself In interest, if its foreign policy cannot balance the interests of the United States and the world, the United States will &quot;be isolated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sino -US relations turned from hostile to cooperation that year. The root cause is that both countries must respond to the threat from the Soviet Union. However, without Kissinger&#39;s knowledge and courage, it would be difficult for Sino -US relations to restart quickly in that harsh bilateral relationship. The symbolic effect produced by the overlapping interaction with the times is unable to have anyone else. Kissinger has become a symbol, a symbol of an era, and has no repeatability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Historically, it is the product of uniting the Soviet Union during the difficult period of China and the United States. When Kissinger secretly visited China, it was the rise and tough period of the Soviet Union, and it was a difficult period for China and the United States. China and the United States realized the handshake that spanned the Pacific Ocean and led the ideological gap, which not only created a foreign legend, but also stabilized the world situation at that time, but also destined the ending of the Cold War in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Kissinger came to China that year, when I saw the strategic contradictions and ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, we must contact China to fight against the Soviet Union together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this sense, China and the United States have therefore become the biggest beneficiaries in the end of the Cold War. After the Cold War ended, both China and the United States were able to get rid of security, reduce security burden, and concentrate on developing the economy. The rise of China in the world and the rise of the United States in the Western camps complement each other. It can be said that it is Kissinger&#39;s personal luck at the turning point of Sino -US relations and the world structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From a personal perspective, Kissinger is often called a realist, mainly because he puts strategic thinking in front of ideas. This distinguishes Kissinger from the current strategic researchers in the United States who are guided by ideology. However, he did not take ideological factors into consideration. In fact, he referred to his foreign policy principles, &quot;free internationalism&quot;, is equivalent to the new conservativeism of the Bush period. It is a product that combines the principles of values, internationalism with national strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is precisely because of this free internationalism that he offended Trump and Biden two US presidents. On November 25, 2020, Trump fired Kissinger from his position as an advisor to the U.S. Defense Policy Council. However, he was not satisfied with Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan, thinking that this was an irresponsible behavior and betrayed the US foreign policy tradition since President Wilson. One result of expressing this rhetoric is that Biden inherits Trump&#39;s approach to Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, many strategist in the US strategic industry, many strategic people in Bikinh, have also withdrawn from the stage. The strategic talents of the United States and the Youth for the United States have now provoked the beams in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But age is a major advantage of Kissinger. Kissinger is 100 years old and has surpassed all his friends and opponents. Kissinger is the only international politician in the world who is still active and has a significant influence. This makes Kissinger&#39;s role largely unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Can Kissinger copy? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Kissinger is the product of the times. When the times cannot be repeated, Kissinger cannot be copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the one hand, the form of Sino -US relations has changed. During the Cold War, the largest external threats in China and the United States were the Soviet Union. For its own security, China and the United States have established a cross -ideological gap system for the quasi -alliance system, which is in line with its own interests. Now, as China has entered the center of the world power stage unprecedentedly, Sino -US relations have also become the most important pair of bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the other hand, the characteristics of the era of diplomacy have changed. Kissinger represented by realism, advocating personal factors, superstitious secret diplomacy. At the end of the Cold War, it was out of place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Kissinger was obsessed with that passion and burning years, and was intoxicated by the thrills and excitement of taking a plane from Pakistan to Beijing to Beijing. In the later Cold War, especially in the era of highly transparent and public self -media, these personal heroism diplomatic behaviors were difficult to reproduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, Kissinger&#39;s influence in the United States is much faster than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the new era, many Americans have also reflected and challenged the contribution and achievements of Kissinger. Hans Morgan, a well -known international relationship scholar, said long ago that Kissinger, like Odysseus in Homer, &quot;has many faces.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the United States, there are two descriptions of Kissinger: one is a scammer. This person has never told the truth, and has always talked about the ambiguous words. It may be one of his secrets in the international constitution. The second is that Kissinger is a amazing person with great memory. He is a kiss and dictionary of many major events. Christopher Hetchins&#39;s description of Kissinger may be more accurate, saying that Kissinger is &quot;a shocking scammer with great memory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Finally, a little dangerous. Compared with Kissinger during the Cold War, the current American strategists basically grow up in a peaceful atmosphere. For them, peace is no longer the primary goal of international politics, but the premise or background of international politics, which does not need to fight and pay the price. Therefore, we can see that compared with Kissinger&#39;s concerns about the prospects of conflict, many American strategists seem to be concerned about the possibility of conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, Kissinger will not have the second one, but Kissinger&#39;s worry crisis will continue to repeat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; >; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;/&lt;/ div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[西藏阿里全体公务人员为一女子献血？应以令人信服的证据消除特权嫌疑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261624]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 14:57:06 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; A woman in Shanghai bleeds a car accident in Tibet. Its relatives contact the Ali area through the Shanghai Health and Health Commission to launch all civil servants to mobilize all civil servants Donation of blood for it? Recently, the news has attracted great attention on the Internet, and netizens have questioned whether there are privileges behind it. Although the parties constantly denied that relatives are public officials, many netizens did not buy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to media reports such as the Beijing News, a woman who claimed to be Xiao Yu recently posted short videos in social media, saying that a serious car accident occurred when he traveled to the Ali region of Tibet. Danger to life. Her husband&#39;s aunt contacted the Shanghai Health Commission to contact the Ali area of ​​Tibet to coordinate Shanghai aid medical experts for treatment for him. He also launched the &quot;all civil servants&quot; in the Ali region, including police stations, fire officers and soldiers, and troops officers and soldiers. In the end, she pulled her back from the death line with more than 7,000 milliliters. Subsequently, she was transferred to the West China Hospital of Sichuan to further treatment through medical charter machines. After the injuries were stable, she returned to Shanghai from Sichuan to continue treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The video quickly attracted great attention. Many netizens have questioned where the &quot;little aunt&quot; is sacred, and can allow the Shanghai Health and Health Commission to mobilize medical experts in Tibet, and can also mobilize all civil servants to donate blood for them. Is it suspicious of using privileges? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After causing great public opinion, all parties of the parties responded to media interviews and denied that there was privilege intervention. However, these responses failed to eliminate the public&#39;s questions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First of all, who is the &quot;little aunt&quot;. Ms. Yu&#39;s husband, Mr. Tao, later told the media that his aunt was not a public official in Shanghai. After the wife&#39;s car accident, the local department suggested to ask the Shanghai Health Commission for help. Division. The Shanghai Health and Health Commission stated that at the time they received a letter of &quot;relevant departments&quot; and requested that the aid doctors in Shigatse City, Tibet went to the hospital to participate in the treatment. There was no action caused by improper factors such as private relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen that this aunt can indeed contact the Shanghai Health Commission and allow the &quot;relevant departments&quot; to send a letter to the Health Commission. From the perspective of ordinary people, an ordinary citizen may be able to make a hotline of Health and Health Commission at most, so the &quot;little aunt&quot; will inevitably make a question in life. It is necessary for the Shanghai Health and Jian Commission to make more explanations. In the end, it is necessary to explain which department has received the letter from which department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Secondly, Ms. Yu was later taken from Ali to the Huaxi Hospital of Sichuan Chengdu Huaxi Hospital with medical charter. Her father said that they were ordinary families, and the chartered costs cost more than 12 million, and the money was borrowed from relatives and friends and leaders. But this statement is also doubtful. It is not easy for the one -million -dollar charter to withdraw from Tibet to save her daughter&#39;s life, although it is to save her daughter&#39;s life, it is not easy to raise such a huge amount in the short term. According to Mr. Yu, he &quot;drove in the unit.&quot; Such a unit, such a good leader, has attracted many netizens&#39; real names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, what netizens are most concerned about whether they have launched &quot;all civil servants&quot; to donate blood to her. Mr. Tao later said that at that time, his wife had just finished surgery, and the injury was still serious. This is to encourage his wife to play the will of survival. , I also contacted the local police station, fire protection and other departments, hoping to get their help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The government staff of Ali said that there are indeed cadres and employees to contribute blood to the injured woman, but they are not officially organized, but they voluntarily donate blood after seeing relevant news. The staff of Ali Hospital also said that after the blood storage inventory was urgent, the hospital asked for help from employees and social personnel. The family members also asked for help from many local departments. Later, many people came to donate blood, including dozens of public officials. The aforementioned government staff also stated that the medical conditions in the Ali region are relatively backward, and the blood inventory will be very tense. If anyone asks for help, many cadres and employees will voluntarily donate blood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shanghai tourists have a car accident in Tibet. Relevant departments in Shanghai and Ali cooperate together to coordinate the treatment of Tibetan experts and voluntarily donate blood to save people. s story. However, because of a short video, it caused a great wave of questioning privileges on the Internet. The reason is because the public has seen too many unfair phenomena of pensions and personal gain, and has also seen too many incidents that have dazzled wealth on the Internet and inadvertently exposed the problem of corruption. The short video released by Ms. Yu may also give people a feeling of showing off the ability of the &quot;little aunt&quot; (that is, showing off her ability). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, no wonder the public will doubt that there is privilege in it. If you want everyone to believe that this is a pure touching event, the parties involved, especially the official agencies involved, should come up with more. Confused evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[查理·芒格逝世 “我没有什么要补充的了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261619]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 14:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/65rpbmhqmak6WB5LLLOGB5RWNUJLBTMCUQYWFR7DM.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/medias/i Mage/23/11/30/65rpbmhqmak6WB5LLLOGB5RWNUJLBTMCUQYWFR7DM. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260229 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; May 3, 2019, Omaha, Braskh, USA, Berke, Burke Buffett (left) and vice chairman of Hill Hathaway&#39;s CEO Buffett &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (visual China/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong >; &quot;Small crazy and stupid than most people&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; There is still one month before the 100th birthday. Wallen Buffett has a good friend, and the world has another humorous and wise wise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 99 -year -old Munger is Wallen Buffett partner. Since 1978, he has been the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. In the past four or fifty years, the two joined forces to build Berkshire from a crumbling textile manufacturer into one of the most successful multinational enterprise groups in history. The group&#39;s subsidiaries have covered multiple fields such as insurance, railway transportation, energy, manufacturing, retail and services. The stocks hold more than $ 318 billion, about half of which are Apple stocks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Two weeks ago, Munger was interviewed by CNBC reporter Biki Kick. Compared with the shareholders&#39; meeting half a year ago, his thinking is still keen. When he stated his view, he used long sentences, but his voice became more hoarse. The limitation of the body is unable to break through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quick asked what he wanted to do at present, and got a negative answer. His hands could not perceive the tension of the fishing line when he was young when he was young. He no longer persisted in drawing &quot;fishing for 200 pounds (Note: about 90 kg) of tuna&quot; from the list of life. &quot;This requires too much physical strength. Even if there is a chance now, I will not go, I will not even chase them. Time will always let you give up.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Compared with the age of 96, he It is getting more and more frequently aware of the aging and weakness of the body. In the face of Quick&#39;s problem, he said he no longer planned. He can &quot;accept it&quot; for various changes. In an interview, he was sitting in a sunny courtyard, with a row of red palms beside the lawn next to him, also known as flower candle. This color is bright, and the flowering period is durable. From bloom to withering, it will present beige, milky white, green and yellow, each with its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qly37kh7e81soyh1soktaiqbkMB0Moaddgm.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;widt =&quot; 0 &quot;widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/qly37kh7e81soktaiqbga2cmb0moadgm.jpg&quot; data- key = &quot;260223&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; From the&quot; Mun Ge &quot;&lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (CITIC Publishing Group provided/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Buffett often teased that he was still a young man in front of Munger. One week before Munger&#39;s death, Buffett, 93, just announced to donate to Berkshire&#39;s shares worth about $ 866 million to the four family charity institutions. This is the latest step he promised to &quot;donate more than 99%of his net wealth to charity&quot;. Since 2006, on the eve of Thanksgiving every year, the &quot;stock god&quot; will donate to the four family charity institutions mentioned above. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said that he was 93 years old and felt very good, but also fully realized that he had entered the &quot;overtime&quot;. A week later, in the &quot;overtime&quot;, his most tacit teammate tested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Munger always believes that he and Buffett have an important reason for his outstanding career. It is enough to stay there for a long time, but the premise of the magic of &quot;compound profit&quot; is still &quot;more than most than most. There are less crazy and stupid people. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mun Ge was born on January 1, 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska. He has loved reading from an early age, especially fascinated by biography, and has strong logical thinking ability. After graduating from Harvard University Law School, Munger continued his grandfather and father&#39;s mantle and opened a lawyer career in Los Angeles. Subsequently, in order to obtain more income than senior lawyers, Munger began to rely on existing customer resources to conduct investment outside the lawyer&#39;s business, and created its own investment partnership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/mp7jsmbqihawf10kmmmjxxhipz1sduv.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;959&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 30/mp7jsMBQIHAWF10kmmmjxxHipshrxi9hogz1SDuv.jpg&quot; data- &quot;260228&quot;>; &lt;/>; &lt;/>; p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; March 9, 1988, Munger &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (visual China/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1959, Munger&#39;s father died. After returning to his hometown, he met 29 -year -old Warren Buffett at a dinner arranged by his friend. At Buffett&#39;s suggestion, Munger began to do business since 1965. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two are confidantes each other, which has also contributed to an important turning point in each other&#39;s life. Buffett once said that Munger&#39;s ideological power has expanded his vision, allowing him to &quot;evolve from orangutan to humans at an extraordinary speed&quot;, otherwise he will be much poorer than now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the beginning of his career, Buffett was a loyal believer of Benjamin Graham, which was called the &quot;father of value investment&quot;. Graham advocates finding companies stocks that sell at the price below operating capital and buy it cheaply. After the stock price rises, it will be sold, leaving enough security margins. These &quot;cheap and not favored stocks&quot; were compared to him as &quot;cigarette butt&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/dgbzqcgvrnwju3wdvara4pjap8fglgpu91euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu in&quot; = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;1592&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/dgbzqcgvrnwju3wdvara4pjap8fglgpu91euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; The Way of Munger &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The key force that promotes the evolution of Buffett&#39;s investment philosophy is Munger. Munger believes that Graham&#39;s investment strategy is based on the assumptions of &quot;more dangerous, not full of opportunities&quot; in the future. In fact, great companies that invest in fair stock prices are far better than ordinary companies with high investment in stock prices. Affected by the thoughts of Munger, Buffett gradually came out of the limitations of Graham theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They found that although some stocks are two or three times the book value, they are still very cheap, because the company may be on a growing channel, with very good management personnel, or or or The entire management system is excellent. Through detailed analysis of the balance sheet, social and economic trends, Buffett and Munger detected high -quality stocks that they were regarded as &quot;compound machines&quot; from the vast stock market. Long -term holding these stocks will bring excess profit returns, and these funds will be used for reinvestment. Buffett compares this process to &quot;snowball&quot;. &quot;Only by looking for the right snow can snowballs&quot;, &quot;Choose snowballs while moving forward to make the snowballs get bigger.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; ourselves From 1965 to the end of 2022, Berkshire&#39;s annual compound yield rate was 19.8%, and the total return of 57 years reached nearly 37,900 times, far to win the performance of the S &amp; P 500 index in the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Without Charlie Munger&#39;s inspiration, wisdom, and participation, Berkshire Hathaway would not be able to develop to its position today.&quot; After Munger&#39;s death, Buffett wrote in the statement in this statement. road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/o7v0ohkl2zelmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmxg2xt&#39;s = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/o7v0ohkl2zelmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmxg2xt&#39;s >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; On May 6, 2023, in Nebraska in the United States, shareholders listened to Munger (right) and Buffett at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway.

However, compared to the wealth life that is difficult to copy, what makes ordinary people benefit Munger&#39;s thinking mode. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Buffett refers to Munger as &quot;the best fast thinking in the world&quot;. As a selection of stocks, Buffett will test his thoughts through Munger&#39;s question. &quot;He can think of Z from A, and even before your words, he has seen all the essence of everything.&quot; Behind this insight is the trained method of thinking of Munger for a long time. Thinking model &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Munger has repeatedly talked about the value and importance of using the &quot;diverse thinking model&quot; in the business world and real life in public. For example, before making investment decisions, he will make a comprehensive analysis of the internal operating conditions of the intention company and the larger overall &quot;ecosystem&quot;, so he can always &quot;find out a convincing weakness within 60 seconds&quot;. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Munger estimation, there are as many as a hundred diverse thinking models stored in his mind. These models help him collect and process information and provide decision -making guidance on this basis. These models need to borrow and combine analytical tools, methods and formulas of various traditional disciplines, including engineering redundant backup system models, mathematical compound models, breakpoints of engineering, chemistry and chemistry, and self -catalytic models. Biology&#39;s modern Darwin comprehensive model, as well as the misjudgment model of psychology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/cmtkpeb3yqz184ju7dblvwvxmjpc6sg8zqum&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;1525&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/cmtkpeb3yqz184ju7dblvwvxmjpc6sg8zqumcab.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;260224&quot;>; &lt;/>; &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Poor Charlie Treasure &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Behind the so-called&quot; intuition &quot;is actually a long-term thinking journey. And other long -term research products. He advocated &quot;quickly annihilating things that should not be done, and then launching a skilled and cross -disciplinary attack on what to do, and then when the right opportunity comes -only when the right opportunity comes -take a decisive action.&quot; He likes to regard his life as an educational experiment. &quot;A person who has well mastered his professionalism and in a very vast academic field, test the feasibility and effectiveness of the basic academic spirit and methods.&quot; &amp; Nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Munger&#39;s view, obtaining wisdom is not only to make the individual&#39;s life better, but also a moral responsibility. In 2007, he put forward this view in the speech at the Graduation Ceremony of the University of California, the University of California. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In his speech, he also reminded young graduates to &quot;avoid extremely strong ideology&quot;, &quot;especially the ideology expressed in a very intense way&quot;, because &quot;it only only Give people some concepts, not to accept some truths in a pleasing manner. &quot;&quot; This is tantamount to imprisoning the brain in a very unfortunate model. &quot; The amazing speed is broken. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In order to help you keep it in a strong ideology to support some kind of strong ideology, Munger sets a&quot; iron law &quot; -&quot; only can be better than the opponent than the opponent. When I refuted my own position, I was qualified to have a point of view. &quot;Of course, this&quot; iron law &quot;is not limited to avoiding strong ideology. Munger believes that this way of thinking is worthy of continuous training. Only by constantly falsifying and torture yourself can you reduce your ignorance. In his opinion, what may be more suitable as an ideology is the spirit of &quot;accurate, diligent and objective&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In contrast, the state of tranquilism includes &quot;jealousy, resentment, hatred and self -pity&quot;. Munger had experienced pain in the world. In 1953, shortly after divorce with his wife, his eldest son Teddy suffered from fatal leukemia. At that time, the bone marrow transplantation surgery had not yet appeared, and Teddy died soon due to the illness. In the memories of friends, when he visited his son at the hospital, Munger, 29, often cried and walked on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After many years, Munger warned young people, &quot;Excessive self -pity can make people almost paranoia. Paranoid is one of the most difficult things. Whenever you find that you have a self -pity, whether it is whether it is What is the reason, even if you are about to die because your children suffer from cancer, you have to think that self -pity is not helpful. &quot;However, different stages of life will always encounter very difficult problems. His suggestion is: Do not expect too high; have a sense of humor; let yourself be in the love of friends and family. &quot;The most important thing is to adapt to the changes in life.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; As a wealthy and long -lived wise man, Munger is most often asked &quot;How can we become happy and rich?&quot; He watched him see at him. In the coming, life is not just a savvy accumulation of wealth, most of life and business come from those things that should be avoided, such as premature death and bad marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znrmzjc1x9gxf67KE7UZJKSEFJZMSKJ.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;widt =&quot; 0 &quot;widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;639&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 30/qxt9znrmzjc1x9gxf67KE7UZJKSEFJZMSKJ.JPG&quot; data- &quot;>; 260225&quot;>; &lt;/>; p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; September 29, 2010, Munger (left), Buffett (middle) and Bill Gates participated in the event in Beijing &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He also has another answer- &quot;When I get up every day, strive to become smarter than you before. Complete your task seriously and excellently. Slowly, you will make progress, but this progress is not necessarily fast. But this can lay the foundation for rapid progress ... slowly move forward every day. Finally -if you have long enough life -big Most people will get what they deserve. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; When 82 years old, Munger&#39;s friends gave him a&quot; Sissero&#39;s Beautiful Life &quot;published by Benjamin Franklin. The translation of &quot;On the Elderly&quot;. Inspired by this article, Munger wrote the article &quot;The Elderly: The Elderly: Munger&#39;s Later&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the text, Munger exceeded the summary of the wise man born in 106 BC: &quot;The best protective armor in his later years is a life that was carefully spent before it was used. The pursuit of beneficial knowledge, glorious achievements and noble lives; people who live this kind of life have been committed to improving himself from his youth, and will harvest the happiest fruit of them in his later years; this is not only because of Beneficial knowledge, glorious achievements, and noble manners will accompany him for life, even until the last moment of his life, will bring the soul supreme because of witnessing the conscience of the upright life and the memories of the past good achievements. Comfort. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Munger&#39;s life is one of the best interpretations of this. Like Benjamin Franklin, who is happy, he always has a strong curiosity and extensive interest. He is always creating, giving, and being remembered. He spent the full 99 years, just as his mantra at the Berkshire Annual Meeting: &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999999;&quot;>; ( Reference materials: &quot;Poor Charlie&quot;, &quot;The Way of Munger&quot;.) &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[糖分摄入过多有危害，上海试水含糖饮料健康提示]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261576]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-30 13:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
