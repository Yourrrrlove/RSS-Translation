He graduated from Renmin University of China and received a doctorate in economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1992, Hu Jinglin has worked in the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau as deputy director of the Policy, Regulations and Judicial Regulations Division. According to the &quot;Historical Dictionary Series of the Communist Party of China&quot;, in order to straighten out the relationship between state-owned assets and establish and improve the state-owned assets management system in the process of reform and opening up, in November 1988, the state established the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the Chinese Government website, in 1994, the State-owned Assets Administration became a national bureau (deputy ministerial level) managed by the Ministry of Finance. Its main task is to comprehensively manage state-owned assets within and outside the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1998, the State-owned Assets Administration Bureau was officially abolished. In the same year, the Large Enterprise Working Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was formally established. During this period, the management structure of state-owned enterprises changed several times until the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council was established in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the time of the organizational reform in 1998, Hu Jinglin entered the Property Appraisal Department of the Ministry of Finance, and then served as Director of the Economic Construction Department of the Ministry of Finance, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of the State Council Information Office, Hu Jinglin has long been engaged in state-owned enterprise reform and macroeconomic theoretical research and practical work. He has rich work experience and profound theoretical foundation. He has participated in a number of major reforms of financial and industrial management systems and He is engaged in research on important macroeconomic policies and has authored (translated) many works such as &quot;State-owned Enterprise Reform and Approaches&quot;, &quot;Financial Asset Assessment&quot;, and &quot;U.S. Federal Government Budget&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Hu Jinglin served as Assistant Minister of Finance and member of the Party Leadership Group. Five years later, he was promoted to deputy minister of finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to The Paper, when he was promoted to Vice Minister of Finance, Hu Jinglin was in charge of the General Office, Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Comprehensive Development Office, Bureau of Retired Cadres, Information Network Center, and China Finance and Taxation Museum, assisting then Minister of Finance Lou Jiwei is in charge of the Office of the State Council’s Comprehensive Rural Reform Working Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure at the Ministry of Finance, Hu Jinglin repeatedly emphasized the importance of budget management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Hu Jinglin emphasized at the National Financial, Administrative, Political and Legal Work Conference that as far as the budget is concerned, it is necessary to enhance the legality and binding force of the budget and how to solve the problems of inaccurate budget preparation at the beginning of the year and mid-year budget. To deal with the problems of frequent adjustments and excessive budget balances at the end of the year, &quot;we need to work with departments to establish the concept of &#39;budget is law&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Never let the medical insurance fund become &#39;Tang Monk Meat&#39;&quot;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;After four years as Deputy Minister of Finance, Hu Jinglin was transferred to the National Medical Security Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2018, the First Session of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress voted to adopt a decision on the institutional reform plan of the State Council, establishing the National Medical Security Administration of the People&#39;s Republic of China (deputy ministerial level) and becoming an agency directly under the State Council. Hu Jinglin became the first director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The institutional reform plan of the State Council at that time proposed that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security’s basic medical insurance and maternity insurance responsibilities for urban employees and urban residents, the National Health and Family Planning Commission’s new rural cooperative medical responsibilities, and the national The National Development and Reform Commission&#39;s drug and medical service price management responsibilities and the Ministry of Civil Affairs&#39; medical assistance responsibilities were integrated to form the National Medical Security Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, during his tenure, Hu Jinglin actively promoted the solution of problems such as difficulty and high cost of medication for ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2019, during the National Two Sessions, Hu Jinglin said in an interview at the &quot;Ministerial Channel&quot; that more life-saving and emergency medicines should be included in medical insurance by optimizing the directory structure to further alleviate and alleviate the epidemic. It is difficult for the people to use medicine and it is expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the State Council Information Office press conference in May 2023, Hu Jinglin introduced that in the past five years, the National Medical Insurance Administration has accelerated the pace of medical insurance negotiations and promoted a large number of exclusive drugs such as camrelizumab and nosinaxin sodium. A variety of anti-cancer drugs and drugs for rare diseases are included in medical insurance at appropriate prices, and after reimbursement, the cumulative burden on patients has been reduced by more than 500 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the official website of the National Medical Insurance Administration published an article written by Hu Jinglin, stating that the next step is to strengthen the management of medical insurance funds, continue to carry out in-depth special operations against fraudulent insurance, and &quot;look back&quot; on some provinces Conduct random inspections and reviews of work. In addition, give full play to the power of the reporting reward system and establish a reporting clue supervision and feedback mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Make good use of the agreement management system. Medical institutions whose agreements have been terminated shall not be included in the medical insurance designated areas within 3 years. Build a long-term mechanism for fund supervision and &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Never let the medical insurance fund Become the new &#39;Tang Monk Meat&#39;&lt;/span>;.&quot; Hu Jinglin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the above-mentioned press conference of the State Council Information Office, Hu Jinglin said that medical insurance funds are &quot;life-saving money&quot; for the people. The National Medical Insurance Administration has always regarded strengthening the supervision of medical insurance funds and maintaining fund security as its top priority, and severely cracked down on various forms of fraud. Such illegal use of medical insurance funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past five years, the total annual revenue of the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance) has increased from 2.14 trillion yuan to 3.09 trillion yuan, and the total annual expenditure has increased from 1.78 trillion yuan to 2.46 trillion yuan. The fund is running smoothly and has a balance,&quot; Hu Jinglin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wang Jun has been the director of the State Administration of Taxation for ten years&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Chinese government website shows that Wang Jun, the current director of the State Administration of Taxation, was born in 1958. He graduated from Peking University and received a doctorate in law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun served in the Ministry of Finance from 1987 to 2013. In March 2013, Wang Jun, then deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group and deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance, was promoted to secretary of the Party Leadership Group and director of the State Administration of Taxation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2023, Wang Jun, Director of the State Administration of Taxation, held talks with the Director of the Qatar General Administration of Taxation.

Image source: The official website of the State Administration of Taxation&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 1993, the State Council issued a document stating that in order to adapt to the national tax work, the organizational specifications of the State Administration of Taxation would be adjusted from the deputy ministerial level to the ministerial level. In January 1994, China began to implement the reform of the fiscal and taxation system with the tax-sharing system as the core, which significantly increased the central fiscal revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the reform of the tax-sharing system, the State Administration of Taxation has successively had five directors, namely Liu Zhongli, Jin Renqing, Xie Xuren, Xiao Jie, and Wang Jun. Among them, Wang Jun has served the longest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All five of them have worked in the Ministry of Finance, and four of them have served as Ministers of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Zhongli served as Minister of Finance and concurrently Director of the State Administration of Taxation from 1992 to 1998. Jin Renqing, Xie Xuren, and Xiao Jie all served as Ministers of Finance after serving as Directors of the State Administration of Taxation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, Wang Jun has served as the director of the State Administration of Taxation for ten years and is 65 years old. In March 2023, Wang Jun was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at the resumes of Wang Jun and Hu Jinglin, they have worked together in the Ministry of Finance for more than ten years, and both have served as director of the General Office of the Ministry of Finance, spokesperson, assistant minister, deputy minister, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the ten years since Wang Jun served as director of the State Administration of Taxation, China&#39;s tax system reform has continued to deepen, including a series of actions such as replacing business tax with VAT, individual tax reform, merging state and local taxes, and tax and fee reductions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from October 2018, the &quot;threshold&quot; for personal income tax will be increased from 3,500 yuan/month to 5,000 yuan/month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five months later, Wang Jun said at the &quot;Ministerial Channel&quot; of the National Two Sessions that the personal income tax reform will bring 100% tax reduction to the working class, and about 80 million of them will no longer have to pay a tax. Taxes will be reduced by more than 70% for about 65 million people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same year, the First Session of the Thirteenth National People&#39;s Congress passed the institutional reform plan of the State Council. The State Council will reform the national and local tax collection and administration systems, merge the national and local tax agencies at the provincial and sub-provincial levels, and specifically bear the responsibilities of various taxation agencies within its jurisdiction. Responsibilities such as tax and non-tax revenue collection and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tax-sharing system reform in 1994 established two sets of tax collection and management systems: national tax and local tax. After 24 years of operation, the state and local taxes were merged and a new tax collection and administration system was established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the effects of tax cuts and fee reductions, the 2023 State Council Government Work Report concluded, “In the past five years, a cumulative tax reduction of 5.4 trillion yuan and a fee reduction of 2.8 trillion yuan have been achieved.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[考公考研人数一升一降：替代还是互补，如何读懂两者间的关系？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261528]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 26, 2023, the written test for public subjects of the national examination will begin. The number of applicants for the national examination exceeded 3 million for the first time. A total of 2.613 million candidates confirmed their registration before the examination, and 2.252 million actually took the examination, which is unprecedented. Vertical comparison shows that a total of 1.422 million people actually took the exam last year. From 2020 to 2024, the number of people recruited for the national examination will be approximately 24,100, 25,700, 31,200, 37,100, and 39,600, which is rising steadily, but it is far from meeting everyone&#39;s application needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, this year is the first time in eight years that the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination has dropped, which may indicate that the enthusiasm for the postgraduate entrance examination has reached its peak. This shows that it is a high probability event that the public and postgraduate entrance examinations will go their separate ways. Because for most people, the purpose of taking the postgraduate entrance examination is to delay employment and postpone the employment decision for two to three years, in the hope that a graduate degree will give them a certain competitive advantage. However, on the one hand, the employment situation is becoming increasingly difficult. Today’s undergraduate degree vs. For graduate students after two or three years, the latter may not have a significant advantage in finding a job. On the other hand, the opportunity cost of obtaining a graduate degree is getting higher and higher. Changing from a master&#39;s degree to a professional master&#39;s degree means higher tuition expenses. The public examination is different. If you use the time and money to take the postgraduate entrance examination, you can take the public examination in multiple places in a year. Until you pass the examination, the probability of &quot;getting on board&quot; will be higher. The two go off and on, and it is obvious that more and more people believe that taking the public examination directly is more cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the relationship between the postgraduate entrance examination and the public examination is complex. In addition to substitution, there is also a complementary relationship. For example, some people still want to take the civil service exam after taking the postgraduate entrance examination. This is because there are more civil servant positions that they can apply for with a postgraduate degree. Educational qualifications become higher and more attractive, and there is also an additional channel for selecting students to enter politics. In short, you can expand your options for public examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the recruitment requirements for national examination positions, the threshold for academic qualifications is constantly rising. This year’s national examination recruitment requirements are all for a college degree or above. As the number of recruits increases year after year, the number of positions that require a college degree as a starting point is decreasing year by year. This year, there are 56 positions that college students can apply for, a decrease of 106 year-on-year. At the same time, the number of positions requiring a master&#39;s degree and the planned number of people have increased significantly. According to statistics from China Youth Daily, there are 2,046 positions requiring a master&#39;s degree or above this year, an increase of 814 year-on-year; there are 24 positions requiring a doctoral degree, an increase of 14 year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to explain this phenomenon? A common view is that the demand for highly educated talents in government agencies has increased. This actually amounts to no explanation. Are these positions really only available to those with a master&#39;s degree or above? Probably not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current employment environment, the attractiveness of jobs within the system has been further enhanced: there is a &quot;establishment&quot;, decent salary, complete benefits, high social status, and stable work. As long as you don&#39;t make big principled mistakes, you will not be unemployed. The danger. Therefore, competition for these positions will continue to intensify. The ratio of the number of people admitted to the national examination to the number of people taking the examination was 1:38 last year and 1:57 this year. The ratio of popular positions is even more exaggerated. When competition intensifies, one of the main criteria for selecting talents will naturally be academic qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For employers within the system, when they are recruiting someone, why not choose someone with a higher academic qualification and a better school? Based on purely objective indicators, this is equivalent to obtaining &quot;better talents&quot; with the same staffing and cost, and neither leaders nor the public can find fault. On the contrary, if you do not recruit people with higher academic qualifications and better schools, but recruit people with average academic qualifications, you will most likely need to explain to the public why it is not a &quot;carrot recruitment&quot; and the people you recruit are the most suitable for the position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this logic and mentality, it is not difficult to understand the following phenomena that are hotly debated by the public: Peking University’s Ph.D. in nuclear physics obtained the urban management establishment, Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s M.D. became a middle school doctor, and Harvard University’s master’s degree applied for education Non-career positions in the Overseas Study Service Center of the Ministry of Education. It is not difficult to understand why the academic qualifications threshold for recruitment within the system continues to increase: last year, we required a bachelor&#39;s degree, but we recruited several master&#39;s degrees from prestigious universities; this year, we simply require all master&#39;s degrees, and people are willing to come and don&#39;t have to spend more money, so why not? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, this is very different from the recruitment logic of free competition industries. Except for the R&amp;D departments of some leading companies, generally the company&#39;s academic qualifications are only a reference when recruiting people. The key is to see whether personal ability and character match the company&#39;s job requirements. If you have too high academic qualifications, you will have the problem of over-qualification. For the same position, undergraduates may do better than those with master&#39;s or doctorate degrees, because from the perspective of the company, everyone must receive vocational training anyway. Being young is an advantage, the mind is not yet rigid, the person has the courage to try and accept new things, and can get started quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, some undergraduates complained that they could not get offers (invitations) when applying for jobs as undergraduates, but they got many offers by pretending to be high school students. The reason why high school students are required rather than &quot;high-achieving students&quot; is because in the eyes of the company, high school students are enough to complete the job. All they need to do is behave in a disciplined manner, follow the procedures honestly, and listen to instructions. They hope that employees can calm down and maintain stable work. ; If you are looking for undergraduates, they may think that they are overqualified and are just making do for the time being, or they may be riding a donkey looking for a horse, and they are not willing to work without peace of mind. Why bother asking for trouble because of a false reputation? After a while, the &quot;top students&quot; leave, and new people have to be recruited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, after understanding the difference in recruitment logic and mentality between the system and the free competition industry, students can decide whether they need to go to graduate school, whether to take the public examination as an undergraduate to get a job, or to go to graduate school to make themselves available. Wider choices. These are factual judgments, not value judgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, in the long run, encouraging the best students to engage in innovation, create wealth in free competition industries, and create a good institutional environment and motivation mechanism for them will naturally be a blessing to society and a country. blessing. For some time, the government has introduced many measures to stimulate the development of the private economy. Recently, eight departments have introduced &quot;25 specific measures to support the private economy.&quot; This effort is in the right direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雷军向母校武大捐13亿背后：曾领两千奖学金立志万倍还回来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261522]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 29, Wuhan University celebrated its 130th anniversary. Lei Jun personally donated 1.3 billion yuan to his alma mater. . The official account of Wuhan University stated that this set a new record for the largest single donation since the founding of Wuhan University, and was also the largest individual cash donation from an alumni received by universities across the country. Nandu reporters learned that when he was studying at Wuhan University more than 30 years ago, Lei Jun received a &quot;huge sum&quot; of 2,000 yuan and was determined to pay it back ten thousand times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7fb2543f6dfa9e1e8eee615866c61337.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;535&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7fb2543f6dfa9e1e8eee615866c61337.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259949&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Donation site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned from Wuhan University that Lei Jun is a 1987 computer science alumnus of Wuhan University and the founder, chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Group. This donation mainly focuses on three directions: supporting research in the six basic disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature, history and philosophy, supporting scientific and technological innovation in the computer field, and supporting the training of college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Jun recalled that more than 30 years ago, as an outstanding student representative, he was awarded the highest scholarship at Wuhan University at that time, which was a full two thousand yuan, sponsored by a company. He said that for a student from an ordinary county family, this is really a huge sum of money. To this day, he still clearly remembers the excitement and pride he felt at that time. At that time, Lei Jun secretly swore in his heart, &quot;No matter how much scholarship I receive today, I will pay it back ten times, a hundred times, or ten thousand times in the future.&quot; In 1997, six years after graduation, Lei Jun started donating to his alma mater. At that time, his salary Only 4,000 yuan. He began his journey to fulfill his vow and donated money to establish the &quot;Lei Jun Scholarship&quot; (then called the &quot;Tengfei Scholarship&quot;) at the School of Computer Science. He has continued to donate for 26 years now. Lei Jun lamented that today he has finally fulfilled his wish to repay 10,000 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 29th, Lei Jun posted on Weibo to congratulate his alma mater on his birthday: Today is the 130th anniversary of Wuhan University. Happy birthday to my alma mater! He said, &quot;Every time I return to my alma mater, I feel very excited.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打造中国版甲骨文：易鲸捷与贵阳银行的双向冒险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261534]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Guiyang Bank Head Office Building.

Zhao Jilin/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the seventh floor of the head office building of Bank of Guiyang (601997.SH), there is a place where outsiders are prohibited from entering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The computer room covering an area of ​​more than 80 square meters is filled with large electronic display screens and computer terminals. All business operations and accounting processing related to deposits and loans need to be completed here. Supporting the operation of the entire set of equipment is the new core business transaction system that was just launched on November 6, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of banking core business transaction systems, foreign companies such as Oracle and IBM were once absolute monopolies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2020, an unknown startup company suddenly broke in. Guizhou Yijingjie Information Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yijingjie), founded in 2015, won the bid for the domestic database application project of Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system with a price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie plays two roles, one is the supplier of database products, and the other is the general contractor of the entire project. Its purpose is to create a full-stack core transaction system for domestic banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After its official launch, this high-profile trading system did not win praise. Instead, it pushed Yijingjie to the forefront. For a time, the Internet was flooded with comments such as &quot;fake domestically produced products&quot; and &quot;shelling Oracle&quot;, and Bank of Guiyang and Yi Jingjie became the target of public criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It may be very difficult for us to build a (database) nuclear weapon for daily use for the country, but we must take this risk.&quot; Li Jing, chairman of Yi Jingjie, spoke quickly He told a reporter from Southern Weekend, his voice was trembling. She looks very capable, with short hair, tattooed eyebrows, and a red coat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the moment, the &quot;nuclear weapons&quot; Li Jing talks about have not yet been put into production. He Xin, general manager of the Information Technology Department of the Bank of Guiyang, revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the current main database of the Bank of Guiyang is Oracle, and Yi Jingjie is used as a follow-up database, which is exactly the opposite of the original plan. &quot;I invested them all at once. To be honest, the risk will be relatively high.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of Guiyang Big Data Bureau, further explained to Southern Weekend reporters that due to the influence of negative public opinion on the Internet, superior supervision Out of the principle of prudent supervision, the department does not agree to the online launch of Yijingjie database for the time being. &quot;As long as the regulatory authorities relent, it can be launched in any minute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Delayed launch&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The biggest doubt from the outside world is whether Yi Wingjie, which started with distributed databases, can build a more technically difficult bank core transaction system database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The databases currently used in the financial industry are still mainly centralized, but distributed is the general trend and has computing advantages under massive data and high concurrency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The branch president of a state-owned commercial bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the difficulty in developing the bank&#39;s core transaction system database lies in the large amount of data that needs to be stored for many years and ensure that the system does not go down. In addition, each bank needs to do some customized development according to the needs of customers. For example, it has to open separate interfaces with the credit reporting system and tax system of the People&#39;s Bank of China, which &quot;has strict requirements for security.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years since Guiyang Bank purchased the Yijingjie database, it has not been able to go online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Wingjie was originally relatively optimistic about the launch time. According to the company&#39;s internal documents, the construction goals are divided into three stages:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of June 2020, achieve an average success rate of 99.999%, and successfully implement the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; plan for Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system in 2021. The main database uses the domestic Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the end of September 2021, the Yijingjie database for typical applications such as banking financial core, graphical front-end, process banking, and credit systems will be transformed and put online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third phase will comprehensively plan and transform the information system of Guiyang Bank, and realize the localization transformation of the full-scenario application system by the end of July 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information can also be seen that the launch time of Yijingjie database has been delayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, the evaluation report of Yijingjie’s shareholder China Software (600536.SH) showed that the core transaction main database purchased by Guiyang Bank is planned to be officially launched in the first half of 2022. Apparently it didn&#39;t happen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already two years later, in May 2023, that there was any further news. When accepting a survey from investors, the Bank of Guiyang stated that the Yijingjie domestic database application project has entered the testing phase and is advancing various testing tasks in an orderly manner. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, another investor asked about the progress of Yijingjie’s domestic database at the Bank of Guiyang’s third quarter performance briefing. Chairman Zhang Zhenghai replied, “The development of the new core business system of Bank of Guiyang has been completed. Testing work, the system has entered the online preparation stage, and the system is expected to be online from 17:00 on November 3, 2023 to 8:00 on November 6.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until November 6, Guiyang Bank issued an announcement stating that &quot;the new system has been successfully launched&quot;, but did not declare what database it adopted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the current situation of Yijingjie as a backup follower library, He Xin explained that for relatively mature bank core trading systems, it usually takes 18-24 months from research and development to launch. However, the Guiyang Bank project has many innovations, such as the full-stack core business system and the first application of eCas4.0 in the banking industry, so it takes a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also added that as early as the beginning of 2021, Guiyang Bank signed a contract with Oracle to allow Oracle and Yijingjie to run parallel databases to back up each other, creating a relatively safe structure. The performance of Yijingjie database is acceptable, but the database does not only rely on performance. &quot;If it is actually put online, we would like to test it more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie is located on the 24th floor of Tower C, No. 1 Gaoke.

The development of the big data industry is considered by Guizhou as an excellent opportunity to change lanes and overtake. In 2015, the country established the country&#39;s first comprehensive big data pilot zone in Guizhou. One of its important tasks is to solve the security and independent controllability issues of China&#39;s big data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yi Jingjie, he has never had access to the core transaction system database of a bank before, so he faces great technical challenges. Similarly, for the Guiyang Municipal Government and Guiyang Bank, betting on Yijingjie is also a risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A representative of Guiyang State-owned Assets who once participated in the investment in Yijingjie revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that at the end of 2015, Guiyang State-owned Assets learned about Yijingjie and visited Yijingjie’s technical team, launching a long-term Half a year of due diligence, interviews included Tencent Music (NYSE: TME), the three major telecom operators, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before investing in Yijingjie, Yijingjie signed an agreement with Guiyang State-owned Assets, stipulating that Guizhou Yijingjie would be the headquarters, and Shanghai Yijingjie and American Yijingjie would be the subsidiaries of Guizhou Yijingjie. &quot;When we invested, we promised to invest 20 million yuan first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Guiyang government revealed to a Southern Weekend reporter that although Yi Jingjie is not well-known, it does distributed databases , the leaders at the time also saw it, the technology was relatively new. &quot;The problem with it is that no one uses it, and there is no actual application scenario verification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong said frankly that Guiyang&#39;s big data started slowly, but it can attract a database company and regard it as a treasure, or even treat it as a treasure. Unicorns to breed. &quot;No city in the country dares to do this. We take real application scenarios and let them verify the database.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016-2019, Guiyang Industrial and Information Industry Development Guidance Fund Co., Ltd. , Guiyang Service Outsourcing and Call Industry Venture Capital Fund Co., Ltd., Guizhou Provincial Venture Investment Promotion Center, Guiyang Comprehensive Bonded Zone Development Investment (Group) Co., Ltd., Gui&#39;an New Area Emerging Industry Development Fund (Co., Ltd.) and other state-owned industrial funds , successively became shareholders of Yijingjie by increasing capital, with a cumulative investment of 128 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people from the Guiyang Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the initial investment and introduction of Yijingjie was based on its overseas technology. According to the official website of Yijingjie, the company is &quot;one of the few domestic database manufacturers with independent core technology.&quot; The R&amp;D team originates from Tianteng Company, with 30 years of technology accumulation and a complete team structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie was initially chaired by Chinese-American Li Weichong, and Li Jing, as his Chinese wife, served as the legal representative. Li Weichong has a glorious resume. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and received dual doctorates in finance and computer chemistry. Before founding Yijingjie, Li Weichong served as a senior executive in Lucent, Accenture, HP, China Unicom and other companies. Among them, asking Yao Ming to endorse China Unicom New World has become a classic case of publicity and promotion model, which once caused a sensation in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to Li Weichong and his wife described to Southern Weekend reporters that Li Weichong is personable, has extraordinary conversation, and has a gentle personality. Li Jing is on the strong side and has been in the clothing business in her early years. After the establishment of Yijingjie, Li Jing also participated in the daily management of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The original architecture is basically that of a small multinational company.” A former employee of Yijingjie told Southern Weekend reporters that in the early days, Yijingjie was relatively leading in the field of integrated distributed databases, and many people in the team were Colleagues or students of Turing Award winner Jim Gray have a relatively luxurious technical lineup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American Yijingjie was born first in Guizhou Yijingjie, one was established at the beginning of 2015 and the other at the end of the year. In Li Jing&#39;s own words, he is a &quot;father who has his son first and then looks for him.&quot; &quot;My biggest request for the American team is to pass on the technology of database development to the domestic R&amp;D team. This matter is not a secret among the American team.&quot; Li Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie&#39;s headquarters is located in Guiyang High-tech Zone.

Zhao Jilin/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small companies take on big projects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to verify the technical reliability of Yijingjie, the Guiyang government selected Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Behavior as pilot projects, starting with the sandbox project rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called sandbox refers to a virtual database environment used for development, testing and experimental purposes, which is completely isolated from the production environment database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin said that the original core business system of Guiyang Bank was built and launched in 2005, using IBM&#39;s Informix database. Because the system is aging, performance has dropped significantly, and operation and maintenance are worrying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An internal document obtained by Southern Weekend reporters also confirms this. The document mentioned, “In March 2020, the core system mistakenly placed the key synchronization program in the day change process, causing the day to be continuously and incorrectly switched at the end of the day, resulting in a large amount of production data disorder that day. More than a dozen engineers repaired it overnight. It took hours to resolve; a production accident occurred in May 2020, and UnionPay and core logic errors resulted in duplicate entries, resulting in a short payment in the bank.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin further explained that as the customer scale of Guiyang Bank increases, both the database and the application system have obvious deficiencies in business carrying capacity. In addition, in response to the country&#39;s requirements for the development of the credit innovation industry and the self-reliance of the bank&#39;s financial technology system, Guiyang Bank is also making local substitutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jingjie was keenly aware of this opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a work report to Li Zaiyong, the former vice governor of Guizhou Province, on January 14, 2019, Yi Jingjie said that promoting its database has great strategic significance: &quot;Solving the country&#39;s problems in finance and government affairs , communications and other core fields of information security issues; breakthroughs in the core basic technology of the database will drive the efficiency of the entire industry; replace the international database led by Oracle, which accounts for about 90% of the domestic market, and can be exported to the Belt and Road Initiative and even the European and American markets, from These two perspectives can effectively reduce China&#39;s service trade deficit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiyong instructed that from the perspective of institutional support, efforts should be made to build Yijingjie into an innovative platform for the development of Guizhou&#39;s big data industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate on November 21, 2023, Li Zaiyong&#39;s suspected bribery and abuse of power case was concluded by the National Supervisory Commission and transferred to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution. However, the news did not disclose whether Li Zaiyong&#39;s fall was related to Yi Jingjie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee of Yi Jingjie who has worked with Li Weichong and his wife for many years told Southern Weekend reporters that unlike Li Weichong, Li Jing has particularly outstanding planning skills and can grasp the core needs of customers. &quot;She clearly understands what the Bank of Guiyang, Guiyang Municipal Government and participating manufacturers want, and has strong ability to make decisions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 2, 2019, the core business of Guiyang Bank&#39;s domestic database construction The sandbox testing system project was sold, with Yijingjie becoming the sole supplier, and the winning bid price was 43.98 million yuan. According to the announcement, this procurement adopts a single-source procurement method because &quot;according to project construction requirements, procurement can only be from a single supplier.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why use single-source bidding? He Xin said that Guiyang Bank&#39;s procurement is based on the &quot;Interim Provisions on the Management of Centralized Procurement of State-owned Financial Enterprises&quot; implemented by the Ministry of Finance on February 5, 2018. &quot;If we violate the law, I think we can be held accountable according to law. If we comply with the law, I think it will be No problem, no further explanation is needed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the project plan, Guiyang Bank uses the Yijingjie database to build a core business sandbox test application system, using the system as a sandbox for the existing core business system, and using the transactions of the core business system on the sandbox Data, carry out the testing and verification work of Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 8 of the same year, Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank purchased another project of Yijingjie - a domestic database application pilot, with a transaction amount of 123 million yuan. This project adopts the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; solution with mutual backup and free switching, and has been officially accepted in May 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A project leader of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the dual-bank parallel plan has three stages. In the first stage, Oracle is used as the main database, in the second stage, Yi Jingjie is used as the main library, and in the third stage, Oracle is completely excluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge admitted that Yi Jingjie has not yet become the main warehouse. “We must first admit the gap, then push our own things up, and let others stand guard for us for a while. , this is a more cautious approach.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee structure of Yijingjie obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that Yijingjie was still a start-up company with a small scale when it received the bank order. From 2017 to 2019, the number of employees was 69, 100, and 144 respectively. Among them, there are 46, 74 and 105 technical personnel respectively. There are less than 20 people with master&#39;s degrees in the company, and only one with a doctorate. In addition, Yi Jingjie has a team of more than 30 people in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, according to the China Software Shareholders’ Equity Assessment Report, from 2017 to June 2021, Yijingjie’s R&amp;D expenses totaled 62.8922 million yuan, of which the R&amp;D expenses in 2017 were 0, and in 2018 they were only 1.03 million. , it was 19.6471 million yuan in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Most income outsourcing &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On the surface, Yibi Jie has received large orders from Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank in the early stage. But in fact, Yibble did not get much benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person familiar with the matter told the southern weekend reporter that among the 123 million yuan orders signed by Yibi and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, their own products are only 25.9709 million yuan, accounting for 21.11%; Among the contracts signed by 43.98 million yuan, the own product part was only 10.9251 million yuan, accounting for 24.84%. Most of its income is realized through outsourcing, and even partial purchasing income costs inverted, which led the company to a sharp losses in succession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Asset Evaluation Report issued by Zhongrui Shilian Asset Evaluation Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Zhongrui Shilian) in January 2021, from 2017-2019, Yibi Jie operating income (parent company caliber ) 22.858 million yuan, 15.113 million yuan, and 91.5668 million yuan were respectively; net profit (caliber) was -1.8598 million yuan, 4.016 million yuan, and -493,900 yuan, respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Do n’t make money in the early stage, why does Yibijie develop more difficult banking core trading business system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A shareholder of Yibi Jie told the Southern Weekend that although Li Jing announced a strong sense of mission to information security, the actual situation was that the company was facing the edge of bankruptcy and had to seek transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From October to November 2019, the Yibble Capital Crisis crisis, the company had no money on the account, and could not even pay the salary for a while. Borrowing funds from Yibi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The above -mentioned shareholders revealed that during the early entrepreneurial period of E -whale, although there were customers such as China Unicom and China Mobile, the amount of single orders was not large, hundreds of thousands to millions. Li Jing once not only mentioned at the internal meeting, &quot;When can I do so?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the United States on the other end of the Pacific, the company&#39;s annual sales revenue is only $ 23 million, but the team&#39;s costs need more than $ 5 million a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the stance of the husband and wife is inconsistent with the matter of doing the core trading system and database of the bank. Li Weichong opposed many times, and the company&#39;s CEO Ding Hong also resolutely opposed it. &quot;But Li Jing saw the market and insisted on doing it.&quot; The above shareholders said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person close to Li Weiyong told the southern weekend reporter that Li Weichong&#39;s personality is very cautious, and the company’s losses are constantly high. big. On October 7, 2019, Li Weichong and Li Jing agreed to divorce. Li Weiyong stepped down as the chairman and handed all the Yibble Jie who was founded to Li Jing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Aiming at the many issues of Yibi Jie, reporters in the southern weekend contacted Li Weichong many times. He declined the interview with &quot;inconvenience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In December 2019, Li Jing held a meeting in the underground conference room in Beijing&#39;s home. The company&#39;s backbones and representatives of Guiyang have participated in more than 20 people, but they excluded Li Weiyong and Ding Hong representing the American team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A shareholder who participated in the meeting told the Southern Weekend reporter that at this meeting, Li Jing asked the company to make a comprehensive transformation, based on the core business of the bank, and decided to leave the US team. &quot;This is the company&#39;s direction and the place where money is made.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The more you understand the technology, the more you know the border, the more you don&#39;t understand the technology, the more you dare to rush.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person who has participated in Evilist financing told the Southern Weekend reporter that stripping the US team has a lot to do with Anke (safe and reliable). &quot;Later we learned that if you want to do the core business system, you must pass the Anco first. You can&#39;t get this off, don&#39;t do any bank core.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Later The price has achieved a wholly -owned holding of Yibbles in the United States. Then, the US team disbanded and cleared the last obstacle of Yibi Jie&#39;s localization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On October 19, 2020, the Guizhou Sunshine Property Exchange announced that the core business system of Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system was transaction, with a total price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He Xin revealed that the project involves the full business chain, from the front, back to core, disaster recovery system, network, monitoring management platform, security and other related projects, involving more than 20 suppliers. Among them, the amount of the Yibble Jie database project was only over 40 million yuan, accounting for over 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Become a &quot;national team&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; For a software startup, sufficient ammunition can maintain this &quot;burning money&quot; game. The method of Yibijie is to marry Chinese software and become the &quot;national team&quot; in the database field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China Software is a large high -tech central enterprise, which is controlled by China Electronics Information Industry Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as China Electronics). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Jing took over the end of 2019, and began to contact China Electronics. In May 2020, China Electronics and Yibai Jie reached an exclusive investment intention, which will complete investment in Yibai Jie through two steps: first to acquire part of the original shares of Li Jing&#39;s Yibi Jie, through Chinese software, and then complete further capital increase Expand shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In April 2021, China officially invested in Yibius, holding 7.6438%of the equity of Yibi Victoria at a consideration of 56.7897 million yuan. One year later, China&#39;s software decided to increase capital. It is intended to adopt a direct investment+newly -held holding sub -enterprise &quot;China Software Investment&quot; investment to register the capital of 22.91 yuan/1 yuan. According to calculations, the actual capital contribution does not exceed 1,819.213 million yuan), and the subscribed by Yi Yibai has added up to 16.9723 million yuan in registered capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the evaluation report of the Sino -Swiss Shilian, the capital increase of China Software to Yibble Jie is nearly 18 times the book value premium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On February 21, 2023, the Chinese Software Board issued an announcement saying that the company had moderate control of actual investment and payment progress in the consideration of prudential and controlling investment risks. As of November 10, 2022, the company had paid 17.91 million yuan in capital increases, and China Software contributed 47.24 million yuan in capital, a total shareholding ratio increased to 11.09%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This investment amount is far from the original plan that &quot;the total contribution does not exceed 389 million yuan, and the total holding of a total of not exceeding the 25%equity of the Yibbles&quot; is far away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On August 17, the Beijing Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a warning letter to the Sino -Swiss Period, and proposed that the &quot;business income prediction data basis was not sufficient&quot; for Yibijie. In the first evaluation project, the implementation of the company&#39;s profit prediction data was not fully analyzed and reviewed. The reason for the second evaluation project did not fully pay attention to the reasons for the extension of the extension of the Easy Whale and the extension of the large order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, the warning letter mentioned that &quot;the&quot; first &#39;and other expressions were used in the two evaluation reports, but there was no sufficient evidence to support related expressions in the draft. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since then, Yibi Jie has no big financing trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person who has worked in Yi Whale Jie for many years told the Southern Weekend that the early integrated distributed database of Yibble Jie was relatively leading, but as other companies rose rapidly, the advantages of Yibi Jie&#39;s technical advantages gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually. No longer, there are some problems with the company&#39;s strategy. &quot;In the final analysis, it must be quickly listed, and then pull to resources to expand the R &amp; D team. A world -class technology, relying on small companies of one or two hundred people, how to get a leading position?&quot; Today, the National People&#39;s Congress Jincang, Dameng, Nanda General and Shenzhou GM are known as the &quot;four golden flowers&quot; of domestic databases. Not only are IT giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, but also small entrepreneurial manufacturers for market segments, such as Star Ring and Pingcap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another former employee who was responsible for Easy Whale&#39;s financing pointed out that even if the company wants to go public, it is difficult to meet the standards. The first is that the income does not meet the standard. Another key issue is a single customer. Except for Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, Yibi Jie basically does not have large customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A former employee of Yibi Jie revealed to the south weekend reporter that starting in October, Yi Whale Jie has begun layoffs, because of &quot;financing issues and normal optimization of personnel&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[怀念奶奶丨到此的路程]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261493]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 13:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;img alt = &quot;art history scholar Xu Xiaohu.

Grandma comforted Dad and said, don&#39;t cry, Sanbu, your little tiger will fly back to you as soon as possible, accompany you for a lifetime. Dad was so relieved and slowly returned to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Grandma holding this new little baby said: You see, isn&#39;t this the little tiger who has been waiting for so many years to accompany you? Who do you say? This is the little tiger who is back. My parents had nothing to say, so my grandmother looked at her mother&#39;s face and gave her daughter-in-law a name for the first time- &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; You said Isn&#39;t it, Huzi Niang? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;img alt = &quot;In the summer of 1934, Xu Xiaohu and his parents are in Lushan Lingling. .infzm.com/cms/Medias/Image/23/11/28/3FB66ea181.png &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1089 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.CMS/cms/cms/cms/cms /medias/image/23/11/28/3fb66ea181.png &quot;data- key =&quot; 259893 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: justify; &quot;>;&quot; Xiaohu and his parents were in Lushan Lingling.

From 1938 to 1941, his father had been the Republic of China in Italy for four years. The outbreak of World War II was broken, and my parents took me and my sister Xiaoyu back to China. Grandma also came to Ge Le Shan from Ge Leshan to meet the three sons of the third son from Chengdu&#39;s aunt&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Our plane landed in Chongqing. Welcome to the parents and speak Chinese words that adults speak. I walked down the rail and the land that walked to China, which was so moved. This is my motherland! My eight -year -old heart burst out. In Rome&#39;s elementary school classmates, I asked me, uncle shouted! (This is the pronunciation of foreigners say Xu Xiaohu&#39;s pronunciation) &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Uncle Sake! Why is your face so flat? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; I thought about it and answered: This is because I am from a long and old country. The Chinese embassy you saw at Vialepola, a strong guards in front of them wearing beautiful uniforms and high feather helmets. That&#39;s my ancient and luxurious motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Now I kneeling to the land of the motherland, bent down and lowered my head, and kissed my dream of four years of belonging, happy and moved, shed tears, shed tears, shed tears, shed tears, shed tears, shed tears and tears. Gently tell the motherland that the great land, Xiaohu is back, and your child is back. I will learn Chinese as soon as possible, Chinese people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; The land at that time was so dirty, not as bright and clean as Rome. I saw a dirty child. The clothes were torn, full of sores, stood there with naked noses, staring at us. Like adults, they spit out sputum from their mouths and vomited to the ground. The little tiger who returned to China was very sad, but insisted on thinking about this is my favorite motherland, the far away, very old and old motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Later, I took a few hours of hillside with a flower rod sedan, and finally came to the small black soil house of No. 15, Eight Tian, ​​Geleshan. Someone moved the luggage in, and her mother and sister walked into the house and turned their luggage to find things. I stayed on the balcony and watched my father knelt next to the grandma tied to the foot. The mother and child hugged each other, the grandmother cried loudly, and the high and high voice shot on the sky. Dad cried silently, and they cried for a long time. I also felt sad when I saw it, and I didn&#39;t understand it, but I fully appreciated the feelings in their hearts. I left quietly, walked into the door, climbed a chair next to the big round table, and saw a pot of tea on the table and a few cups of no man controlled. I don&#39;t know what the drink is, but it must be the drink of my motherland. I poured myself a drink for myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; bitter and astringent. Adult. taste of China. I love it, I want to love it. Drink another glass to taste it. Another cup. This taste has not been tasted for a lifetime. It has no taste in Italy. I am Chinese, I will drink Chinese taste. One cup after receiving this ancient taste and sucking into my soul. Xu Xiaohu and her motherland gradually became one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; The sky began to be dark. The crying and complaints outside had not stopped, but the room was not clear. Someone put a lamp on a large table. It is a green long -handle oil lamp made of ceramics. A white light core floated on the bowl of oil. Is this the only lighting in our big room (restaurant)? The new Chinese who returned home found that she could not see anything. She was not like the light of the Roman electrical chandeliers, and she immediately felt ashamed. This is the ancient lighting of my motherland. No matter how bright, I will love it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; I don&#39;t remember how I fell asleep on the first night in Gelshan, I just remember that I insisted on going to school right away, and learned my mother tongue again. Chinese elementary school students. I did not expect that I expected to go to elementary school to continue to study in the fourth grade but was sent to the first grade to learn Chinese. I went to school happily, and I still remember that the first lesson said, &quot;Come, come to school, everyone come to school.&quot; All Chinese characters have no phonetic symbols -we go directly to know the ancient Chinese characters. On the way home, the classmates chased the stones behind, and shouted loudly &quot;Madam!&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; My hair was not black and straight, Tea red curved. After I went home, I desperately brushed with water and brush, trying to brush it directly. No matter how wet and how to brush it, it rolls up again. I had to face these students myself, fight with them, and hit them one by one. After all, I am eight years old, a little higher than the first -year classmates. When I got along with Italian classmates, there was no negative behavior, and I began to release an inherent energy, and I felt very proud. It turns out that the children of the motherland in the war persuaded each other with physical strength. Well, start learning Chinese words, and start to become a Chinese hero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; . &amp; nbsp; &lt;/span>; Grandma said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; I will not come down from the tree. This tree is my home. &lt;/span>; I answered happily and naughty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; . &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; at my place. I look at the world from here. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot; Give me it from that tree. Grandma told you to come down from that dirty tree. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; No. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; We will not be filial now. Little tiger, a good child, come here to grandma. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Tree? Why must I go to my grandma? I like to live in this tree. Here I can count the enemy aircraft! &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; At that time, my Chinese had already spoken well, on the pine tree near the small mud house in Geleshan, I remembered Before the Grand Garden, the official residence of the elegant embassy in Rome, the freedom of free flowerless trees that were not observed and found. I have a high ceiling in the bedroom in Rome. The ceiling to the wall covers the colorful murals with classical mythical characters ... There is a two or three -story doll houses in the bedroom, which can play with the furniture, doll bed and cabinet, chairs and tables. And several puppet dolls who can stand and stand. These are not interesting to me. After lunch, I will slip into the garden outside, find the highest flower fig tree to climb up, hiding in the leaves that are rich and overflowing with milky liquid. No one can see me, and no one will go there to find me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In the months of autumn, I can pick juicy fruits on this huge tree. Even if there is no fruit, I can sit on its big branches to enjoy the breeze, height and happiness. For a child with a family nanny, this is difficult to get lucky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; My cute little sister Xiaoyu is three and a half years younger than me, and has always been in the embrace of the French Switzerland nanny of Mademoiselle, from the embrace of the French nanny of Mademoiselle. Roman years at the age of 4 to 8, they are very free, and they are more committed to exploring unknown loneliness, not chatting with servants or dolls. In the changing trees that pass through the cool breeze, I will talk from the people from the higher favorable position to talk about the sound of people on the ground, and I can feel the movements of adults. That perspective made me from a wonderful distance and adults from an adult. The world is separated from a buffer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; On those generous big branches, everything has lost the persuasion of &quot;adults&quot;. From the perspective of tree living, everything on the ground has become less urgent and threatening. Observe them from a higher perspective than adults, and find that adults often destroy the scope of secular wisdom or common sense. Surprisingly, they are often like this and spend a lot of time to participate in unnecessary words and deeds; do a lot of unnecessary action, unreal behavior, and raise a hypocritical mentality. Adults will spend a few days and nights that are not important or even ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; For example, they created very difficult clothes, my mother&#39;s clothes out of the house, there is a large row of buttons-but they are all behind! Walking behind her, I can see that one of the buttons is not right, tilting her head aside, causing all the other buttons to be wrong, forming a scene that looks very funny. The adults would pretend not to see it, but they giggled behind her all day. No one pointed her to this, and no one helped her to deduct the whole row of buttons again. I can only walk behind and watch them, thinking about how stupid and unnecessary this time is spent, but our children are not allowed to point out this, giggle or laughing; Leave it to yourself and attribute this to the adult&#39;s love for spending time, and the children can only endure silently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Give me the tree. Did you hear it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Why, grandma? Why do I leave my beloved habitat? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Because I must teach you now embroidery. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Embroidery?

I have never heard of embroidery in class! &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; When I think of sitting in a closed room, holding a thin needle, piercing a cotton cloth stretched in a round hoop, entering and leaving Out, isolation of all breeze sounds, fresh air in the sun, the singing of birds, or people&#39;s voices, it is like I isolating life itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In addition to sitting on the pine tree at home, I also like to sit on a small square stone under another pine tree. Through the valley on the way home from school, under the winding corner of the winding mountain trail, under the big stone mansion of General Chen Cheng, I will reach the habitat after a few steps, sit there and stare at the distant Shapingba Valley Plain. , The Jialing River in the sun meanders into the distance. There is a Central University, and my father teaches there, and also works in the Chongqing Central Government. In that habitat, I will listen to the voice of people living in the plain. They sell the goods, the parents yell at the children, and the children shouted each other. I would think of my father and work with my head alone to do all my heads. People serve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Every Sunday, he will take the &quot;two-person human car&quot; to leave our black mud house, go down the mountain along thousands of steps, reach Shapingba below Shapingba below Entering his Chongqing and his lonely rooms, I have always been thinking like my dad. I think about my dad&#39;s inner world ... He is alone, satisfied everything that we can do, and make our country better. Some. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; That is the time when the start of World War II. Japan has a ruthless bombing of Chongqing every day in Japan, hoping to eliminate important government goals. However, Chongqing has been in haze, and Wuyun is densely set, and the Japanese aircraft is difficult to bombard the target. Every few days, we will hear the alarm sounds over the head of our heads. Everyone will even rush out of the people who live in Gele Mountain and squeeze into those humid and dark air -proof caves. Water vapor. Every time I slip out alone, sit on the rocks under my favorite tall pine, counting enemy planes, try to identify different brands of the aircraft based on black and white photos -those photos are me and my classmates from the police station.

Of course you want to get married! Marriage and give birth to children! &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Grandma, please tell me, Was our life when we were young to get married and gave birth to children? ——This is so painful, grandma! Each of you has given birth to a child! Mom and dad have done it too! Grandma&#39;s child is born in front of grandma! Now that our children are finally here, we must start a interesting life. We come here for our special and unique life of children! &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; I suddenly became crystal clear. The reason for our birth is to be born! Become a child who is married to our parents. Now we are finally born, the purpose of growing up is successful, and we don&#39;t need to get married and have children anymore! The life explained by my grandmother is completely unacceptable to my broad -minded way of thinking. Is this really the life everyone said? So in this way, obviously adults are really ignorant! The real purpose of life is not just for the existence of human beings. I saw it clearly at the time that humans obviously had not asked this question, the meaning of survival -why do we live -this is the question! Why do we come to this fun place? Of course, come to appreciate this life and play it thoroughly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Play in pain to the end-this is the purpose of us-no? The most basic and important test of this is from my heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Grandma told me a lot of stories. There is a large round metal barrel on the elevated in her room. Grandma shook around and moved her little feet, and she could walk to the elevated elevated and took off the particularly bright barrel, mixed it, and opened it to take out her own maltose. There is nothing in the world than the maltose that rolls with grandma. Round and flat, with white powder on the outside, so that they are not sticky into a group. Therefore, of course, eating maltose can also count on one of the main goals of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Listening to grandma telling stories is also one of the wonderful goals, too charming! Grandma&#39;s story will include the heroes of our family. For example, the grandma&#39;s surname is Xia, and the Xia family comes from Yue Fei&#39;s hometown. Grandma&#39;s voice as sweet as honey and high as a bird, slowly using her Xuzhou cavity story, all have a taste. Xiaohu sat next to her grandma&#39;s knees and listened, and she forgot everything else. The entire countryside loves Yue Fei. He helped the emperor from returning from Jin Guo to restore the throne of the emperor, but Gao Zong was unwilling to return the throne he had already sat to his father and father -this unsuccessful son called Yue Fei and Yue Fei&#39;s eldest son Concerned as an enemy and chopped his head. Xiaohu cried loudly when he heard it, and his tears flew around. The villagers who love Yue Fei are also speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Grandma also likes to tell the story of Grandpa to Mongolia- &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot; FONT-FAMILY: Kai style, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Tiger Head, one day, the country wants Mongolians to stay in China and cannot leave the motherland to go out independently. So your grandpa-General Xu, then, did not bring any army or weapons. He ran to Mongolia alone, and only took his flute and the old mother of Xuzhou with his cake. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Find a hill and sit down on the top. Grandpa inserted his big &quot;Xu&quot; military flag on the ground -just sitting there, singing, singing, watching the moon, eating pancakes, and waiting for the Mongolian chief to surrender calmly. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; coming. He looked up, wow! Hearing the voice of Kunqu opera. Seeing the big &quot;Xu&quot; character flag, it was startled, and immediately climbed up respectfully. When he saw Grandpa, he knelt down and squeezed his head to apologize desperately. &quot;Oh! The president is coming in person, the little ignorance is incompetent, so I dare not be! Xiao&#39;s unwilling to disturb the uncle!&quot; I regret that the buns and apologies are too late. . Hahaha! If you don&#39;t say a word, you ca n’t say a word, so you caught the Mongolian back. You said that your grandpa is more capable. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; This is how my grandma tells the story of Grandpa who recovered Great Mongolia, which has also become one of our private family history. When the great -grandchildren who are scattered in various countries are gathered together, this story will perform the &quot;historical drama&quot; of multiple versions of the story, expressing the story of General Xu Shuzheng regaining foreign Mongolia from various perspectives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Dad, of course, have never heard of grandma. In front of my father, no one dares to mention the name or past of Grandpa. Thinking of his favorite father, his father would shed tears. Xiaohu likes to listen to the story of grandma, which is much faster than Yue Fei&#39;s story. Every time I heard the chief sweaty, I laughed at the period when I was too sweating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; At this time, the national, struggle, self-sacrifice, integrity, and various ideals of serving the public have taken root in the bottom of the heart. I began to think about the purpose of our survival repeatedly; how important and huge time and space worlds were felt.但在心底的最深处，我开始生出一个无法压倒的疑问……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“我想当大明星”：地下偶像疯狂在2023年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261515]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“营造女友感”：追地下偶像的男人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261499]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 12:10:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“蓉漂之后，再无漂泊”：年轻人与成都的双向奔赴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261513]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 10:57:32&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the afternoon of October 20, 2023, &quot;Chengdu Marathon &amp;amp; World Science Fiction Conference City Walk &quot;The flash mob event was held at the main venue of the World Science Fiction Conference on the Greenway around the Lake.

Now, he also has his own book signings at science fiction conventions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As one of the millions of young people &quot;floating in Chengdu&quot;, Bai Bi from Jiangsu has a reason to stay in Chengdu. At present, he is mainly engaged in the Internet industry and works part-time in science fiction writing. There are few cities that can simultaneously host good Internet companies, embrace the vision of building a science fiction industry, and also create a comfortable, livable and smoky urban atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu attracts Bai Ben, and young people like Bai Ben also attract Chengdu. For years, this rapidly rising megacity in the Midwest has struggled to recruit and retain young talents. I don’t know who was the first to say the words, “After Chengdu, there will be no more wandering.” This has become the essence of Chengdu’s talent work branding and the pursuit of the city’s builders. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Beside Xinglong Lake, look up and meet the doctor&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After five years, I faced the computer screen with a picture of Aba, Sichuan Province in 2018 Huang Ying is still quite moved by the high-altitude bird&#39;s eye view of Aerzhai, Wenchuan County, Prefecture. That year, a landslide suddenly hit Aerzhai. Half of the village collapsed &lt;span>; and half of it was buried. Fortunately, no one died. The geological disaster monitoring and early warning platform developed by Sichuan Zhongke Chuanxin Technology Co., Ltd. played a role. Villagers moved in advance and escaped this natural disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying is now the deputy general manager of this company. However, going back to 6 years ago, Huang Ying was still confused on the eve of changing careers. At that time, the 24-year-old was working in a survey and design institute in a province in Central and South China. The industry was gradually declining. A colleague asked: &quot;Should we transform into high technology?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Huang Ying is somewhat tempted, but where to settle is a problem. He thought of Chengdu, where he spent four years in college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, major cities across the country have increased their efforts to attract young talents. Chengdu also needs more young people to participate in urban development and construction. Li Rong, a talent worker in Chengdu, told Southern Weekend reporters that Chengdu has launched version 1.0 of its new talent policy around the idea of ​​“gathering people to prosper the city”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Settlement first and then employment&quot; is a policy initiative that has led to a nationwide trend of settling down and attracting talents. &quot;Those under 45 years old and with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above can directly settle in Chengdu with their graduation certificate.&quot; Li Rong said that in the past six years, Chengdu has attracted more than 710,000 college students to settle down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying took a fancy to the convenience of settling down and joined the trend of &quot;Peacock Flying Southwest&quot;. He and his partners founded a company in Chengdu High-tech Zone, focusing on geological disasters and Environmental disaster prevention and reduction platform construction and product research and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Everything is difficult at the beginning. Huang Ying&#39;s new company encountered obstacles in financing, human resources, sales and other aspects. Initially, he traveled to almost every county in western and southern Sichuan to introduce himself to the local land and resources departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu gave him a hand. Huang Ying remembers that when the company first settled in Chengdu High-tech Zone, the government provided policy support of halving office rents. At the end of 2017, the company sold the first batch of prototypes to a county in western Sichuan. Half a year later, the machine successfully warned of landslides twice, and since then it has gradually opened up the market in southwest China. However, government assistance has not stopped. Three years after the epidemic, the company has also received financial subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying said that currently, the company has applied its equipment and platforms to water conservancy dams, mine safety, foundation pit support, transportation, etc., and has Go nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Ying’s career is developing, and Chengdu’s talent policy is also iterating. In 2020, Chengdu launched the New Talent Policy Version 2.0 around the construction of the Western Science City, focused on technological innovation, launched and implemented Tianfu Laboratory&#39;s global high-end talent recruitment plan, created Chengdu&#39;s characteristic professional group, and supported high-level platforms to open to the society. In 2022, The Chengdu Innovation Index ranks 29th in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years have passed, and there are many scientific research institutions in the Chengdu Science City located in Tianfu New District, Sichuan. Liu Hongyan, a 34-year-old assistant researcher at the Institute of Urban Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, joked, “If you walk around Xinglong Lake, you might just look up and meet a doctor.” In 2019, she came to the institute as a postdoctoral fellow to work on functional Food development and other work, becoming a member of Xinglong Lakeside&#39;s army of doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shi Jian, the 36-year-old assistant director of the DC Research Institute of Tsinghua Sichuan Energy Internet Research Institute, is also a Ph.D. from Xinglong Lakeside. Looking back on his two years in Chengdu, he felt that he had achieved what he had hoped for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Shi Jian is pursuing the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. He once worked for 7 years in a research institute affiliated to a state-owned enterprise in a southeastern province, focusing on research on ultra-high voltage DC engineering and new energy power generation. He has always been troubled by the fact that the cycle of transferring scientific research to application is too long. After arriving in Tianfu New District, Sichuan, he was able to flex his muscles. Right now, the Shijian team is developing the most critical projects in the power industry such as series of power equipment and power chips for DC projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 22, 2023, Peking University Qiu Deba Gymnasium, the scene of the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; Peking University special event.

State-owned enterprises do not &quot;go round and round to make appointments&quot;. Instead, the person in charge directly reads the resume, interviews, and talks about job content, remuneration and benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a scene from the Beijing special event of the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; series of events. Li Rong introduced that as the most important series of talent recruitment activities in Chengdu in recent years, the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; has held more than 1,000 talent recruitment activities in key cities at home and abroad, and signed more than 200,000 contracts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, Chengdu has focused on leading the city’s talent work with branding strategies. &amp;nbsp;The slogan &quot;Rongpiao&quot; has been shouted out, but there has been some controversy in society as to whether the talent brand should continue to use this name. After all, like Beipiao and Shanghai Piao, there is still the word &quot;piao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Chengdu has been a typical immigrant city since ancient times, with cultural characteristics of openness, tolerance, generosity and friendliness. According to talent workers in Chengdu, the genetic inheritance and cultural core of &quot;Rongpiao&quot; have long been rooted in the urban development trajectory, and have become Chengdu&#39;s endless driving force, changing the original meaning of &quot;piao&quot; and enriching the meaning of &quot;piao&quot;. &quot;Connotation. Chengdu respects every individual&#39;s dream, cherishes every upward force, and uses the greatest sincerity to help &quot;Rongpiao&quot; realize their personal value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has fully launched the practice of talent work branding strategy, creating a deeply rooted &quot;Rongpiao&quot; brand, and is also the first country in the country to apply for trademark registration The city&#39;s talent work brand has created a series of flagship products and a series of derivatives, such as the &quot;Rongpiao Plan&quot; to attract talents, the &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; to recruit talents, the &quot;Rongpiao Cup&quot; to gather talents, and the &quot;Rongpiao Cup&quot; to educate talents. Talent Development Institute”, Jingcai’s “Rongpiao Talent Day”, Licai’s “Rongcheng Talent Green Card”, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has been exploring ways to solve practical difficulties for young college students who have just entered society. &quot;Thinking about it from a talent perspective, what does a newly graduated college student lack when going to a city to find a job? It must be a place to live.&quot; Li Rong said that based on this idea, Chengdu has created 26 &quot;Rongpiao&quot; cities in recent years. &quot;Youth Talent Station&quot; provides short-term free accommodation for fresh graduates who come to Chengdu to find jobs, as well as a series of value-added services such as employment guidance and urban integration. &quot;As long as they hold the interview notice and pass the online application, young college students can stay in the apartment for free for up to one month.&quot; So far, more than 80,000 young college students have been accommodated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that in the past, when enterprises and institutions in Chengdu went to first-tier cities and well-known universities to recruit, the results were not good because they worked alone and lacked visibility. not good. Later, they changed their approach and maximized the effectiveness of talent introduction by building a collaborative talent introduction model of &quot;government guidance, employer leadership, and broad social participation&quot; to unify publicity themes, unified promotion processes, and unified logos and slogans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking this year&#39;s &quot;Rongpiao Talent Gathering&quot; Tsinghua University and Peking University as an example, Chengdu mobilized 26 public institutions and 16 municipal state-owned enterprises to come up with For high-quality positions, university research institutes and Fortune 500 companies are invited to participate in recruitment. According to statistics, this event released 782 recruitment positions and attracted more than 1,800 young college students to participate. The activity includes city promotion, opportunity list release, job promotion, doctoral and postdoctoral policy promotion, etc. Each recruitment unit &quot;can add their own creativity&quot; and set up stalls to recruit talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruiting young talents is only the first step. In order to retain talents, Chengdu also spent real money. From the city level to the district (city) and county level, there are a series of talent project applications and talent level assessments. Liu Hongyan recalled that after she achieved certain scientific research results, she was evaluated as a senior talent category C in the &quot;Tianfu Talent Plan&quot; of Sichuan Tianfu New District in 2022. The new district will provide a subsidy of 500,000 yuan within five years. The following year, she applied for scientific research funds from the Chengdu Agricultural Science and Technology Talent Cultivation Program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Right now, a laboratory in the institute is filled with freeze-dried fruit and vegetable solid drinks developed by Liu Hongyan’s team, and a whitening and moisturizing set containing phloretin. and other technological transformation achievements. This Inner Mongolian native has bought a house and settled in Chengdu. &quot;Currently, Chengdu is the city that best coordinates my work and life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Chengdu Youth Development Report (2022)&quot; released by the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Chengdu New Economic Development Research Institute shows that the population of &quot;Rongpiao&quot; reaches 6.8349 million. Among them, the proportion of young people from outside Sichuan Province is 21.85%, and the proportion of young people from &quot;Rongpiao&quot; who come from outside the province is 32.9%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rongpiao Youth Talent Station, Jinjiang District, Chengdu.

He is just an ordinary person who loves life. In Chengdu, he felt another attraction of this city for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;30-year-old Hu Peng is from Leshan, Sichuan. He works as a tour guide in Chengdu, taking tourists to appreciate the different flavors of the city, including city gates, city walls, streets, and museums. , listen to historical stories and observe the lifestyle of local residents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他开发了两条小众路线，一条从城西的少城到抚琴，一条从城北的新二村到曹家巷。 In Fuqin, he had seen a cup of tea costing 3 yuan, and a bowl of noodles costing 89 yuan. The old man went out to eat noodles and drink tea in the morning, and sat there all day, feeling relaxed and happy. In Xiner Village, &quot;the size of the community is the size of the market.&quot; The market men and women lingered in the market in the morning, and he felt a vibrant beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Young people can always find the livable side of Chengdu. Science fiction writer Huo Zhongwu came to Chengdu in 2005 to study at university and settled here after graduation. He enjoys the pleasant cost of living here. Similarly, renting an apartment near the city center is about a quarter of that in Shanghai. A &quot;Rongpiao&quot; young man admitted to Southern Weekend reporters that one of the important reasons why he came to Chengdu to work three years ago was that Chengdu&#39;s housing prices are extremely cost-effective among provincial capital cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Have fun&quot; is a business card of Chengdu. Huo Zhongwu’s observation is that life in Chengdu is much slower than in first-tier cities, and there are always people in the teahouses and cafes on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Bai Ben was deeply impressed by a salon at the World Science Fiction Convention. A writer mentioned that he had seen a netizen post asking: It will be rare to have sunny weather in Chengdu tomorrow. Does anyone want to go to a high-rise building to watch the snow-capped mountains together?作家第二天天不亮便到楼顶，已经有不少人在搓手等待。 “This kind of thing is hard to imagine in other cities,” Bai Ben said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu has also captured the needs of talents for urban environment and quality of life. In 2022, Chengdu will launch the &quot;Talent New Deal 3.0&quot; version with excellent platforms and ecological management, attracting more young talents to take the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When the water accumulates, fish gather&lt;span>;, and when trees grow thicker, birds gather.&quot; The relevant person in charge of the Talent Office of Chengdu Municipal Party Committee introduced that Chengdu has been We strive to protect the value attribution of talents with the highest quality services and create a value ecosystem where everyone is seen, respected and cared for. What can be proved is that Chengdu has been ranked first in &quot;China&#39;s happiest city&quot; for 14 consecutive years, ranked first in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#39;s &quot;Attractive Cities for College Students and Young Job Seekers&quot;, and won &quot;China&#39;s Best Talent Attracting City&quot; for 4 consecutive years. &quot;prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Talent work is ultimately inseparable from improving the quality of the city.&quot; For example, in order to cater to young people&#39;s fun-loving and quality-of-life mentality, Chengdu continues to optimize its environment , a 100-kilometer first-level greenway of the Ring Ecological Park has been built inside and outside the city ring expressway, with billowing green wheat fields, lush grassland, and swaying woods; while building a park city, Chengdu has opened up a large number of wetlands and green spaces As a camping site, &quot;everyone goes camping and basking in the sun on weekends&quot;, creating a new picture of urban life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 3, 2023, a unique &quot;underwater bookstore&quot; next to Xinglong Lake, a famous internet celebrity check-in place in Chengdu.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Resonance among young people&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chengdu’s life scene that attracts young people also includes abundant public spaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The streets and alleys here hide &lt;span>;three&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;thousand&lt;/span>; more than one bookstore, far more than any other city in the country. It is difficult to count the number of public activities that are closely connected to it - reading clubs, movie viewing parties, script screenings, and sharing by scholars and experts. Some active spaces can host hundreds of events a year. The event was small in scale, with only twenty or thirty people at most, but it provided an opportunity for connection and resonance for countless young people eager to express, share, and see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Around 2015, Wang Miaomiao worked as an account manager for a brand company in Chengdu. At that time, she fell into depression for a time due to family reasons. She began to participate in a large number of offline public activities and spent three or four nights a week in various sharing sessions. Although most of the time, she couldn&#39;t understand what the sharer was saying, she liked the friendly and warm atmosphere, which allowed her to temporarily escape the pain in her life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Product manager Di Hao came to Chengdu to work in 2016. At the beginning, he couldn&#39;t find anyone he could play with, whether at work or in life. A year later, he saw the activities of the Toastmasters Club in the same city on Douban and tried to participate. Since then, he has been hooked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He has vivid memories of many activities. During the reading party, they read Tolstoy to understand human greed; after the movie viewing party, someone explained Plato&#39;s Allegory of the Cave. Once, scholar Wang Di came to a tavern in the suburbs of Chengdu to share. More than a hundred people came and &lt;span>;Wang Di&lt;/span>; talked until midnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Di Hao felt that the young friends who participated in the event gave him a sense of belonging. These activities also opened up a new world for Di Hao. In the past, when facing big figures, he had a sense of order based on distinction between superiority and inferiority. The egalitarian atmosphere of public activities gradually made him accustomed to dealing with others as an equal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After 2018, Hu Peng also often went to Chengdu to participate in public events. In his early years, he met a Polish man and a British man at a sharing meeting. They worked for a few months a year, teaching English and doing project planning, and the rest of the time was spent traveling around. This way of life surprised him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hu Peng prides himself on being a young man from a small town, having graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree. Many people in his hometown have nothing to do in their spare time except playing cards. These activities made him realize that there was another possibility in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Also in 2018, Wang Miaomiao, who has participated in numerous public activities, became the director of Xunlu Library. This is a community library, but it aspires to become a &quot;humanistic beacon&quot;. Wang Miaomiao discovered that people lacked general education, so he invited professors from Sichuan University to come to the library to teach general education courses about Du Fu and visual culture. She listened to lawyer Zhang Ying&#39;s &quot;Bright Dialogue&quot; series of public debates and thought it was good, and invited Zhang Ying to the library for a discussion on psychology. Some participants said that these discussions responded to the rising enthusiasm for psychology since the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Miaomiao feels that these public lives have reshaped her life. She likes to study people and society, and is curious about where strong vitality is born, and the sharers &lt;span>;also&lt;/span>; responded to her questions in their own ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, she will become busier. Offline activities in Chengdu are very prosperous. In addition to creating more in-depth public activity content, she also needs to run a &quot;reclamation community&quot; that unites participants with reading as the core. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this corner of the southwest, public space is so prosperous, and Hu Peng connects it with the characteristics of the city. Chengdu has a tradition of chatting in teahouses and cafes.此外，或许是许多忙碌的年轻人都奔向了北、上、广等一线城市，来成都&lt;span>;的&lt;/span>;青年人更加追求精神充盈、&lt;span>;向往&lt;/span>;美好生活。 They find resonance in Chengdu and at the same time inject new vitality into Chengdu&#39;s public life.

Usually, after gathering seven or eight tourists, the team sets off. Along the way, there will be more and more listeners behind the red volunteer uniforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This 51-year-old Chengdu native was originally a manager of a foreign company. He traveled around the southwest and was busy and exhausted from work. After a serious illness, the doctor warned &quot;not to be too tired from now on&quot;, so the museum at home became a new choice. The company organized groups to come and listen to it several times. They were surprised by the colleague in front of them who talked about the ancient Shu civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 3.6 million people like her with dual identities in Chengdu. Zhang Zimeng, a student at Sichuan Conservatory of Music, is a volunteer in the &quot;Song is the Sweetest Medicine&quot; project. She goes to the hospital every week to serve as a vocal teacher for fifty or sixty &quot;Teletubbies&quot; suffering from severe spinal deformity; 37-year-old Express Member Tang Jian is the captain of the &quot;Maverick Pioneer Drivers&quot; volunteer service team. His team is a &quot;mobile probe&quot; that walks through the streets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are volunteer service stories that happen every day in every corner of Chengdu. Wei Na, the relevant person in charge of the Volunteer Service Department of the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee, told Southern Weekend reporters that they have built a volunteer service platform &quot;Civilized Xingrong&quot; to use information technology to record all volunteer service information. Since the entire platform is in operation, there are nearly 40,000 registered volunteer teams in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chengdu is becoming a model city of &quot;City of Volunteers&quot;. Wei Na feels that this is a &quot;process of gathering glimmers of light&quot;: &quot;Looking at them separately, they are all small and microscopic, but together they are dedicated to the governance of the city and its happiness.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;“It’s so troublesome to be a volunteer”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is Ji Ying’s sixth year as a volunteer at the Jinsha Heritage Museum. “Without a strong belief, there is no way to persevere.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 60 volunteers in the museum, and the recruitment assessment of Ji Ying’s explanation team is recognized as strict. This &quot;novice on historical knowledge&quot; stumbled all the way. He passed the group interview, completed the first round of the relics museum&#39;s interpretation test, passed the written test, and passed the entire museum&#39;s interpretation interview, becoming a trainee volunteer. The entire assessment process lasted nearly seven months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first lesson of the volunteer training is to visit the museum, and the second lesson is to learn the team rules and regulations. The service hours are required to reach 120 hours per year, and in principle, they must come once a week. Ma Nong, a volunteer in the service group, was not used to it when he first arrived: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect that being a volunteer would be so troublesome, but it is so strict.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id =&quot;73774&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70565&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/0bf8bd712f.jpg&quot; img-title =&quot;ffa8c2a263ca7831b29090f0159f916.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteers in red uniforms are explaining to tourists at the Jinsha Heritage Museum.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who manages this volunteer team is Lu Lu, a staff member of the museum’s Department of Public Service and Social Education. &quot;We often call her King Lu or Little Leather Whip.&quot; Manong joked, &quot;King Lu&quot; is very strict. If you don&#39;t bring a work permit, you won&#39;t be allowed in, and the service time will not be counted. As time went by, she discovered that this strict compliance with the rules was equivalent to blocking out &quot;those who were not determined&quot;, leaving only those who really wanted to be volunteers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Lu told Southern Weekend reporters that she &quot;stated the rules and regulations upfront&quot; in the hope of conducting a double selection with volunteers. &quot;Without management, there is no cohesion. If you can accept it, we will happily work together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cohesion of the team is not only reflected in the system. Lu Lu will try her best to remember each volunteer’s birthday and lead everyone in the group to send blessings. At the end-of-year commendation meeting, she will contact the departments the volunteers have worked with and request them to issue certificates of honor to express respect and gratitude to the volunteers. &quot;Volunteer partners are not here for material things, so I hope to satisfy them in other ways that they are respected and needed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For museums with limited manpower, volunteers are important supplementary strength. Lu Lu mentioned that the museum has more than 30 docents, and during winter and summer vacations and popular holidays, the supply far exceeds demand, and volunteers can fill the seats. They announced the designated time for volunteers to give lectures, three in the morning and one in the afternoon, &quot;which can alleviate the demand to a great extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The English translation volunteers in the translation team have a &quot;full schedule&quot; of work. The museum had tried a translation company, but it involved archaeological terminology and was more difficult. Instead, the museum&#39;s volunteer translation team was more competent - they had all passed CET-8 in English, and their academic qualifications were basically at least a master&#39;s degree. &quot;We have a lot of professional training, including the curator who will explain to us the excavation and historical origin of cultural relics, and we all understand them very clearly,&quot; said Lei Lei, the head of the translation team. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Overall scheduling from city to district&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the aforementioned &quot;Civilized Rong&quot; platform, there are an average of more than 500 various activities like this every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first intelligent platform in the country to fully support the practice of civilization and the development of volunteer service activities in the new era. It is understood that this smart platform can realize the complete record of volunteer service information. At the same time, it is also an important reference for award evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of the Chengdu Volunteer Network, who is responsible for managing the platform, said that volunteer service activities in all districts and counties in Chengdu can be seen on the platform. “Its biggest function is to facilitate citizens to find activities and sign up to participate. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, there have been particularly many ecological and environmental protection activities on the platform. Liu Yi told Southern Weekend reporters that during the National Day holiday, the Chengdu Municipal Civilization Office linked 14 volunteer service stations on the greenway around the city to carry out cycling check-in activities. Chengdu’s city-ring greenway is a holy place for cycling enthusiasts, with a total length of 100 kilometers. &quot;The needs of citizens prompted us to extend civilized practices and volunteer services to the greenway scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 14 stations cooperate with each other and each has its own actions. Zhang Ying, chief of the Creation and Volunteer Service Section of the Propaganda Department of the Wenjiang District Party Committee, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at that time, she was most worried about not attracting citizens to stop. The organizer put together the civilized blind box of the station into a map of China. Cyclists passing by would always stop and ask questions, which was very eye-catching. “Every day, our check-in points are crowded with people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the projects in the Jinsha Site Museum, this is a network of volunteer activities woven by government departments at all levels in Chengdu. An event lasting several days requires the cooperation of multiple departments. In the greenway station activities, civilized units at all levels play the main role, guiding and coordinating social organizations to participate in the assistance, and civilized units at the provincial, municipal, and district levels pair up to jointly build greenways. In the Wenjiang section of the Ring Greenway alone, the participating departments include the Wenjiang District Health Bureau, the District Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, and the District Education Bureau, with a total of more than 100 people from at least 12 units and enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The specific activities of the greenway station every day are also carried out by the responsible unit. Zhang Ying gave an example. The district health bureau is responsible for free TCM clinics, which provide health consultation services to citizens, teach first aid knowledge, and deal with sudden accidents such as cycling injuries and hiking sprains. The Wenjiang District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital also dispatched medical team volunteers. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Zhang Ying, it is not difficult to connect various departments to participate in volunteer activities. The entire event is coordinated by the New Era Civilization Practice Center, and the district party secretary serves as the director of the center to implement the work. Before the start of a large-scale event, the Civilized Practice Center will hold a scheduling meeting, and all departments that need to cooperate with the event must attend the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to her, Wenjiang District is among the first batch of new era civilized practice center pilot projects in the province and the second batch in the country. A district-level center, nine towns and sub-districts, and 95 villages and communities have jointly built a three-level position where the Civilized Practice Center is located. It also has 8 professional volunteer service standing teams and multiple special volunteer service teams. “When we need it When the time comes, we can coordinate.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our volunteer service model in Chengdu is well coordinated from top to bottom. The civilized practice centers in each district and county have standardized systems, activities and organizational structures, which can promote this kind of service very well. Civilized practices and volunteer service activities are carried out on a regular basis.&quot; Zhang Ying concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73771&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70562&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/69306910a6.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;839b8378c9c405b613355b1a9cb0de4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wenjiang District carries out activities at the Greenway Station during the National Day in 2023.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Volunteer service in &quot;Taobao Mall&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Establishing a points feedback incentive mechanism is an important part of building a city of volunteers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Volunteer time exchange for points and services, and related selection and recognition are common options for each project, and it is a top-down design. The &quot;Chengdu Volunteer Service Incentive Measures (Trial)&quot; launched by Chengdu City in 2019 is the country&#39;s first systematic volunteer service incentive system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the framers wanted to link education, employment, settlement, etc. with volunteer services. Wei Na admitted that there are difficulties at the practical level, such as extra points for employment interviews or public examinations. Due to the lack of upper-level system support, it is difficult to clearly correlate volunteer service experience with the degree of extra points, and the basis is also difficult to quantify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are some areas where quantitative bonus points can be gained.譬如，在居住证积分统计中，志愿服务有10分分值。 &quot;The previous policy was to add 100 points to get a household registration, and to participate in volunteer services, you can add 10 points. The points are still very impressive.&quot; She added that the Municipal Civilization Office has a dedicated person responsible for the points recognition of volunteer services, which has been changed to Normal operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, volunteer service is closely related to the comprehensive quality evaluation of primary and secondary school students in Chengdu. If you participate in the &quot;Civilized Rong&quot; volunteer project, the platform will automatically generate an official certificate, which will be used as a reference for school evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the &quot;Civilized Xingrong&quot; platform, volunteers can exchange points for corresponding rights and interests. Liu Yi nicknamed it the &quot;Taobao&quot; of volunteer service. The online points mall can be redeemed for items, training and services. Some communities will also upload incentive items, such as a pack of washing powder, a bag of rice, or a haircut card at the doorstep. &quot;We are actually using the concept of crowdfunding to provide courtesy and help for volunteer services.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Niushikou Street, which gave birth to the &quot;Maverick Pioneer Drivers&quot; volunteer service team, has created its own points incentive system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jie, a staff member of the Party and Mass Affairs Office of Niushikou Street, said that one point is equal to one yuan, which can be exchanged for mobile phone holders, ponchos, power banks and other items in the points mall, or you can choose coupons donated by caring companies. . The most popular redemption items are Hongqi supermarket chain cash coupons, which can be used directly for consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the volunteers of Jinsha Heritage Museum, the biggest incentive to give back is intangible. The suggestions they make always get the support of the museum: invite sanitation workers to enter the museum, accompany nearly a hundred visually impaired friends to visit, and walk into the community with the story of &quot;Sun God Bird&quot; ... It has become the representative project of the museum volunteer event, which makes volunteers quite proud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 导 导 导 导 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;is also born under such autonomy. In the show, the &quot;Golden Sands&quot; will use Chengdu to explain the ancient Shu civilization and Tianfu culture in the 31st World University Student Games. &quot;We hope to let more people understand Chengdu deeper through this program.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The seeds buried in 2008 &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Weina found that the soil was already thick, and volunteer activities gradually became a lifestyle for Chengdu people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the National Day holiday in 2023, a staff member of the Volunteer Services Department took his son to Ride Ringhuang Road to ride. When they arrived at Jiaozi Baiye Road in Wuhou District, they saw that volunteers were busy. The 16 -year -old son stopped, registered on the spot, and made two hours of volunteers at the station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Her parents have also spontaneously joined the community elderly volunteer association. Various volunteer services are often released in the association group. Father will participate in chorus programs to celebrate the festival for residents; the mother will participate in the river tour every week to take a walk with friends of the same unit to see if there is a problem of fishing for fishing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ten years ago, the two elderly people came to this strange city to help bring their children.通过参与社区的志愿服务活动，他们认识了周边老年人，有了自己的社交圈。 At present, the house of his hometown has been sold and chose to settle in Chengdu. She said, &quot;Because they love the city very much, they are also very active in community activities after settlement. They are really super backbones.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In Weina&#39;s view, the bones of Chengdu have a strong one in the bones of the people of Chengdu. Feelings of public welfare: &quot;In 2008, the earthquake could actually be called the first year of Chengdu volunteer service. At that time, we were where the disaster occurred, there were NGOs from the world, and many volunteers to help us.&quot; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; For the public welfare Xu Zhen, the seed of the volunteer was buried in 2008. At that time, many rescue teams and volunteers all over the world poured into Sichuan, and those aid hand left a deep impression on her. Four or five years later, when she was in college, she wanted to join the school volunteer association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Today, as the person in charge of Yungong&#39;s &quot;song is the sweetest medicine&quot; project, she has been with the volunteer to serve the &quot;antenna baby&quot; for nearly seven years. When I first saw these severe spine deformities, their heads and waist were covered with a steel ring, which was fixed by 4 support rods above the head. This physical condition gave Xu Zhen a very strong intuitive intuition. impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Usually, volunteers will take the patient to do vocal practice, breathe and beat the rhythm, and make a &quot;hiss&quot; sound on the mouth to exercise the breath. This is a part of the treatment process, which is customized by the hospital&#39;s orthopedic director. From admission to discharge, the average &quot;Babies of the antenna&quot; will grow 20 centimeters high, and we will usher in a new life. When someone in the group was reminiscent to &quot;discharged&quot;, Xu Zhen was particularly relieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; More volunteer seeds are continuously buried in the &quot;Monday Hive&quot; project carried out by Volunteer Network of Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xie Hong, the leader of the &quot;Hive Hive&quot; project team, introduced that they advocate citizens to participate in at least 1 hour of volunteer services per week. During the 4 years of the project, there were more than 170 online and offline activities, more than 80,000 participating volunteers, and more than 5 million services. During the Chengdu Grand Games, the moment the citizens were encouraged to upload civilized viewing, after the Grand Games ended, they also launched a micro -story solicitation to children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For her, &quot;every Monday&quot; is used to develop tasks, so try to reduce the threshold for participation in volunteer services and increase the number of participants and coverage. The &quot;free shot&quot; activity that is being promoted can participate in any place in the city. As long as you take a civilized behavior, you can get electronic certificates, volunteer service duration and points for five times. &quot;The ultimate goal is to stimulate our citizens&#39; identification of volunteer services, recognize the friendly atmosphere of the city, and be willing to make a force for the civilization and friendliness of the city.&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The micro -governance of &quot;By -way Going&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In this volunteer city, volunteers serve others, and they are also served. This &quot;two -way go&quot; is a micro -urban public governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the new road of Jinjiang District, a conspicuous courtyard is hung with the sign &quot;Mavericks Brother · You&quot;. Here is a 24 -hour love station, which is a rest for new employment groups such as express delivery, takeaway, and online car drivers. Gao Linya, the person in charge of the &quot;Mavericks&quot; project, said that there are 35 sites in Quanjinjiang District like this. From hydration, charging, to psychological counseling, labor safety protection, employment guidance services, vocational skills training, and a friendship clinic, etc., are all options for posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the early stage of demand survey, the &quot;Mavericks&quot; team found that the most needed for courier and takeaway is the charging service. Therefore, a company is specifically coordinated. Set up charging cabinet. &quot;&#39;Mavericks&#39; Brother&#39; was not only a good service from the beginning, but also to guide them to participate in social services and form a closed logic of a two -way service.&quot; Gao Linya said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73773&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70564&quot; src = &quot;http: //images.infzmmm .com/CMS/Medias/Image/23/11/28/0E329F974D.JPG &quot;IMG-Title =&quot; 79C93e56795144985B1569ca6447dd5.jpg &quot;alt =&quot; &quot;Mavericks Brother · Shie&quot; station. border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;729&quot; data-src = &quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/0e32974d.jpg&quot; data- key = &quot;259912&quot; &quot;stylele = &quot;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; &quot;Mavericks Brother · Sho&quot; station. Photo by reporter Gao Yichen, a southern weekend &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is also inspiring citizens to participate in the initiative of urban governance. He combined with colleges and communities, and college students independently launched refined volunteer services, communities listing needs, and corresponding majors to provide professional services. &quot;Let students see the value of their own disciplines during the development of voluntary services, and facilitate subsequent life planning.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Since then, the scope of inspiration has gradually expanded. Zhang Haibo has set up a youth volunteer service innovation laboratory to organize service projects with problems. Zhang Haibo was very impressed that left -behind children&#39;s anti -mobile phones in the summer vacation in 2023 were obsessed with &quot;craingling operations&quot;. College student volunteers also invited the players of the Chengdu AG e -sports team to play a game with children. Let&#39;s talk about it. &quot;He laughed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This micro -governance occurs in every corner of the city. Takeaway riders walk through the streets and lanes, and they are actively uploading social governance clues during the delivery. Gao Linya introduced that the governance clues are divided into eight categories such as accident emergency and public facilities damage. There are special persons in the streets responsible for reviewing and disposing of clues, feedback the problem to the department corresponding to the grassroots, and cannot be resolved to continue to be reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For some things they can, volunteers are encouraged to &quot;find themselves to solve themselves&quot; and actively participate in grass -roots governance services. It is equivalent to getting the points of the shared bicycles to make the problem, which is equivalent to obtaining two clues. For more than two years of the project operation, there are more than 500 people in the background, and more than 3,000 social governance clues collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our group of people may feel embarrassed to do (volunteer). With encouragement and promotion, there are additional rewards after finishing, and the enthusiasm will get up. In the end Come inside. &quot;The courier Tang Jian sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[社区营造师：“我们在链接中产生价值”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261509]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 10:57:51 src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/05731d75e3.png&quot; IMG- Title = &quot;Picture 1.png&quot; Alt = &quot;Yang Yingqi. border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;731&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/05731d75e3.png&quot; data- key = &quot;2599088 &quot;STYLE =&quot; &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Yang Yingqi. The interviewees confessed &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting in September 2023, Yang Yingqi and her team made a bold attempt in Chenghua District, Chengdu: 23 of the 83 communities were selected for gradual participation planning. The only criterion for screening is attitude, &quot;the community secretary must be changed from the inside.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is one of the series of the fourth series of &quot;Chengshi · Cheng Painting&quot; Chenghua District Community Planning and Design Festival. Yang Yingqi explained to the secretary of the community party committee who participated in the competition that the gradual participation plan was to continue to try and correct errors to make a community gradually move towards a better direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a community creator, this is the fifth year of &quot;post -95&quot; Yang Yingqi. Cheng Cheng, who is active in the public governance atmosphere in the community, is not a small number of &quot;professional players&quot; like her. They are responsible for formulating community action plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Yang Yingqi&#39;s view, community builders are more like the companion and deep cultivators of the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Yingqi accompanied the participating team to complete the entire process. From the training ability of the preliminary secretary, to the discussion of round tables with the backbone of the secretary, and then to the backbone call for residents to do participation and voting, and select community issues. Then perform two -way blind selection to match the volunteer designer team. &quot;All are controlled by small physical quantities, 100,000 yuan, but we have to solve a problem or contradiction in the community, or let the community have a point to glow.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; For Yang Yingqi The results of the game are not the most important. More importantly, in the process of participation, people&#39;s awareness of the community and inspiring the enthusiasm for public governance of community residents, &quot;grassroots governance should be seen most.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One of the contestants, Zhu Xiangling, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Shuanglin Community, is particularly impressed. At the discussion stage of the round table that week, there were almost 100 people who participated in almost every day. Most of them were residents, as well as community builders, planners, grid members, community and street office staff. &quot;Before we didn&#39;t know how to leverage various resources, it seemed that everyone felt that this was a cross -border thing. It was actually not. Everyone had a common goal to make this environment better.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p >; Following the possibility of solving the problem, the &quot;wall competition&quot; is at this time into the attention of the participants. Master Jiang, who was repairing the car for a long time, occupied a public space in the community. Zhu Xiangling said that like Master Jiang, the entire community is also distributed a lot. They provide personalized services and survive in public contradictions. However, residents have denied this method of banning. &quot;People have been here for two or three decades here, and the craftsmanship is good, and it provides good services. Why do people ban people?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; They started thinking, can the two be symbiotic? As a result of the &quot;shared wall and surface&quot;, it gradually became full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Yingqi appreciates the temperature and flexible treatment of the Shuanglin community. In order to solve a community contradiction, there is no new contradiction. The car repair master who works hard can still maintain a living, and can also provide services to the community residents. Sharing ladders, hammers, pliers and other tools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhu Xiangling was also impressed by Yang Yingqi&#39;s team. In the contact at the beginning of the event, Zhu Xiangling observed that the team ran through the entire Chenghua District to visit the investigation. She recalled that the little girl also brought the secretary and the &quot;special forces&quot; visited the friendly community of the people created by the team before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是杨迎琦带着团队扎根成都的重要项目，也是她“对于成都整个有信心的原因”。 Three years ago, the project landed on the Bilei community. She met the community in charge for the first time and talked to 11 o&#39;clock at night, and decided to cooperate immediately. Yang Yingqi felt that the managers of this community were tolerant and appealing, and they were also willing to continue to introduce youth forces. &quot;I think this is the most needed energy for community secretaries. I call it endogenous power.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She likes Beilei communities. She is a shop when she is on the street. The residents are living on the street. The shop provides the service of the entire community. The price is cheap, the life is comfortable, there is no large viaduct, and there are no wide highways. It is more suitable The dominance scale of urban residents.她愿意回到这样的地方，将新活力注入到老城区中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the Beilei community, in response to the contradiction between people and dogs who are more concentrated, Yang Yingqi team helped formulate a friendly convention and complete the construction of the community&#39;s pet community. The spontaneous operation of the community has no longer needed coordination and guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Two months ago, she was building a basketball court for a village, and her funds were insufficient. A wonderful thing happened: friends in the friendly community of people learned about this and took their children to raise funds on the street. The merchants in the community also deliberately contributed their own products as a gift for fundraising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She sighed: &quot;If in the grass -roots governance, when we make people and people have value recognition, when condensed into some strength, they can help people in other places. This good will continue to expand And glowing. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Time clockwise allocated for another five years. The new Chengdu native of Chengdu who moved with his family since his childhood, with the sense of weakness of the public welfare industry, chose this profession. She wants to find a link between people in the urban community. In her understanding, the &quot;community&quot; is not an administrative division or a community concept. It means the community. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So in the early days of each project, Yang Yingqi was looking for such links, looking for the community of this place, and exploring the real needs of the community. In the south, there were projects for villagers&#39; courtyard renovation with 700,000 yuan. Before the Yang team took over, five sets of courtyards had been transformed. The designer entered the venue directly, did not negotiate and respect, and the effect was counterproductive. The owner was very dissatisfied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After Yang Yingqi took over, she told the villagers that she could not obtain the decoration fund for free and need to pay 2,000 yuan, which is the fee paid to the young designer.她要求每一位户主参与到整个建设过程中，设计师与户主同吃同住15天。她还要求各家降低庭院围墙高度，尽量透明化。 &quot;The entire village does not have high walls, and it is not the appearance of small households. It will form the concept of a large family in the entire community.&quot; This common creation model was promulgated by the Asia -Pacific Office of the United Nations Agency in 2021. &quot;2021 Asian Metropolis Landscape Award&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This creation concept has been running through. In this gradual participation planning action in Chenghua District, the core theme is community motivation, which is inseparable from &quot;community cultivation&quot; and &quot;community growth power&quot;. Yang Yingqi&#39;s &quot;community cultivation&quot; is to combine &quot;from bottom to bottom&quot; with &quot;top -down&quot;. When the community ability is still insufficient, it is appropriately incorporated into external forces. A degree of intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Out of interest, Zhu Xiangling also participated in the training course of the community creator. In her understanding, the key step of &quot;building&quot; is to dig out the owner&#39;s consciousness of the community residents: &quot;I think community construction should be the participation of diversified subjects, reaching a consensus on a public problem, and more resources to solve the corresponding problems. After the solution, it is also necessary to empower it. In the end, the two -way change of people and the environment. It is not only a change in hardware, but also changes in everyone. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
