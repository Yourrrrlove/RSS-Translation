Of course it is a famous dish and no one is stupid enough to think of a fishy and dirty lion&#39;s head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Cubans really think you are going to take a bite of a lion&#39;s head - when Tao Yan first introduced this dish to the &quot;Guard Captain&quot; in Spanish, the latter&#39;s severe facial twitching showed that he was So understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best Chinese restaurant in Havana is called &quot;Tiantan Hotel&quot;. The owner, Tao Yan, is my friend. He graduated from Shanghai Second Medical University and came to Havana very early. There are not many overseas Chinese in Havana. He has been The idea was to Cubanize his Chinese food. Cubans are very sweet and aromatic, so their Chinese dishes try to be as &quot;sweet and fragrant&quot; as possible, such as pig&#39;s trotters braised with sea cucumber, catfish stewed with tofu, and sweet and sour braised lamb chops, all with a large amount of Cuban sugar. Cubans can’t even figure out why Chinese food ingredients are so well matched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yangzhou lion head is the signature of the &quot;Temple of Heaven&quot;. After the captain of the guard knew that this &quot;lion head&quot; was actually a &quot;pig head&quot;, he came here often relying on his relationship with Tao Yantie. He was a tall man with a height of 1.9 meters. He was impatient with small dishes and specialized in picking big dishes. It’s a piece of meat, so I’m full of praise for the lion’s head in the “Temple of Heaven”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting next to the captain of the guard that day. We also ordered the lion&#39;s head and thought it was &quot;too un-Yangzhou&quot;. It was like &quot;noodles&quot;. The ratio of starch to minced meat was wrong. The meat was too little. The ingredients were not in place. The taste was &quot;wooden&quot;. My wife felt itchy and said, I Come and give it a try! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her cooking method was passed down directly from her neighbor, a woman from Yangzhou. The first thing is the choice of pork. You cannot overemphasize the &quot;essence&quot;, it should be &quot;mixed with essence and oil (fat)&quot;, but it cannot be pork belly, it must be sandwiched. meat, and remove the fascia; minced pork cannot be the product of a meat grinder. It must be cut into small pieces first, then finely diced, and then minced into minced meat, but not too fine, as it will &quot;stick to the knife&quot;. This takes effort. Then add salt (or soy sauce), sugar, monosodium glutamate, minced green onions, diced fried dough sticks, rice wine, and appropriate amount of starch, and stir in one direction, usually clockwise, also called &quot;shangjin&quot;, until it is thick and sticky, waiting for frying. There is another trick here that is ignored by the outside world, that is, &quot;fine diced water chestnuts&quot; must be included in the ingredients. Water chestnuts are called &quot;di pear&quot; in Shanghai and &quot;horse hoof&quot; in the north. You can only buy canned water chestnuts in Cuba. . As for fried dough sticks, they are not available in Cuba, but local fried dough sticks can be substituted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan looked on, his eyes widened and he was dumbfounded, and said, my lion head is just a mixture of minced meat, MSG, flour, onion, ginger, and soy sauce, and then deep-fried, you have to add so much Ingredients? ! My wife said that it is best not to add ginger, but out of habit I would add less ginger, as the flavor would be too strong. The last key is that the outside of each meat ball is not smeared with egg paste until before frying. The egg paste is made as follows: Beat eggs to one ratio of flour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be fried hard, braised in brown sauce and reduced in juice. The lion&#39;s head is delicious when it&#39;s hard on the outside and tender on the inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cubans are straightforward and came to taste the lion’s head the next day. As soon as he tasted it, he stood up and made a phone call. Not long after, a large group of relatives came. There were more than ten of them. They sat neatly like thugs all over the yard. They all looked at the dining table and sat in rows. , eat fruit. This is a Cuban custom. Once there is delicious food, the whole family comes to share it. However, Tao Yan was frightened and explained to the guard captain in Spanish that today was just a trial production and it was impossible to supply a large group of people at once. The guard captain blinked his eyes honestly and refused to leave. My family is here and I want them to go back. Where can I put my face? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was frightened. Please call my wife urgently. &quot;So many big eaters?!&quot; The wife couldn&#39;t help but groan. The lion&#39;s head was slightly smaller than a tennis ball. The captain of the guard could swallow 10 of them by himself. But what! How many &quot;noodles&quot; are there from the past? she asked. The answer is that there are many in the refrigerator. The wife asked to take them all out, defrost them, took a large bottle of mayonnaise, dipped the &quot;gnocchi&quot; in the heavy flavor, turned on the oil pan, and fried it over high heat. The aroma was overflowing, and served it hot to the relatives of the guard captain. Have to howl. The inside of the &quot;gnocchi&quot; is not that good, but the egg skin shell is especially crispy and salty when fried. This is a particularly pleasing thing for my wife. But the guard captain is not stupid. He knew that his wife&#39;s lion&#39;s head was better, and she knew the taste after eating the marrow, so within a few days he actually brought &quot;Whitebeard&quot;, a high-ranking official from Cuba. Of course, I didn’t forget to notify you in advance this time. &quot;Whitebeard&quot; is a close comrade of Castro. He drives a black Audi. As soon as he comes in, he says that he has brought a &quot;mysterious guest&quot; without permission. He heard that the &quot;Chinese Lion Head&quot; is particularly delicious and wants it. Have a taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was dumbfounded when he saw it. She was an old lady with a noble status! He also had a young grandson with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He turned sideways and leaned back as a habit. There was a large group of people in the yard, sitting in rows, eating fruits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is our custom.&quot; The guard captain explained again. He also said that the people who paid this time were all relatives of &quot;White Beard&quot;. When Cubans go to dinner parties, they like to bring their entire family. This time I really learned the lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the behavior of &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady is quite elegant. They gently bite open the lion&#39;s head, the inside is pink, and there is a slight gravy in the steaming heat, but the elegance does not diminish their elegance. Appetite, thumbs up while swallowing, the delicacies in the big basin are rapidly decreasing, and the guard captain&#39;s companionship has accelerated their disappearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was impossible to estimate the number of people who would &quot;sit in rows and eat fruit&quot;, there was a shortage of seats for the lion head, so my wife hurriedly took advantage of the opportunity to make it. Of course, it was too luxurious to chop the meat by hand, so I directly used a meat grinder, but The problem is, a catastrophic accident occurs unexpectedly. China runs out of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chives are a scarce commodity in Havana. The Chinese usually save on using them. Now that they are suddenly out of stock, where should they go to replenish them? Tao Yan suddenly caught a glimpse of the onions in the corner of the room. Isn’t an onion an onion? Although the taste difference is huge, it&#39;s hard to tell. &quot;The question is, what if Cubans happen to be good at this?!&quot; The wife asked Tao Yan coldly. The two looked at each other and understood. The latter immediately jumped into action and pulled out a large bag of onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can imagine, the whole room was filled with the smell of onions fried in a big oil pan, and &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady couldn&#39;t sit still. People in the courtyard couldn&#39;t sit still. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;White Beard&quot; said, why is it getting more and more fragrant? For the sake of the continuation of this fragrance, I am even willing to launch another cooking &quot;revolution&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people in the compound left their original positions like the mud of a barrier lake, and squeezed into the dining room bit by bit like toothpaste. They shouted in Spanish and pushed each other. No one dared. Head straight to the table. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final outcome is predictable. A famous dish was born in Havana. It is no longer called Yangzhou lion head, but has a more Cuban name: onion lion head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黑龙江省人大常委会原副主任宋希斌一审获刑14年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258838]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/8d32eea8c44f27b9b172302b6fc2430a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/18/8d32eea8c44f27b9b172302b6fc2430a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 17, 2023, the Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court of Liaoning Province publicly pronounced the verdict of the Heilongjiang Provincial People’s Congress Standing Committee in the first instance In the case of former party member and deputy director Song Xibin accepting bribes and embezzling public funds, the defendant Song Xibin was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting bribes and fined RMB 3 million; he was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzling public funds and decided to execute the term He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and fined RMB 3 million; the property obtained from bribery and the interest therefrom shall be recovered in accordance with the law and turned over to the state treasury. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;It was found after trial: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;From 2005 to 2021, the defendant Song Xibin successively used his position as the Daxinganling Prefectural Committee of Heilongjiang Province Deputy Secretary, Administrative Commissioner, Director of the Forestry Administration, Secretary of the Daxinganling Prefectural Committee, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission, Deputy Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee and Mayor, Member and Deputy Director of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial People&#39;s Congress, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, etc. With the convenience in the field, as well as the convenient conditions for the formation of authority and status, it provided assistance to relevant units and individuals in matters such as business operations, land replacement, project contracting, job promotion, etc., and illegally accepted property from others equivalent to more than 35.32 million yuan. In 2014, Song Xibin took advantage of his position as deputy secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee and mayor to seek personal interests and decided to lend 50 million yuan of Harbin&#39;s special fiscal funds to other units in the name of his unit for profit-making activities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court held that defendant Song Xibin’s behavior constituted the crime of accepting bribes and misappropriating public funds. In view of the fact that Song Xibin truthfully confessed his crimes after arriving at the case, and took the initiative to explain most of the criminal facts of bribery and misappropriation of public funds that were not yet known to the supervisory authorities. The crime of misappropriation of public funds constituted surrender; he pleaded guilty and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the bribes and stolen goods have been recovered, and the misappropriated goods have been recovered. All public funds have been recovered before the first instance trial, and there are legal, discretionary or mitigated punishment circumstances. According to the law, he can be given a lighter punishment for the crime of accepting bribes and a reduced punishment for the crime of misappropriating public funds. The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电梯事故频频发生，一图读懂如何自救？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258923]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;8581&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254649&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（上）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258853]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1TImi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1 TImi. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254579&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Between 1872 and 1875, initiated by Rong Hong and supported by Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang , the Qing government sent four batches of 120 students to study in the United States. The average age of these students when they went abroad was only twelve years old. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wedge&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The exchanges between China and the United States, if we start with the opium epidemic in 1840 It has been almost two hundred years since the war began. The young republic of the United States is making its first cry. In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, after receiving the mission of writing this article from Mr. Chen Fangzheng, I thought about it for a long time - I felt that I should write: Because this big topic is not only related to China and the United States, It can almost be said that the fate of the world in the past two hundred years has been inseparable from Sino-US relations in many cases. The turn in Sino-US relations often leads to a turn in world history - of course, China&#39;s destiny also changes accordingly, and similarly the destiny of the United States is also turbulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason I say this is because the basic pattern of Sino-US relations over the past two hundred years is: there is a host-object relationship between the strong and the weak. Because the United States has its own ideals, policies for founding the country, and choices it made to measure its position in the world at that time, if there are changes in its policy toward China, it will mostly be the United States that takes the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when discussing this issue, I often use the above perspective as a constantly changing clue to consider: Why did the United States do this in that specific time and space? In terms of Sino-U.S. relations, given the characteristics of time and space, how will the United States&#39; actions affect its own development direction and the overall international balance? Will the ensuing world situation lead to disaster or peace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I dictated this article &quot;China and the United States since 1840&quot;, I actually had mixed feelings in my heart. The relationship between China and the United States has its share of grievances and grievances, as well as unavoidable entanglements. Looking around the world, the help we receive from the United States is more significant and far-reaching than that of other countries. However, China is even more constrained by the United States and forced to go in many unexpected directions - this is not what China wants, and it also has a great impact on China&#39;s overall history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Trade between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1840, Britain and China fought the first Opium War. In fact, the opium traders operating in Hong Kong at that time were not only British, but also Americans. The United States, a recently established emerging country, has also followed the United Kingdom in participating in international trade—China trade is a piece of meat that it must get involved in. At that time, he was following Charles Elliot in planning how to use force to open China&#39;s trade door, and American businessman Thomas Perkins was also involved. To this day, the Perkins family is still an important part of the New England family in the United States. They did the same, bringing opium in ships and taking away Chinese porcelain, tea and other commercial goods. However, this kind of trade is not permitted by Chinese law, which means that Britain is already conducting trade while forcibly opening the door to China. Although it was Britain that launched the First Opium War, its sponsors also included American businessmen in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China was defeated in this war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing with Britain. In 1844, the United States sent envoy Caleb Cushing to sign the Treaty of Wangxia with Qi Ying, the general representative of China and the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi. Since then, China and the United States established diplomatic relations, and Gu Sheng was the first minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as minister, Gu Sheng said that he was very excited and felt that this was a difficult responsibility. This youngest country, which had just emerged from the civil war and was involved in world politics and international relations for the first time, actually officially established relations with the longest-lived Eastern Empire in the world. He believed this was an important milestone in human history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, and I would like to tell you something that is very meaningful to me. On February 2, 1784, the birthday of George Washington, the &quot;Empress of China&quot; sailed from New York Harbor to China. It was the first merchant ship sent by the United States to China. What they brought was not opium, but thirty tons of wild ginseng collected near Pittsburgh (known as &quot;American ginseng&quot; or &quot;American ginseng&quot; in China), as well as leather, pepper, cotton and other commodities; taken from China, It is porcelain, tea, silk and other commercial goods - these are the typical products sold by China to the United States in Sino-US trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On several occasions, as a staff member of Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Academia Sinica&quot;, I visited Harvard University to negotiate cooperation matters, and I stayed in Harvard hotels. This hotel is an old-fashioned New England residence, with a wooden house, ancient wooden beds, and the rooms are filled with Chinese porcelain shipped by American merchants in the early days. In addition to China&#39;s own porcelain, we can also see trade porcelain specially fired for the United States and Britain, and we can also see Chinese silk fabrics used as decoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a scene made me feel that time and space were reversed: a young Chinese man went to the highest university in the United States to discuss academic cooperation - and in the room where I lived, all the people surrounding me were ancient Chinese objects. . This is something worthy of commemoration and worthy of my lifelong memories and emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, American merchant ships have entered China one after another. Although there were already motorized ships at that time, many of them had a combination of motors and sails. The &quot;Queen of China&quot; is a rather large mixed-aircraft and sail ship, and the &quot;Chinese Scissor&quot; is even larger and faster. By around 1860, there were three ports for trading ships to depart from North America: San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Vancouver, Canada. They come and go regularly, traveling across the Pacific Ocean between the two coasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of the nineteenth century, the United States experienced the Civil War. The overall development direction has changed from developing new land to entering industrialization. Moreover, the most important projects in the development of the United States are the construction of large cross-state railways to the west, as well as the development of farmland and the construction of cities in the western half of the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers provided important help in these tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the reason why the United States became the United States was that it transformed from an old British colony into a major country spanning two oceans. This process is of great significance to East Asia on the Pacific side; Sino-US relations have also gone through a very abnormal process. For example, Chinese workers who have made significant contributions are trapped by the Chinese Exclusion Act and cannot immigrate into the United States like European workers. As the United States has become a big country that spans two oceans, its industrial products can naturally enter the Chinese market more conveniently than Europe. Previously, the trade direction of Chinese daily necessities imported into the United States has since shifted to the direction of American products entering the Chinese market. Europeans competed for the trade markets of this vast and populous empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, these ships have brought countless Chinese young people to the United States for education. The first group of more than 100 Chinese children brought by Rong Hong entered American middle schools and then furthered their studies. After these &quot;young children studying in the United States&quot; returned to China after completing their studies, they worked in various fields such as diplomacy, business, and education. The beginning of this phase of Sino-US relations is of immeasurable significance to the Chinese people. The American influence brought by these people extended to the students who came to the United States under the so-called &quot;Gengzi Indemnity&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Gengzi Indemnity&lt;/span>;) - this Among them, a very important figure is Hu Shi; of course, there are many other figures, including my mentor Li Jizhi. More than half of them have made significant contributions to China&#39;s modernization, are either scholars in pioneering research fields, or are extraordinary people who have created extraordinary careers. They also include the Nationalist Government&#39;s ambassador to the United States and figures in charge of foreign affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Education in the United States and Modern China&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the twentieth century, the world also changed a lot. The capitalist economy, which uses machine industry to produce goods, has swallowed up the entire world quickly and massively. Under this drastic change, white people not only became the masters of the world, but also competed among themselves for the &quot;leading&quot; position of exploiting the world. In Europe, there was World War I. In that war, the capitalist economy faced its first test: the germination and growth of international communism brought the world into the division of left and right; also in the modern Western state system, the communist system and its associated The ideal of symbiotic social good and social welfare. The United States only entered the war in the late stages of the European War. General John J. Pershing led the American war troops and declared to Britain and France: We are back and we are participating in the common affairs of the Old Continent. In Chinese history, the word &quot;West&quot; has since been divided into left and right sides; and this division has made China have to make choices in its struggle to break away from the old empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of importing Western ideas, American missionaries established schools in China, which was an important process. At the same time, the ideas brought to China by American intellectuals, including travelers, journalists, businessmen, and educators, therefore have at least two routes as their own choices, and the Chinese must choose. Similarly, the impressions they brought back from China have since then had two faces and images, left and right, resulting from their subjective choices and subjective descriptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest schools set up by Americans in China were affiliated middle schools run by missionaries to China in churches. It is difficult for us to say which middle school was opened earliest. Peking Union Medical College is the first modern medical school in China, as well as Xiangya Medical College in Hunan, West China Union University in Sichuan, and Qilu University in Shandong, all of which were founded by missionaries from the United States. Union Medical College adopts a method of integrating modern medical education with general hospitals and has become a model in China. Their influence extends to more remote provinces, such as Mingxian College in Shanxi, which was also established by American missionaries. During the Republic of China, in addition to the above-mentioned medical teaching, famous universities such as Yanjing University, Soochow University, Jinling University, and Zhijiang University were all founded by American missionaries and contributed to the development of education in modern China. In the field of history, Yenching University&#39;s Journal of Yenching, Academia Sinica&#39;s Journal of the Institute of History and Linguistics, and Tsinghua University&#39;s Journal of Tsinghua are collectively known as the &quot;Three University Journals.&quot; To this day, Tsinghua University on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is still a very important university, especially Tsinghua University in Beijing, which is the &quot;leading&quot; university in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Jen Middle School, where I study, was built by Chinese Christians in Shanghai who returned to their hometown of Wuxi. They believe that although they are not missionaries, they still set up schools with the service spirit of devout believers and in accordance with the educational level and teaching methods of British and American middle schools. Although these teachers from Furen Middle School only trained me for two and a half years (from the first semester of high school to the first semester of high school), they had a great influence on my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From university education to secondary education, the United States has a profound influence on China. Medicine and education were areas where missionaries focused their attention. In 1937, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China was established. These people with ties to China were basically missionaries to China. They returned to the United States and advocated helping China during the Anti-Japanese War and donating Chinese medicine, equipment and doctors. When China was under blockade and faced extreme difficulties, plane after plane of U.S. aid supplies entered China via the &quot;hump route.&quot; This includes the newly invented penicillin, the first batch of which was shipped to China after it officially left the factory, which was of great help to China&#39;s wounded soldiers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, we should be grateful to them. Many missionaries stayed in China and stayed here until their old age; many missionaries considered China their hometown, and they said &quot;my hometown is in China&quot;; many missionaries protected Chinese children, Chinese wounded soldiers, and Chinese refugees during the Anti-Japanese War. By. In the case of the Nanjing Massacre, Jinling Women&#39;s University was designated as a &quot;protected area&quot;, and thousands of Chinese women fled there to receive rescue and avoid being ravaged by the Japanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such things make us deeply moved. However, we also have entanglements. In U.S. trade with China, the U.S. is almost always outperforming and China is outperforming. And it is very regrettable that the United States also played a shameful role in the early opium trade: in terms of the amount of opium transported to China, the United States was not necessarily less than the United Kingdom—the United Kingdom and the United States were the largest opium traders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In January 1945, the first Chinese transport convoy drove through the Burma Highway. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The complex grievances between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The greater grievances between China and the United States Grudges appear in the middle of war. The first time the United States intervened in China&#39;s war was during the Taiping Rebellion. At that time, there were many foreigners in the Shanghai Concession, and there were also many Chinese people who fled there. In 1860, American Frederick T. Ward led the formation of a &quot;foreign gun team&quot;. This group of mercenaries was small in number and very elite. Initially to defend the Shanghai concession, he later left the concession to help Li Hongzhang&#39;s Huai army and the Hunan army Zeng Guoquan&#39;s troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late Qing Dynasty, the revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen used the United States as a model in its early stages - although he did not seriously understand the various internal debates and struggles after the founding of the United States of America, nor did he study the impact of the American Civil War on American politics. Institutional influence. Later, the &quot;civil rights&quot; of the &quot;Three People&#39;s Principles&quot; were only explained in general terms. But after Sun Yat-sen established his government in Guangzhou, he had a most important struggle. He got rid of the influence of the Japanese ronin &quot;Xuanyang Society&quot;, but he also gained support from the new international communism in Europe and accepted some of their ideas. More importantly, the first revolutionary army organized by Sun Yat-sen to build New China received 8,000 rifles from the Communist International in Russia in the name of Whampoa Military Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sun Yat-sen&#39;s conception, the prototype of people&#39;s livelihood doctrine is &quot;land to the tiller.&quot; This is also a dream shared by the peasant revolutionary armies in Chinese history, including the aforementioned &quot;Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&quot; rebels. After the establishment of the government in Guangzhou, cooperation with the Communist International led to the emergence of opposition between the left and the right within the Kuomintang, which also fundamentally changed the connotation of his &quot;people&#39;s livelihood doctrine&quot;: &quot;People&#39;s livelihood doctrine is socialism.&quot; Sun Yat-sen&#39;s ideal Changes also caused the blueprint for the founding of the Republic of China to not only cause ideological opposition between the left and right in the future struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but also lead to opposition between important party members. After his death, the so-called &quot;Ning-Han split&quot; originated from this. The right wing led by Chiang Kai-shek has since lost the support of the Kuomintang left wing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time the United States intervened in China&#39;s war was during the Anti-Japanese War. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, China lost 800 aircraft within a month and nearly 3,000 aircraft during the entire Anti-Japanese War. Japan had the best aircraft in the world at that time, but China did not have the ability to manufacture them. It could only buy various types of aircraft from foreign countries and form them into an air force combat force. Therefore, China&#39;s airspace was abused by the Japanese at will. When the Chinese army is fighting, the bombs falling from the sky are more helpless than the bullets on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Claire L. Chennault, an American aerial aerobatic team member, organized American aerial athletes who were not afraid of death and established a Chinese Air Force American Volunteer Group (American Volunteer Group) in a private name. &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;. Their team members are dedicated aerobatic pilots who can climb out of the cabin and walk on the wings of a flying aircraft. They can take off in farm fields, land on barn roofs, do somersaults in the air without falling, and even swing in mid-air from a rope dangled from an airplane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, they used aircraft that had been retired by the U.S. Air Force. After the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; incident, the United States entered the war and reorganized this civilian force into the Fourteenth Air Force, with Chennault as commander. Since the establishment of this aviation force, I remember that starting in 1942, we could finally sleep peacefully in Chongqing. Our troops were fighting the Japanese and were covered by aircraft in the sky. China lost thousands of pilots during the War of Resistance. Slowly, our pilots can also fly the same aircraft as those in the United States and fight side by side with the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although these athletes from the United States are not in vain: they are rewarded with five taels of gold for each mission, and ten taels of gold for shooting down a Japanese plane. Everyone returned with dozens of pounds of gold. You know, the value of gold at that time was different from today; but among these young people, there were also a large number of them who left their lives in China. It is now estimated that they lost about 400 men from 1942 to 1945. As for whether they died for wealth or for righteousness, we can ignore it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we particularly want to mention is the commercial exchanges between China and the United States. There are banks from many countries in the concessions of Shanghai and other treaty ports, the largest of which are the &quot;bank group&quot; of the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the British HSBC and the American Citibank. HSBC is still one of the largest banks in the world, and Citibank of the United States is the most involved in China&#39;s financial operations. The reason is that China’s first finance ministers who understood modern finance were Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen—Song Ziwen studied at Columbia University, and Kong Xiangxi graduated from Yale University. They brought the most important banking facilities in the United States to China. Therefore, China&#39;s first central bank was designed and operated according to the Bank of America, and regarded Citibank as a friend bank. When it overdrafted, it had Citibank as its backing. Without this backing, Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s central bank would have no credibility; and the central bank was one of the most important factors in Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s rule over China - not just with his army, but with a modern financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the first international exchange in the East. Together with the Wall Street, London and Tokyo Stock Exchanges, it has become the four important world financial trading points. This operation involves China&#39;s modern finance and modern economic operations into the world economic network. Few people pay attention to this. During this period, the United States squeezed China&#39;s finances more and less often helped China&#39;s finances. But in terms of importing this system into China, it can be said that no other country in the world can import its entire financial system into other countries, and have its most important bank as its backing. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek established China&#39;s modern government, modern industry, national industry, national defense, etc. so quickly, all of which were inseparable from the financial support behind the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, because the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded Beijing and defeated the Qing army, they obtained 450 million taels of silver compensation from China - China had a population of 450 million at that time, which was equivalent to one tael of silver per person as compensation. . This reparation was known as the &quot;Gengzi Indemnity&quot; in history. Russia and Germany accounted for the largest proportion, followed by France, Britain, Japan, the United States, Italy and other countries. Japan used this compensation and the previous Sino-Japanese War compensation for domestic business and construction, which became the largest capital for later occupying the three northeastern provinces and even launching a full-scale war of aggression against China. The United States returned part of this compensation to China as a special fund for the latter&#39;s education development; subsequently, Britain, France and other countries returned part of the compensation. Tsinghua University was established with its support. When each new national university was established, funds were allocated from the &quot;Geng Geng Fund&quot; to support its construction - this was the case for the Central University, which was restructured from Liangjiang Normal School, and for national and provincial universities in various places. Until the end, when Tsinghua University in Taiwan resumed school, it still used a very small balance of the &quot;Genggen money&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 1909, when the United States returned part of the &quot;Boxer Grant&quot; to support China&#39;s education, to 1964, when Tsinghua University in Taiwan resumed school, the &quot;Boxer Grant&quot; continued to have an impact on Chinese education for such a long time. But to put it another way, the &quot;Gengg money&quot; is a huge debt that China has borne. This group of foreign banking syndicates lent money to China - China did not have huge funds to pay the compensation, so it could only borrow money from the World Bank syndicate to pay. When the refund comes, the original loan will still be in the World Bank Group. We can only withdraw interest and deduct what he needs for himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last &quot;geng money&quot; payment was handled by my late father, Boxiang Gong, when he was transferred to the Ministry of Finance as a customs supervisor. After the unequal treaty was terminated in 1942, he was responsible for sorting out the remaining balance of the &quot;Gengg money&quot; and the method of compensation. During the difficult and difficult period of the War of Resistance, the Westerners did not forgive us this debt. My late father was about fifty years old at the time. Every time he came back at night, he would look at the accounts and feel very sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 7, 1941, Christmas Eve, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war. Finally, because of its status as an allied member, China canceled all unequal treaties. This is tantamount to lifting the burden that China has carried for decades. Since then, the relationship between the United States and China has entered a new stage. The original civilian identity of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; became the Fourteenth Air Force of the United States. The Chinese Expeditionary Force also went abroad from Tengchong to rescue the British army in Burma. This army was incorporated into the command sequence of the Allied Powers, the Chinese, British and American Allied Forces. The United States also sent a representative, General Joseph Stilwell, as the chief of staff of the Chinese theater. Stilwell wanted to be the commander-in-chief of the Chinese theater and command the entire Chinese army, but Chiang Kai-shek disagreed. Since then, the U.S. military has intervened in China&#39;s military, and there have been endless grievances and resentments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last two years of the Anti-Japanese War, American aircraft flew over the &quot;Hump Route&quot; to transport supplies to China and also provided aircraft for the Chinese Air Force via this route. On land, the Stilwell Highway, the road from India to China via Myanmar, was also opened, and truckloads of supplies entered China, all under the command of Stilwell. China needs his permission to call in these troops. When the Chinese army is fighting on the front line and every second counts, it often misses the opportunity because it needs to see the battle plan. On a battlefield thousands of miles away, the battle situation is changing rapidly. How to provide a battle plan? This makes the last stage of China&#39;s battle still very difficult because there are people on the side who are restricting it. Of course, in the last battle in Changde, if American military planes had not transported reinforcements from afar to Changde, we would not have been able to stop the Japanese from marching in. This was a very significant help provided by the United States to China during the Anti-Japanese War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese part of the Stilwell Highway was dug by hand in the mountains of Yunnan by villagers from various ethnic groups.两千多部卡车，从缅甸进入中国——其实美国赠送给中国的车大概有四千辆，有一半在史迪威公路上翻车了。这些车都是由马来西亚、菲律宾、新加坡等地的华侨青年，到缅甸投军、作为志愿者开进来的——他们没学过驾驶这种车，两千多人永远留在了山沟里。他们本想回祖国帮助抗战，却连祖国的土地都未曾踏足。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在抗战初期，为了争取美国的援助，国民政府驻美大使胡适在全美各地作了五六十次讲演。蒋介石夫人宋美龄女士也特地在美国国会发表讲演，使美国人对中国的印象，摆脱了中国劳工在美的形象。同时，美国的记者以及作家，尤其赛珍珠（Pearl S.Buck）和《时代》《生活》杂志的发行人路斯（Henry Luce，汉名路思义），不断向美国公众介绍中国在苦难之中的挣扎。另一方面，中国北方在日本的战线向西推进时，八路军派往敌后的干部掌握了农村。在那些地区的美国传教士以及访华人员，后来又包括美国大使馆、领事馆的职员谢伟思（John S.Service）等人，将北方的消息传送到美国。其中，斯诺（Edgar Snow）的新闻报道，具有无可估量的影响力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种舆论的分歧，再加上史迪威和蒋介石之间的对抗，使得中美之间在第二次世界大战最后一段的关系与配合，发生重要的冲突。二战以后，美国紧接着出现了“麦卡锡主义”，造成美国内部左右之间的严重分裂。那一裂痕，又导致了所谓“谁丢失了中国”的辩论。更进一步，美国以同样的心态，回头看二战后的欧洲。苏联的崛起与中国的国共内战，导致二战后近二十年，美国对自己领导的世界及与此相关的外交政策，都趋向对共产主义国家的抵制和围堵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抗战结束后，国共内战开始，美国莫名其妙地纠缠其中。美国派遣外交官谢伟思等人组成的“迪克西使团”(Dixie Mission)参观延安，他们回来说：延安是未来的希望，重庆是黑暗的地方；重庆是要没落的，延安要起来；帮延安，不要帮重庆。这其间的恩恩怨怨，我们很难说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（深圳行政学院副教授陈新华整理）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;22岁的程海燕是家中长女，她还有一个患白血病的弟弟。她刚通过专升本考试，在海口读大一。自从母亲投水自尽后，哀伤的父亲陷入消沉，加之弟弟病弱，作为家里唯一上过大学的人，她需要短时间内撑起这个摇摇欲坠的家。她觉得自己身上的担子太重，更多时候是硬扛。 “很累，但是没办法。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对文昌那个简陋到不行的家，程海燕是有心远离的，不仅因为出租屋物质条件差，更因为她早早地认清了家族和家庭里重男轻女的旧思维。所以除了在校学习，她会利用课余和假期在海口打工，“服务员、洗碗工、洗菜的、前台收银、宴席服务员、发传单、赛事保障、做防疫的民兵，能做的都做”。 2023年6月10日开始，到7月23日义永红自杀那天，程海燕都在海口一家超市当收银员，一个月赚2600元，不包吃住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕帮家里干活时，也是一把好手。她给番石榴套袋加包装，一天起码能完成2000个，换算成给别人家打工，相当于挣了200元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但命运却给程海燕开了一个残酷的玩笑。她想离家里远一点，但不得不成为没了妈妈的家庭主心骨，成为弟弟可以依靠的姐姐，成为给出决断、拿主意的女儿，还要以晚辈身份应酬亲戚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我能清晰地感受到，尽管她知道母亲任劳任怨，抚育她长大，可程海燕并不想成为义永红那样的女性。也许，程海燕不一定清楚她想要成为什么样的人，但她确实在努力不要重蹈母亲的人生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;义永红也支持女儿这样做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在义永红自杀前几天，程海燕返回文昌陪伴母亲。当她在水房洗澡时，村里一个“男疯子”把头从门槛下伸进去偷窥，嘴里嘟囔着“好漂亮”。程海燕惊恐之下用衣服打他，然后报警，可对方拿出了精神分裂症的证明，程海燕愤怒又无奈。警察让她不要放在心里，可程海燕无法做到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;女儿被偷窥后，义永红催她赶紧回海口。程海燕至今感到遗憾的是，那次回去没有如愿将母亲带回海口，离开那个环境。如果离开了，或许她就不会自杀了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;整个采访过程中，程海燕讲述了两个对她来说极为残忍的场景。其一就是义永红在水库自杀后的情景。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7月23日那天，程海燕赶到家时，发现门锁着，母亲不在家，看到床上放着母亲的手机和钱包，程海燕顿时慌了，因为母亲从来不会不随身携带钱包。她与父亲程善志分头找，边找边给大姨、大舅打电话，最后她循着父亲的哭声赶过去，“看到我爸爸一直在哭，衣服都是湿透的。我爸已经在那里哭得不行了。我妈妈人都硬了，像睡着一样，嘴巴张开的”。当时的程海燕“感觉很晒，头很晕，眩晕，看不到东西”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;整个采访中，我认为最沉痛的是程海燕用平静的语调，回忆第二个冰冷场景——为了发现新的证据，也怕妈妈冷冻太久，希望早点入土为安，她和弟弟决定给妈妈尸检。程海燕扶着痛哭的父亲站在一旁，目睹法医解剖、殡仪馆人员缝合母亲的全程，她要看母亲身上有没有伤痕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕提到一个细节，解剖前，一只蟑螂从义永红的裤脚那儿爬出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;程海燕哭着抠自己的手指甲，她说她不知道该怎么办，很害怕，因为解剖的是自己的家人。她学的是护理专业，所以能大致描述法医的工作流程，包括解剖刀在义永红遗体上行进的路线，以及解剖刀之下她妈妈的一点点“变形”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“人走了，还挨一刀，感觉很对不起她。”同时，程海燕也异常愤怒，“我感觉恨到骨子里了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报道刊发前，程海燕愿意实名。我相信，经历并处理过如此重大的人生跌宕，程海燕一定会比她自认为的更坚强。她能和七八个退伍军人朋友一道去到派出所，被偷窥后决意报警，她勇敢地追问警方，正面硬刚加害者，尤其是目睹母亲的解剖画面，程海燕一定不再是从前那个小女孩了，她将成为另一个不同的人。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;对比前一年的数据：截至2021年底，全国60周岁及以上老年人口26736万人，占总人口的18.9%，其中65周岁及以上老年人口20056万人，占总人口的14.2%。一年之内，60周岁及以上和65周岁及以上的老年人，分别增加了0.9与0.7个百分点，前者净增加1268万人，后者净增加922万人。中国社会的老龄化程度进一步加重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国老龄化加剧的原因有二，一是预期寿命的增长；二是新生儿出生人数的减少。 2016年是全面二孩政策落地的第一年，新生儿1786万，有可能是最后一个阶段性历史高点。次年即降至1723万，以后每年都向下突破一两个百万大关，至2022年降至956万，与2016年相比下降了46.5%，短短六年几乎腰斩。由此，老年人怎么样养老的问题就越发突出了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2005年，上海率先提出了“9073”养老服务格局的目标，即老年人90%居家养老，7%社区养老，3%的机构养老。 2021年4月，国家卫健委老龄健康司司长王海东表示，我国老年人大多数都在居家和社区养老，形成“9073”的格局，即90%左右的老年人都在居家养老，7%左右的老年人依托社区支持养老，3%的老年人入住机构养老。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，2023年北京市委社会工委市民政局通过调查发现，北京99%以上的老人选择居家养老，只有不到1%的老人选择机构养老。可见，无论从地方与全国层面的养老战略来看，还是从实际情况来看，老年人压倒性的养老模式仍是居家养老。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样看来，养儿防老并没有如一些人所想象的那样成为历史。从另一角度看，养育孩子也可以视作一种投资：不仅孩子长大后会工作，会给年老的父母转移支付，提供一部分养老资金；而且父母有大病需要就医与照料，亲儿亲女的作用是不可替代的：子女出钱出力、亲力亲为只是一方面，帮失能甚至失智的父母主张与捍卫权利也是重要的方面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哪怕出钱请人照料，有身体与智能健全的亲儿亲女随时监督，老人才有更高概率得到较好的照顾。当失能老人躺在家中床上不能动弹，请来的保姆有动机不尽力干活，如果没有亲儿亲女，失能老人主张与维护自己的权益都很难。儒家讲“慎独”，那是一种很高的道德修养，很难要求从市场上请来的保姆或护工有这么高的道德自觉与职业伦理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，子女也可能忤逆不孝，但子女与父母间有割舍不断的血缘与亲情。从人性的角度上，如果对子女照看、孝养自己都没有信心，那如何会对与你根本没有血缘关系也没有感情可言的外人产生这么大的信心？这是一个逻辑问题，也是一个人性问题。而且，如果对教育出一个有正常价值观、尊重敬爱父母的子女都没有信心，又如何对自己提前几十年设计的养老安排产生这么大的信心？这也是一个逻辑问题。既然谈风险，就要精算不同风险的大小。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外，许多人在城市工作与生活，缴纳社保，会产生一种“自己给自己养老，不需要子女养老”的错觉。其实，这种现收现支的社保模式，本质上是年轻人、工作者与下一代向老年人、退休者与上一代的代际转移支付，或者说“所有子女养所有父母”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即便看单个家庭，养老也不仅仅是一个养老金有无多少的问题。哪怕钱再多，无论是在家请人照顾，还是去住豪华养老院，也要确保在自己失能甚至失智的时候能把这钱花出去、花到自己身上、让自己得到很好的照看，这时候，有身体与智能健全的亲儿亲女在一旁，帮你主张与捍卫权利，他们的作用是不可替代的。如果没有子女，有天性纯良的年轻近亲属如侄子侄女、外甥外甥女代行子女的功能，或者有感情深厚的好友来帮衬，那自然也是可以的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自己投资金融资产、存钱养老看起来是不错的选择，但仍有同样的问题绕不过去。在能走能动的时候，住在养老院里，因为你能主张与捍卫自己的权利，所以能得到不错的照看；但当你失能甚至失智时，或者神智清醒但躺在床上动弹不得，或者神智也不清醒了，因而无法主张与捍卫自己的权利，你能不能得到必要的医疗与照看服务，那就要看养老院经营者与护工的良心了。当然，政府机构会有监管，但在力度与细致度上，恐怕代替不了亲儿亲女或天性纯良近亲属或好友的“监管”。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/48466fe39e17ef0662e7a589ea8ea87c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1563&quot; height=&quot;3362&quot;

&lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;针对城市恶犬伤人事件，目前各城市均出台了禁养或严管犬只相关规定，涉及犬类的预防接种、登记、养犬行为规范等，包括禁养犬只的种类。此次纳入统计的15个城市中，每个城市至少出台2项养犬管理相关规定，涉及养犬管理条例、动物防疫条例或者文明行为促进条例等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梳理发现，从出台的养犬管理规定数量来看，天津市最多，包括《天津市养犬管理条例》《天津市动物防疫条例》《天津市文明行为促进条例》《天津市养犬登记和养犬注册管理办法》《天津市饲养犬只防疫管理办法》等5项。其次是北京、重庆，各有4项，北京有《北京市养犬管理规定》《北京市养犬登记和年检管理办法》《北京市文明行为促进条例》《北京市动物防疫条例》；重庆有《重庆市养犬管理暂行办法》《重庆市养犬管理条例》《重庆市动物防疫条例》《重庆市文明行为促进条例》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;养犬管理条例是目前多个城市依法执法的重要依据、具体参照，但梳理部分城市的最新修订时间或施行时间发现，15个城市中有北京、天津、杭州、武汉、南京等城市超过16年没有对相关养犬管理条例进行修订，最长的已经达20年。早在2017年，杭州市城管委在回应媒体采访时称该法规修订被列入杭州市2016年政府立法工作计划的调研项目中。南京市人大常委会2018年已将修订《南京市养犬管理条例》列入《南京市人大常委会2018—2022年立法规划》。 2022年，武汉市第十四届人大常委会第二十二次会议审议《武汉市养犬管理条例（修订草案）》，但还没有正式公布。最近，天津市公安局相关人员接受媒体采访时也透露相关部门正在着手对《天津市养犬管理条例》进行修订。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比其他城市，《重庆市养犬管理条例》是2023年6月1日起正式施行，此前实施的是2008年版《重庆市养犬管理暂行办法》。从15个被纳入分析城市的养犬管理条例修订次数来看，杭州、苏州此前修订相对频繁，《杭州市限制养犬规定》分别在1997年、2001年、2004年进行修订，《苏州市养犬管理条例》最新修订时间是在2022年，此前修订时间是在2018年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/66212136c002ea146d35a1cf91703f12.jpeg&quot;

&lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;10月16日成都崇州咬伤女童的罗威纳犬，公犬肩高一般在70-90厘米，母犬在65-80厘米，一般意义上属于大型犬种（一般各地规定肩高60厘米以上算大型犬），但《成都市养犬管理条例》中规定了22种烈性犬、大型犬，并没有包括罗威纳犬。此外，深圳市市场监督管理局关于公布烈性犬名单的通告中，罗威纳犬也未纳入禁养名单，但纳入统计的其他13个城市中禁养罗威纳犬。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南都大数据研究院梳理发现，上述出台养犬管理条例的城市中，从各地公布的禁养烈性犬名单、重点管理区准养犬类相关通告或公告可见，对禁养犬、限养犬的规定不尽相同。例如，北京规定重点管理区内原则上应饲养成年体高35厘米以下(含35厘米)的小型玩赏犬，应禁止饲养烈性犬及成年体高超过35厘米的犬种；天津明确养犬重点管理区准养成年体高不超过45厘米的小型犬观赏犬，禁止饲养烈性犬及成年体高超过45厘米的犬种，而且特别强调办理养犬登记后所养犬体高超过45厘米的不予注册；青岛要求规定中未包括的烈性犬、含有烈性犬血统或体高超过60厘米的杂交犬只一律禁止饲养，等等。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;梳理这些城市禁养犬品类的名称来看，禁养犬只的名称也有一些差别，有的用全称，有的用简称，例如日本土佐犬，有的城市禁养犬只名单中就叫土佐犬或者土佐斗犬；意大利扭玻利顿犬，有的叫扭玻利顿犬，有的直接称纽波利顿，等等。从纳入统计的15个城市禁养犬只名单来看，找不出一个名称完全相同或者均禁养的犬只类别。不过，藏獒、牛头梗、纽芬兰犬、中亚牧羊犬等普遍被列入禁养名单，但总有城市未纳入禁养名单。例如，纽芬兰犬就没有出现在上海、苏州、天津禁养犬品的名单中。由于各地数量差异较大，存在某个犬种在一地可养，在另一地禁养等问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对此，有专家分析由于具体养犬细则制定权则交给省、自治区、直辖市的人民政府，也是各地养犬规定差异如此之大的原因，需要与时俱进的政策跟进，以及不断积极完善政策体系的运作机制，更规范的管理，堵上烈性犬禁养标准不一的口子，防止烈犬伤人悲剧重演。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[他们关心大山里的孩子，那么谁来关心他们丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258834]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2013年12月10日，乃拖村小学，教室内采光不好且气温比较低，学生们在室外上课。受访者供图&quot;

&lt;p>;万朝辉支教的地方在昭觉县色底乡乃拖村，海拔2600多米。乃拖村小学建于1990年，深褐色瓦片，黄褐色泥墙，年久失修，墙体开裂，大裂缝有三处，最宽的能塞进万朝辉的拳头，小的裂缝十多条，能塞进孩子的手指。窗户用塑料薄膜封着，呼呼的山风吹不进来。三间屋，中间是老师宿舍，两边是一、二年级教室。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;临近开学，小学的旗杆被猪拱断了。三个男生背着砍柴的短刀，上山砍了3米长的竹竿抬回学校，万朝辉把五星红旗用尼龙绳子绑好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年9月1日，开学第一堂课。 9点上课，万朝辉7点半起床，用纸巾反复擦眼镜。站上讲台，万朝辉拿出花名册点名，可喊了几个名字，没人应答。有的孩子咧开嘴巴哈哈笑，有的孩子两眼直勾勾地看着他，一脸茫然。他们不会说普通话，万朝辉急得在黑板前来回转圈，最后喊来村支书吉达大哥，吉达跑来给他当翻译。一节课45分钟，全用来点名了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，小学的土坯房变成了砖瓦房，学校有了厕所和洗澡间，有了厨房和水泥操场，还有了新的课桌椅、篮球架、国旗杆、宿舍床铺、衣柜。担心老乡不识字，万朝辉特意嘱咐建筑工人，在厕所墙上画了两个小人，帮助老乡区分男女厕所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年我再次见到了万朝辉。在6月的彝族火把节上，学校操场变成了学生们点火把的游乐场，二十多个孩子把万朝辉围在圆圈的中央。火把点起来，万朝晖和学生们举着火把，围着学校跑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;转眼间支教生涯已过十年。 2023年7月，我又见到了万朝辉。他38岁了，人近中年。岁月积淀中，他人生的另一个故事主线已慢慢浮现：回归世俗，结婚生子。这时候，此前每次与他在山区见面的一个特定话题也逐渐变得重要：他作为支教老师，每个月的生活补贴不足3000元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年4月，在凉山待了5年的万朝辉，经过彝族朋友介绍，他认识了第一任妻子，两人从第一次见面到结婚领证，仅用了一周的时间。班级里的男生充当男方的亲戚，按照彝族娶媳妇的习惯，村民又帮忙杀了两头猪；班级的女生跑去山上采来索玛花，放在教室的讲台上，并在黑板上写下“新婚快乐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;婚后，妻子在雷波县城开饭馆，万朝辉依然在古觉村小支教，两地相距150公里，行车需要5个多小时。由于两人的不同文化背景和生活习惯，关系越来越疏远。 2019年5月，两人离婚。 2020年9月，万朝辉与当地一名幼儿园老师结婚，第二年孩子出生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有了家庭，有了孩子后，才知道现实的压迫，尿不湿、奶粉、房租、水电等各项生活开支。”有一次，&amp;nbsp;坐在我面前的万朝辉，平静地诉说着这一切。他已经多次想离开山区，回归到都市生活，但他顾虑38岁的年龄，“很多用人单位明确规定，35岁以上不收”。谈到父母，万朝辉也是一脸无奈与愧疚，“每年寒暑假才能回家，有时候觉得自己挺不孝顺的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他属于支教老师队伍中比较特殊的群体，并非主流，但依然值得关切，一些自发支教且愿意长期扎根大山的老师，他们该如何留在这里？所以就有了这个短片《&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/256942?source=131&quot; title=&quot;坚守大山十年，月薪不到三千：支教老师“中年危机”何解&quot;>;坚守大山十年，月薪不到三千：支教老师“中年危机”何解&lt;/a>;》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在拍摄时，我恰好遇到了一群新来支教的大学生。有海外留学回来的，还有师范专业毕业的，他们大多计划支教一学期或两学期，便离开山区回归正常生活。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;
