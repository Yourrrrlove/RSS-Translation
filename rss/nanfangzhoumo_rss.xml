I haven&#39;t asked for it in six years of work. Leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fahem, a machine operator at a garment factory in Gazipur, Bangladesh, told Southern Weekend reporters that although there is meager overtime pay, if workers forcefully ask for leave, they are likely to be laid off verbally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Bangladesh government adjusted the minimum wage standard in 2018, the monthly income of garment workers has remained at 8,300 taka (equivalent to RMB 530) for a long time. This money can hardly afford to live with inflation and high prices due to the new crown epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Bangladesh’s cheap labor has brought huge profits. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of Bangladesh, in 2022, the production value of the textile industry will account for more than 13% of Bangladesh&#39;s total GDP, and the country relies on clothing exports to make US$55 billion in profits every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the silent volcano erupted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/1706045b48.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/1706045b48.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259581&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;During this round of protests, Bangladeshi police are using sticks to drive away female garment workers. Picture provided by interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From October 24 to November 14, 2023, tens of thousands of ordinary Bangladeshi workers launched a &quot;Taka 23,000&quot; protest in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and its surrounding cities. Wage protest” (equivalent to RMB 1,472). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Taka 23,000 salary protest&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Six years ago, after passing a mechanical operation test and a simple interview, Fahem entered this garment factory. Because he is engaged in a more technical position, his salary is 10,500 taka (equivalent to RMB 672) per month, which is slightly higher than the 8,300 taka of an ordinary garment worker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Most garment workers are women, and their situation is even more difficult.&quot; Fahem said. When Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact several female garment workers, they were unable to get a reply because they were unable to communicate in English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fahem mentioned that some female workers don’t even know how to type on their mobile phones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/73ff85113b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/73ff85113b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259582&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The income of female garment workers in Bangladesh is only half that of female workers in India and Cambodia. The latter two also have a large number of female garment workers in their countries. Li Chunhua&amp;nbsp; Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fahem did not directly participate in this &quot;Taka 23,000 salary protest.&quot; The city of Gazipur where he is located is a textile industry city in Bangladesh, 25 kilometers north of the capital Dhaka. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early November, Bangladesh’s Minister of Labor and Employment Sufian announced that the minimum wage for workers would be raised to 12,500 taka starting from December 1. Bangladeshi textile workers hope that employers can triple the minimum wage to 23,000 taka - garment workers believe that 23,000 taka is the baseline for maintaining food and clothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gazipur, Asuriya and other industrial cities are the core areas of the &quot;Taka 23,000 salary protest&quot;. Police in Asuriya, Bangladesh, said that more than 10,000 local workers protested along the highway. During the protests, about 300 factories closed down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At least four workers were killed and thousands injured in violent protests, according to the Bangladesh Garment Workers Federation. The police have launched 40 criminal cases so far, with more than 20,000 workers accused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/9ca9fdd311.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/9ca9fdd311.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259583&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Bangladesh is one of the very few Muslim countries that allows women to work outside the home.

Li Chunhua&amp;nbsp; Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;More than 100,000 workers across Bangladesh participated in the wage increase movement.&quot; Tohidur Rahman, chairman of the Bangladesh Garment Workers Federation, is one of the organizers of this protest one. He told Southern Weekend reporters that every year, he submits a salary increase plan to the Bangladesh Ministry of Labor and Employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Individual workers dare not make any demands to their employers for fear of being fired.” As one of the representatives of the local union, Fahem did not go directly to the streets. He was avoiding arrest by the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When prices and rents rise, the salary cannot sustain my life, and I cannot lose this job.&quot; Fahem told Southern Weekend reporters that in order to support his family, he can only hold on to his &quot;job.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Female Workers in Bangladesh&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Being a garment worker is a common occupation in Bangladesh. &quot;Most people only need to receive very little training to stay and work.&quot; Jon Hossain, a Bangladeshi, told Southern Weekend reporters that his friends would also choose textile engineering when they went to college. major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Bangladesh, more than thirty private and public universities train textile industry graduates every year, further increasing the number of technical talents in the textile industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the factory where Fahem works, it is more common to see female garment workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a study by the Ethical Trade Initiative, more than 50% of the 4 million textile industry workers in Bangladesh in 2022 will be women. In the 1980s, female workers accounted for as high as 80%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/7d7b73aa51.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/7d7b73aa51.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259584&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Lunch for Bangladeshi female workers.

The weekly output of her production line must reach 1,000 pieces of clothing.&quot; American author Maxine Bedart&#39;s book &quot;Amplified Desire&quot; A book chronicles the work of Rima, a Bangladeshi garment worker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book mentions that every working day, Rima can only go to the toilet after completing her production target. If she falls behind, her manager is nearby, loudly urging her to work faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Labor rights activists in Bangladesh and the United States believe that Bangladesh’s garment industry provides young women with opportunities to move from the margins of society to the center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hazy, a female worker, once worked in a garment factory, sewing shirt pockets, &quot;every day until she couldn&#39;t sew anymore.&quot; But she still &quot;loves it here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can decide my own life, and I can also make money to support my family.&quot; Hartz believes. Some relatives and friends praised her as &quot;the only one in the family who earns a salary.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While being squeezed by their employers, Bangladeshi garment workers also face potential safety hazards at work. The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Savar, Bangladesh, in 2013 killed more than 1,130 people, making it one of the world&#39;s worst industrial disasters&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of salary, the monthly salary of 8,300 taka for female workers is far from enough to live on. In a study on &quot;Basic Rights to a Living Wage&quot; by the U.S. non-profit organization Microfinance Opportunities and the C&amp;amp;A Apparel Foundation, the income of female garment workers in Bangladesh is only half that of female workers in India and Cambodia. The latter two also have a large number of domestic workers.

They can work in various places such as banks and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is a woman, and she has provided more preferential policies for women in Bangladesh.&quot; Jon Hou, Ph.D. in International Investment Law, China University of Political Science and Law, Bangladeshi Sain told Southern Weekend reporters that there is no tuition fee for women in Bangladesh to go to college, while men have to pay. &quot;It&#39;s just that many women get married early and give up their studies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hussein smiled and said, if in the factory If there were more male workers, it would be easier for protests to break out. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Who will bear the cost of salary increase? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bangladesh, a South Asian country with a population of less than 200 million, is one of the largest clothing manufacturers in the world. According to statistics from the Bangladesh Manufacturers Association, nearly 3,500 garment factories in the country employ 4 million people, and they supply well-known European and American brands such as Levi&#39;s, Zara and H&amp;amp;M. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate will rise to 9% between 2022 and 2023, the highest value in 12 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unequal wages have attracted the attention of international big names. In September 2023, 18 brands including Levi&#39;s, H&amp;amp;M, Gap, and Puma wrote to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, calling on him to re-establish minimum wage standards to meet the basic needs of workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/d03de605c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/d03de605c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;A group of garment workers gathered on the outskirts of Bangladesh in an attempt to protest against unequal wages.

They sign contracts with local factory owners. Factory owners need to pay all upfront costs, including raw materials, factory equipment, and worker wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For many small garment factories, it is very difficult to raise wages for employees.” Bangladeshi Jon Hussain told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Hussein&#39;s friends sold part of his property and opened a small clothing factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/33e9261a6c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;831&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/24/33e9261a6c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259587&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Bangladeshi police patrol near the factory. Picture provided by interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The export price has been negotiated between the factory and the brand. If employees need a salary increase, many small factories will close.&quot; Hussein mentioned that due to insufficient production levels , most small factories are also unable to purchase automation equipment, and once workers take to the streets, the factories are forced to stop production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protests forced the closure of hundreds of factories. Kalpona Akter, president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, mentioned that the suspended factories supply almost all well-known European and American brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The low cost of international FMCG brands is not unrelated to the low income of workers in exporting countries. When brands seek lower prices from OEMs, worker wages will only stagnate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the COVID-19 epidemic, international brands canceled approximately US$40 billion in orders from factories around the world, and factories and workers paid the price. At that time, the workers&#39; rights alliance launched many labor movements on social media, some of which claimed to have caused major brands to repay nearly US$22 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Jiang Lai, Xu Ziyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[起诉“停止大象表演”败诉，野生动物表演等于虐待吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261296]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-25 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新嫂燕球丨云间夜话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261246]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fish Balls.

Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Songjiang River in Shanghai was called &quot;Yunjian&quot; in ancient times. When I first moved to Songjiang, it felt a bit like &quot;between the clouds&quot; - empty and silent, misty and deserted. There are no acquaintances. Naturally, there were no familiar delicacies. I thought I would start a lonely life and start everything from scratch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, I was suddenly called by my name on the quiet road that day. I couldn&#39;t help but be startled. I took a closer look at a fat lady, but I didn&#39;t recognize her, but she smiled and said, I often watch on TV. I see you here, why are you here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turned out to be Jin Mei, my childhood neighbor. Hearing that her mother was still alive, she couldn&#39;t help but be surprised: New sister-in-law, is she still there? ! It&#39;s about ninety, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ninety-seven!&quot; Jin Mei replied. I immediately asked to see her. Because when she was a child, she was a popular idol in the alley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;New Sister-in-law&quot; is probably called famous by a group of old people. The reason must be that she was a bride in the alley back then. It is said that many people want to see a new wife who can&#39;t cook and make a fool of herself, but the new sister-in-law&#39;s skills make many older people feel inferior to her. What makes many women obey the most is that she actually raised eight boys and one girl in one go. Her youngest daughter Jinmei is my classmate. Behind her back, the old ladies call her &quot;Laikehang&quot; (a kind of foreign chicken that is very good at laying eggs). ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although her ancestral home is Shaoxing, she is more proficient than ordinary people when it comes to &quot;being a good person&quot;. When people in Shanghai say that people &quot;can be a good person&quot;, they are praising a kind of &quot;intelligent frugality&quot;, which is left-brained and right-brained. Living a life by discussing things is not just living a stingy life. For example, using mature loofah tendons to wash dishes is far better than sponges, but the price is negligibly cheap; cutting discarded sweatshirts into strips of cloth to tie into mops is much better absorbent than yarn; buying meat at a &quot;small market&quot; You can be precise enough to buy only 2 taels, which is enough to fry shredded pork for a meal. This is in contrast to the honest and honest people in the north who often buy half a fan, forming a &quot;precision&quot;. When you go to a restaurant to eat, most of the leftovers have to be packed up and re-cooked at home, called &quot;zaluo soup&quot;. The most typical one is the invention of the &quot;fake leader&quot; in Shanghai, which uses the least amount of fabric to maintain the greatest dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But these &quot;life skills&quot; are just &quot;mere&quot; in the eyes of the new sister-in-law. She has her own unique skills, and they are beyond everyone&#39;s imagination, which makes the whole alley admire her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin’s sister-in-law’s hometown has a lot of bamboo shoots, and every year a lot of bamboo shoots are brought there by people. In order to preserve them, Xin’s sister-in-law always boils the bamboo shoots in a large pot of salted water, cuts the cooked bamboo shoots into pieces, and air-dries them. The old soup used to cook the bamboo shoots is not changed, and is cooked batch by batch. Finally, the old soup is slightly thick, and the large bottle and large wine bottle are poured in sequentially. The whole process does not touch the water, and the wine bottle is sealed with oil paper. This is the &quot;soy sauce&quot; for cooking in her family. &quot;. They call it &quot;bamboo shoot oil&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, good red soy sauce cost 27 cents per catty, white soy sauce (fresh soy sauce) cost 21 cents per catty, and MSG was even more expensive. But with the bamboo shoot oil, her family never buys soy sauce and MSG. My grandmother often orders me to go to her house and buy a bottle. The freshness is better than the soy sauce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new sister-in-law also pickles bacon every year, adds coarse salt and pepper, and pours some sorghum wine. The strange thing is that she is reluctant to throw away the reddish marinated meat water. She &quot;makes meat with meat&quot; and uses the marinated meat water to cook braised pork. Just add a little red soy sauce to make the meat very red and fragrant. Neighboring, the kind of fragrance between &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;wax&quot; is almost indescribable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what we miss the most is her &quot;Yanqiu&quot; - the new sister-in-law Yanqiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Specially difficult period&quot;, considering that her family is a &quot;super-large family&quot; of 11 people, eight boys, and eight &quot;tiger&quot;, it is natural that there is a serious shortage of meat resources. Anyone who wants to touch big meat Their thoughts were not only &quot;immoral&quot;, but directly &quot;cheating&quot;, but the new sister-in-law&#39;s &quot;Shaoxing-style wisdom&quot; actually solved them as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time she stopped at the market, a storm would rush through her eyes - in the fish stall, there were dead white fish (silver carp), as cheap as mud, the most undesirable, and the new sister-in-law would kill them with a move. &quot;Here are two, big ones!&quot; The stall owner was so flattered that he offered them at the lowest price. In the meat stall, people walked around the milk fat pork, the loosest fat on the pork belly, and the stall owner often felt worried about it. At this time, the new sister-in-law waved her pink arm and said, &quot;Two pounds here!&quot; The stall owner was like Feng Lunyin. Not only did he cut the meat wide, but he also charged the floor price, and often even refused to charge for the meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Mei and I love watching our new sister-in-law make swallow balls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw her quickly removing the scales, gills and internal organs of the fish, and then rinsed it clean. Then cut it in half from head to tail, remove the bones and large spines, cut off the head and belly of the fish (reserve for fish soup), leaving two large pieces of fish meat, skin side down, place on the chopping board and nail them For the fish tail, hold the sharp knife upright and scrape the fish meat from the outside inward. When the skin and red meat under the skin are left, the new sister-in-law said proudly, many people don’t understand and are greedy for this piece of red meat! In fact, you must not ask for red meat. The fishy smell comes from the red meat! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My new sister-in-law chopped the scraped fish meat repeatedly and finely, saying that all the fish bones were gone. Then I put it in a container, stirred it clockwise for a few minutes with two pairs of chopsticks, added salt, and stirred it until it bubbles. , then picked up the milk and fat meat. Chop the cooked milk fat pork and lard residue together, add starch and chopped green onion and ginger, then mix in the fish paste and mix well until thickened, and shape into fish balls. Because of the abundant raw materials, she made the fish balls larger. It is as big as a ping pong ball or even a tennis ball. It is cooked in a pot of boiling water for a while. It is as white and crystal clear as snow. It is as tender and smooth as tofu in the mouth. It is not fishy and delicious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why we treat it as a swallow ball every time is because every time we can taste one first and squeal with joy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night was a carnival where the eight boys and her husband had a &quot;meat feast&quot; - when the big pot of swallow balls was served, the new sister-in-law had to use the spoon solemnly with a straight face. They were strictly allocated one by one. If it were left to them, it might be a dinner table accident with blood splattering three feet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the story is not over yet. The &quot;Eight Tigers&quot; had eaten all the swallow balls, and there must be a by-product of the swallow balls, &quot;fish soup&quot;, waiting for them the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After my new sister-in-law cooked the tripe that was chopped off yesterday, she removed the fish, removed the spines, chopped the fat meat into pieces, mixed it with the fish and added it to the soup. Add vinegar and salt. Sprinkle in a lot of celery leaves or minced garlic, the aroma is fragrant, fresh and slightly sour, and the big pot of brown rice is gone in an instant. It can be described as more than just &quot;dinner&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While being jealous, a group of old women headed by my grandma often commented quietly: This dish actually comes from Hangzhou cuisine. The most outstanding thing is that it uses the most unwanted &quot;trash&quot;. And make it delicious. Who wants this dead white fish? If it cannot be sold, it will rot; who will buy this fat meat? If it can&#39;t be sold, it can only be boiled in oil residue. But with her help, the New Year&#39;s Eve dinner can be served. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, everyone put down their arrogance and asked the new sister-in-law for advice; gradually, the fish stalls and meat stalls in the vegetable market, those &quot;abandoned items&quot; that no one usually touched, were noticed... &lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, it became the most popular, affordable and nourishing home-cooked dish in our alley. The official name given to it by the neighbors was &quot;Xinsao Yanqiu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many years have passed, the time has almost changed, and the alleys have disappeared, but how many generations, especially the &quot;eight tigers&quot; have grown up eating the cheapest and most delicious &quot;big meat&quot; , joining a job, getting married - and even getting older, my new sister-in-law is actually still alive! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I stood in front of her bed. To be honest, at ninety-seven, she was too old to remember me, but when she talked about her swallow balls, her eyeballs flashed a few times.

Originally, children can jump more than 190 times per minute, but this kind of skipping rope can only jump 160 times. If it were not required by the school, I would definitely I won’t buy it.” Mr. Huang, a citizen of Hangzhou, said that his son will take the high school entrance examination next year, and the sports test will be skipping rope. Since the brand of skipping rope chosen for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination was &quot;Hengyou&quot;, in order to familiarize the children with the rope used for the exam in advance, he had no choice but to buy this skipping rope after being designated by the school teacher. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“I checked the same type of rope online. One rope only costs more than ten yuan, and this one costs 78 yuan.” Similar to Mr. Huang, a primary school student in Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City Ms. Lu, the parent of a second-grade student, said that almost all of the 39 students in her child&#39;s class bought &quot;Hengyou&quot; brand skipping ropes at the teacher&#39;s request. Some parents even bought two, one for practicing at home and one for practicing at school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In August 2020, five departments including the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening and Standardizing the Management of Education Fees&quot;, which clarified that &quot;students and parents shall not be forced or implied to purchase designated fees.&quot; Teaching aid software or materials”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why do some schools recommend buying this rope even though it is explicitly prohibited? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou said frankly that rope skipping is a must-test sports event for grades one to six in primary schools; in middle schools, it is also one of the items in the high school entrance examination. Since the rope used in Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination is &quot;Hengyou&quot;, some primary schools also use &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping ropes to compete with middle schools. &quot;It is better to use it early than to use it late. We will recommend parents to buy the &#39;Hengyou&#39; rope to strengthen training, but teachers are not forced to buy it. The school will also provide corresponding skipping ropes to try to meet the needs of students.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A junior high school student in Hangzhou told reporters that because the &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope is relatively expensive, she usually uses rubber ropes that cost a few yuan a piece when practicing at home; Practice with the school&#39;s &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope. &quot;Some students in the class who are from well-off families also bought a &#39;Hengyou&#39; rope with a Bluetooth counting function, which costs more than 140 yuan.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter investigated and learned that, Some head teachers or physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou asked parents to purchase ropes of this brand by verbal notification or by sending links to parents in groups.

Other ropes are easy to jump on. &quot;In order to prepare for the exam, the children can only sign up for training classes.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Why did the &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope become a special rope for Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Is there a standard for the rope used in the high school entrance examination? Shen Hao, deputy director of the Hangzhou Municipal Education Examination Institute, who is responsible for purchasing sports equipment for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination, said that neither the country nor the province has standards for ropes used in the high school entrance examination. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that the national skipping rope standard stipulates the length and diameter of the rope and the diameter and weight of the handle, but this standard is a recommended standard. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“In fact, the length of the rope and the thickness of the handle of the &#39;Hengyou&#39; skipping rope are designed according to adult standards, which is not suitable for primary school students - primary school students are small and weak. The &#39;Hengyou&#39; skipping rope is heavy, not easy to jump, and easy to break,&quot; said some primary and secondary school physical education teachers in Hangzhou. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is understood that the manufacturer of &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope is Shenzhen Hengkang Jiaye Technology Co., Ltd.

Jump rope products. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The relevant person in charge of Hangzhou Feiniao Sports Goods Co., Ltd. admitted that since entering the Zhejiang market in 2011, the &quot;Hengyou&quot; skipping rope has been the test rope used for the Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination Sports; the current market It has covered all major urban areas in Hangzhou, and more than 100,000 tubes are sold in Zhejiang a year, of which more than 70% of users are primary and secondary school students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So, how did the &quot;Hengyou&quot; rope become a special rope for Hangzhou&#39;s high school entrance examination? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Since about 2011, the Hangzhou Education Department has been leasing and using high school entrance examination sports equipment produced by Shenzhen Hengkang Jiaye Technology Company. After 2017, we have Using an open bidding method, the annual rental fee for leasing sporting goods produced by this manufacturer is 8.9 million yuan,&quot; Shen Hao said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some skipping rope manufacturers said that they also tried to enter the range of sports ropes for Hangzhou High School Entrance Examination, but found it difficult. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter was in a &quot;Single Source Announcement on the Hangzhou Education Examination Institute&#39;s High School Entrance Exam Physical Examination Equipment Leasing Project&quot; (January 2019) published by the Zhejiang Provincial Government Procurement Network It has been seen that the Hangzhou Municipal Education Examination Authority plans to use the &quot;single source&quot; procurement method (leasing) to purchase high school entrance examination physical examination equipment from Hangzhou Xingti Education Technology Co., Ltd. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reason for the application given by the Hangzhou Education Examination Authority is: &quot;For many years, the physical education examination of Hangzhou urban high school entrance examination has been using the products produced and produced by Shenzhen Hengkang Jiaye Technology Co., Ltd. The original equipment rental service provider for the physical education high school entrance examination equipment and examination system developed is Hangzhou Xingti Education Technology Co., Ltd. The equipment system operates stably, the service response is fast, and the high school entrance examination physical examination tasks are successfully completed every year. From the continuity of use, the examination system Considering the integrity and specificity of the software management platform, it meets the condition of &#39;can only purchase from the only supplier&#39; in single-source procurement.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Shen Hao said, ten For many years, Hangzhou Sports High School Entrance Examination has been leasing equipment from the manufacturer &quot;Hengyou&quot;, including skipping ropes, skipping rope testers, etc., so the result is that the rope used in the high school entrance examination today is &quot;Hengyou&quot;. In addition, this company is one of the earliest manufacturers to develop intelligent counting rope skipping. Compared with the past, invigilators used to count the number of rope skipping by candidates with their eyes, this kind of intelligent counting is fairer and more efficient. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“It is actually not profitable to lease physical examination equipment to the Hangzhou Education Examination Authority. Our market is more of the market for primary and secondary school students, which is under the physical examination mechanism of primary and secondary schools. Policy market.&quot; The person in charge of Hangzhou Feiniao Sports Goods Co., Ltd. said frankly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Break the hidden brand monopoly and give parents and schools more choices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Some skipping rope manufacturers said that countable skipping ropes are not high-tech products and can be produced by any manufacturer. &quot;We hope that by improving the bidding methods and establishing standards for ropes for primary and secondary school physical education examinations, parents and schools will have more choices.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Now there is no The cost of a high school entrance examination rope with a counting function does not exceed 8 yuan per rope; the cost of a high school entrance examination rope with a counting function does not exceed 20 yuan. The prices of &#39;Hengyou&#39; non-counting and counting skipping ropes are respectively sold at 78 The price is 148 yuan, and the profit margin is huge.&quot; revealed a brand merchant in Zhejiang that produces skipping ropes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Anti-Monopoly Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs shall not abuse administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition. &quot;If the education and examination department uses a certain brand of skipping rope for a long time without justifiable reasons, especially if it simply purchases a certain product through the &#39;single source&#39; procurement method without extensive investigation and understanding of market products, it is obviously against fair competition in the market.

There are people specially guarding the place, and the elderly are free to enter. There are many small benches inside, and loudspeakers are turned on. Young people are on the stage preaching the efficacy of a certain product, and then encouraging the elderly to buy it. Obviously, this is a product promotion meeting, but it has two obvious characteristics: first, the promotion location is in the village, located in a pure rural area; second, the sales target is the elderly, and they are all left-behind elderly people in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is a sales meeting or a merchant advertising, it cannot be said that there are many violations, but upon closer inspection, it is still full of &quot;routines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About daily arrangements. It is understood that this kind of sales meeting usually lasts for 6-7 days. In the first 4-5 days, someone will explain the relevant knowledge to make the elderly believe it. One of the common tricks is to exaggerate certain aspects of the elderly&#39;s problems based on the characteristics of the product to be promoted. For example, when promoting water purifiers, one would say how poor the quality of water commonly used in rural areas is and what harm it causes to the body. The purpose It makes the elderly feel that if they do not buy their products, the consequences will be very serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second trick is to frequently use some scientific and technological means during the explanation process, such as on-site testing of water quality, using special instruments, professional testing methods, and demonstrations by academicians and scientists to convince the villagers. This is scientific, advanced and developed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third trick is that a group of people will jointly &quot;perform&quot; the explanation process, including outsiders, locals, and perhaps people who are quite prestigious in the local area. The business owner&#39;s assumption is that you don&#39;t have to believe it. Foreigners, but locals should believe it, right? There is a high probability that merchants bribe a small number of local people through money and other means. The goods will be sold in the next 1-2 days. That is to say, there is a process of first acting with emotion, convincing people with reason, first brainwashing, winning people&#39;s hearts, and finally harvesting (money). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About identity changes. A few days ago, merchants used various videos, speeches, performances, etc. to gain the trust of the elderly. In the process, the merchants transformed into many roles. A few days ago, they were outsiders and they were technology explanators in the countryside. Members, they are rural revitalization helpers, they are psychologists who are familiar with and understand the psychology of the elderly, they are health guardians who care about the physical and mental health of the elderly, and they are philanthropists who send warmth to the countryside; two days later, they returned to their The essential role - a profit-seeking businessman, a villain and a villain who defrauds honest village elders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About what is sold and given away. What they ultimately want to sell is a certain brand of water purifier, and the items they give away are divided into two types: a few days ago, they were paper towels, wash basins, toothpaste, toothbrushes, washing powder, and laundry detergent. Only those who came to the scene could see it. portion; the next two days are range hoods, wall breakers and heating and cooling air conditioners. Obviously, the gifts given a few days ago were mostly cheap and practical things in rural areas. As long as you go there, they will give them to you. When people go there, there are so many people, it is easy to cover the eyes of some onlookers. Yes, there are people. A herd mentality, especially for old people in the countryside. They will think, &quot;Are they all fools, right? I&#39;ll go take a look too.&quot; The gifts in the next two days are also very practical, but anyone with a discerning eye will know at a glance that they are not cheap, but the condition is that you have to spend money to buy the net. Water vessels are only given by others. In other words, the things they sell and give away are not cheap. This method of selling one large item and getting three large items for free makes many elderly people feel that this business is full of sincerity and is not a profiteer in the ordinary sense. , some old people even stood up to speak for them, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter even if they are cheated in the end. Thousands of dollars are gone, but at least four real things are in hand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About price. Take the main product for sale, water purifiers, as an example. My mother told me that the price is 2,980 yuan per unit. I simply searched on regular e-commerce platforms such as JD.com and Taobao and found that I can buy it for only 400-500 yuan. Find similar products with good quality. Faced with such a huge price difference, merchants&#39; compensation tactics include intimidation, bragging and gifts. What’s even more annoying is that my mother told me that the merchant would say that the price of 2,980 yuan was still a lowered price after enjoying the national subsidy policy for technology products going to the countryside. In other words, the original price may be 4,980 yuan per unit. Now it is the business that benefits the people. After deducting the 2,000 yuan of state subsidies, the villagers have a rare opportunity and opportunity to buy one unit for 2,980 yuan. As soon as these words came out, the old people&#39;s previous defensive mentality was easily defeated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About people entering. My mother told me that those people were very friendly. Every morning at seven o&#39;clock, the car would arrive at the entrance of the village on time, pick up the elderly in the village, and prepare breakfasts such as fried dough sticks, steamed buns, and milk for the elderly, and deliver them to the sales meeting for free. When we arrived at the scene, someone brought us tea and water, and the service was quite attentive. At twelve o&#39;clock at noon, the car took the elderly home on time to cook and eat. At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the car will appear in the village on time, waiting for the elderly; at 5:30, they will take the elderly back to their homes. A friend of mine who is about the same age as me told me that a similar activity was held in their village last weekend. He wanted to go into the shed and have a look, but did not want to be dissuaded by the person guarding the door. The meaning was obvious, only the elderly could enter, and young people could not go in. , middle-aged people, don’t give in. Obviously, businesses are afraid of the presence of young or middle-aged people because they are worried that young or middle-aged people will expose their tricks in public, and young people or middle-aged people will openly oppose them, which will seriously affect the elderly. purchasing psychology, reducing the purchasing intention of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above is the relevant situation that I heard or learned, which triggered some other thoughts in me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the basic fact is that some businesses defraud ignorant elderly people in the countryside under the guise of &quot;expanding domestic demand&quot; and &quot;enjoying national subsidies for technological products sent to the countryside.&quot; To be honest, many product manufacturing companies exist in name only. However, under market-oriented conditions, although many companies persist, their main products have long been eliminated by the market. Especially in urban markets, they are already saturated. What should we do? Of course, the company just thought about it and moved its tentacles downwards to occupy the urban and rural markets. There is no doubt that this is a move by companies to expand domestic demand. However, it is difficult to say how good the quality of this type of product is, and the price is many times higher than the price of similar products purchased online. It is undeniable that there is deception and fraud in the product sales process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the abnormal behavior of rural elderly deserves scrutiny. First, why do elderly people who have been living frugally for most of their lives not hesitate or feel distressed when faced with a large purchase of close to 3,000 yuan? I think there is a problem of transfer of family (words) rights (power) here. Nowadays, most of the things in many people’s homes are purchased online by their children outside the home. You buy it and I use it. In the past, I bought it and everyone used it. Now that I am old, I don’t need to buy it. You and your children buy it. That&#39;s good. I don&#39;t have much contribution to this family anymore, at least not as much as before. The elderly are more of just passive recipients of gifts and users of objects. They have little opportunity or need to participate in the purchase and sale of objects, especially large items. The process of selection, screening and purchasing is a deprivation of consumption. Now there is such an opportunity, I pay, I buy, I make the decision, I am happy. Even if they find out in the end that they have been fooled and deceived, they will feel distressed to some extent, but they will also accept the reality calmly, &quot;Where is the use of money other than money? I just spend money to buy something? You can easily spend hundreds of dollars on a meal in Guangzhou. Thousands, you think I don’t know? It’s too expensive for me to buy something?” My mother would use words like this to rebuke me, even in the face of my earnest attempts to dissuade her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, knowing clearly that there is a high probability that it is a trick of a liar, knowing clearly that there is no free lunch in the world, why do the elderly insist on &quot;traveling to the tiger mountain&quot; instead of believing in evil? This is mainly due to the fact that many elderly people have been in rural areas for a long time. They are kind-hearted and honest, and are prone to overflowing with sympathy. They do not understand the complexity of society enough, have limited knowledge of profiteers, have shallow knowledge, and lack basic anti-fraud awareness and skills. Businessmen They often take advantage of this fatal weakness of the elderly and succeed every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A grandfather who finally spent 800 yuan to buy ostrich milk said, &quot;You (young people) can&#39;t say that they are all liars. Hello, I have to say, I can&#39;t buy nothing, I can&#39;t be like this.&quot; Obviously, during the shopping process, the old man felt that it was not just a purely monetary transaction, but also included emotional feedback, that is, people If someone treats us well and takes good care of us, we should also &quot;treat others with courtesy&quot;. This &quot;courteous&quot; way is to buy other people&#39;s things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, why do the elderly not choose to consult their children outside for their opinions or suggestions? The author learned that during the few days of the sales meeting, many elderly people acted silently, went silently, bought silently, and returned silently. They would not take the initiative to inform their children outside of home about this situation. Of course, they were worried that their children would worry about them, or even Scold them. As old people, of course they care more about face. If they are scolded by their children, they will feel shameless. This is certainly not a situation they like to see. In fact, many elderly people are used to &quot;being independent&quot;. &quot;Don&#39;t interfere with what I do or what I buy. I&#39;m not old yet. I haven&#39;t reached the stage of Alzheimer&#39;s disease yet. I have my own judgment and ideas.&quot; , please mind your own business.&quot; This should be the true mentality of many elderly people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, another possibility is caused by the so-called &quot;disconnection&quot; phenomenon, that is, many children living outside have little contact with their parents on weekdays, and their care is relatively scarce, or even indifferent. When encountering this matter, they suddenly became &quot;doubly concerned&quot;. The old people would feel that the young people were &quot;hypocritical&quot; and &quot;too fake&quot;. Yesterday afternoon, one of my cousins ​​called his father several times at the sales venue to ask him not to buy any ostrich milk. Unexpectedly, his father got tired of hearing this and said angrily, &quot;It&#39;s not your money. I&#39;m willing to spend it. You don&#39;t have to pay for it.&quot; &quot;No matter what,&quot; then hung up the phone and turned off the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, joining in the fun is actually quite scarce in many rural areas. My mother went to the market for six days in a row. I didn&#39;t understand it, but my father said it was okay. &quot;I have nothing to do anyway. It&#39;s okay to go and have some fun. It&#39;s fine if I don&#39;t buy anything.&quot; My father&#39;s &quot;strategy&quot; was not to let my mother bring cash or mobile phones, and then not allow her to borrow money from others. Every night on the phone, my mother was cheerful, talking about who she met yesterday and who she met today, whose daughter got married, whose son bought a house, and the steamed buns she served today tasted good. Obviously, my mother&#39;s mind is not on the sales meeting or the product. What she cares about is being able to see and chat with her friends every day. Yes, in today&#39;s rural areas, young people have gone to cities, children have gone to school, and even the elderly are not far apart from one village to another, but they are not close either. For a mother who is nearly seventy years old, there is nothing special. I won&#39;t go to neighboring villages to visit. On weekdays, she just wandered around the village and spent time with her father every day. You looked at me and I looked at you. Occasionally, they would have a few words, saying that her later life was very fulfilling and not boring at all. That was a lie. Obviously, she will be lonely, she will be lonely, she will have nothing to do, social interaction is her real need, and going to the sales club every day for a walk can make her extremely happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of when I was a child. At that time, there were often acrobatic troupes performing in the village, and occasionally people would come to the village to show movies. The scene was spectacular and lively. Times have changed, and in today&#39;s rural areas, many people have their doors locked all year round. The only permanent residents in the village are the elderly. Hollow villages or hollowed-out villages abound. Obviously, the permanent population has dropped sharply, and there are no or few public recreational activities, making the elderly even more lonely, which will inevitably seriously affect the quality of life of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, regarding the fact that rural elderly people are (easily) deceived, I think young people might as well be more free and easy-going, encourage them to visit and go shopping, and tell them to be more vigilant. However, there is a basic fact that it is difficult for us to say now or in advance that the things they buy are fake or counterfeit. This requires a period of testing to see the effects after trial or consumption. If in the end, they find that the items they purchased are indeed inferior products, and they have really been fooled, there is no need to be angry or angry with them, because they have finally gained something, such as meeting and chatting with old friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山东莱荣高铁被举报偷工减料存在质量隐患，官方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261300]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-24 19:51:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On July 20, the media reported that there were some threaded piles in the construction of the first three sections of the Lairong High-speed Railway Station. The pile length did not reach the designed pile length, and the design change procedures were not completed, resulting in quality hazards and other problems. The National Railway Administration, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government attached great importance to it and immediately established a joint investigation team composed of the Shanghai Railway Supervision and Administration Bureau and the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation to conduct investigations in accordance with laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The joint investigation team dispatched more than 120 professionals from across the country to conduct on-site investigations, and organized 10 experts in railway, geology and other fields to provide technical guidance. It lasted more than two months, carried out geological exploration and drilling inspection, interviewed 14 relevant units and 83 people, reviewed more than 29,000 pieces of data in 130 categories, and formed an investigation report and more than 100,000 words of investigation supporting materials. After the investigation was completed, seven experts, including academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were invited to demonstrate the investigation and conclusions. The joint investigation team verified the issues reported by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the problem that the pile length of some threaded piles constructed by Sanjie Company did not reach the designed pile length.
