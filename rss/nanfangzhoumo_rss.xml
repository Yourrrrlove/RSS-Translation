Between the mountains, the Nu River, Lancang River and Jinsha River flow side by side in three canyons with a horizontal distance of only more than 60 kilometers. Under the sunlight, they look like yellow veins. When the plane landed slowly, I saw Shangri-La in the green valley like a spilled palette, flowing beside the Napa Sea wetland. The flowing cloud shadows are reflected on the water surface of the wetland, which is like a dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Napahai Wetland&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center of Shangri-La City is An ancient city named &quot;Dukezong&quot; was originally built by the Tubo people and means &quot;Moonlight City&quot; in Tibetan. Since its construction, it has been abandoned and rebuilt several times, and its organizational structure, zoning and name have been changed several times, but its status as the political, economic and cultural center of Diqing, Yunnan has remained unchanged. For thousands of years, this place has witnessed not only the smoke of wars, but also the bustle of tea and horse trade. It has also been the link between Yunnan, Sichuan, and Tibet&#39;s &quot;Grand Triangle&quot; and a channel for frequent exchanges among various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2014, an unexpected fire partially burned down the ancient city of Dukezong. Today, the ancient city has slowly recovered. Strolling along the stone road in the ancient city, you will see wooden houses on both sides, operating inns, restaurants, bars or handicraft shops. It reminds people of the &quot;quaint little town&quot; described by the British botanist Kingdon Ward. In 1913, in order to investigate the rivers and plants in the Hengduan Mountains, Kingdon Ward passed by this place and stayed in a house. He found that &quot;the house was extremely clean, and the copper cooking pots and tea utensils were polished to a discernible shine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kindon Ward was not the only one to leave written records for Shangri-La. Liu Manqing, the first &quot;female imperial envoy&quot; to Tibet in modern times and known as the &quot;Fantastic Woman of the East&quot;, wrote about the ancient city of Dukezong in a delicate way in &quot;The Campaign of Kangzang&quot; published in 1933:&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When the sky dawns or the sun sets, the streets are full of people carrying water. The ladles for collecting water are made of folded bark. They are light in weight and large in capacity. , beside the spring, water seekers swarmed like ants.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, at the foot of Dagui Mountain, the spring mentioned by Liu Manqing is still gurgling. Someone placed a water ladle next to the spring for passers-by to get water and taste it. The sun passes through the transparent water, and the waves dance under the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since ancient times, Shangri-La has been a legend on the Tea Horse Road. At that time, there were more than 190 businesses traveling between Shangri-La and Lhasa alone, and more than 20,000 caravan horses passed through each year. In the alley of Dukezong Ancient City, I met the handsome Kham man Zhabagdan. Zhabagdan&#39;s father is from Shangri-La and was a member of a caravan when he was young. In 1970, Zhabagdan was born in a small mountain village in India. He worked as a monk for seven years. When he was seventeen, he returned to his hometown with his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhabagdan’s life legend begins in Shangri-La. After returning to China, he started studying in the first grade of primary school and later studied in Austria and the United States. He speaks Tibetan, English and Hindi, as well as a curry-flavored version of Mandarin. He has worked part-time as a civil servant, a tour guide, and opened a travel agency and restaurant. In 2012, Zhabagdan created the first &quot;Arokangba&quot; B&amp;B in the ancient city of Dukezong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Aruo Kamba&quot; is a sentence used by our fathers to greet each other while walking on the Ancient Tea Horse Road, which means &quot;Come on, friend&quot;. Creating &quot;Aro Kamba&quot; was not only Zhabagdan&#39;s father&#39;s dream during his lifetime, but also his own dream. Back then, the caravans walked on the Tea-Horse Ancient Road. Whenever they were exhausted, they would get a chance to rest in &quot;Naicang&quot; deep in the mountains. Every time my father mentioned the story of the caravan to Zhabagdan, he would always talk about the &quot;Naicang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fire in 2014 severely damaged the ancient city. Although Arokamba Manor survived, the memory left by the fire in Zhabagdan has never faded. He still clearly remembered the shops and houses shrouded in fire, falling tragically like defenseless giants. The sound of explosions of liquefied gas tanks came one after another, and clouds of fireworks rolled up. The flying fragments hit the broken walls and made various sharp sounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This was like a one-sided war. We were caught off guard in the face of the rapid fire.&quot; Zhabagdan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes Zhabagdan happy is that over the years, through the reconstruction of &quot;building the new as the old, replacing the old with the old, and imitating the old with the new&quot;, the ancient city of Dukezong has gradually restored its original appearance. What was once a devastated place has been replaced by a brand new look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stone streets, unique Tibetan inns, handicraft shops with ethnic colors, cafes and bars full of literary and artistic atmosphere, indicate that the ancient Dukezong city is back.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;For Shangri-La, Zhabagdan has always had love and confidence. He still often thinks of the time when he and his father climbed over a pass and saw Shangri-La for the first time: &quot;That was a scroll painting that appeared countless times in my dreams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;Songzanlin Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Shangri-La is the imagination of the whole world&quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After leaving Shangri-La, we headed towards Deqin along the Yunnan-Tibet Line and stayed overnight in Benzilan Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benzilan is located on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Jinsha River. It means &quot;little sand dam&quot; in Tibetan. It is a valley area between the surging Jinsha River and steep mountains. However, as the altitude decreases, the scenery of the valley becomes desolate: gravel and barren soil on both sides, and exposed rocks. Just now, you could still see tall broad-leaved forests, a lush scene, but gradually they turned into low shrubs and cacti. The wind blew on my face, it was hot and dry, making me feel like I was in the desert of Mexico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;hot and dry valley&quot; scene is a typical geological landscape in the &quot;Three Parallel Rivers&quot; area, and it can be called a wonderful stroke of nature: the warm and moist airflow becomes cold as it climbs over the mountains on both sides of the canyon in the wind. It triggers precipitation, so rainfall is frequent on the top of the mountain and vegetation is lush. The airflow descends through the leeward slope and becomes hot, and when it reaches the valley bottom, it becomes a dry and hot &quot;Foehn wind&quot;. The &quot;Foehn wind&quot; intensifies the degree of dry heat, causing the vegetation to become sparser, forming a &quot;hot dry valley&quot; landform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;Hot Dry Valley&quot; is by no means completely desolate. Through the car window, you can see ocher-colored mountains studded with agate-like terraces. By transforming these terraces, local people have created local environments suitable for farming. Walnuts, citrus, grapes, watermelons and olives are planted on the platform, complementing the tawny Jinsha River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After passing Benzilan Town, we left the road, followed the stream, passed through the valley, and arrived at the peaceful Bairen Village. Cacti grow among the exposed rocks, and pepper and plum trees grow along the roadside. The person I want to visit is Estelle Achard, a French female architect. Nine years ago, this French woman from the foot of the Alps sold her hut in northern France, came to this Tibetan village deep in the river valley alone, and opened an inn called &quot;Tulu Lodge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dirt Road&quot; was renovated from an old Tibetan-style house in the village, and the original appearance has been maintained as much as possible: plum trees and pomegranate trees are planted in the small yard surrounded by earth and stone walls. , rosemary and mint grow in stone flower beds. Estelle went out to greet us, followed by two dogs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​of them is a blind dog&lt;/span>;), spinning around our feet excitedly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle has ash-brown hair, glasses, and a Tibetan necklace hanging around her neck. Thirty years ago, when she was an architect, she came to Yunnan on a business trip for the first time and couldn&#39;t help but fall in love with the mountains and rivers here. Fifteen years later, she moved to Kunming. After working in hotel design for a few years, she moved to Shangri-La and finally settled in Benzilan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle takes us through the rooms she designed and decorated one by one. Although each room has a different style, they all organically combine national characteristics with modern concepts, as if time has quietly settled here. When renovating the house, Estelle values ​​​​the most ecological and environmental protection concepts. She kept the wood as bare as possible and did not use chemical-based varnishes. She also deliberately preserved the &quot;dry toilet&quot; in rural areas: a hole was made in the ground of the toilet, a chair was placed above the hole, the seat was hollowed out, and there was a pile of sawdust under the hole, and the excrement fell directly into the sawdust and became Fertilizer for the vegetable patch outside the yard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having lived in Benzilan for nearly ten years, Estelle can communicate with the villagers in Chinese, and the villagers call her &quot;French Ajia&quot;. She likes local ghee, yak meat, and fresh vegetables and fruits, and she grows various herbs needed for French cuisine in the garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, we sat under the plum tree in the garden and shared a country dinner made by Estelle with a French family traveling to Diqing: tomato and watermelon cold soup, spice roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, served with Shangri-La products red wine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corn leaves outside the courtyard swayed in the evening breeze, and the sound of the stream became louder. We talked about our respective experiences. Estelle said that she also thought about opening a B&amp;B in Provence, but Provence was already too saturated. She was very happy to settle down in Benzilan and open a small B&amp;B. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provence is the imagination of the whole world, and it is the same here.&quot; Estelle said, &quot;Whenever I tell my French friends that I have settled in Shangri-La, they will exclaim!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252056&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinsha River Big Bend&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Zichao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Xueshan Market Dunshiyang&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, we left Benzilan, left the dry and hot valley, and walked along the Jinsha River. The elevation of the road rises again, and the vegetation on the mountains becomes lush again. At the big bend of the Jinsha River, I saw the yellow river water turning around, like a man&#39;s bent arms, full of power - the mountains sandwiching the river water were like the guardian angel of the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is 86 kilometers from Benzilan to Deqin County. Although the mountain road is winding, it is in good condition. Before liberation, there were no roads in Deqin County, and it was not until 1959 that the Yunnan-Tibet Highway was built. At that time, it was necessary to climb the Baima Snow Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. From October to May of the following year, traffic was often blocked due to heavy snowfall. Now that the tunnel has been opened, it is no longer necessary to cross the pass of Baima Snow Mountain. Our car seemed to be gliding on the road, surrounded by dense forests on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The town of Deqin County used to be called Adunzi. It is said that during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the eminent Tibetan Buddhist monk Karmapa discovered during meditation that Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, was the holy land of Chakrasamvara predicted by Padmasambhava. This started the pilgrimage of Tibetan Buddhists to Kawagebo. the first of its kind. Adunzi is not only the starting point and the end point of worshiping the sacred mountain, but also an important material distribution center and cultural exchange center on the Tea Horse Road. Therefore, it has the reputation of &quot;Snow Mountain Market&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a broader perspective, Adunzi is located in the contact zone between the Han and Tibetan peoples. As scholars say, just as Zhangjiakou&#39;s commercial development is due to its location in the contact zone between the Han and Mongolian peoples, Adunzi&#39;s commercial development is also due to the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Anti-Japanese War, traditional international trade routes were blocked, and merchants gathered in Adunzi, which became a bridge to maintain Sino-Indian trade and transport war preparation materials. Due to the large number of major business houses, in order to facilitate transactions, merchants used a &quot;Dunshiyang&quot; currency as a medium of circulation. This kind of currency can only be used in Adunzi market, which shows the prosperity of Adunzi in those days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Deqin has restored the appearance of a small mountain town, with buildings winding down the valley, with a drop of nearly 600 meters. Walking on the street, I can&#39;t see the prosperous scene of the Tea Horse Station back then. It looks more like an ordinary mountain city. Only the skin color of passers-by, their accents, and the attire of some residents made me realize that I was in a minority area inhabited by Tibetans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to its location in a narrow ravine, the biggest risk faced by Deqin County in recent years is mudslides. In 2003, the Diqing Prefecture government considered moving the county seat elsewhere. In 2010, a mudslide occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, which has similar terrain, which aroused people&#39;s concerns about Deqin. But local people told me that the mountains near Deqin are undulating, and it is very difficult to find a piece of flat land that is open enough. Therefore, the government’s latest consideration is to relocate the entire county seat to the adjacent Weixi County. If this is the case, the ancient city of Adunzi will also will become a piece of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, and the Mingyong Glacier flows below the snow peak. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Mingyong Glacier is protected by Mingyong Village&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In the early morning, we went to Feilai Temple to watch the sacred scene of &quot;Rizhao Jinshan&quot; - the golden sunshine hitting the Kawagebo Mountain Peak. Then we returned to Deqin County and met the poet Tashi Nyima in a Tibetan restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima was born in Mingyong Village under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. This village is located under the Kawagebo Snow Peak, which means &quot;mirror&quot; in Tibetan. It is named after the huge glacier pouring down from the snow-capped mountains behind the village. In addition to Mingyong Glacier, Mingyong Village is also the place where the late poet Ma Hua taught. There, Ma Hua wrote the collection of poems &quot;Snow Mountain Short Songs&quot;, which was praised by critics as the clearest and clearest part of contemporary Chinese poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After lunch, I asked Tashi Nyima to take me to Mingyong Village. We got in the car and got on National Highway 214, and soon saw the roaring Lancang River. The landscape here is also a dry and hot valley, but I found that wherever there are terraces and slopes, there are pastoral houses, and you can see the waves of wheat rolling and the fragrance of melons and fruits. Driving on this road, you will see oases and residential houses embedded in the landscape drawn by snow-capped mountains, canyons and rivers, which is refreshing and refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Along the way, in the passes and fields on both sides of the river valley, you can see towering earthen watchtowers from time to time. Most of them are dilapidated and dilapidated, full of the vicissitudes of history. I asked Tashi Nyima, when were these watchtowers built? What is it used for? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima told me that due to the passage of time, even the locals have lost their memory of the watchtowers. Whether they were for the purpose of war or just a symbol of wealth and status, historians and archaeologists disagree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252055&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tibetan village under Meili Snow Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leading to Mingyong The road in the village was opened in April 1998. In the past, the only way to enter and exit Mingyong Village was by taking the path on the cliff. In Tashi Nyima’s memory, the sound of the Mingyong River was louder than it is now. He goes to school, a half-day walk and a zip line. During the summer vacation, he went to the mountains to herd sheep. When he was hungry, he roasted the matsutake mushrooms collected from the forest, sprinkled them with salt and chili, and ate them. Now it seems that all this is a &quot;rare experience in life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the life of the people in Mingyong Village was very difficult. In most families, the whole family sleeps on the same bunk, and there are not even extra bowls at home. Zhaxinima remembers that when he was in junior high school, he once went home for a vacation and invited his classmates to have lunch at home. Since there were no guest bowls at home, he had to use a family member&#39;s bowl, which was only deformed - his father once went up the mountain to chop wood and fell, causing the wooden bowl to become deformed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from junior high school, Tashi Nyima went to a normal school to study, and then moved around villages and towns under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. In 1997, he was transferred to the Deqin County Tourism Bureau and participated in the preparation of the development plan for the Meili Snow Mountain Ecological Tourism Zone. It was that plan that made Mingyong Glacier a priority scenic spot for development, and the great changes in Mingyong Village began at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the government&#39;s vigorous promotion, Kawagebo Peak and Mingyong Glacier have begun to attract more and more tourists. Deqin County seized the opportunity and invested more than 70 million yuan to build infrastructure for Mingyong Village. Mingyong Glacier became the first national 4A-level scenic spot in Deqing Prefecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the glacier tourism development, the villagers of Mingyong Village are mainly involved in providing horse-drawn services for tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Mules and horses have become the money bag of Mingyong Village.” Zhaxinima said, “In 1999, the average income from horse pulling was 8,700 yuan per household; by 2006, the average income per household exceeded We paid 50,000 yuan.&quot; The villagers have become rich in the tourism industry, and every household has purchased satellite TV, refrigerators, washing machines, and high-end stereos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the county proposed the implementation of the glacier cableway project. Because the cost of raising mules and horses is not small, building a ropeway may bring more tourists. The villagers believe that by signing a contract with the ropeway company and negotiating a share of the profits, they can earn money comfortably without having to worry about feeding the mules and horses and safety issues. Since the Glacier Cableway was put into operation, each villager household has been able to receive at least 55,000 yuan in dividends every year. Mingyong Village has changed from a poor village in the past to a wealthy village in Deqin County and even Diqing Prefecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252054&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Deqin Yubeng Village&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I and I Walking with Tashi Nyima in Mingyong Village. I saw that every household had built a two-story Tibetan-style house with a yard, and the white walls were dotted among the green forests and fields. Kawagebo Peak is right in front of you, and the glacier extends from the chest of the main peak to the forest at an altitude of 2,660 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima told me that according to the old people in Mingyong Village, you could see the glacier and feel the cool air of the glacier when you opened the window. At that time, the glaciers were very &quot;strong&quot; and filled the valley, and you could hear the loud noise of the glaciers cracking all day long. In 1913, the British botanist King Dun Ward also visited the Mingyong Glacier and saw &quot;a huge icicle shaking like a drunkard, roaring and rolling down the valley in an instant, startling a group of green parrots on the tree.&quot; rise&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima said that when he was a child, the outlet of the glacier would be blocked by falling ice, and the river would suddenly stop flowing. Village women would go to the edge of the glacier and raise their voices. Sing &quot;Mani Tune&quot;. As they sang, the ice cubes were broken open and the river water surged out. However, the glaciers have gradually receded over the years, which makes Tashi Nyima feel heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Every time I return to the village, I feel that the glacier has become smaller.” Zasinima said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, he also filmed a documentary called &quot;Glacier&quot;, which expressed the Tibetan people&#39;s belief in the snow-capped mountains and their influence on foreign culture from three perspectives: pilgrims, tourists, and villagers. Different understandings, and the various confusions they face in the wave of tourism development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252057&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Shangri-La region, peach blossoms bloom under the snow-capped mountains. (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a &quot;Monument to Teacher Ma Hua&quot; standing on the roadside of the village. On the front and back, it is written in Chinese and Tibetan: &quot;Ma Hua, poet and scholar. Born on April 11, 1972, male, Han nationality, from Tianjin. He graduated from the International Politics Department of Fudan University in Shanghai. In March 2003, he went to Mingyong Village Primary School to teach on a voluntary basis. Unfortunately, he died on June 20, 2004, at the age of 32. &quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Zhaxinima and Ma Hua were of the same age and both were poets, and they quickly became friends. When he returned to Mingyong Village to visit Ma Hua, the two often talked about books and music together. Ma Hua would pick up the guitar and sing folk songs, his long hair like a black waterfall. They went to a nearby mountain for a picnic and lay under an old peach tree that was unknown how old it was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The breeze blows from time to time, and the petals fall down one after another along the warm sunshine. Behind the scenes are the Kawagbo Snow Mountain and the huge glaciers stretching down from the snow-capped mountains that appear and disappear in the clouds and mist.

There are also many people who are eager to travel and use third-party platforms&#39; &quot;Light Speed ​​Ticket Grabbing&quot; and &quot;Ticket Grabbing Magic Tool&quot;. Tickets usually cost extra. In this regard, Railway 12306 issued a statement through its official Weibo, stating that it has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statement said: &quot;Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only are there traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, bundled sales services, etc., but there may also be risks of personal information leakage. Please Passengers must purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the true meaning of this statement? Will &quot;ticket-grabbing tools&quot; lose their market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must understand why for many years, it is difficult to get a ticket for high-speed rail on many lines during long holidays. But first, starting from this year, the shortage of tickets on some lines may change. And turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use intensity of high-speed rail passengers on different lines is different. Some lines are more popular, with constant demand for commuting, business travel, tourism, etc., and there are many trains every day, such as between cities in the Pearl River Delta or Yangtze River Delta regions. There are lines between major urban agglomerations, as well as lines to popular attractions; some lines are not so popular and have relatively few flights. During the long holidays, in order to cope with the surge in travel demand, the high-speed rail will open some additional trains. However, it is obvious that the former will increase the absolute demand and relative demand much more, but the potential for additional operations is limited; the latter has great potential for additional operations, but the increase demand is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, for a long time, most high-speed rail lines have had the same price during normal times and long holidays, which often leads to the following consequences: when demand is low during normal times, the fare is higher than the market equilibrium price; during long holidays When demand increases sharply, ticket prices are significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, causing tickets to sell out as soon as they are released. The National Railway is well aware of this situation, so it is also making improvements to make fares more market-oriented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway began to implement floating fares. The highest second-class fare for the entire journey was 598 yuan, an increase of 8%; the lowest fare was 498 yuan, a decrease of 10%, that is, the upper limit was increased. , the lower limit is lowered, which is the first time in the nine years since the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway was opened that a floating fare mechanism has been implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from May 30, 2023, the railway department will conduct &quot;fare inspections&quot; on many high-speed rail lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity, Nanjing-Hangzhou High-speed Railway, Nan-Guangzhou High-speed Railway, Jiaoji Passenger Line, and Liunan Passenger Line. &quot;Optimization adjustment&quot;, the upper limit is the published fare, the lower limit is 34% of the published fare, the upper limit is further increased, the lower limit is lowered, and the floating range is further relaxed. Taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity as an example, the published fare for second-class seats from Nanjing Station to Shanghai Station is 166 yuan, which is the highest fare after adjustment, an increase of 19% from the pre-adjusted fare of 139.5 yuan; the lowest fare is 110 yuan. The fare dropped by 21% from the 139.5 yuan before adjustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to raising and floating the fare caps on some popular lines, the railway department has also launched discount tickets. China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group announced that &quot;in order to facilitate intercity passengers&#39; business travel and commuting travel&quot;, starting from June 20, 2023, the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Tanzhou Intercity Railway will officially launch regular tickets and time-counted tickets. Passengers can Take the S-shaped train running on the route at the designated departure station. Take the 60-time/30-day regular ticket from Chengdu East to Chongqing West priced at 5,852 yuan, which is equivalent to 97.5 yuan per time, which is close to the lowest operating fare for ordinary tickets, with a discount of up to 52%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general trend is that the pricing strategy of high-speed rail is in line with that of airplanes. Unless there is an emergency, as long as you buy a ticket some time in advance, you can basically buy a ticket, and even the price is very favorable. This is because the air ticket will be set at a high &quot;original price&quot;, which is much higher than the market equilibrium most of the time. The price does not go up, but only goes down, with discounts of 30% or 40% off, giving passengers a sense of gain. This is a pricing strategy that is purely market-oriented and accurately grasps the psychology of passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pricing strategy of high-speed trains is completely copied from that of air tickets. Starting from September 15th, high-speed trains will go on sale during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays. When purchasing tickets, many people found that compared with normal times, some high-speed trains and trains and trains increased significantly during the National Day holiday. A passenger posted on social media that a dormitory ticket from Beijing to Shenzhen only costs 1,150 yuan on weekdays, but on September 28 the upper berth price increased to 1,860 yuan and the lower berth price increased to 2,090 yuan. On the same day, the lowest direct fare from Beijing to Shenzhen is 1,100 yuan (excluding tax). On the official website, the published fare for Beijing to Shenzhen is 2,264 yuan, with discounts of 1,860 yuan and 2,090 yuan, approximately 12% off and 92% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, floating fares are not yet implemented on all lines. If you cannot get tickets during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, it only means that the fares are still low relative to demand. For this line Either fixed fares are still being implemented, or floating fares are not in place. This is the explanation from economics. And this means that the &quot;ticket-grabbing artifact&quot; still has room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essence of &quot;ticket grabbing artifacts&quot; is digital scalpers. When the official price of a commodity is significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, the price difference is &quot;unowned income&quot;, and many people are motivated to compete for this. In terms of income, scalpers are one of them. Those who are diligent and queue up early to earn hard money, and those who have the skills to get insider tickets will share the income with insiders. Digital scalpers are also scalpers, but if a third-party platform claims to have &quot;priority to purchase tickets&quot;, it is a lie. If you buy an acceleration package, they will help you buy tickets at 12306. In this sense, clarification from the railways is necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, using algorithms and apps to grab tickets is definitely faster than hand speed. This is the market niche of the “ticket grabbing artifact”. The railway department&#39;s clarification cannot persuade passengers who are eager to return home and are eager to get tickets. Of course, 12306 can ban certain IPs or even the App itself that frequently brushes tickets, but it is also difficult to completely exclude machine ticket purchases, leaving only hand ticket purchases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, &quot;As long as there is room for profit, technology will continue to evolve.&quot; Therefore, the fundamental solution is to further marketize fares so that passengers’ bids reflect their demand intensity as much as possible. In this way, people who really want to go somewhere can always go there if they can&#39;t wait for a whole day. Those who don&#39;t mind delaying for a day or two can also save a lot of money and get what they want; the high-speed rail can also make more money to pay for the operating costs of the high-speed rail. , cost and even bank principal and interest, digital scalpers naturally have no room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[汪顺破纪录夺金：看看这个成绩，还行吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 18:57:22&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/QlfWjfuC6wKHukCvJfShO65Zew6GziVEFjCHXCWb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QlfWjfuC6wKHukCvJfShO65Zew6GziVEFjCHX CWb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun in the competition &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;1:54.62&quot;, Wang Shun is far ahead in the swimming pool, followed by continuous Cheering and cheering, the big screen gave a more accurate record.

At the World Swimming Championships two months ago, Wang Shun failed to enter the finals in any of the three competitions he signed up for, leaving him far behind his peak form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, in the preliminaries of the Asian Games, Wang Shunyou clocked 1:58.84, which was still far behind his 11th place finish at the World Championships (1:57.97). Teammate Qin Haiyang ranked first 0.12 seconds ahead of Wang Shun and advanced to the finals that night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final final, Wang Shun led the way and won the gold medal, and at the same time broke the Asian record (1 minute 55 seconds 00) held by him, which was previously set by him at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s like I (can) swim,&quot; Wang Shun and the story of this blue swimming pool began in the summer when he was 5 years old. He followed his father to the swimming pool for the first time. When he saw his father jumping into the pool, he jumped in immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The body sank and he was scrambling to grab something. Wang Shun quickly choked on the water, but he didn’t feel scared. “I didn’t feel like I was choking on the water and wanted to stay away from it. Instead, I wanted to To conquer it. Perhaps, I have a natural affinity for water. In the water, I feel unprecedented happiness and relaxation, and I feel like a fish in the water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun&#39;s past achievements are indeed marked by the feeling of being like a fish in the water. : Born in Ningbo, Zhejiang in 1994. In 2007, he was selected by coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the first team of Zhejiang Province. In 2009, he followed coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the second team of the Chinese swimming team. In the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, he became the runner-up in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley; in 2016 In 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley at the FINA Short Course Swimming World Championships and won China&#39;s first world championship in men&#39;s medley; on July 30, 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley championship at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in water, it’s not always possible to go downstream. After winning the Tokyo Olympics, Wang Shun lost his goal and felt that he could no longer get happiness from swimming. Raising the national flag and playing the national anthem at the Olympic Games has been Wang Shun&#39;s ultimate goal in his sports career of more than 20 years. He has long said, &quot;Athletes must have clear goals.&quot; From national champion to world champion, and then to Olympic champion, he has improved his competitive performance step by step. &quot;I always encourage myself to achieve good results.&quot; It&#39;s hard won, it&#39;s all step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252116&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, Chinese player Wang Shun (right) shook hands with teammate Qin Haiyang after the game&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the cheers, there was confusion without a goal. Looking back at the glorious moments in the past, Wang Shun said: &quot;Olympic championship has always been the ultimate goal pursued by all athletes. Before winning the Olympic championship, it took me more than 20 years to establish this goal and work unswervingly towards it. Let&#39;s go. After winning the championship, I found that the goal had dissipated and all the sources of motivation would disappear. I had to set new goals again, which was more difficult. I spent a year to re-establish the goals and then go Hit the peak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 2023, World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. Wang Shun feels that he has regained his motivation, hoping to forget the halo of the Olympic champion, continue to surpass himself, and fill the last gap in his gold medal Grand Slam (Olympic Games, Asian Games, Short Course World Championships and Long Pond World Championships) - Long Pond World Championships Tournament champion. However, Wang Shun ranked 16th in the men&#39;s 200-meter medley preliminaries of this competition and was almost eliminated; he ranked 11th in the semi-finals and missed the finals. In the 400-meter medley, he was disqualified due to a foul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Wang Shun okay? Such questions come from the outside world and from his heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval from the Fukuoka World Championships to the Hangzhou Asian Games was less than two months, and Wang Shun has been adjusting his condition. He is 29 years old this year and this is his fourth time participating in the Asian Games. At the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun was still a newcomer. It was the first time he stood on the stage of the Asian Games and competed in the same swimming pool with his Asian opponents. Looking back today, he is &quot;still full of enthusiasm.&quot; But Wang Shun is no longer just a passionate novice. He has reached his peak, experienced ups and downs over a long period of time, and finally chose to jump into the swimming pool again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;619&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252115&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming competition held at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Natatorium in Zhejiang Province, Chinese player Wang Shun won 1 point Winning the championship with a time of 54.62 seconds &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;He has to look at it carefully&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun was still a child when he first faced the choice of swimming pool.

It was instinctive and risky, so he chose the swimming pool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Swimming has always given me a sense of progress.” As an adult, Wang Shun explained his choice this way. When time passed long enough, he experienced and felt more and more the other side of swimming: boring, repetitive, and self-confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swim in the 50-meter-long, 25-meter-wide swimming pool with 8 lanes, and take the trouble to go back and forth between the starting point and the end point again and again.

The only thing you can hear is the water sliding towards you, and the sound flowing through your ears is the most intimate thing for me. partners.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun once accidentally said in an interview that for 7 months in 2022, he would train at the base, just like building blocks. Every day he would start with basic training and train in one class. The class swims 13,000-16,000 meters, and sometimes there are two or three training classes in a row, including reaching the edge, turning around, rolling, and returning, and a complete set of water movements are repeated in a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His hands looked thin, with sharp knuckles, but rough calluses formed on the palms. During the first two years of training, the skin on his hands would wrinkle from being soaked in water for too long. Over time, the body gradually adapts, and &quot;the apparent reaction is basically gone.&quot; Long-term, fixed training also changed his daily routine. &quot;When I was on vacation, I was fine one day, but if I didn&#39;t go to the swimming pool the next day, I would feel uncomfortable all over. As long as I get to the swimming pool, I will feel very comfortable. Now I have such an emotion towards water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In addition to physical training, facing one&#39;s own heart is also a required course in this track. At the 2019 World Championships, Wang Shun was very eager to win a gold medal, but he did not even perform at his normal level. At the Military World Games three months later, Wang Shun&#39;s desire remained unabated, &quot;I must prove myself.&quot; He desperately increased the difficulty of training, but as a result, his lungs ruptured and he developed a pneumothorax due to excessive training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treatment plan given by the doctor at that time was to inhale oxygen for one hour a day, but he hoped to recover as soon as possible and bring glory to the country, so he started to inhale oxygen for two hours a day. Even so, the doctor still recommended that he give up the game and rest for a week. He refused. After lying in bed for five days, he returned to the training ground and tried his best in the next day&#39;s game to win the championship. Now when he recalls the situation at that time, he still feels sad: &quot;There are many things that you may not be able to see. To me, it&#39;s like risking your life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;774&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 23, 2023 , the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, torchbearer Wang Shun and digital torchbearers jointly lit the main torch &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that The peak moment is the Tokyo Olympics. On the day he won the championship, Wang Shun wrote on Weibo: &quot;Although my name is Shun, it is actually not smooth. Today I want to say to my coach that I have fulfilled our agreement! Winning the championship is not the end. Walking off the podium, Everything starts from scratch, see you in Paris...&quot; From the bronze medal in Rio to the gold medal in Tokyo, Wang Shun described the feeling as &quot;indescribable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I want to look at it carefully,” Wang Shun said. The gold medal is very heavy, which is a recognition of himself for so many years. It, what I am for - it is for it that I keep fighting. I feel that it is much heavier than I imagined. Although everyone only sees a gold medal, my life is included in it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;After the peak, he experienced a trough, and at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun once again proved himself with a fuller mentality. In an interview after the game, when asked if it exceeded expectations, Wang Shun said, &quot;It exceeded expectations. It was expected to be within 56 seconds, but I didn&#39;t expect that it would break the Asian record today.&quot; A reporter joked, &quot;Did the ignition yesterday give you strength?&quot; &quot; Wang Shun replied: It was the elders in my hometown who gave me strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just the night before winning the championship, on September 23, at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun and the &quot;Digital Human Torchbearers&quot; lit the main torch of the Asian Games together. As the last torch bearer, he Become a live witness of a classic scene in Asian Games history. The arena also witnessed the ups and downs of Wang Shun&#39;s swimming career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on this long journey, what is the greatest satisfaction as an athlete?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun once answered in an interview, &quot;After you try your best, you improve by 0.1 (second) Or the happiness that 0.01 seconds brings to you, this is the greatest sense of satisfaction I can create. This sense of satisfaction is not coherent, no one can keep improving, the feeling is intermittent, some are good and some are bad, just like Just like an electrocardiogram, there are ups and downs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He likes the small moments on the field, &quot;When you look back at the results on the big screen, you realize that your best time has improved by 0.1 (second) , 0.2 (seconds) or 0.01 (seconds), 0.02 seconds, at that moment, you will feel that the training during this period of time has not been in vain. 0.1 seconds may have challenged your own limits, and also challenged the limits of human beings.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the pre-match interview of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the reporter asked: What does swimming mean to you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun replied: &quot;I loved swimming when I was a child, but now it is more of a responsibility. The Olympic championship is just a new starting point. I have to work harder for Chinese swimming.

Recently, many Internet celebrities in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province have been jailed for false advertising and selling fake goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the days after the shock, the aftermath still affected the live broadcast rooms of some Liangshan anchors. People question, who are the locals? What are the local products? Which are the true stories? What is script arrangement? Since the rise of short video platforms, users have curiously turned their perspectives to the countryside and no longer have to imagine life in a different place in their minds. Through the lens of local people, people saw the scenery and culture, and also ate fruits and vegetables sent from the local area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the relevant departments of Liangshan Prefecture launched a special campaign to &quot;clarify and strictly rectify the &#39;self-media&#39; chaos&quot; and disclosed &quot;miserable auctions&quot;, &quot;false aid to farmers&quot;, &quot;fake charity&quot;, etc. Violations of laws and regulations; 54 suspects were arrested, including 11 Internet celebrity anchors involved, 5 MCN institutions were destroyed, and 14 companies involved were seized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the most attention-grabbing ones are that accounts with more than 2 million followers including &quot;Xiao Yu&quot;, &quot;Zhao Ling&#39;er&quot;, &quot;Liangshan Qubu&quot; and &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; have been permanently suspended.

(MCN organization), came to Liangshan and found individual industrial and commercial households Zhao (female, Han nationality, 27 years old), Ari (male, Yi, 23 years old) and other &quot;Internet celebrity seedlings&quot; &quot; and began to incubate carefully. In less than a year, the number of followers of the two accounts &quot;Zhao Ling&#39;er&quot; and &quot;Liangshan Qubu&quot; has exceeded 2 million, and they have brought goods to cash.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of some fans, Qu Bu was deceived. A Sannong video blogger named &quot;Wang Ershuai&quot; who is familiar with these Daliangshan Internet celebrities explained in a live broadcast on the evening of September 22, &quot;I just said that I was bribed with money.&quot; &quot;Everything they did was negotiated.&quot; He gave an example. After selling for 10 million, the company received 3 million, but the boss took away the majority, and Qu Bu got 500,000 to 600,000. Zhao Ling&#39;er was a little higher than Qu Bu. , &quot;You are an amateur. You are nothing. You used to tighten screws in a factory. Will you do anything if I am given such a platform?&quot; You can’t make so much money by tightening screws for a lifetime.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge, a agriculture video blogger who has been in the industry for many years, told Southern Weekend reporters that some agriculture bloggers around him would hire local actors to perform. This is A semi-public secret in the industry, &quot;It costs a few hundred yuan to hire an actor. Some actors are quite expensive and you can&#39;t even hire them for a few hundred yuan.&quot; (Because) If you call any farmer or ordinary person, it will be obvious in front of the camera. Many people have camera phobia. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge said that some professional actors cost about one or two thousand yuan to shoot one or two jokes, but there are more “temporary hires”. These jokes are similar: meeting local farmers and having kind conversations, expressing He acted like he was helping others, and paired it with tragic music. &quot;As soon as the music started, everyone thought this anchor was awesome, really good. &quot;Using the same routine, bloggers started to tour the country, going to Hainan Island to sell pineapples, to Fujian to sell grapefruits, etc. Such live broadcast rooms have good data and high sales.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Internet celebrities from Daliang Mountain We were not satisfied with this, and implemented &quot;iterative upgrades&quot; based on the above-mentioned conventional routines.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2022, Zhao Ling&#39;er appeared for the first time as a young man who returned to his hometown to help farmers and start businesses. &quot;Qubu, a simple young man from the Yi ethnic group in Liangshan, began the story of Daliang Mountain. Zhao Ling&#39;er emphasized that he and Qubu met by chance. &quot;There is no team, let alone the capital and packaging of a big company as everyone talks about.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Just three months ago, Xiao Yu, a &quot;philanthropic blogger&quot; who claimed to be shooting in Daliang Mountain, also &quot;stumbled into the depths of lotus flowers&quot; and met the simple and hard-working &quot;Four Girls of Liangshan&quot;. Compare several Internet celebrities There are many similarities in the scenes, filming and scripts. Both are about encountering a single ethnic minority young man by chance, going to a stranger&#39;s house for dinner, killing a chicken to entertain him, taking out the bacon, and talking about the poor family situation during the meal. Established a deep friendship and created a relationship of assistance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, &quot;Little Zhongxing China&quot; also posted a video in October 2022, meeting &quot;Shiyi&quot;, a Yi girl from Daliang Mountain . It is reported that, like Zhao Ling&#39;er and Qu Bu, Eleven also signed a contract with this MCN organization in Chengdu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, Xiaoyu published an oral story in the self-media &quot;Interview with Real People&quot; . He claimed to be from Shangqiu, Henan Province. He started engaging in e-commerce in 2018 and earned 1 million yuan in one year. He was initially inspired by the story of the &quot;Cliff Village&quot; in Daliang Mountain. After going there, he found that the rattan ladders had turned into steel bars. Ladder.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in a series of videos he later planned, the local uninhabited production houses and dilapidated buildings in Gumo Village, Tebulo Township, Zhaojue County became theirs. Filming and live broadcast site. Local villager Hai Laihaqu said in an interview, &quot;One day the lights suddenly came on in the old house that no one could live in, and I later found out that they were filming videos and live broadcasts there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;When Xiaoyu was delivering supplies in Daliang Mountain, a local photographer asked to take pictures. &quot;What surprised me was that I only spent seven or eight thousand yuan on the last batch of supplies, but netizens gave rewards or gifts for the total amount About ten to twenty thousand. &quot;Xiaoyu has since tasted the sweetness and plunged into Daliang Mountain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 22, 2022, Chengdu Xiaoyu Zhunong Media Co., Ltd. was established. A month later, Zhao Ling&#39;er&#39;s account released an encounter with Qubu video. Qubu is similar to Ding Zhen, who became popular in 2020. They are both from remote villages, with dark skin, handsome face and innocent smile. He is considered to have the potential of an internet celebrity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Ershuai remembered that when he first came to Daliang Mountain, Xiao Yu told him that if he wanted to truly understand the people in the mountains, he had to eat and live here. Make friends with them for a little money.&quot; According to media reports, Xiaoyu&#39;s team did not communicate much with local villagers in Daliang Mountain, but when they needed villagers to appear on camera, they would give them some money. They rented several local houses and They grow corn on the land and cook on the mountain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter asked Wang Ershuai in the live broadcast room how to tell the authenticity of Internet celebrities. Wang Ershuai replied: &quot;You can tell the difference clearly after watching it too much.&quot; Come on... you can analyze it yourself. I can tell you about the things that have been revealed now. I will not talk about the things that have not been revealed. After all, people still rely on this thing to make a living and make money. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QgOxEPgrynEebvrA1wH3Ncg4n5GaWwYF4MRzSaUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QgOxEPgrynEebvrA1wH3Ncg4n5GaWwYF4MRzSaUQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252099&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;With the support of short video platforms for content that helps farmers, Daliang Mountain has become a traffic hotspot.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The track selected by traffic&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xiaoyu is not the earliest Daliangshan Internet celebrity. The Liangshan Public Security Bureau discovered that since 2020 , Tang Mou, the head of Chengdu Aowei Culture Media Co., Ltd. (MCN Organization), used scripts, staged shots, etc. to incubate &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; (Axi Moumou, female) with more than three million fans on the short video platform. Yi nationality, 21 years old), and &quot;Liangshan Aze&quot; (A&#39;s certain, male, Yi nationality, 21 years old).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a previous report by &quot;China News Weekly&quot;, some fans went there out of sympathy in 2019 Jiqu Village, Bier Town, Zhaojue County, where &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; is located, discovered that the place where Mengyang often shoots videos is actually a place where local farmers raise cattle and sheep, and Mengyang&#39;s family background is not bad, and he is considered wealthy in the village . Meng Yang dropped out of school early and worked in Guangdong. Villagers believe that Meng Yang’s fortune is inseparable from “meeting a good boss.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police stated that the above-mentioned illegal and criminal acts are well-organized and confusing. The case is strong and involves a wide range of areas, forming a gray industrial chain of counterfeiting and selling in recent years, including front-end creation of characters, incubation of Internet celebrities, mid-end script shooting, e-commerce operations, end-end supply of agricultural products, and traffic realization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Why are these MCN institutions so keen on &quot;mining gold&quot; in Daliang Mountain?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin, a senior practitioner of agricultural products e-commerce, analyzed that Daliang Mountain is a natural reservoir of products and traffic. First of all, Daliang Mountain&#39;s The products have become popular among Internet celebrities; secondly, the topic of Daliang Mountain caters to traffic, “Daliang Mountain has ethnic minorities, beautiful scenery, and rich cultural heritage. People are rare for these few things, which solves the biggest traffic problem. &quot; Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The economic development of Daliang Mountain is relatively slower than that of coastal areas, and with the attribute of helping farmers, this matter will develop more logically. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Daliang Mountain, but also Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, places with “products, scenery, people, and culture” are sought after.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge believes: &quot;It&#39;s more credible to shoot there. There must be a choice. Why doesn&#39;t anyone choose to go to Zhejiang to help farmers? &quot;According to his many years of experience in carrying goods in the countryside, many short video bloggers like Meng Yang are suspected of exaggerating the misery of the countryside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A farmer practitioner from a mountainous area in the north told Southern Weekend reporter, people always have a prejudice against mountainous areas. In fact, including the business environment, some local things may be better than those in developed cities, but these have no attention and traffic. &quot;There is no electricity in mountainous areas in xx&quot;, this topic is With traffic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supporting farmers has become the focus of short video platforms. On September 12, the first &quot;Kuaishou Light Chasing Conference&quot; announced the launch of Kuaishou Village Broadcasting &quot;Stars Project&quot;, which will be launched in the next three years. Invest 10 billion traffic and 50 million cash to cultivate 1 million village broadcasters and 1,000 rural entrepreneurs, and provide talents to 160 key national assistance counties. On September 21, Douyin E-commerce released the &quot;2023 Harvest Festival Douyin E-commerce&quot; &quot;Agricultural Assistance Data Report&quot;, the number of short videos of trailers selling agricultural products on Douyin e-commerce is 21.86 million, and the total time of explaining agricultural products in the live broadcast room is 37.78 million hours. Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, Anhui and Sichuan have become the agricultural products on the platform. Businesses originate from the top five provinces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police released the script of the MCN agency’s agriculture and rural areas video, which includes “collecting mountain goods”. For example, Shiyi and her cousin went to local villagers with scales, bags, backpacks, etc. Collect mountain goods at home.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of rural areas and farmers caters to the traffic algorithm of short video platforms in disguise. Nie Wenchang, chairman of an e-commerce group in Shandong, established one of the first live broadcast bases in Linyi. He told Southern Weekend reporters Analysis, &quot;The popularity will be high after the script is written. It is done according to some rules of the platform to boost the popularity. &quot; He said that the theme of rural life has broad resonance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin believes that the reason why these videos are popular is that they trigger the platform&#39;s mechanism, &quot;data feedback, not human feedback.&quot; Data indicators determine this If it is a &quot;good&quot; video, more traffic will be injected. Judging from the logic of the platform, the speed of fans accumulation of Daliangshan Internet celebrities is normal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters that these scripts There is a lack of normal life logic, and the routines are not new, but short videos are often driven by emotions and do not need to think about logic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Daliangshan internet celebrity incident, Southern Weekend reporters called several farmers-helping culture The phone calls of media companies may not be connected, or they may remain silent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It looks like helping farmers, but it is actually selling goods&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Using false personas to attract people After becoming fans, the above-mentioned companies will open online stores and live broadcast to sell goods. Under the banners of &quot;helping farmers&quot; and &quot;high-quality original ecology&quot;, they purchase honey, walnuts and other agricultural and sideline products at low prices from foreign food companies, and pass them off as &quot;Daliangshan specialty agricultural products&quot; Trademarks were passed off as inferior and fake as genuine and sold across the country. According to the police, the company where &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; works also hired Internet trolls to create the illusion of popular products and orders in the live broadcast room, inducing consumers to buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Yang once shouted excitedly in the live broadcast room, &quot;You gave me the money for gifts, and you bought walnuts, which is equivalent to supporting many uncles, aunts and ordinary people here, you know? &quot;In fact, only a very small amount of the agricultural products brought by the above-mentioned companies come from the local area, and most of them are purchased from other places at low prices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge does not agree with this way of helping farmers. He has been selling it for several years Agricultural products, he has always called himself a &quot;dealer&quot;. &quot;Most people easily believe it when they tell us how pitiful we are in front of the camera and use other people&#39;s kindness to make money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Shengfan&#39;s analysis, false personas, fictitious origins, etc. The situation has constituted the category of false advertising, and once false advertising is involved, the anchor and the MCN organization where he works may be required to bear three different legal liabilities: criminal, civil, and administrative if there is any conscious intention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Even if the products are indeed from the place of origin, selling them by fabricating stories and creating personas may be illegal. Feng Shengfan told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Although the origin of the products is real, consumers are based on the stories and characters made up by the anchors. Assuming that only those who are willing to place an order have sympathy for helping farmers. Therefore, the anchor’s fabrication of stories and creation of characters also constitutes a misleading way of fabricating, fabricating, and distorting facts in false propaganda. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Odikebu, the village secretary of Gumo Village, said, “Our Gumo Village is such a small place and we don’t get so much honey. He is a liar and has not helped. Don&#39;t recognize him! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant people from Xinxuan Group, a live broadcast e-commerce company, told Southern Weekend reporters that some places have problems with unsalable agricultural products and have fewer distribution channels. The public welfare agricultural assistance project aims to help local areas open up sales and drive employment, Help revitalize. Compared with other categories, agricultural products are more prone to problems, have low profit margins, and require a large investment of manpower and resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with leading companies, the quality of local supply chains is uneven. Wang Huilin introduced that a common model in the industry is that the Internet celebrity company finds a suitable local supply chain, negotiates cooperation, and establishes links through short video platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Southern Weekend reporters, Internet celebrities live broadcast to draw goods The commission for agricultural products is generally about 20%, and the commission for higher products can be as high as 30%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the products carried by Daliangshan Internet celebrities come from the supply chain of Pujiang County, Chengdu. Wang Huilin reminded that this It does not mean that the goods of these supply chain companies do not come from Daliang Mountain. Perhaps to save logistics costs, &quot;Hami melons in Xinjiang may be shipped from Xi&#39;an.&quot; According to Liangshan Prefecture Police, the Liangshan Internet celebrity who was imprisoned chose The supply chain does not actually get goods from Daliangshan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another common model is for supply chain companies to cultivate and discover Internet celebrities. &quot;China News Weekly&quot; revealed that many Liangshan Internet celebrities He once cooperated with supply chain supplier Ren Yanbing to sell his products. Southern Weekend reporters contacted Ren Yanbing as a collaborator. He said, &quot;This business is not easy to do, and I am ready to change my career.&quot; This supplier was not affected by the Liangshan Internet celebrity. The impact of the incident.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nie Wenchang said that compared with other categories, agricultural products are special. The quality of agricultural products in the hands of farmers varies, and even if consumers get agricultural products from other places, it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity from the fake.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the illegal behavior of some Internet celebrities has had a negative impact on Daliangshan specialties. Faced with doubts, some sellers have to make special explanations. A store that specializes in selling pure oatmeal flour from Daliangshan farmers has its business qualifications But it was shown in Panlong District, Kunming City, Yunnan Province. The anchor explained that the store was opened by fans, but the shipping address was his home. Another store claiming to sell ugly apples from Daliang Mountain in Sichuan has its business address in Haikou City, Hainan Province.

Those who wantonly publish abuses and insults against individuals on the Internet Cyber ​​violence that spreads rumors, defamation, invades privacy and other information must be subject to due legal sanctions. On September 25, the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held a press conference to officially release the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Punishing Internet Violence and Crime According to the Law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; have a total of 20 articles, mainly covering ten aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, clarify the applicable rules for the crime of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; provide guidance on the nature of online violence in accordance with the criminal law and relevant judicial interpretations. Specifically, those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others on the information network, if the circumstances are serious, will be convicted and punished for the crimes of insult and slander; organize &quot;human flesh searches&quot; to illegally collect and release citizens&#39; personal information to an unspecified majority of people, and the circumstances are In serious cases, they will be convicted and punished for the crime of infringing on citizens&#39; personal information. In addition, the crime of illegal use of information network can be applied to malicious marketing and hype behaviors carried out through cyber violence incidents; the crime of refusing to perform information network security management obligations can be applied to the behavior of failing to perform information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to clarify the rules for handling illegal online violence. For online violence, we should adhere to multi-dimensional and joint governance and improve the connection mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that the implementation of online insults, slander and other online violence does not constitute a crime. If it complies with the provisions of the Public Security Management Punishment Law and other provisions, administrative penalties will be imposed in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to clarify the policy principles for punishing cyber violence crimes. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that the spirit of severe punishment for cyber violence crimes should be reflected so that the people can fully feel fairness and justice. Adhere to strict law enforcement and justice, strictly investigate cyber violence crimes in accordance with the law, and effectively correct the erroneous tendency of &quot;the law does not punish the public&quot;. We must focus on cracking down on malicious initiators, organizers, malicious promoters, and those who persist in reforming despite repeated abuses. The &quot;Opinions&quot; also stipulate that there are those who commit cyber violence against minors and disabled people, organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to commit cyber violence, fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics to infringe on the human dignity of others, and use &quot;deep synthesis&quot; and other generative methods If artificial intelligence technology releases illegal information, or if network service providers initiate or organize cyber violence, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is to clarify the boundaries between illegal crimes and legal behaviors of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that reporting or exposing other people&#39;s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks should not be considered a defamation crime as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly spread the facts to be fabricated. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth is to clarify the work requirements for public security organs to assist in evidence collection. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, in cases where the victim files a private prosecution for online insult or defamation, if the people&#39;s court determines after review that it is indeed difficult for the victim to provide evidence, it may request the public security organs to provide assistance. The &quot;Opinions&quot; reiterate the provisions of the Criminal Law, and also clarify that the public security organs should promptly identify the perpetrators of online insults and slander according to the requirements of the People&#39;s Court and the specific circumstances of the case, and collect evidence and materials such as the spread and spread of relevant information and the impact caused. Network service providers shall provide necessary technical support and assistance for public security organs to obtain evidence in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth is to clarify the public prosecution standards for criminal cases of online insult and defamation. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, those who commit crimes of insult or slander and seriously endanger social order and national interests shall be prosecuted in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that in cases of online insult and defamation, public prosecution procedures will apply if one of the following circumstances occurs: (1) causing serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives, and causing a bad impact on society; (2) arbitrarily using The general public is the target of infringement, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously disrupting the order of the Internet, and having a bad impact on society; (3) Insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times, causing social harm Those with a bad impact; (4) Organizing and instigating people to spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms, with a bad impact on society; (5) Other situations that seriously endanger social order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seventh is to clarify the transition process from private prosecution to public prosecution in criminal cases of online insult and defamation. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that for online insults and slander that seriously endanger social order, the public security organs have filed a case as a public prosecution case, and the victim simultaneously files a private prosecution in the People&#39;s Court, the People&#39;s Court may request the private prosecutor to withdraw the private prosecution or rule not to accept it; it has been accepted If the case is found, a ruling should be made to terminate the trial and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. The original private prosecutor can participate in the lawsuit as a victim. The victim files a private prosecution before the public security organ files a case. If, upon review, the people&#39;s court determines that the relevant online insults and defamation seriously endanger social order, the case shall be transferred to the public security organ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighth, support civil rights protection against online violence in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if cyber violence is committed against others and infringes on others&#39; reputation rights, privacy rights and other personality rights, and the victim requests the perpetrator to bear civil liability, the people&#39;s court will support it in accordance with the law. If the right holder has evidence to prove that the perpetrator is committing or is about to commit an illegal act that infringes upon his or her personality rights, and failure to stop it in time will cause irreparable damage to his or her legitimate rights and interests, the People&#39;s Court may, upon the right holder&#39;s application, issue an injunction against infringement of personality rights in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ninth is to clarify the rules for public interest litigation in cases of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if online violence harms public interests, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. If a network service provider fails to perform its information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information, resulting in the large-scale dissemination of illegal information or other serious circumstances that harm the public interest, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. When handling public interest litigation cases in the field of cyber violence control, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may require network service providers to provide necessary technical support and assistance in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tenth is to proactively perform duties and promote comprehensive management of cyber violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that when handling cases of cyber violence, information on the progress of the case should be released to the public in a timely manner in accordance with the law, clarify the truth, and eliminate the adverse effects of cyber violence, so as to reduce the harm to the victims and help the victims get out of their predicaments; carry out legal publicity and give full play to law enforcement The role of rule guidance, value orientation and behavioral norms in handling cases is to educate and guide netizens to consciously abide by the law and lead social civilization; to conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes that promote the occurrence of online violence, promote multi-dimensional co-governance of online violence, and fundamentally reduce online violence occurrence, creating a clear cyberspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一文止步八强，新旧交替的女子重剑队亟待历练]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257567]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEzLcs4MrEYLK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEz Lcs4MrEYLK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251880&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, women&#39;s individual epee four in the fencing event of the Hangzhou Asian Games In the quarter-finals, Chinese player Sun Yiwen (right) lost to South Korean player Song Shiluo 12-14 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;12 to 14, on September 24, the first official competition day of the Hangzhou Asian Games, in the quarter-finals of the women’s individual epee fencing event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese player Sun Yiwen lost to South Korean player Song Se-ra and stopped in the quarterfinals. So far, all Chinese players in this project have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yiwen’s third Asian Games trip. She and her teammates won the women&#39;s epee team championship twice before. At the last Asian Games in Jakarta, Sun Yiwen also reached the finals of individual events, but ultimately lost to South Korean star Kang Young-mi and won a silver medal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This sport pays great attention to variety, balance, game and precision.” A game lasts up to 9 minutes. If you hit at the same time, you must be 1/25 second earlier than the opponent to score. A blink of an eye is 0.75 seconds, which is enough to turn the tide or give up victory. To do this, fencers need to &quot;count one step at a time.&quot; Excellent fencers are often in a &quot;man-sword-in-one&quot; state, that is, under various circumstances, they can hit the opponent&#39;s exposed effective parts (including the torso, legs, feet, hands, arms, and helmets) at the fastest speed and the shortest route. . Behind the &quot;subconscious&quot; sword thrusts again and again is the muscle memory cultivated over many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tokyo Olympic champion Sun Yiwen is the number one Chinese women&#39;s epee player. He has always been good at &quot;stopping with stillness and attacking later.&quot; &quot;Determined, calm, and explosive&quot; is how she sums up her playing style. However, after winning the Tokyo Olympics and Xi&#39;an Games, Sun Yiwen has been trapped by injuries and will not resume training until October 2022 and systematically participate in events. To &quot;find the feeling of starting over&quot;, the road is rough. Sun Yiwen once lamented that he &quot;can&#39;t even play games anymore&quot; and was &quot;very unfamiliar.&quot; It was not until the International Fencing Federation World Cup Barcelona in February 2023 that he gradually regained his form and won two bronze medals in a row, both individual and team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 24, 2021, Sun Yiwen (right) celebrated with his coach after winning the women&#39;s individual epee final in fencing at the Tokyo Olympics&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous interviews with the media, Sun Yiwen once said that winning a gold medal is not necessary for this comeback. After reviewing the schedule performance of the last Olympic Games, she and the coaching staff found that although they won the gold medal, many problems and deficiencies were still exposed in the process. If they can be improved, the state will be better than before. &quot;There is a new coach in the team who has taught me many new ideas and moves. Now I dare to try new moves in the game and explore new areas. This is what makes me most interesting and what makes me happy.&quot; The reason why I decided to stick to another Olympic cycle is that I am still learning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, the Chinese fencing team is facing a transitional period of replacement of old and new players and adjustment of the coaching team. Three-quarters of the athletes participating in the Asian Games have never competed in the Tokyo Olympics. The Hangzhou Asian Games is regarded as an important training opportunity for this young team to prepare for the Paris Olympics. According to the competition plan, the fencing competition of the Hangzhou Asian Games will be held from September 24th to 29th, with a total of 12 gold medals produced. On September 27, Sun Yiwen will also lead his young teammates to continue their pursuit of medals in the women&#39;s epee team competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Zhang Xin, Secretary-General of the Chinese Sports Delegation at the Hangzhou Asian Games and Director of the Competitive Sports Department of the State Sports General Administration, said, the Hangzhou Asian Games is the &quot;high school entrance examination&quot; before the Paris Olympics. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Sun Yiwen will usher in her third Olympic trip in Paris, and before that, she and the young Chinese fencing team still need to overcome many obstacles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 20, 2023, in the 2023 Asian Fencing Championships Women’s Epee Team Third Place Competition held in Wuxi, Jiangsu, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team and won the bronze medal. Chinese team players Tang Junyao (first from left), Lin Sheng (second from left), Zhu Mingye (third from left) and Sun Yiwen took a group photo after the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Behind the &quot;Duel of Swords&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen never considered himself a &quot;talented player&quot;. She attributes her gains in her career to her seriousness and stubbornness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen was born in Wanggezhuang Village, Qixia City, Yantai, Shandong Province in 1992. When she was young, her health was very poor and she would catch a cold every winter. Sun Yiwen&#39;s father, Sun Hongming, is a local village doctor. Under his father&#39;s supervision and company, she has developed the habit of running and exercising since she was a child. Long-term persistence pays off. In elementary school, Sun Yiwen had become the school&#39;s top sports student. When he was 11 years old, Sun Yiwen was selected by the Qixia Sports and Competition School to focus on middle and long-distance running. Two years later, she had grown to 1.66 meters, and her best standing long jump score was over 2.5 meters. Because of her tallness, long wingspan, strong instantaneous explosive power, and being left-handed, she was spotted by Xu Zhaowei, the then head coach of the Yantai City Fencing Team, and officially embarked on the road of fencing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fencing is a project that requires very comprehensive abilities. &quot;Strength, speed, explosive power, endurance, coordination, flexibility, and thinking&quot;, none of them can be missing. The initial training was hard and boring. Morning training starts at 5:30 in the morning. Basic steps and movements last for several hours. In order to develop their endurance shortcomings, the team members also need to receive additional running training. From Monday to Friday, I run 3,000 meters in the morning and evening, and there is also a 6-kilometer cross-country race on the weekends. If you fail to complete the task within the stipulated time, you will be fined. The longer it takes, the greater the fine. After the high-intensity training during the day, there are cultural classes in the evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a week, Sun Yiwen wanted to give up. In order to comfort and encourage his daughter, Sun Hongming rushed to Yantai from his hometown and stayed with his daughter for two days. After the initial adaptation period, Sun Yiwen, who is physically fit and good at thinking, began to gradually emerge. &quot;Every time I practice an action and I can&#39;t do it, I will carefully review it and think about why. Every time I win or lose a game, I will dig deeper into the underlying logic.&quot; At the 2010 Shandong Provincial Games, the 18-year-old Sun Yiwen represented the Yantai Fencing Team and won 8 gold medals with his teammates. After the competition, she was successfully selected for the provincial fencing team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But life was not smooth. For a long time, because there was no establishment in the provincial team, Sun Yiwen had to pay for outings by himself. Sometimes a game would cost half a year&#39;s salary of my father. At that time, his younger brother was still studying at home, and Sun Hongming and his wife were living in a very tight situation in their hometown. Due to technical and tactical breakthroughs facing bottlenecks, Sun Yiwen was withdrawn from the provincial team twice. Worried that he would not be able to get ahead by practicing fencing, Sun Yiwen once proposed to his father that he should give up fencing and go out to work to support his family as soon as possible. The father knows his daughter&#39;s thoughts well. Just like when he was a child, Sun Hongming sought psychological relief on the one hand, and actively communicated with the coach on the other. In the end, no one gave up. Fortunately, under the advice of her coach, Sun Yiwen began to try to change the gun-handled sword to a straight-handled sword. After that, her hard training finally paid off. For a time, there was no female player in the province who could match her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Sun Yiwen was selected for the national fencing team. In the same year, at the age of 21, she made her debut in international competitions and won the women&#39;s epee World Cup Grand Prix team championship. Two years later, she won her first individual championship at the Italian Fencing World Cup. However, it was the 2021 Tokyo Olympics that really brought Sun Yiwen to the pinnacle of his career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Sun Yiwen, as a &quot;dark horse&quot;, won the individual bronze medal and team silver medal in women&#39;s epee. But with the end of the Rio Olympics, the national women&#39;s fencing team has also undergone earth-shaking changes. At that time, the head coach &quot;Bole&quot; Levavasseur, who had a profound influence on Sun Yiwen&#39;s thinking and technology, resigned, and the main players such as Xu Anqi and Sun Yujie retired. The burden of leading the new team suddenly fell on Sun Yiwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sun Yiwen&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Sun Yiwen was used to &quot; The &quot;second intention&quot; style of play is to first use fake moves to confuse the opponent, and then attack by surprise. However, the successor head coach Yuge Oberly is good at direct offensive tactics, which is exactly Sun Yiwen&#39;s shortcoming. During the running-in period, which lasted for about a year, Sun Yiwen&#39;s performance in competitions has been mediocre. She felt as if she had returned to the state when she had just joined the fencing team at the age of 15, and everything had to start from scratch. &quot;My thoughts and thoughts at that time were completely chaotic, like a ball of knotted hemp rope.&quot; She has experienced too many ups and downs. Sun Yiwen could only encourage himself silently, &quot;This state must be temporary. There will always be low points in life. It depends on how you overcome it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, due to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, Held in 2016, Sun Yiwen adjusted back to his form in time during the Olympic points competition. By blending the strengths of both sets of technical ideas, she developed a new combat style. In the summer of 2021, she won the gold medal in the Tokyo Olympics women&#39;s epee individual finals, defeating Romania&#39;s Popescu, who was ranked number one in the world at the time. The only regret was that in the subsequent team competition, Sun Yiwen was injured and had to be replaced. The Chinese women&#39;s epee team eventually failed to reach the top four of the team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, Sun Yiwen missed several major events in 2022 due to injuries. In an interview with the media in early 2022, she described her injuries this way, &quot;I now have a torn posterior cruciate ligament and water accumulation in my left leg, a knee cyst, a worn meniscus, and a long stretch from the back of my right leg to the knee. Injury. Even if I move a few times or when the weather is bad, my knee will still hurt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many other sports, few people can maintain absolute dominance in the field of fencing. force. In the past year, Sun Yiwen has been participating in the competition while sick due to the lumbosacral pressure on the nerves in her legs. She has been exploring how to coexist with the injury technically and psychologically. At the World Fencing Championships in Milan in July, Sun Yiwen won the bronze medal in the women&#39;s epee individual event. This was her first time winning an individual event medal at the World Championships. In a post-match interview, Sun Yiwen said that this bronze medal was a &quot;heart booster&quot; for her, letting her know that she &quot;can do it&quot; despite injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t care about winning or losing, but I have perseverance. I think I can do things that others can do. Injuries, difficulties and problems are in front of me, and I will never run away from them. I won&#39;t be afraid, I will definitely solve it. The higher you go, the more problems you will encounter.&quot; In Sun Yiwen&#39;s view, the most important lesson her 18-year fencing career has taught her is &quot;not to accept weakness. Don’t admit defeat.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;(Reference materials: &quot;Blog World&quot;, &quot;GQ Report&quot;, Chao News, Dazhong Yantai Channel, Forbes China, &quot;Wonderful OK&quot;, &quot;Qilu Evening News&quot;, China News Network, &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, Shangguan News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从北京、广州到杭州：33年3届亚运会见证中国经济社会发展与国民精神进化丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257571]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, the 19th Asian Games opened in Hangzhou. During the lighting ceremony, a giant &quot;digital man&quot; rushed from outside the venue and lit the main torch together with the real people present, bringing this technologically full opening ceremony to a climax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s not just about digital people igniting fires. This opening ceremony can be said to be the opening ceremony of a sports meeting with the strongest sense of technology to date. A &quot;net screen&quot; with a total length of 185 meters and a height of 20 meters hangs in the air, and a 6,000-square-meter ground screen on the ground turns the &quot;Big Lotus&quot; of the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium into a huge three-dimensional display screen. In addition, with the blessing of naked-eye 3D, AR and other digital technologies, the digital fireworks are dazzling, and the opening performance combines virtual and real scenes, giving it a full sense of the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the third time China has hosted the Asian Games in more than 30 years. The hosting of these three Asian Games also reflects the development process of China&#39;s economic society and national spiritual mentality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, the 11th Asian Games was held in Beijing. This was the first time that China hosted a large-scale international comprehensive sports event. It was also the early stage of China&#39;s reform and opening up. In 1983, China applied to host the Asian Games, hoping to show an image of openness to the outside world. Economically, China&#39;s development was just starting at that time. By 1990, when the Asian Games were held, the country&#39;s total GDP was only 1.89 trillion yuan, less than 360.9 billion U.S. dollars. Its per capita GDP ranked outside the 130th place in the world, and it was also the lowest in Asia. Not forward. At that time, even the preparations for the Asian Games lacked funds, so they had to launch a nationwide fundraising campaign. Tens of millions of people across the country participated and donated a total of 270 million yuan, more than one-tenth of the total investment in the Beijing Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time China hosted the Asian Games was the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games. In the past 20 years, especially at the beginning of the new century, China&#39;s accession to the WTO and integration into the global market have made China the world&#39;s factory, and its economy has developed by leaps and bounds. Although affected by the financial crisis in 2008, China&#39;s economy quickly resumed development. In 2010, China&#39;s total GDP exceeded 40 trillion yuan, equivalent to more than 6 trillion US dollars, surpassing Japan for the first time, ranking first in Asia and second in the world. The Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou. Guangzhou has been a commercial capital for thousands of years and the forefront of reform and opening up. The Pearl River Delta is also the most active region for China&#39;s export-oriented economy and one of China&#39;s most important manufacturing and foreign trade bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the Hangzhou Asian Games has been more than ten years since the Guangzhou Asian Games. Over the past ten years, China&#39;s economy has nearly tripled. More importantly, the scientific and technological content of China&#39;s economy has also been greatly improved, especially in the field of digital economy, which leads the world. Hangzhou is the home base of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The gorgeous digital people and digital fireworks at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games are a concentrated display of China&#39;s high-end digital technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the attention attracted by these three Asian Games is also different. I believe older friends will have a better understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the successful bid to the preparation and successful hosting of the Beijing Asian Games, it has attracted unprecedented attention from the whole country. I remember that televisions were not yet popular in China, especially in rural areas. Black and white TVs were rare, and color TVs were even rarer. In some villages, only the village committee had a color TV for villagers to watch. Farmers are busy with farm work during the day and have no time to watch the live broadcast of the Asian Games. At night, the color TV in the village committee is crowded with farmers watching the game. Of course, more news about the game was heard from the loudspeaker broadcast in the village the next morning. Every time there was news that the Chinese team had won, it would cause a burst of carnival. The emblem composed of the Great Wall pattern, the mascot panda Panpan, and the promotional song &quot;Asian Heroes&quot; have all become the memories of a generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony of the Guangzhou Asian Games was ingenious and brilliant. The &quot;Sail of White Clouds&quot; showed a grand atmosphere of openness and pioneering. However, in terms of attention, I am afraid it cannot compare with the national participation of the Beijing Asian Games. the hot state. I came to Guangzhou from Beijing to work in October 2010, just before the Guangzhou Asian Games. Just two years ago, China just hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. All the top events in the world have been held, and the psychological threshold of the Chinese people has naturally increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, mobile networks have become the main channel of communication. Everyone has a variety of short videos and news apps installed on their mobile phones. Even payment tools such as Alipay have video reports of the Asian Games. Information about the Asian Games can be received anytime and anywhere. In such a convenient communication environment, more than 100 million people participated in the Asian Games digital torch relay event. However, with the continuous evolution of lifestyles, we can no longer see the state where everyone sits in front of the TV. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change in attention to the Asian Games is also an inevitable result of the development of China&#39;s economic society and national mentality. At the time of the Beijing Asian Games, China&#39;s economy was still relatively backward. The Asian Games was an opportunity to unite the strength of the Chinese people and show their national pride. The vigorous publicity by the official media made the Beijing Asian Games known to everyone. As for the Guangzhou Asian Games and this time the Hangzhou Asian Games, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic level, there have been countless world-class sports events held in China. Ordinary people also have more channels to access more information, and their attention is divided. Of course, this is also a good thing. Those who love sports will continue to pay attention to the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third Asian Games in thirty years is a testimony to China’s development and the evolution of the national spirit. In this sense, the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has increased technological content and attracted less attention than it did in the past, which is a reflection of its richness, development and progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“常·识”背后的南方报业融合转型密码]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257611]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, Huang Changkai, Secretary of the Party Committee and President of Southern Newspaper Media Group, wrote the monograph &quot;Common Knowledge - Southern The book &quot;Newspaper Media Convergence Comics&quot; was officially published by Nanfang Daily Publishing House. This is another professional masterpiece by the author following &quot;Communication Power - Media Integration Practice of Southern Newspaper Industry&quot;, which deeply summarizes the practice and experience of the integration transformation of southern newspapers and profoundly explains the understanding and understanding of the regularity of integration transformation of provincial party newspaper groups. Although the title of the book is &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, it is closely combined with the extraordinary process of the southern newspaper industry in recent years to successfully explore the path of integrated development that is in line with the spirit of the central government, industry trends and with southern characteristics. It shows the southern newspaper people&#39;s perspective on media integration and transformation. Deep understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/5b8d0c05c65e1a924c997e724b8104c4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/5b8d0c05c65e1a924c997e724b8104c4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252058&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Book and video of &quot;Common Knowledge - Comics on the Integration of Southern Newspaper and Media&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Looking at integration transformation from eight sets of dialectical relationships&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;:&lt;/span >;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Without communication power, there is nothing&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the era of mobile Internet, how to promote the development of media integration is a question of the times and also of contemporary media. A must-answer question for people&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;. Media integration is a systematic project that involves &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;innovation of ideas, content, forms, methods, and means. It involves many tasks such as resource integration, process optimization, and platform reengineering, and involves all aspects of technology, operation, and management problems. . Where to solve the problem and how to solve the problem? How to focus on the key reforms that &quot;pulse one person to mobilize the whole body&quot;, innovative measures to achieve the traction effect of &quot;one child is full of vitality&quot;, and how to rectify the complex relationships between various aspects and different links? To this, we can find part of the answer just from the content structure of the book &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the content structure, the book is divided into eight themes, namely &quot;Old Business and New Business&quot;, &quot;Rice Bowl and Stage&quot;, &quot;Career and Talent&quot;, &quot;Main Business and Industry&quot;, &quot;Content and Technology&quot; &quot;Removal of disadvantages and innovation&quot;, &quot;Management and construction&quot;, &quot;Big ecology and small ecology&quot;. Furthermore, the eight themes actually illustrate eight sets of major dialectical relationships that need to be accurately grasped to crack media integration. For example, &quot;Old Industry and New Industry&quot; focuses on a dialectical view of the relationship between traditional media and emerging media, and how to achieve complementary advantages, one can grow stronger than the other, and one can be better than the other during the iterative process of integration and transformation. &quot;Jobs and Stages&quot; focuses on how, in the face of the irreversible trend of the decline of traditional media, how to build a bigger and stronger self-controlled and controllable communication platform, provide a secure job, and create a stage for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses. By analogy, &quot;Business and Talent&quot; focuses on the construction of a talent team for integrated transformation; &quot;Main Business and Industry&quot; explores how to achieve positive mutual promotion between editing and operations; &quot;Content and Technology&quot; focuses on building a solid foundation for integrated transformation The technological foundation of and Small Ecology&quot; shows how for a provincial party newspaper group like Nanfang Newspaper, which has multiple sub-media, multiple ports, and multiple positions, to build an all-media communication system with misaligned development, coordination and harmony, and amplify the communication power of integrated development. and influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3bc02f7af596f0fabf0199532b415f1d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;530&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3bc02f7af596f0fabf0199532b415f1d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252062&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Innovative measures for the southern newspaper industry’s institutional mechanisms. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see from a detailed reading of &quot;Chang·shi&quot; that the eight sets of dialectical relationships are not &quot;theories out of thin air&quot;, but stem from the successful integration and transformation practice of the southern newspaper industry. A profound summary of the Southern Style of Play. In recent years, Southern Newspapers has taken improving modern communication capabilities as its primary task, deeply implemented the &quot;three integrations&quot; and &quot;four modernizations&quot; strategies and tactics (see the book &quot;Communication Power - Media Integration Practice of Southern Newspapers&quot; for details), and built It is a micro-screen all-media communication system for newspapers and periodicals with over 457 million users on the Internet. Its seven media organizations, including Nanfang Daily, Nanfang Magazine, Nanfang.com, Nanfang Rural Daily, Southern Weekend, Southern Metropolis Daily, and Nanfang+Client, are all among the &quot; &quot;Billion Yuan Media&quot; Club, Southern+, GDToday News Network (client), Nanzhou App, Nandu App, N Video, Guangdong Learning and other new communication platforms with independent controllability and strong communication capabilities are developing well. Southern+ has exceeded 1.7 With an outstanding performance of over 100 million downloads and over 6 million daily active users, it firmly occupies the position of the most authoritative mobile publishing platform of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, and ranks first in the dissemination power of the self-owned client of the provincial party newspaper in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such an outstanding performance in integration and transformation stems from the correct grasp of the eight sets of dialectical relationships discussed in the book. The author&#39;s so-called &quot;community&quot; is by no means a general discussion. He focuses on a series of key problems, important themes, and major issues in the integration and transformation of media. The author&#39;s in-depth explanation of the eight sets of dialectical relationships is the answer to the &quot;need and need&quot; dilemmas of effectively solving media convergence and transformation. From it, we can also get a glimpse of the successful code of the Southern newspaper industry&#39;s convergence and transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Feel regular knowledge from “common knowledge”: &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Transformation is not a career change&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The author states in his preface, &quot;The title of the book is &quot;Chang·Shi&quot;, which means both ordinary views and normal common sense.&quot; Looking at the whole book, there are many views on &quot;Without communication power, there is nothing&quot;, &quot;What kind of circle should Southern+ get out of&quot;, &quot;What kind of person should Mingji become&quot;, &quot;What kind of industry should we build&quot;, &quot;Let management and management change from a &#39;dilemma&#39; to a &#39;dilemma&#39; The in-depth discussions on a series of industry-concerned topics such as &quot;two ends&quot; can be said to have &quot;frequent golden sentences&quot;, which left a deep impression on people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense is unusual. For a long time, in the face of the continuous fierce impact of new Internet media, where to go in media transformation has been the &lt;span>;most prominent&lt;/span>; problem. Practice has proved that the correct answer to this question often determines the path choice and future of a media. In this regard, the author clearly pointed out that &quot;transformation is not a change of career&quot; and emphasized that &quot;as mainstream media, regardless of newspapers, radio and television, websites, or clients, we must ask ourselves: what do we do?&quot; &quot;The southern newspaper industry must be clear about its positioning. No matter how it is transformed or integrated, the cornerstone status of media attributes cannot be shaken.&quot; In the current era of drastic changes in the industry, adhering to the strategic determination of &quot;still calm when flying through chaotic clouds&quot; is common sense, but it still requires an unusual &quot;sobriety in the world&quot;. Similar to the book, &quot;ignoring the media business is tantamount to discarding the basics&quot;, &quot;being independent and controllable does not mean starting from scratch&quot;, etc., etc., which may not seem to be profound and mysterious truths, but often require people to make clear decisions in the reality of integration and transformation. The right choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1ddee1f0902287b520469a2b18222ed6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1ddee1f0902287b520469a2b18222ed6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252061&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Four-year changes in the business structure of Southern Newspapers (2019-2022). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense is also consensus. As the author said, &quot;Common Knowledge&quot; &quot;presents by no means my personal practical thinking, but the crystallization of collective wisdom.&quot; It not only originates from the integration and transformation practice of Southern Newspaper Industry, but also condenses the consensus of all employees of Southern Newspaper Industry . It is not difficult to see from the discussions in the book, such as &quot;Content production and dissemination as the basis for survival&quot;, &quot;Building new mainstream media must adhere to &#39;long-termism&#39;&quot;, &quot;The most precious assets of the southern newspaper industry are two: the first is Talent, the second is communication power.&quot; &quot;Famous journalists are not judged, but typed.&quot; &quot;Only by &#39;sinking down&#39; can the foundation be everlasting.&quot; These are not only important concepts and principles that the southern newspaper industry adheres to in its integration and transformation, but also have long been Integrating into the daily development of the group has become a consensus practiced by the Southern Newspaper industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Common sense is a regular understanding. Many &quot;golden sentences&quot; in the book are not only insights, but also reflect a deep understanding of the laws of media integration and development. For example, when talking about the essence of transformation, he pointed out that &quot;transformation is the transformation of media from a &#39;paper&#39; form to a &#39;net&#39; form; integration is the fusion and symbiosis of old and new media forms&quot;; when talking about the relationship between main business and industry, It was pointed out that &quot;by strengthening the main business, the communication power and influence can produce spillover benefits, thereby doing a good job in the main business, leveraging the industry and bringing diversified income&quot;; when talking about the relationship between technology and content, it was pointed out that &quot;where the content is spread, Technical support will follow wherever you go.” Discussions like this are undoubtedly highly inspiring to the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of media integration is a big article. This year marks the 10th anniversary of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instruction to “accelerate the integrated development of traditional media and emerging media.” At such an important time point, the publication of &quot;Common Knowledge&quot; undoubtedly provides a vivid sample and reference for us to summarize the media integration transformation practices of the entire industry and accelerate the in-depth development of media integration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1f89d7f6202dd2ba9ff83a96f15f47a8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;5678&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1f89d7f6202dd2ba9ff83a96f15f47a8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252064&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Table of contents of &quot;Common Knowledge - Southern Newspaper Media Integration Comics&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/07bb486f461ce7c1189ca9b7220c0010.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;851&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/07bb486f461ce7c1189ca9b7220c0010.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252060 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;About the author. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[亚运新项目电子竞技开赛，中国香港队小组赛战胜中国台北队]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257563]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 13:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/24/ef0b241597.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/ef0b241597. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251859&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 24, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports events in China Hangzhou E-Sports Center kicks off. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports competition was held in Hangzhou, China The E-Sports Center starts.
