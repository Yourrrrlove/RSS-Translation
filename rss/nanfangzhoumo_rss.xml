Before the physical education class, a group of boys and girls in my son&#39;s class knelt down and prayed for rain, saying, &quot;God bless you, let it rain quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Kneel down and pray for rain&quot;, the first reaction in my mind is the plot in the TV series &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. A group of children knelt down to pray for rain in a serious manner. Of course I understood that there was an element of comedy in this, but I also realized an indisputable fact: some children do not like to attend physical education classes. On the one hand, the weather in Guangzhou is very hot. Running, skipping rope, and playing with hula hoops on the scorching playground for forty minutes is very painful or even torturous for most students; more importantly, some children There is a clear resistance to taking physical education classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of the time when I was in school more than thirty years ago. Physical education was, without a doubt, the most popular class, without “one”. During recess or physical education classes in elementary school, we would roll hoops, fold cards, play marbles, hopscotch, shuttlecock, and tug-of-war, and have a great time. Whether you come into the classroom with a red face after playing in the summer or warmed up after playing in the winter, it is always a very happy moment. In junior high school and high school, before the class ends in the morning or afternoon, or before the physical education class, many of our classmates carry table tennis rackets. As soon as the bell rings, the students sitting in the back row of the classroom sprint at the speed of 100 meters. Running to the table tennis table and sitting or lying down on the table tennis table means &quot;we have occupied this table&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PE classes at that time were synonymous with relaxation, happiness, and fun, which perfectly matched the playful nature of children. Times have changed, and today’s physical education classes are far less popular than before. Some students don’t like or even hate physical education classes. What is the root cause? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we all know, the original intention of physical education classes is to strengthen children&#39;s bodies. The &quot;physical fitness&quot; here is not only about physical health and fitness, but also about cultivating the children&#39;s perseverance and fearless qualities. It has both physical and psychological implications, both of which are indispensable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to overeating, anorexia, other improper, unscientific, and unreasonable diets, or lack of exercise, or no exercise habits, many children are seriously out of shape, obese or suspected of obesity or frailty. There are not a few children who are suspected of being weak. Out of shape will affect children&#39;s learning, social interaction and other aspects to a certain extent. As natural attributes, the body, body shape and body shape will construct and affect children&#39;s social attributes, often with negative effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to effectively solve or alleviate the above-mentioned difficulties and strengthen children&#39;s physical exercise, education authorities and schools have begun to pay attention to physical education. The importance of physical education in various subjects is increasing day by day. Not only weekly physical education The number of classes has increased significantly. In some provinces and regions, physical education classes have been officially included in the scope of entrance examinations, and physical education scores have been included in the high school entrance examination subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve higher overall results and not lose points along with the sports scores, the original sports items as a casual or optional fun function have been transformed into compulsory compulsory content for students. In other words, taking physical education classes is not to play, not to sweat, not to develop a lifelong habit of exercise, but to take the entrance exam and get a temporary score. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of including physical education as an examination item is to allow students to develop their moral, intellectual and physical development in an all-round way. The problem is that under such incentives, most students hope to get close to full marks or high scores in physical education. Many students In addition to physical education classroom training, students also spend a lot of time, energy and money on training for physical education examinations. Various expensive training courses, improvement courses and crash courses have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. There is no difference between these extracurricular training programs for major subjects such as Chinese, Mathematics, and English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the school perspective, some areas have implemented a policy that links student physical examinations to the performance of principals, and therefore to the performance of teachers. Therefore, physical education classes and physical tests are not just a matter for the physical education teacher, but also a matter for all teachers in the school, involving the welfare and treatment of all teachers in the school. Under such circumstances, strengthening physical education classes, allowing students to strengthen physical exercise even when they return home, and doing everything possible to improve students&#39; physical test scores has naturally become a common choice for many schools. &quot;Using the whole school&#39;s efforts to develop and revitalize sports&quot; has become a goal of many schools. slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let students strengthen physical exercise. The specific exercise content is very specific and clear, including the physical test items required above. Students have to insist on punching in every day, and ignore other items at all, such as kicking shuttlecock, Projects that are interesting to students or more popular among students, such as hoop rolling and hopscotch, are basically excluded. In other words, the sports that students play in class may not necessarily be what they like. They have no right to choose. They can only passively accept several types of sports designated by the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, some schools in some areas have also popularized activities designed to allow students to exercise for one hour a day - &quot;big break&quot;, which specifically includes free exercise, relaxation exercise, running exercise and other sections. The problem is that the evaluation criteria for this kind of &quot;big break&quot; are mainly beautiful formations, which require uniformity in an absolute sense. The row spacing, shoulder distance, arm raising range, left alignment, right alignment, and uniformity throughout the formation are not important. There are strict rules about not allowed to laugh and not allowed to make any sound. Students are forced to spend most of their &quot;recess&quot; time on superficial tasks such as formation rehearsals and pattern displays. Actual sports and exercise time are very limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to win the &quot;big break&quot; competition, to come out on top in the gymnastics competitions of other schools, to gain greater honors, and to get richer bonuses, some physical education teachers in some schools go to great lengths. Use your brains and find ways to &quot;create&quot;. How to &quot;create&quot; is nothing more than working on the formation and making the movements more difficult. For example, inventing a &quot;flexibility exercise&quot; requires students to be proficient in difficult movements such as splits and lower backs. How? Only repeated training once and for all, this kind of high-intensity training brings huge harm to the students&#39; bodies, and some of the damage is irreversible. From a psychological point of view, most students will feel that practicing these innovative exercises is more boring, boring, and uninteresting, and it is extremely painful for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned various innovative exercises wearing a fitness &quot;hat&quot; are more difficult and less interesting, and there are fewer practical exercises for students. As a result, if the school radio station broadcasts &quot;Due to ****** reasons, today&#39;s recess is temporarily canceled&quot;, bursts of cheers will be heard from every classroom on the entire campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is obviously contrary to common sense, because not every student has the physical condition and talent to practice gymnastics, and not every student is suitable for doing difficult movements. This kind of training is only for professional gymnasts. It is really unreasonable to transplant standard machinery to ordinary students. The motivation behind this move - to win awards for the school and to increase the income of the school and some teachers, feels despicable and dirty, which is not an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standardizing and homogenizing sports, converting physical measurements into results and scores, and linking sports to the performance of school leaders and the pocketbooks of teachers have greatly reduced or obliterated the diversity of sports. The essential stipulations such as sex, diversity, and interest are used to alienate the children into tools for some people to pursue their political achievements. Such behavior is naturally not welcomed by the students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, we cannot oversimplify our understanding of students’ “kneeling down to pray for rain”. We cannot simply attribute it to the fact that today’s children are generally afraid of sweating, suffering, weak willpower, and weak ability to withstand stress. If you don’t like or even hate physical education classes, relevant parties should think about it in all aspects: Is the current function of physical education classes to strengthen your body, please your body and mind, or is it something else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[研究女性劳动力市场的女性，问鼎2023诺贝尔经济学奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258365]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/X0B4ScncQcKaw0hR2fkONFJQebCS37mC6nfK2fZl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/X0B4ScncQcKaw0hR2fkONFJQebCS3 7mC6nfK2fZl. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253618&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Claudia Goldin. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, 2023, Beijing time, Claudia Gore, professor of economics at Harvard University Claudia Goldin will win the 2023 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for &quot;advancing our understanding of women&#39;s labor market outcomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I studied Golding’s economic thought during my Ph.D., and in 2011 published “Review of Claudia Golding’s Economic Thought—Potential Female Nobel Economics” in Economic Trends &quot;A Review of the Academic Contributions of Academic Award Winners&quot;. Now I am very happy to see that she has actually won the award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are traces of Goldin winning the Nobel Prize in Economics. She has served as president of the American Economic Association and the American Economic History Association, and has also been elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. These important indicators of a scholar&#39;s academic status have long meant that Goldin has the potential to aspire to the top. The strength of the Bell Prize in Economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Uniqueness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2023 Nobel Prize in Economics not only continues the common rules of previous years, but also has its own unique features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the winner Golding is still from an American university. More than half of the scholars who won the Nobel Prize in Economics from 1969 to 2023 were from the United States, far ahead of the number of winners from other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin was born in New York City in 1946. He received his bachelor&#39;s and doctoral degrees in economics from Cornell University and the University of Chicago. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin, Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. Now a professor of economics at Harvard University, she is the first female tenured professor in the history of Harvard University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Goldin is the third female economist to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. When the Nobel Prize was first established, it did not include economics awards. Since the Nobel Prize in Economics was first awarded in 1969, male economists have always won this honor. Until 2009, Eleanor Ostrow Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in Economics for &quot;innovative research in economic governance, especially in the governance of public resources.&quot; This is the first time a woman has won the prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years later, in 2019, Esther Duflo became the second female scholar to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. The reason for the award was for her outstanding contributions in the field of global poverty research. contribute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third place is this year&#39;s Goldin. She revealed the main driving factors of gender differences in the labor market, which has far-reaching significance for understanding the female labor market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, both Ostrom and Duflo shared the Nobel Prize in Economics with other scholars. For example, Duflo won the Nobel Prize in Economics at the same time with her husband, Abhijit Banerjee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University. Goldin’s husband, Lawrence F. Katz, is also an economics professor at Harvard University. The two have collaborated on many classic articles on labor economics and are a couple in the academic world. But it is a pity that Goldin and Katz were not able to share the Nobel Prize at the same time this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the research fields of the Nobel Prize in Economics are becoming more and more &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. In the past, the Nobel Prize in Economics focused more on theoretical contributions. In recent years, the Nobel Prize in Economics has gradually begun to focus on the applied value of research. For example, Duflo, the second female economist to win the prize in 2019, studied poverty. Golding&#39;s systematic research on female employment and gender discrimination, the history of educational development and changes in wage structures also has important practical significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Goldin’s research characteristics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Goldin’s research not only focuses on the construction of a theoretical analysis framework, but also focuses on combining a large amount of economic history data to analyze Conduct research on real-life problems. Its research characteristics are to use a large amount of historical data combined with econometrics and other methods to conduct empirical research, and to analyze current problems through the perspective of the past in order to draw more practical conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, we quote two cases from Goldin, one is a study on women’s working time legislation in the United States. In the 1940s, 40 states in the United States passed legislation on women&#39;s working hours, setting mandatory maximum working hours for each day of the week. Many scholars believe that these laws not only fail to effectively protect these groups, but even harm their own interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Golding used manufacturing data to conduct research and found that the maximum working hour legislation not only reduced the working hours of women, but also reduced the working hours of men, and the proportion of women in the manufacturing sector was also reduced. It has not been reduced due to restrictions in working hours laws. She also pointed out that the proportion of women in other industries such as sales has increased as working hours legislation has become more restrictive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example shows the skill of Golding&#39;s approach to researching problems. Most studies generally use some traditional &quot;discrimination coefficient&quot; and other methods to measure female employment discrimination. However, Goldin cleverly directly measured female employment discrimination by comparing the recruitment methods of American symphony orchestras before and after the reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the reform of recruitment methods, symphony orchestras mainly selected musicians through direct interviews among the many outstanding candidates selected by the music director. This method favored male applicants and favored female applicants. discrimination against persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the 1970s to the 1980s, the recruitment method was reformed in the form of &quot;blind performance&quot;, that is, listening to the performance level through a curtain screen. In this way, the judges will not know the gender of the musician applicant and can only recruit based on the applicant&#39;s technical level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the implementation of this reform, Golding found that the &quot;blind performance&quot; format can increase the likelihood of women advancing from the preliminary round by 50%, and the likelihood of entering the final stage has also increased several times. , the possibility of becoming an orchestra musician also greatly increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employment discrimination problems may occasionally be encountered in real life, so some of Goldin&#39;s research may help solve these problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Main Economic Thoughts&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Goldin has made important contributions to the study of gender discrimination, the history of educational development and the evolution of wage structure gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female employment and gender discrimination are important research topics in the field of labor economics, which have attracted the attention of many economists. Goldin&#39;s research mainly focuses on occupational segmentation caused by gender differences, factors affecting female employment, and the measurement of gender discrimination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematic research on the theory of discrimination in the labor market began with G. Becker (1957). Later economists gave various explanations on the causes of discrimination and the influencing factors of discrimination. Such as the crowding hypothesis (Bergmann, 1971) and statistical discrimination (Phelps, 1972). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from these theoretical explanations, Golding focuses on analyzing the influencing factors of gender discrimination in female employment from an empirical perspective. She believes that the gender discrimination faced by women in the job search process is the result of a combination of factors, and analyzes it from the perspectives of World War II, the availability of contraceptive pills, and legislation on maximum working hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars such as Golding believe that birth control pills reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and thus increase the age at which women get married for the first time. The widespread use of contraceptive pills among unmarried women has also reduced the cost of women&#39;s long-term career investment and increased the proportion of educated women. More female college graduates have entered the labor market, promoting women&#39;s employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Workers can improve their labor productivity and thus their income by receiving education, but what is the relationship between years of education and income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article &quot;The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women&#39;s Employment, Education and the Family&quot; (2006), Golding divided women&#39;s employment from the late 19th century to that time into four stages based on changes in women&#39;s educational attainment: In the first stage, from the late 19th century to the 1920s, women in the labor market were usually young, unmarried women. At this time, the income elasticity of labor supply was very high, while the substitution elasticity was very small. Most female workers were not well educated. . The second stage lasted from the 1930s to around 1950. In this stage, restrictions on married women&#39;s work were relaxed. The income elasticity of labor supply dropped significantly in absolute terms. Secondary school enrollment and graduation rates increased, and part-time work increased. The rise of the economy and the popularization of office facilities have greatly increased women&#39;s labor market participation rate. The third stage, from the 1950s to the 1970s, was the origin stage of the &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot;. In the two age groups of 45-54 and 35-44, the labor force participation rate of women increased significantly, from 25% in 1950 rose to 46% in 1970. The fourth stage is from the late 1970s to the time when the paper was published, that is, the &quot;quiet revolutionary stage.&quot; The Quiet Revolution is mainly manifested through three indicators: horizon, identity, and decision making. Horizon mainly refers to a woman’s ability to predict her future career more accurately; identity refers to a woman’s name after marriage. retaining their surname; decision-making allows her to be better prepared to enter the labor market. The conclusion is that changing trends in women&#39;s education have promoted women&#39;s employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Economic inequality is closely related to the level of educational development. Goldin also gave a detailed explanation of the relationship between the two in his book &quot;The Race between Education and Technology&quot; (with L.F. Katz, 2008). She pointed out that the United States began to implement mass education at the beginning of the 20th century, making the 20th century known as the &quot;human capital century&quot; and the &quot;American century.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About education, technology and economic inequality, it can be summarized as follows: 1. A more educated labor force can produce higher labor productivity, which in turn produces rapid economic growth. However, it is important to note that economic growth does not depend solely on investment in education, but also on the type of government, the degree of protection of property rights, and many other prerequisites. 2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of education can also drive technological progress. In turn, the continuous progress of technology also requires more and better-educated labor force. Relative to the labor force with less education, the wages of labor force with more education are higher, and the insufficient supply of labor force with more education will inevitably lead to the labor force with more education and more education. The wage gap between the less educated workforce continues to grow. If the relative proportions of different levels of education remain unchanged, technological progress will inevitably bring about economic inequality; in other words, if the quantity and quality of education increase, technological progress will promote the decline of economic inequality. 3. Throughout the 20th century, the economic growth of the United States showed a continuous rise, but economic inequality showed discontinuity. In the first 70 years of the 20th century, economic growth brought about a decline in inequality, but in the last 20 years of the 20th century, economic inequality gradually increased. 4. Judging from the above statements, the main reason why inequality in the United States first declined and then increased in the 20th century was due to the out-of-synchrony between the speed of educational development and the demand for talents in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is a close connection between female employment and gender discrimination, educational development history and economic inequality. The development of education is an important factor influencing the increase in female employment and changes in economic inequality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin has a wide range of research interests. In addition to the above-mentioned fields, it also involves many issues such as slavery and immigrant migration. She is a female economist with extensive research fields and rich academic achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor and doctoral supervisor at the Department of Economics, School of Economics, Liaoning University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“国家需要就是我的专业”丨钱伟长110周年诞辰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258367]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/9CXRlLqfFveyoWxWucuEqpM9sLsWKAY9XzF2d1VJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;731&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/9CXRlLqfFveyoWxWucuEqpM9sLs WKAY9XzF2d1VJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253614&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qian Weichang (1913-2010), born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, majored in physics and mechanics , applied mathematician, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and president of Shanghai University during his lifetime. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 9, 2023, is the 110th anniversary of Chinese scientist and educator Qian Weichang Birthday anniversary. At Shanghai University, which is called the &quot;Eternal President&quot;, activities such as &quot;Qian Weichang and Heritage Protection&quot; and &quot;Commemorating the 110th Anniversary of Qian Weichang&#39;s Birthday and the Development Forum of &#39;Long-lasting Great Deeds&#39;&quot; were held one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he has been dead for more than ten years, the legendary stories about Qian Weichang still attract public attention from time to time. For example, his thesis that &quot;this article does not need to refer to any literature&quot;; he entered Tsinghua University with &quot;only a 5-point score in physics&quot;, but due to his strength he became a famous physicist as famous as Qian Xuesen and Qian Sanqiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned paper, called the &quot;hardest core&quot; by netizens, was published in the fifth issue of 2002 of the magazine &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot; (&quot;Nonlinear Calculation Problems of Large Deflection of Ningbo Yongjiang Bridge&quot;). In fact, he has a profound and unique understanding and use of research and documentation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1993, he said in his speech &quot;How to Be a Graduate Student&quot; that &quot;documentation is one aspect of investigation, and literature is an important aspect in learning, and it is also used to doing this internationally. .&quot; He also gave detailed guidance on how to write academic papers at the graduate work meeting, &quot;Before writing a paper, you must first go to the front line to find out where the person&#39;s &#39;shoulder&#39; is.&quot; &quot;What is touching the shoulder? It means looking up information and going Investigation and research.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2004, CCTV&#39;s &quot;Everyone&quot; column interviewed 92-year-old Qian Weichang. He recalled that he scored 225 points in his entrance exam, with full marks in Chinese and history subjects. &quot;I scored a total of 25 points in mathematics, physics, chemistry and English... I only scored 5 points in physics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to research, the facts may be doubtful. A document titled &quot;Admission Standards for Undergraduate Students Recruited by National Tsinghua University Over the Years&quot; shows that in 1931, Tsinghua University required an overall average score of 54 or above in the entrance examination, and the average score requirement for the three subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics was at least 54 points. 49 points or more. According to the requirement of taking five compulsory exams and two elective exams at that time, according to this calculation, the total score of the seven subjects should reach 378 points. If only the five compulsory subjects are counted, it will be at least 270 points, both of which are higher than 225 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after enrolling, Qian Weichang successfully passed the &quot;High School Algebra Analytical Geometry&quot; screening test organized by Tsinghua University. In 1932, in April of his second year of enrollment, Qian Weichang was able to independently translate mathematician Fox&#39;s English paper on algebraic equations. &quot;According to our historical data research, he received very strict (academic) training at Suzhou Middle School, and their textbooks were almost all English textbooks.&quot; Wang Yuandi, secretary of the Party Committee of Shanghai University Library (Archives Museum), told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang spent his later years at the Yanchang Campus of Shanghai University. People often see Qian Weichang walking on the quiet campus. He enjoys greeting students and watching them walking hurriedly through the campus. He was particularly fond of a wide red jacket and always wore it when talking to students or communicating with leaders. Li Yin used to be the chairman of the Shanghai University Graduate Student Union and is now an academic teacher at Shanghai University. She and Qian Weichang met three times. She remembered that Qian Weichang, who was over 90 years old, was always full of energy and smiled with the innocence of a baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang maintained the curiosity of a scientist throughout his life. He once wrote an article sorting out &quot;The Origin of &quot;China&quot;&quot; and also discussed &quot;the structural characteristics and non-uniqueness of the Chinese Rubik&#39;s Cube&quot;; he was concerned about the problem of sandstorms in the north and once wrote to Premier Zhu Rongji in 2001: The problem of sandstorms in the north may be It is related to the number of goats raised in Inner Mongolia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He did not use political business cards during his lifetime. When introducing himself, he often used three titles: president of Shanghai University, editor-in-chief of &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot;, and director of the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics. These are the three identities he cherishes and are also important achievements in the later life of Qian Weichang as an educator. Dai Shiqiang, a tenured professor of Shanghai University who has worked with him for many years at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, recalled that the magazine &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot; edited by Qian Weichang had only two academicians including him at the beginning, but later the editorial board had a total of There have been 15 academicians, 16 presidents and vice-presidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Shiqiang said that Qian Weichang had three major interests in his life: football, Go and speaking. When he entered Tsinghua University, due to his poor family, Qian Weichang was only 1.49 meters tall, which was 1 centimeter shorter than the starting point of the height measurement benchmark. Like the ambitious young people of that era, he armed his body with patriotism. Less than two years after entering school, he participated in the Tsinghua cross-country team and won the championship at the sports meeting. He was later selected to the Tsinghua football team and represented the Chinese football team in the Far East Games held in the Philippines in 1937. When he graduated, Qian Weichang&#39;s height reached 1.65 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang likes to talk. Dai Shiqiang noticed that during speeches, Qian Weichang liked to tear off a corner of the newspaper on the table and chew it in his mouth. As president of Shanghai University (1994-2010), he gave speeches to students at the opening and graduation ceremonies every year, which was his unshakable practice in his later years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang&#39;s last public appearance in the media was in 2007, in Phoenix TV&#39;s feature film &quot;The Light of Life&quot;. At that time, he occasionally couldn&#39;t recognize people. Qian Wei always loved playing Go. Later, when he had no one to play with, he started playing backgammon, holding black in one hand and white in the other. Dai Shiqiang remembered that the last time he went to see him, Qian Weichang had sunspots in both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time he spoke in front of students was at the graduation ceremony of Shanghai University in 2005. Qian Weichang gave a motto: &quot;Be worried about the world&#39;s worries first, and be happy after the world&#39;s happiness.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;He said to the students in the audience: Children, can you keep it in mind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/HczUuZyE2ottYvWPOH3AOiVT6hMg5eEJsltukdNj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/HczUuZyE2ottYvWPOH3AOiVT6hMg5eEJsltukdNj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253616&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qian Weichang was in the study before his death. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Science is needed to save the country&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In 1913, Qian Weichang was born in a rural intellectual family in Wuxi. His fourth uncle was Qian Mu, a master of Chinese studies. There is an anecdote that is still talked about today: During the Tsinghua University Entrance Examination, Chen Yinke asked a question in the history test paper, requiring him to write down the name, volume, author and annotator of the Twenty-Four Histories. This question was difficult to answer. Many people were interviewed, but Qian Weichang answered them all and finally got full marks for this subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With a solid foundation in literature and history, it was a natural progression to enroll in the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University. But in 1931, on the third day after Qian Weichang entered school, the &quot;September 18th&quot; incident broke out. Qian Weichang&#39;s famous saying is widely known, &quot;I have no major, the country&#39;s needs are my majors.&quot; He felt that &quot;science is needed to save the country.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to enroll in the Department of Physics, Qian Weichang spent a week with Wu Youxun, the dean of the Department of Physics. Classes were held at eight o&#39;clock every day, and Qian Weichang went to the office to wait at a quarter past six. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Youxun couldn&#39;t test him, so he agreed to let him try it out. At that time, the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University had requirements for probationary students. The three courses of general chemistry, general physics and advanced mathematics needed to reach the intermediate level (70 points) or above. If they did not meet the standards, they would be returned to the original department. During the first seven weeks of the trial, Qian Wei studied physics according to the memorization method of studying Chinese studies, and his test results were &quot;a complete mess&quot;. It was only after Professor Wu Youxun&#39;s guidance that things changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He goes to the Science Museum at five o&#39;clock every morning to recite. Usually when he gets there, Hua Luogeng has already finished reciting. After finding the key to learning, Qian Weichang successfully stayed in the Department of Physics. After graduating from his undergraduate degree, he was admitted as a graduate student in the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University with first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like many progressive students at that time, Qian Weichang actively participated in the national salvation movement. In 1935, Qian Weichang participated in the &quot;December 9th&quot; student demonstrations. At the end of that year, he and several male classmates formed a bicycle team to go south and rode all the way to Nanjing to promote anti-Japanese and national salvation to the masses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving at the Southwest Associated University in Kunming in 1939, he, Lin Jiaqiao and Guo Yonghuai were admitted to study abroad at the Chinese and British Boxer Indemnity Fund. The majors that the three people took the examination were all &quot;mechanics&quot;, and their scores were the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a boat trip from Shanghai to study in Canada, they were surprised to find a Japanese visa in their passports. The person in charge explained the reason: The cruise will be suspended in Yokohama, Japan, and the Japanese endorsement can facilitate their shore excursions. &quot;While the Japanese aggressor army occupied most of the motherland, they could not accept visas from the enemy&#39;s government,&quot; Qian Weichang wrote. They disembarked with their luggage. Seven months later, we set off again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After studying abroad at the University of Toronto for about fifty days, Qian Weichang co-authored &quot;The Intrinsic Theory of Elastic Plate Shells&quot; with his tutor Xin Ji. His research on the theory of elastic plate and shell bending unity began as early as Kunming. When I arrived in Canada, I found that I could combine the macro and micro ideas of my mentor. During World War II, due to the lack of guidance from a unified plate and shell strength theory, aircraft crashes and high-speed aircraft test failures were common. &quot;Intrinsic Theory of Elastic Plate Shells&quot; is also one of the first papers in this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is included in the 60th birthday collection of American scientist von Karman. The authors of the collection also include physicists such as Einstein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To study plates and shells, Qian Weichang creatively used Riemannian geometry and tensor analysis to study the unified theory of plates and shells. Einstein studied general relativity and also used Riemannian geometry as a tool. So Qian Wei After the director reported the relevant results, it is not surprising that Einstein wanted to discuss and ask for advice from him.&quot; Dai Shiqiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving his Ph.D., Qian Weichang went to the von Kármán Jet Propulsion Institute at California Institute of Technology as a postdoc. He collaborated with von Karman on &quot;Torsion of Variable Torque Rate&quot;, which von Karman called the most classic elastic mechanics paper in his life. Both Synge and von Karman belonged to the &quot;Göttingen School&quot;, a mathematical school that emphasized application. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Xin Ji&#39;s most significant influence on Qian Weichang is not to drown in the sea of ​​applied mathematics, but to climb up after solving the problem. After you get a knife, you have to sharpen it again. It&#39;s fast and good, and it can chop melons and vegetables, but you can&#39;t always appreciate how good and sharp my knife is,&quot; Dai Shiqiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang attaches great importance to practicality. When encountering practical problems that interest him, he does not limit himself to the subject areas in which he specializes. Some people call Qian Weichang a &quot;universal scientist&quot;. In 1970, domestic tank development faced difficulties: the four lead-acid batteries used in the tanks could only be started 15 times, and sometimes they could no longer walk after traveling dozens of kilometers. Qian Weichang is not a battery expert, but according to his creed, &quot;the needs of the country are my expertise&quot;, he organized a research team to study tank batteries while translating foreign documents and monographs. The next year, a high-energy battery was actually made that was the same size and weight as an ordinary battery but had eight times more energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in his later years, Qian Weichang will study new majors for the &quot;national needs&quot;. In 1980, Qian Weichang led a delegation to Hong Kong to participate in the International Chinese Computer Academic Conference. At the meeting, the Chinese computer technology of overseas companies such as IBM was relatively mature. Some people said disdainfully: It is too difficult for you to do this. China only needs to buy the products. Qian Weichang, who was over 60 years old at the time, began to learn computers and designed a macro glyph code for Chinese characters, referred to as &quot;Qian Code&quot;. At the first national Chinese character input program evaluation meeting, the single-person input speed of &quot;Qian Code&quot; ranked first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1946, Qian Weichang returned to China on the pretext of visiting relatives. In order not to attract attention, he only brought simple luggage and books. After returning to China, he worked as a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University. From 1946 to 1949, domestic prices soared, and professors lived in poverty. Qian Weichang&#39;s salary of 140,000 French currency was not enough to buy two thermos bottles. In order to supplement his family income, he went to Yenching University School of Engineering and Peking University School of Engineering to teach part-time, &quot;contracting&quot; applied mechanics and materials mechanics courses at the three schools, as well as some senior courses, teaching more than 15 hours a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following year, the Jet Propulsion Institute of California Institute of Technology invited him to return to the United States to work, promising generous remuneration that could solve his financial difficulties at the time.钱伟长在美领馆填写申请表，最后一行的问题是：若中美交战，你是否忠于美国？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长毅然填了“No”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/njgTdhnyAXpHUGqupVzYzcckzxEFgcaGXRRkBxf5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;633&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“我力图夺回久已逝去的良好岁月”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;钱伟长身上有一种科学家典型的固执，“他眼睛揉不得沙子，喜欢做评判和决断”，戴世强观察。这曾让他在特殊年代吃了不少苦头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1952年，钱伟长被任命为清华大学教务长，负责清华的教学改革。他的教育理念与当时推崇的苏联模式相悖。苏联教育模式推崇培养专才，但钱伟长认为，大学教育应该培养学生的自学能力，专业不应分得太细，如此，进入社会之后，学生方才有发现问题和解决问题的能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1957年，《人民日报》发表了《高等工业学校的培养目标问题》一文。这篇文章是钱伟长教育思想一次相对完整的呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在文中，他写道：“教学改革以前，高等工业学校教学工作是漫无目标的通才教学。在学习苏联经验进行教学改革以后，我们学到了环绕一个明确目标进行有计划的教学工作的一整套的制度和方法。这是很大的进步……教学质量在某些方面看是提高了，但是学生学习负担过重，独立工作能力较差，专业分得过细过专，以致在分配就业时发生了困难。这都不符合我们国家的要求，值得我们研究改进。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也因此，钱伟长在1957年以后被剥夺了上讲台的权利，仅保留“教授”的头衔，级别从一级教授降到了三级。后来邓小平主持教育工作时提出，“钱伟长不要待在实验室里，要让他上课。”后来又说，“有很多课开不出来，让钱伟长上嘛；有好多问题，你们不懂，他懂，让他开嘛！”于是从1961年到1965年，钱伟长先后去了清华九个系，写了九份讲义，别人再拿他的讲义去上课。晚年，他接受央视《大家》栏目专访，说：“我还是坚持我的一切。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儿子钱元凯当年也因身份问题，未能继续高等教育。在央视的镜头前，他回忆父亲的教诲：“上学学的东西，在人的一生里是一小块……人们可以剥夺你上学的机会，但是任何人剥夺不了你学习的机会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科学家的主业是发现问题，解决问题。有群众和科技工作者上门咨询或来函，他都尽力帮忙：他给工厂无偿翻译过机器说明书；为人民大会堂眺台边缘的“工”字梁稳定提供相应增强方案；在不利于施展科研能力的时代，他就靠一架手摇计算器，埋首计算“傅立叶三角级数之和”的大表，做一点实用的贡献，写定的稿子厚达30厘米。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他有一段话我就很欣赏：我每天都在考虑一些问题，考虑这些过去人家没有解决的问题，后来有人解决了我很高兴，后来这个问题还没有人解决，我就纳闷它为什么。凡是弄通一个问题我就很开心，比当个什么官都开心。”戴世强对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“文革”结束后，钱伟长开始四个现代化的全国演讲工作。 “钱先生何等聪明，他很会领会上面的精神，我们国家怎么建设（四个现代化）头头是道，谁都爱听……他一直讲到新疆伊犁，伊犁人家少数民族骑着马骑着骆驼都过来听他的讲课。”戴世强回忆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《钱伟长科学论文选集》的序言里，钱伟长袒露当时心境：“重新获得了科学工作的权利，欣逢1978年党中央召开全国科学大会，春风拂人，奋起之情油然而生。虽已年近七旬，还能为&#39;四化&#39;效力，感到无限幸福，我力图夺回久已逝去的良好岁月，夜以继日地工作着。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;超前的教育改革&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1983年，钱伟长离开清华，赴上海工业大学（后来合并为现上海大学）任校长。邓小平亲签的调令上写着：“此人任命不受年龄限制。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海大学校长的身份延续到钱伟长人生的最后一刻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于钱伟长赴任上海工业大学，曾流传着一种说法：钱伟长来到上海时，原以为是担任上海交通大学校长，得知是上海工业大学这所“四类学校”后，一度有些失望。戴世强告诉南方周末记者，事实情况并未如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说，1979年，年纪渐长的钱伟长动了离开清华的心思。华中工学院（现华中科技大学）、上海交通大学和上海工业大学三校皆有意请他做校长。当时华中工学院的院长朱九思是钱伟长挚交。 1980年，钱伟长创办国内第一本《应用数学和力学》杂志时，朱九思出钱出力帮忙办英文版。得知钱伟长要离开清华，愿意让贤。不过钱伟长基于多种考虑拒绝了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上海交大与上海工业大学之间，有人劝他：“交大是名校，名校不要你的名教授来增加它的光芒，而上海工业大学是非名校，他们又是求才若渴，马上你可以真刀真枪大干特干。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚到上海工业大学，钱伟长很快展开改革。他提出要“拆掉四堵墙”。一是要拆掉学校和社会的墙，为了适应社会的变化和需求，精简、压缩了一些专业，增设应用数学与力学、精细化工等专业；二是要拆掉校内各科系、各专业的墙，大学前两年不细分专业，无论文理，都建议学习计算机；三是拆掉教育与科研之间的墙。最后一项则是拆掉旧的“教与学”观念的墙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长反对照本宣科的老师，他曾说：“凡是照本宣科的老师，学生可以缺课，可以不上他的课，因为学生自己念得比他念得快。”这种对教师的要求，最初是受他的老师叶企孙影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1939年元旦，钱伟长历经曲折抵达西南联大时，老师叶企孙被调任至重庆研究院。钱伟长负责为叶企孙代讲一学期热力学课程。拿到叶的课程讲稿后，钱伟长发现，虽然要教授的基本原理如故，但例题已换成国际科技杂志上提出的最新问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每年虽然讲同一门课，但应该年年改变其基本理论的应用范围，使一门基础课一定要跟上科学发展的时代步伐，年年阅读大量有关科技国际期刊，消化吸收进教材中去，才算尽了教授的讲课责任。”钱伟长受此启发。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长同时提出对学校进行三项制度改革：学分制、选课制、短学期制。学分制和选课制最大程度上给了学生自主权，选课制让学生可以“跳槽”听课、跨年级选课，“学得特别好的学生可以多学些”。这样的教育改革，在当时远远领先于其他高校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王远弟是1980年代的大学生，他回忆，当时很多学校沿用苏联体制。 “工学院就是工学院，农学院就是农学院，专业之间区分得比较严。比如你是学钢铁的，出去之后马上就要进高炉厂，当技术人员。比如采矿系的学生，你要全面弄清楚怎么找矿、怎么采，出去马上就能用了，就是这样一种非常专的教育。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长并不认为学科之间，尤其是文理之间应该泾渭分明。 1998年，他发表于《光明日报》的文章表达得很清楚：“我认为自然科学、技术科学、社会科学和人文科学传统的学科分割界限即将会消除，它们将会结合成一个完整的科学知识体系。不同的学科之间不再是&#39;隔行如隔山&#39;，而是&#39;取长补短&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，钱伟长的科学研究，一定程度上也受益于他的国学功底。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戴世强举例说，钱伟长研究板壳的内禀理论，用的就是研究国学的思路，“念国学的人很会条分缕析、分门别类”。钱伟长根据板壳的特性，将其分成12个板、35种壳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今的上海大学校园，很多地方都遗留着这位终身校长的改革痕迹。在设计校园时，钱伟长曾特别提出，女厕所应建得比男生大一些。上海大学里有南方学校常见的连廊，方便选课的同学在不同教室走动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李银现在负责留学生的学工工作，开学第一课，她常带着学生熟悉校园环境。她对南方周末记者说，到达伟长楼时，她总会和学生们讲起这栋楼的由来：“那个时候，他觉得每个大学里，一定要有一个很隆重的（地方），把学生从家长手里接过来，等他毕业的时候，再很隆重地把他送向社会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长非常注重培养学生的问题意识和创新精神。 “社会需要能带着满脑子的问题从大学走出来的人，要有创造性而非模仿性。”他认为，大学老师应该向学生说清楚，不要以为毕业后自以为学到很多东西，似乎什么都懂了，其实懂得还很少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从一个没有问题的人变成一个有问题的人，这就是大学教育的成功。”钱伟长说，如果学生觉得应该去解决这些问题，就会不断地进行创造和革新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;（注：主要参考文献：《钱伟长文选》第四、五、六卷）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[心理咨询中的性争议：“咨询师没有任何理由和来访者发生性关系”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258353]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/iyq1ToLamR5wWT8RlEbvi1gVIZVrifMYdJP2MdA1.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;中国心理学会的相关伦理守则明确规定，心理师不得与当前寻求专业服务者或其家庭成员发生任何形式的性或亲密关系。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月16日，网友“冬妮”发帖称，自己于2014到2018年间，接受咨询师李松蔚心理咨询服务，四年期间多次遭到性侵、精神虐待及心理控制等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月25日，心理咨询师李松蔚做出公开回应，称网帖指控纯属诽谤，否认自己实施过上述行为，并表示愿意接受心理咨询伦理的监管，接受相关调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2007年，中国心理学会制定公布了《临床与咨询心理学工作伦理守则（第一版）》（下称《伦理守则》），被视为心理咨询行业的一份可靠规约；2018年，中国心理学会对第一版进行了修订。两版守则皆对咨访关系中的性或亲密关系做出了严格规定：心理师不得与当前寻求专业服务者或其家庭成员发生任何形式的性或亲密关系；心理师不得为有过性或亲密关系的来访者提供专业服务；咨访关系结束三年内，不得与寻求专业服务者或其家庭成员发生任何形式的性或亲密关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来访者与咨询师因不当亲密与性关系而陷入争议，在中国心理学界，并非首次出现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年，心理咨询师王星波因与来访者发生不当性关系，被投诉至“中国心理学会临床与咨询心理学专业机构与专业人员注册系统伦理分委员会”，王星波当时是该注册系统的注册督导师。经过近半年的内外调查和当事人质证，该伦理分委会最终确认：王星波明确违背中国心理协会《伦理守则》，并被该注册系统除名。这是国内第一起被该注册系统公示的违反伦理案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，湖南心理咨询师罗登国，被长沙中级人民法院二审判定强制猥亵罪。该案终审判决文件显示，2017年5月起，被害人褚某因患抑郁症和双相情感障碍，在罗登国处寻求心理咨询服务5次。咨询过程中，罗登国主动和来访者谈起性相关的话题，并采用被褚某误认为心理治疗的方法，多次对被害人实施猥亵行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京大学临床心理学博士、大儒心理创始人徐凯文是中国心理学会心理工作咨询师委员会委员、伦理工作组组长，2014年时任该委员会秘书长和伦理委员，曾作为王星波事件伦理工作小组成员参与调查。他也曾作为组员参与了《伦理守则》第二版的修订。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据多次伦理事件的处理经验，徐凯文总结了心理工作中性与亲密争议可能的五种情形，并分别提出处理方向：一、咨询师确实实施性侵行为，属刑事问题，应走司法途径；二、咨询中存在不当性关系，属伦理问题，中国心理学会等专业协会需处理；三、咨询中产生了性移情，即来访者和咨询师之间产生情感反应，属临床议题，咨询师可与督导讨论；四、来访者有钟情妄想，可能有精神疾病，需要精神医疗帮助；五、诬告，属于法律问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于李松蔚事件，徐凯文对南方周末记者说，在事实尚未明确前，他不对该事件做出评价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月底，围绕咨询中可能存在的伦理不当和性侵害情形，徐凯文接受了南方周末的专访。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“我们没有办法完全判定他是不是完全自愿”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2014年的王星波事件是国内第一起被“注册系统”公示的咨询师与来访者不当性关系伦理投诉案，你当时作为伦理工作小组的成员，具体做了哪些工作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;来访者提出投诉，我们根据来访者提供的大量相关证据，经过先后历时近一年的调查取证，确认事实以后，我们伦理工作小组经过多轮讨论，按照《伦理守则》，提出处分意见。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在证明来访者遭遇性侵或性骚扰时，哪些可以成为证据？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得这个是很困难的，因为要证明两个人在单独相处的时候有过性关系，是不容易的。但是如果来访者能够提供比如暧昧的短信、微信，有咨询关系以外的联系，这样可以间接证明他们确实有过性关系的信息，在这种情况下，应该还是可以间接证明确实发生过不当的性关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2019到2021年，你担任过一位来访者的专家辅证人，当时的情况是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;就是咨询师和来访者发生了不当的性和亲密关系，来访者感到被伤害，所以来访者就状告了咨询师。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;专家辅证人在类似的性争议事件里起到什么作用？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;告诉法官为什么一个口腔科医生和他的病人谈恋爱不违反他的职业道德，但是一个心理咨询师和他的来访者发生性和亲密关系就是违反职业道德。因为心理咨询建立在信任的基础上，来访者向我们坦诚展示他内心的一切，首先根本上不是因为信任我们这个人，而是信任我们的职业。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打个比方，我做过一个阑尾炎的手术，全麻，全麻意味着我在大概在三四个小时中，完全失去对身体的控制，开个玩笑说是“任人宰割”。但是我为什么躺在手术台上“任人宰割”？我要解决我的阑尾炎。首先是因为我信任我的医生，不会因为我失去意识，做任何伤害我的事情，反而是帮助我。但是我跟这个医生可能根本就不认识，我为什么会信任一个不认识的人？是因为我信任的是职业，不是信任这个人。而且这里面也是有法律保障的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么心理咨询的过程跟做手术的过程相似的地方在于，只有来访者全然地信任我们，可以在我面前坦陈他经历过的一切痛苦、悲伤、羞耻、伤害，我们才有可能更好地帮助到他。那么我们要赢得这种信任，就不能辜负这种信任，而来访者来寻求帮助的时候，必定是脆弱的，他是容易受伤害的，他很痛苦，需要帮助，所以他是处在一个心理脆弱的状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来访者对我们的信任是心理咨询能够有效进行的前提和基础，所以绝对不能够破坏这种信任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更不能够利用这种信任去获取不当的利益。比如，如果我做一个咨询，我收他100块钱，但是来访者觉得很有帮助，要多给我100块钱，这也是不可以的。或者他要送我一个昂贵的礼物表示感谢，也是不可以的。这里面都涉及额外获益。因为我掌握了你内心的秘密，所以我理论上有可能会利用我对你内心秘密的掌握，去要挟你答应我的一些不恰当的要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像为什么高校里的老师不能跟学生发生性和亲密关系，因为他会决定你能不能拿到学分，能不能毕业，能不能拿到学位，这种权力上的不平等就有可能被滥用，产生不当利益的情形。为了避免这种情况，我们这个行业的职业伦理道德就要求任何这样不当的、额外的获益都不可以获得。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果有违反《伦理守则》的行为，哪怕来访者是自愿的，也会被认为是涉嫌违反心理咨询伦理。因为我们没有办法完全判定他是不是完全自愿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你去年督导过一个公益心理咨询项目，当时有一个高校的咨询师遭遇性相关指控，能否展开讲讲？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;涉及来访者和咨询师的隐私，我不能说太多细节。简单地讲，是来访者认为咨询师对她有这种性意味的行为。学校进行了非常认真的调查。当然，谁指控谁举证。你认为对方是怎么性骚扰你的，要提供相关证据，比如老师给学生发过非常暧昧的、有性意味的短信、微信，都被认为违反师德规范，至少要有这样间接的材料。这位投诉的学生没有提出这样的证据，谈的都是她的主观感受，也没有发生实质性的行为，那当然这个指控就不成立。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;注册系统除名是最重的处罚&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《中国心理学会临床与咨询心理学工作伦理守则(第二版)》涉及性关系的规则有两条，这两条的制定是出于怎样的考虑？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这个规则的制定实际上是心理咨询行业的共识。类似这样的规定在国外早就有了，从这个意义上来说，是向国外心理学界学习的结果。这样一种不当性关系会对来访者造成比较严重的身心的损害，所以是一个明令禁止的行为。心理咨询伦理当中最重要的原则就是善行原则，以来访者利益最大化为利益第一，是我们工作的宗旨。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那这些年，《伦理守则》里和性有关的规定有发生变化吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;基本没有。如果说有什么变化的话，那么包括以电子方式发生性和亲密关系的行为，也是被禁止的，是违反伦理的。网络性爱这种没有发生实际身体接触的也被算在里边。在咨询关系里，所有跟来访者有任何形式的性和亲密关系，都被认为是对来访者的剥削、伤害和利用。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;网络性爱怎么界定？没有身体接触的情况下，网络上的表白、调情、暧昧等是否算在内？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这方面暂时还没有实践的案例。据我所知，我国对于网络性爱、虚拟性爱目前也还没有相关法律规定。但经过三年疫情后，网络电话等远程咨询越来越发展，因此发生这样问题的可能性越来越大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从心理学的角度上来说，如果咨询师对于来访者实施了不当的性行为，会在心理上对来访者造成怎样的伤害？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我想对他可能造成的创伤最主要是在信任层面。因为来访者相信我们会以他的利益为重，相信我们会保守他的秘密，我们不会利用来访者对咨询师的信任去做伤害他的事情，但是这一切就发生了，那么他进而可能会对所有人难以建立信任。因为他可能受到过他人的伤害，这种伤害如果在咨询关系中再次发生的话，伤害可能会显得更严重。应该被信任的咨询师都不可信任，可能所有人都不可信，或者大多数人都不能信任。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;相比一般情况下的性骚扰或性侵，当它在咨询师和来访者之间发生，会带来附加的伤害吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;无论什么职业，性侵或者性骚扰的行为首先都是违反法律的。如果来访者是非自愿的，那就是性侵和性骚扰，是法律问题。但如果来访者是自愿的，在其他行业可能不是问题，但是对我们这个行业来说，它就是伦理问题。因为你可能利用了来访者对心理咨询职业的信任。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当一个女性来访者，在心理咨询过程当中感受到了这方面的不适，现在心理咨询行业里，有没有可以投诉的渠道？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;可以向中国心理学会临床心理学注册工作委员会的伦理工作组投诉，但是投诉的渠道不一定能够非常适用，因为这是一个学术组织的伦理投诉机制，它并不是一个国家政府性质的机构，如果被投诉的咨询师不是中国心理学会临床心理学注册工作委员会的成员，就很难去做后面的投诉处理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;也就是说，在国内，如果一个人想成为心理咨询师，并没有准入门槛？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对。目前来说没有严格意义上的准入门槛。原来是有人社部的心理咨询师考试，但是这个考试2017年停止了。现在除了当时已经获得人社部心理咨询师资质的（心理咨询师），以及精神科医生和心理治疗师外，其他从业者并没有明确的证照。我们国家这方面的证照制度还没有建立起来。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;是否可以理解为，在“注册系统”里注册的这些咨询师可以被视为正规从业者？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得可以，但不能说只有“注册系统”的人员才是正规的。也有大量受过很好训练的，包括获得硕士甚至博士学位的，包括留学回来的（人员），以及有丰富临床经验和良好职业操守的咨询师并没有参加注册，因为这不是一个强制性的国家标准。所以这不能是唯一的标准，但是它是一个靠谱的标准。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《伦理守则》看上去只是一种行业约束，遇到具体的性争议事件时，中国心理学会能起到什么作用？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;就像你刚刚提到的王某某（注：王星波）的情况，这应该就是最典型的华人世界第一起不当性关系伦理投诉案。但是我们做的事情也就是对他进行永久除名，也就是说他不再能够被接受成为“注册系统”的注册人员——注册心理师或注册督导师。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这是现在能做出的最严格的反应吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;哪怕被系统除名，被投诉的咨询师仍可以继续进行心理咨询工作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，理论上来讲是这样的。实际上解决的方式就应该建立证照制度，就像医师有证照，如果被吊销执照，他就不能行医，否则就是非法行医，甚至要追究刑事责任。但是我们现在还没有建立证照制度，所以在这一点上比较困难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;对道德自律性要求比较高的行业&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有文献认为，性伦理失范在来访者侧显示为“情欲性移情”（erotic&amp;nbsp;tranference）和“情欲化移情”（eroticized transference），这是否是你所说的“性移情”？在咨询关系里，为什么会有性移情的产生？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有各种各样的原因，可能很难用一句话概括。比如来访者有过被性侵的经历，然后她可能会产生一种心理，觉得自己所有的价值就是在于她的身体，那么她要用她的身体去获得有权力、有权威的人的认可，这是一种可能性，这是非常个体化的。所以很难讲哪一条是绝对的，要看具体的情况。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，心理咨询关系也是一种人际关系，一种专业的、职业的人际关系。在心理咨询和心理治疗过程中，咨询师会以来访者为中心，去深入地共情、理解、感受来访者并给与回应，这是一种全然的关心和无条件的支持，既是专业的也存在某种非现实性，因为这样的几乎单向的、全然以来访者为中心的人际关系，在现实生活中是一种理想化的存在。因为即便是最亲密的家人、朋友间的人际关系，也是双向的，既会给予和付出，也会得到同样类似的支持和回报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾经和一位爱上自己的咨询师来投诉的来访者访谈过，她在咨询中会感受到咨询师是世界上最能理解和支持自己的人，也是最体贴和温暖的人，因此爱上了咨询师。但一旦进入了恋人甚至婚姻状态，来访者很快就感到越来越失望，因为她发现那个全然以她为中心的人一旦变成了恋人和夫妻，也会对自己有情感诉求以及并不能全然以自己为中心了。继而这种失望导致婚姻关系的破裂，甚至导致对对方当时和自己相恋的动机的怀疑，最后还对簿公堂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种从天堂到地狱的感受转变就是跨越了专业咨询关系的界限，发生性和亲密关系必然的结果。但并不是说，咨询关系为来访者提供这样的安全、信任、温暖、支持的关系是不真实或不科学的，来访者在其现实生活中遭遇了困难和挫折，产生了心理的痛苦和困扰，因此来寻求帮助，咨询师为其提供心理疗愈的环境，就好像一个人生病后，需要住到非常洁净的医院病房里，有专业的医生、护士提供专业科学的医疗设备、环境、营养、药物来帮助其提高免疫力，恢复健康，甚至在其免疫力低下时还要住进无菌室，负压病房，病人在医生、护士的精心照料下，增强抵抗力，恢复免疫力，健康后就能出院正常生活了——在心理咨询中，来访者就能具备自己解决好自己的人际关系、亲密关系问题的能力，这个时候就能结束咨询了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来访者感到自己爱上咨询师并不是错，但可能是错觉。咨询师需要清晰地认识到这一点，并将其作为咨询中重要的临床议题进行专业的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;来访者是否需要避免这种性移情？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得性移情的发生是有某种必然性的。它不是一个可怕的事情，它是个很正常的心理现象。所以如果发生这样情况，应该在咨询中加以讨论和解决，这本身是咨询重要的议题。这是一个专业问题。咨询师遇到这样问题，如果没有经验，可以去跟他的督导或者他的上级的咨询师讨论，怎么样更好地帮助来访者处理好这一切。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果咨询师对来访者产生了反移情，这种情况下怎么办？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;咨询师也有可能会出现这种情况，咨询师也是人，也有七情六欲，也有他自己没有解决好的个人议题。他确实可能会错把来访者的性移情当作是爱情，或者甚至于爱上来访者。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是咨询师的训练和职业道德要求，无论什么情况下，我们都不可以跟来访者有这样的性和亲密关系。这就好像是这个行业中，每个人都不折不扣去执行的法律。为何要执行这一条，是因为此前国外心理行业出现了很多这样的情况，对来访者造成了很大的伤害，对行业的声誉也造成很大伤害，所以是明令禁止的。如果他能够处理好这样的临床议题，当然最好；他处理不好，应该找督导；找了督导还是处理不好，他应该停止咨询，然后把咨询工作转介给更合适的咨询师，而不是继续做下去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这样的话，对于咨询师的道德自律性要求很高？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对。我们这个行业是对道德自律性要求比较高的行业。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果咨询师发出了不当的性或亲密接触邀请，来访者可以怎么保护自己？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;首先，建议来访者要有清晰的认识，在咨询中发生的性和亲密关系是在特定咨询环境中发生的，并非完全自然真实的情感，无论是来访者感到爱上了咨询师，还是咨询师向来访者表达爱意。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，建议告知咨询师，根据《伦理守则》，如果咨询师发出了性和亲密关系的邀请，咨询师已经违反了相关规定，可以要求其停止相关行为并建议其接受督导。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再次，如果咨询师继续有相关言语、行为，建议向咨询师所在机构进行投诉。如果咨询师本人就是机构负责人，或者这是私人机构，例如咨询师的个人工作室，建议考虑终止咨询关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;心理咨询行业应该建立证照制度&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你提到，心理咨询过程关于性与亲密的争议，还会涉及钟情妄想和诬告的情形，能否介绍一下这两种情况？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;钟情妄想是一个严重的精神疾病，比如经常有明星被疯狂的粉丝爱上，粉丝认为明星是爱他的，实际上明星见都没有见过他，明确否认对他有任何爱意。这是钟情妄想的例子。妄想就是跟现实不符，并且不能够被现实所纠正。妄想是基于生物遗传因素，不需要有任何现实基础和心理社会原因。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;诬告的情形通常是出于怎样的动机？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;诬告的情况，可能是对咨询师不满，为了毁掉咨询师的名誉，并没有依据事实或者捏造了一些事实，然后指控咨询师。所以我说，“事实是智慧”。先把事实搞清楚，究竟有没有过发生性和亲密关系？如果有，那么咨询师至少是违反了伦理，甚至违反法律。如果这个行为没有发生过，那么违法和违反伦理就无从谈起了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;诬告者需要付出怎样的代价？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;诬告主要是涉及名誉权的问题，侮辱、诽谤他人、损害他人名誉权的，有权要求停止侵害、恢复名誉，消除影响、赔礼道歉，并可以要求赔偿损失。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果核心证据缺失的情况下，伦理工作小组或整个心理学界、行业对性争议事件的处理方法是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这方面还是很困难的。确实要认定这个是很困难的，这个显然不是心理学家擅长的工作。所以谁主张，谁举证，需要有足够的直接或间接证据能证明该行为发生过。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;面对这类来访者和咨询师间的不当性关系，我们还能做什么来规避或减少类似情形的发生？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;让更多的来访者知道这一点，是会有帮助的。可能很多来访者不知道咨询师和来访者发生性关系这点违反咨询师的伦理道德，这个很值得去和公众宣传。当然来访者知道他能够拒绝，发生类似情况也知道怎么保护自己的话，这个显然是有效的方式。咨询师真的性侵来访者的情况不是没有，但是我想还是很少，犯罪行为毕竟是少数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当人们需要心理咨询服务，如何找到靠谱的咨询师？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;来访者要审慎地选择咨询师和咨询机构，就好像看病的时候也要小心，应该去正规医院是同样的道理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当寻求医疗诊治时，我知道什么是公立三甲医院，什么是私立医院。心理咨询行业有这样的分级吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;现在行业还没有成熟到这个程度，但是我想会有这么一天的，就好像二十多年前我刚开始当医生的时候，医疗行业也还没有成熟到现在这个程度，所以会有一个过程。我们也希望媒体能够帮助我们行业一起呼吁国家加强这方面的立法。现在有《中华人民共和国精神卫生法》相关的法律条文，但对于这个行业管理来说还是不够的，特别希望引起政府和法律界人士的重视，能够修订相关的法律。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《精神卫生法》是11年前颁布、10年前开始实施的，不够系统和全面，还不能够适应现代。现在的中国心理咨询行业不可同日而语，心理健康需求大大增加了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最简单直接的解决方式，就是建立执照制度。拿到执照才能够做心理咨询师，然后接受国家和行业协会的监管。如果有违反伦理、职业道德和法律的行为，他就会被吊销执照，如果在没有执照的情况下从事这样的工作，就是非法行医，可以追究刑事责任。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这一引发关注的规定，既反映了这些领域科研活动高度活跃、正取得肉眼可见的进步，也折射出某些科研突破的不仅是认知边界，还有伦理边界，确有厘清伦理边界、凝聚社会共识的必要性与紧迫性，因为这不只是科学家个人或所谓“内部”的事，而是涉及每一个人权利的“众人之事”。期间一些关于科研伦理的认识误区，亦有必要加以辨析与澄清。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，“科研活动是善的或至少是中性的，因此科研无禁区”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科研跟科研不一样，不能一概而论。数学家拿纸笔进行演算，物理学家用天文望远镜眺望宇宙、用粒子加速器试图轰开原子核窥探微观奥秘，说这些科研是善的没有问题。既拓展了人类的认知边界，树立了求真标杆，又对支撑人类社会存续的价值观没有冲击、反有增益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而对药物的人体试验、人脑接口、人造子宫、对人类胚胎与DNA的操作，显然很不一样。此类科研，不仅直接拿人当研究对象或人本身就是参与者，而且研究过程与可能的成果对人类社会本身就形成现实与潜在的重大冲击，包括但不限于生活方式与价值观方面，必须慎之又慎，在有社会共识前提下谨慎推进，才是对社会与文明负责任的态度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说严重些，如果让反人类分子进行此类研究，并将此类发现用于反人类目的，人类社会因此被毁灭也不是没有可能的。比如现在关于基因修饰、编辑的技术，成本与习得的门槛都越来越低，而这项技术对人类社会的存续来说不是中性的。过去发生过骇人听闻的事：拿人体当试验对象，研发细菌武器，这是对整个人类在犯罪。所以，1970年代国际社会形成了禁止生物武器公约，禁止发展、生产与储存此类武器。现在基因技术突飞猛进，如果不对此类技术加以管制，整个人类会面临空前的威胁。这种威胁比核毁灭的概率高多了。有风险不是最可怕的，最可怕的是无视风险而陷入自大与傲慢之中。科技伦理的重要性于此可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由此，“科研无禁区”之说难以成立。科研包括研究目的/效果与研究手段。就目的/效果而言，有善/利、中性、不善/不利及善恶/利弊参杂等多种可能；就手段而言，也有合法、合乎伦理与非法、悖逆伦理等不同情形。某个具体的科研领域、某种具体的科研活动，该不该设立禁区，该设立什么样的禁区，禁区是从研发环节一开始就设立还是设立在传播环节，要系统衡量具体的科研目的/效果与手段，不能一概而论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二、“科研是科学家的事儿，大众没有发言权”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于对第一点的分析，不难推知这一点也是不成立的。科研活动是科学家从事的高级认知活动，没有一定的天赋与专业训练做不来，这诚然是对的。 “争辩火箭发射用水洗煤还是无烟煤”，专业人士认真回复都算输。不过，除此之外，大众或纳税人有权过问的事儿多了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，如果科研活动本来就是纳税人的钱资助的，纳税人当然有权过问这钱使用的合理性，包括但不限于：这一项目对知识边界的拓展、对社会利益、对价值观的各种可能影响是什么，成本预算是否合理，科研手段是否合乎伦理，出来的成果有没有达到预期的目标。如果是私人资助，私人赞助人也就有权过问类似的问题。谁出钱，谁就有权过问，这反映了人类社会的基本伦理“受人之托，忠人之事”，是从事任何活动包括科研活动的伦理前提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，正如第一点所说，如果研究领域或研究活动使用人为研究对象，或者/而且对人类的生活方式、价值观、文明甚至智人作为一个物种存续本身有影响、冲击或威胁，那就是事关每一个人的切身权益，社会的每一分子都有权过问，研究不由纳税人资助或“个人自由”或“科研高贵神圣、是精英活动”等都不是逃避大众过问的理由。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;综上，大众有权过问的两大理由，正是必须要有科技伦理的根源所在。在这个意义上，科技伦理也不神秘，只是人类社会每一个人都要遵循的普遍伦理与价值观在科研领域的体现：如果你从事的任何活动是有人资助之下进行的，那你就要接受资助人的问责；如果你从事的活动对第三方或社会有现实或潜在的“负外部性”，你就要有效控制之，不得为所欲为。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Japanese Translation and Research of Zhou Zuoren&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;After coming to Japan to study, although I did not specialize in literature, I liked reading Chido&#39;s works when I was in China, and I have always paid attention to the research on him in Japanese academic circles. Interestingly, Japanese Zhidang research is also troubled by political issues. Although there were scholars like Shigeo Matsueda who were loyal to Chido before the war and began to translate and study it, due to political reasons after World War II, there were very few scholars who studied Chido, and translations were also rare. I have seen only one copy, which is &quot;Essays of Zhou Zuoren&quot; translated by Shigeo Matsueda (Toyamabo Encyclopedia Library, 1996), this book is a new compilation of an old book. After World War II, Matsue also co-translated &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s Hometown&quot;, but his new translation was only this one volume. Hu Shih&#39;s treatment was even worse. Only recently has a biography been published. It was a translation of &quot;Hu Shih and the Chinese Renaissance&quot; by American sinologist Grider, which has been published in China for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after I started graduate school in the mid-1990s, a teacher gave me &quot;The Sorrow of the Oriental People: Zhou Zuoren and Japan&quot; written by Liu Anwei, a PhD student in comparative literature at the University of Tokyo. More than ten years ago, Liu Anwei went a step further and wrote a book called &quot;The Biography of Zhou Zuoren: The Spiritual History of a Literary Man of the Zhini School&quot;, which won the prestigious Watsuji Tetsuro Cultural Award. In order to study Zhitang, Liu Anwei even studied ancient Greek. He discussed the ancient Greek classics translated by Zhitang in the book. This made me curious and wanted to read it in full one day. Recently, Liu Anwei also co-published the Japanese translation of &quot;Reminiscences of Zhitang&quot;, which provides Japanese readers with good biographical information. In addition to Liu Anwei, some Japanese scholars have also been doing Zhitang research in recent years. For example, Professor Ogawa Toshiyasu, who participated in the editing of &quot;Notes from Zhou Zuoren to Shigeo Matsueda&quot;, recently published &quot;Traitor and Hermit: Zhou Zuoren in the 1920s&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, some of Chido&#39;s works have been published in Japanese, such as &quot;Nihon Tan Yi Shu&quot; (Toyo Bunko, 2002) compiled by Chinese literature expert Kiyama Hideo, which includes four &quot;Japanese Glimpses&quot; There are forty-six essays included. As the title of the book indicates, they are all about Japanese culture. The most important one should be the five-volume &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Reading Miscellaneous Notes&quot; compiled by Nakajima Nagabumi, a Chinese literature expert and one of the translators of &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; (Toyo Bunko, 2018). When I saw an advertisement for Toyo Bunko published in the Asahi Shimbun five years ago, the author was shocked because I had the impression that Toyo Bunko had never published five books by the same person. I really admire the courage of this publishing house. After all, it is an old publishing house that has published Japan&#39;s best encyclopedia and &quot;Collected Works of Lin Dafu&quot; and other good books. By chance, I recently borrowed this set of books and read several translations and explanations carefully. I found that it is indeed a good translation that has put a lot of effort into it. It is worth introducing it to domestic readers and seeing how Japanese scholars read it. Zhitang&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/WmMqi6PYTz5zGEB8gOK40WZxUx6wNB8MsL1VybUE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;627&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/WmMqi6PYTz5zGEB8gOK40WZxUx6wNB8MsL1VybUE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253505&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Zuoren and his friends are in Kuyu Zhai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The best Japanese version of Chido&#39;s works&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;We know that Zhitang read countless books throughout his life, and many of the articles he wrote were related to books. In the words of his student Zhang Zhongxing, Zhitang ranks among the best among the older generation in terms of the amount of reading and the variety of reading. Therefore, Professor Nakajima compiled and selected Zhidou&#39;s articles from the perspective of reading. It was a very insightful decision to name this set of books &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Reading Miscellaneous Notes&quot;. It can be said that it captured the main thread of Zhidou&#39;s lifelong pursuit of knowledge. The text used as the translation base was &quot;Zhitang Shuhua&quot; which I had read back then. However, he used a newer version, a two-volume version published by Renmin University of China Press in 2004. The &quot;Chitō Preface and Postscripts&quot; that was published at about the same time as &quot;Chitō Shuhua&quot; was basically not included in the collection, because in Professor Nakajima&#39;s opinion, Chitō wrote the preface and postscript to the books he had personally seen, and as a translator, he had to verify them one by one. It&#39;s not easy, I have to give up. In order to fully reflect the complete picture of Chitou&#39;s works, Professor Nakajima said that he also referred to &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Collected Works&quot;, &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Humanities Collection&quot;, &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Complete Prose Collection&quot; and &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Complete Translations&quot;, which means that it is a fact Above are five volumes selected from all the works. The translator&#39;s seriousness in choosing the original text for translation is truly admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After determining the general direction, how to arrange the specific volumes is also a very difficult matter. After all, the articles written by Zhitang cover a wide range of knowledge and the number of articles is amazing. In his own words, his knowledge is &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;miscellaneous knowledge&quot;. Therefore, Nakajima simply placed the autobiographical article &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot; at the beginning of the first volume. This is the best introduction, allowing Japanese readers who are not familiar with Chido to have an overview of this foreign literati and thinker. learn. After all, compared to his brother, his popularity in Japan is vastly different. Lu Xun&#39;s articles have even been included in Japanese middle school Chinese textbooks. The first volume is after &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot;, and the translator also divided it into sub-categories such as reading theory, banned books, and book records, and included related articles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/BFTwoxiZlzn2Qnf35InJvKi9MDrcUHerQuqXJzTg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;897&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/BFTwoxiZlzn2Qnf35InJvKi9MDrcUHerQuqXJzTg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253506&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two scholars who had a greater influence on Zhou Zuoren are Ailisi on the left and Kunio Yanagida on the right. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second volume is mainly articles related to folk customs. Zhitang&#39;s concern for folk customs lasted throughout his life, and he was a very prominent figure in the history of modern Chinese culture. In Nakajima’s words, in terms of mythology and folklore, Chido can be regarded as the founder of modern Chinese related knowledge. He is not only familiar with the knowledge of the British classical master Ms. Jane Harrison, but also highly respects modern Japanese folklore. Kunio Yanagida, the founder of the school. The third volume includes articles related to women and sexuality. Nakajima said that Chido’s motivation for being very concerned about women and sexual issues is still unclear even now, but at least he was ideologically influenced by the British scholar Ellis. Including relevant articles in the third volume is also a very discerning choice. After all, this is an extremely important part of Zhitang&#39;s lifelong study and thinking. Zhitang said that the one who had the greatest influence on him was Elisabeth. According to Zhang Zhongxing, Zhitang has read more than three million words of Elis&#39;s works, including the seven-volume &quot;Research on Sexual Psychology&quot;, which shows the great influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is no unified standard for the classification of this set of Japanese translations of Chido&#39;s reading miscellanies. Nakajima said that starting from the middle of the third volume, the classification changed from title to classification. He said that it was actually inspired by &quot;I The influence of &quot;Miscellaneous Studies&quot; is basically similar to the classification of Zhitang Shuxue. The fourth volume is composed of Zhitang&#39;s articles discussing old and new Chinese literature. The fifth volume contains many articles about notes, as well as old novels. Zhitang loved to read notes throughout his life. We can know from his collection that he read a large number of notes from past dynasties. Needless to say, his writing style was also affected. Many of his own articles are good notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After carefully reading Professor Nakajima’s selection and classification, the author feels that the articles he selected have included Chido’s lifelong academic thoughts. The author has also read some translations, and the quality is very good. It should be said that these five volumes of translations have provided Japanese readers with trustworthy texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/yviJvXqfXrRQF1Q5rv3EoAwXtz8iZwH82btzm5K3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;838&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/yviJvXqfXrRQF1Q5rv3EoAwXtz8iZwH82btzm5K3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253507&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Anwei from the Institute of Liberal Arts Education, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and his representative work &quot;The Biography of Zhou Zuoren&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Tokyo Institute of Technology website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;An unmissable explanation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I I originally thought that I had been reading Chitou&#39;s works for many years, and I didn&#39;t care if I didn&#39;t read the explanations attached to each book. However, after reading a few pages, I realized that I was completely wrong. When I patiently read the five-volume commentary, I was first moved by the translator&#39;s efforts, because each commentary was very long, some nearly thirty pages, and the shortest nearly ten pages. In order to make it easier for Japanese readers to read, in addition to introducing a lot of background materials, the most interesting part is the part where Professor Nakajima talks about his views on Chido. There are not only praises, but also sharp criticisms, and some from the Japanese perspective. Some of his profound insights have never been discovered before. Here are some selected ones to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when talking about Zhitang&#39;s concern for mythology and folklore, Nakajima pointed out that Zhitang&#39;s related work was all carried out in his study, and he only collected two hundred works in Shaoxing in 1913. A nursery rhyme. Nakajima said that this was very different from Yanagida Kunio, whom Chitou admired. Yanagida Kunio traveled all over Japan to collect folklore materials and established a set of learning rules for Japanese folklore. Nakajima also pointed out that as both study-type scholars, Chitou is different from Fraser, the author of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, because he does not engage in classification work or analyze data, which means that he does not do systematic work. This point is indeed to the point. Maybe it has something to do with Zhitang&#39;s way of doing academics. After all, he has never felt the need or pressure to write a paper, and has always written in the form of essays. Nakajima&#39;s criticism also made the author have some associations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard a saying before that Zhou Zuoren is known as the best Japanese scholar in China, but he is not a real scholar who studies Japan. At first glance, I was shocked because I instinctively refuted it. Is there any Chinese scholar who knows more about Japanese culture than Chitou? But thinking about it calmly, Chido did not conduct research on Japanese culture by writing a paper. He mainly wrote his observations and analysis of Japanese culture in the form of essays. The same goes for his work on folklore and mythology. Nakajima pointed out that the same characteristics are also reflected in Chido’s focus on and research on women and sexual psychology. He said that Zhitang&#39;s method is based on conscious individuals and is not combined with mass movements, so in practice the effect is zero. In other words, Zhitang wanted to enlighten people through articles, but the result was like waiting for the Yellow River to clear up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/V8zfMLkNUczfDZ2Tuxrg5j0WLCv7gX9cU7keGaF0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/V8zfMLkNUczfDZ2Tuxrg5j0WLCv7gX9cU7keGaF0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253508&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Zuoren in his later years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a saying that the best way to read is to translate. As a translator, Nakajima can be said to have thoroughly read Chido&#39;s major works, and as a result of repeated scrutiny, he has an understanding of Chido&#39;s texts that ordinary readers do not have. For example, one of the issues pointed out by Nakajima, which I have not paid much attention to before, is the understanding of Yanagida Kunio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chido has an article about Yanagida Kunio&#39;s masterpiece &quot;Tono Monogatari&quot;, and the title of the article is &quot;Tono Monogatari&quot;. Nakajima said that when Chitō read Yanagita’s book, he read it in the same way as when he read Hao Yixing and Yu Zhengxie, that is, based on the criteria of thoroughness of thought and readability of the article, but for the most important thing Yanagida’s article wanted to convey, It&#39;s folklore, but I don&#39;t pay too much attention to it, that is to say, I don&#39;t look at it from a cultural perspective. In other words, Chido admits that Yanagita&#39;s book has both the beauty of writing and the value of folklore, but he seems unable to see what he has excavated from Yanagita&#39;s folklore and what he has elaborated on it. Such criticism reminds me of Chido’s own words. He said he just likes to read miscellaneous books and learn more about things. I am neither a scholar nor a scholar, I am just doing odd jobs. Comparing the two sides, it may be easier to understand. Nakajima also said that there is no harm in appreciating Yanagita&#39;s article as a good text, but if the folklore meaning is not read, misunderstandings are likely to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Sino-Japanese relations were deteriorating, Chitou expressed his confusion about his Japanese research. For example, in &quot;Japanese Insights No. 4&quot; written in June 1937, he said that he admired the beautiful Japan cannot be linked to Japan, which invaded China in reality. Chitou confessed that he could not understand Japan like that, and said that he usually felt that the Japanese nation was very different from China, and that was religious beliefs. To borrow Yanagita Kunio&#39;s statement, the Japanese worship rituals often show a state of &quot;harmony between gods and gods&quot;. Chido said that Japan&#39;s upper-class intellectual circles have absorbed Chinese Confucianism and Indian Buddhism, and in modern times have added Western philosophy and science. However, the fundamental belief of the nation seems to be Shintoism from Southeast Asia, which has always dominated the thoughts and feelings of the people. . Nakajima also talked about this part. He said that although Chitou said that he did not understand, in fact, he had basically pointed out the truth of the matter here, because Chitou said that if he could understand the psychology of the strong man who carries the shrine, he would Able to understand Japan&#39;s actions against China. Nakajima said that here Chido finally made full use of Yanagita&#39;s folklore results not from a literary perspective but from a folklore perspective. The analysis of Japan&#39;s invasion of China was not just from the perspective of upper-class politicians, soldiers and intellectuals, but from the perspective of upper-class politicians, soldiers and intellectuals. Turn your attention to the people. Yanagita&#39;s purpose in studying folklore is to unearth those thinking and psychological mechanisms that cannot be simply rationalized. They are accumulated in the unconsciousness of the group and restrict the behavior of the people. Nakajima said that Chido had studied Yanagita for so many years, and now he really understood what Yanagita was talking about. Nakajima&#39;s analysis is indeed very sharp, because this is an issue that is difficult for us Chinese readers to detect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/7foPziv5ixeyj6RBwyROIxk3eYlqFwezpIuIEz8w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height= &quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/7foPziv5ixeyj6RBwyROIxk3eYlqFwezpIuIEz8w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253513&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese scholar Yoshikawa Kojiro. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I remembered the words of another great scholar, Kojiro Yoshikawa, recalling his meeting with Chitō. . At the beginning of the article &quot;The Significance and Methods of Foreign Studies&quot;, Yoshikawa said that he met Chido in Beijing shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. He said Chitou told him that his Japanese studies paid too much attention to the Chinese-influenced aspects of Japanese culture and did not pay enough attention to Japanese religion. These were fatal flaws. Yoshikawa said he answered bluntly that it was indeed the case. In fact, he spoke highly of Chido&#39;s Japanese studies, because in his opinion, most Chinese people at that time did not recognize the uniqueness of Japanese culture, but Chido loved Japan deeply and advocated that Japan had its own culture. In this regard, Yoshikawa believed that Japan People and the Japanese government should express their gratitude. However, in his view, Zhou Zuoren’s Japanese research was actually too biased towards the Heian period, towards the late Edo and Meiji periods of a certain school of literati (should refer to the Shirakaba school), and although these can be said to represent Japanese literature era, but it cannot represent the era of Takeshi in Japan. Even if we cannot say that these are very Chinese parts of Japanese culture, they are indeed an era that Chinese intellectuals can easily understand. Yoshikawa went on to say that Japan still has eras of representative martial arts, such as the Kamakura shogunate, and the religions of Nichiren and Shinran that emerged in the Kamakura period play an important role in Japanese history. These Japanese people are very aware. However, it has been almost completely ignored in Chido&#39;s Japanese studies. The reason for this is that Yoshikawa believes that the Chinese people attach great importance to literature. Japan&#39;s national character of attaching importance to martial arts is inconsistent with Chinese tradition. Yoshikawa said there is another reason, and that is the lack of religion in Chinese culture. Yoshikawa believed that Confucianism was strongly opposed to the idea of ​​finding an ideal world after death, in a super-sensory place separated from the human world. Although this tendency was weakened by the entry of Buddhism, it soon rebounded and was completely finalized by the time of Confucianism in the Song Dynasty. Japan is the opposite of China, and it is here that Japan has its most special place. In Yoshikawa&#39;s view, because Japan was the opposite of China in terms of religion, even the erudite Chido was not interested in it, so his research on Japan was biased, which also led to his inability to understand Japan&#39;s military operations. Yoshikawa even said that Japan’s China studies should take Chido as a lesson and reflect on whether they have made the same mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/QLGfbMLg0t57Taac0rf6AigiLRR5K4hQIArMoTnh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height= &quot;807&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/QLGfbMLg0t57Taac0rf6AigiLRR5K4hQIArMoTnh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jiang Baili. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yoshikawa&#39;s analysis and criticism of Chido&#39;s Japanese studies can be seen together with Nakajima&#39;s More complete. The author believes that Jiang Baili, a contemporary of Chitang, has the most accurate understanding of the martial side of Japanese culture. After all, Jiang Baili had a military background, attended a Japanese military academy, and had some friends in the Japanese military circles. He was very familiar with Japan. The grasp of characteristics is most accurate among Chinese Nippon Tongli, and some views even predicted the outcome of the war. We will understand after reading his &quot;Japanese—A Study of a Foreigner&quot;. Although Chido is proficient in Japanese culture and has many friends in the literary and art circles in Japan, his Japanese studies do have problems with the study style. His misjudgment of the situation may also have something to do with this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Zhitang&#39;s unique literary outlook, of course he will mention his high evaluation of short essays in the late Ming Dynasty. Nakajima&#39;s explanatory essays not only set off a craze in China, but also influenced Chinese literature researchers in Japan across the sea. The author is very ignorant and this is the first time I have heard of this. Nakajima said that as far as he knew, at least two famous scholars were affected. One was Iriya Yoshitaka, and the other was Ogawa Tamaki, who was the first to introduce Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Selected Annotations to Song Poems&quot; in Japan. Yoshitaka Iriya has researched Ming Dynasty literature and is also known for his research on Zen Buddhism. According to Nakajima, Ogawa Tamaki did not directly study the late Ming Dynasty sketch essays, but he always loved reading Chitou&#39;s articles. He followed the lead and collected most of the books mentioned in Chitou&#39;s articles, and now they are all collected in the Ogawa Bunko. Nakajima said that he benefited a lot from Ogawa Bunko when translating. When I read this, I thought it was a coincidence, because I have a set of &quot;Collected Works of Ogawa Tamaki&quot; published by Chikuma Shobo, which is very close to Chido&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/tlWHtV0tNa5wFO8rUzmU751NJYEPwcQ0G0F2ZXMx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height= &quot;766&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/tlWHtV0tNa5wFO8rUzmU751NJYEPwcQ0G0F2ZXMx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253514&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hello Takeuchi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Enlightenment and falling into the water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In summary Zhitang When it comes to the characteristics of a lifetime&#39;s work, Nakajima said it can be summed up in four words: &quot;physical human feelings.&quot; For Zhitang, this &quot;physical favor&quot; is not only the standard of value for judging literary works, but also the standard for judging all things. This point of view is completely consistent with Zhang Zhongxing&#39;s point of view in the article &quot;Re-Talk about Kuyu Zhai&quot;. Nakajima also said that to sum it up in more popular terms is &quot;reasonable thinking and humane feelings&quot;, which is the essence of the Enlightenment spirit that Chido absorbed from his own civilization and foreign ideas. At the same time, this is also the most important prescription Zhitang wants to use to solve China&#39;s fundamental problems. Nakajima said that precisely because of this, his contribution should not be erased because of political missteps. Interestingly, Nakajima changed his tone at this time and talked about the difficulties encountered by this enlightenment spirit in the 21st century. He said that he originally thought that this &quot;physical human relationship&quot; that integrated the essence of Eastern and Western thought would still be effective in another hundred years. However, after entering the 21st century, he found that almost all his ideals were shattered, so he began to doubt whether this enlightenment spirit also had limitations. . The reason for this suspicion is that the Japanese have already led a life of abundant food and clothing, and education is universal. Almost everyone can enter high school, and nearly 60% of them can enter university. Regardless of quality, this is an astonishing number. It stands to reason that this number is very close to the ideals held by people with lofty ideals in modern times, but irresponsibility is prevalent in society where no one is responsible (this is reminiscent of the &quot;irresponsibility system&quot; said by the famous political thinker Maruyama Masao) ), the democratic system seems to have turned into populism, which can be said to have the tendency of obscurantism. In this case, how to promote &quot;physical favors&quot;? If that were the case, wouldn’t all the efforts of the enlightenment sages back then be in vain? This question is too big, and I am not capable of answering it. However, Nakajima is very keenly aware of the serious problems that modern enlightenment may bring. Adorno and Horkheimer, who wrote &quot;Dialectics of Enlightenment&quot;, have long warned about this. , Nakajima is just repeating an old story. However, he was able to discuss the enlightenment concept of &quot;physical human relations&quot; together with the enlightenment trends in modern times, which shows his broad vision, because after all, our enlightenment is closely related to the West. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to write about Zhitang without mentioning his falling into the water. As mentioned earlier, Professor Nakajima believes that he cannot be completely dismissed because of this incident. This is consistent with the spirit of Mr. Zhong Shuhe’s saying that people should return to their own people and the article should return to the article. But how do you view this matter from a Japanese perspective? I remember that many years ago when I was reading Takeuchi Yoshi&#39;s &quot;Inside China&quot;, I saw him mention Chitou, and he said that we Japanese were sorry for him. Professor Nakajima said something similar in the explanation, but more specific, which moved me as a Chinese reader very much. He said that it was our grandfathers and fathers’ generation who carried Chitou out like a scarecrow in a wind and rain festival, made him sit on the shrine, and then threw it to the roadside outside the village. In other words, the great-grandfathers or great-grandfathers’ parents of those working in society today. Their names cannot be remembered, but they are all Japanese. We should not forget this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter what the external reasons are, it is Chitou’s own judgment after all, and the blame cannot be placed on others. However, the opinions of Takeuchi Yoshi and Nakajima Nagafumi, two Japanese scholars who have studied Chinese culture all their lives, If there is any Zhitang who knows this, he will definitely be very moved by these words. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Something about the translator of Zhitang&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After reading Professor Nakajima’s last explanation, I felt particularly respectful. He said that this translation work was originally proposed by the editor of Pingfanshe in 2005, and it took a total of 13 years. It was really a long and protracted battle. Considering his physical strength and age, it was not easy to last until the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Japanese Chido translators, he highlighted Shigeo Matsueda and Hideo Kiyama and paid tribute to them. In his later years, when sorting out Chitou&#39;s letters, Matsueda Shigeo once said, &quot;Half of his life, he fell in love with the Dream of Red Mansions, but his whole life, he fell in love with Zhou Zuoren.&quot; The former refers to his translation of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, and the latter, of course, refers to the correspondence between him and Chitou from their student days to Chitou&#39;s later years. Communicated. It is said that Matsueda Shigeo once planned to translate all Chido&#39;s works, but he was unable to realize this long-cherished wish. In 1973, his student Hideo Kiyama collected Chido&#39;s articles on Japanese culture and compiled them into the book &quot;Japanese Culture&quot;, which was the predecessor of &quot;Nihon Tan Yoshiro&quot; included in Toyo Bunko. Mushan also interviewed insiders and wrote a book about Zhitang&#39;s fall into the water, &quot;The whole story of Zhou Zuoren&#39;s cooperation with Japan - Supplementary Notes and Sequels to &quot;The Story of Kuzhu&#39;an in Beijing&quot;&quot;, which is unavoidable for all readers who are interested in that period of history. past works. He also assisted his octogenarian teacher in compiling and publishing the &quot;Essays of Zhou Zuoren&quot; mentioned earlier, which included thirty-nine famous articles written by Zhitang up to the 1930s. In addition to translation, Mr. Matsue, who rarely writes, wrote an article &quot;Mr. Zhou Zuoren&quot;. Although it was written in 1941, it is one of the best articles about Zhitang that the author has seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading Zhitang’s articles for so many years, I finally have the opportunity to write about Zhitang. It is still the old saying of Mr. Zhong Shuhe, people will return to their people, and the article will return to the article. Zhitang&#39;s political mistakes are indeed regrettable and make the readers who admire him feel worthless for him, because Hu Shi said that a wise man should understand lightly. and serious, but he made a judgment that shocked the people of the country. But his works have their own value of being handed down from generation to generation. After all, Zhitang left a valuable asset to the history of Chinese culture and thought, and some of his ideas still retain their brilliance. It is said that after Hu Shi returned to Taiwan in the 1950s, he asked people to collect Zhitang&#39;s works everywhere. He said that the works of this old friend were still worth reading since the May Fourth Movement. Although it is not without exaggeration, it also tells the undeniable truth. The work of Japanese scholars introduced in this article can also provide us with some new ideas for understanding Zhitang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[解构“讲课费”，数读藏起来的医药腐败丨H5]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258351]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打击缅北电诈有重要突破！揪出幕后“金主”、组织头目23名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258333]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;span>;From June 25 to September 30 this year, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Public Security Based on the characteristics of public security and the security and stability situation, we coordinated and directed the public security organs across the country to mobilize all police officers and go all out to carry out a summer public security crackdown and rectification operation to crack down on various illegal crimes and severely rectify outstanding public security problems, referred to as &quot;Summer Operation&quot;.

We have always maintained a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; attitude towards illegal crimes such as ticketing. In the &quot;Summer Operation&quot;, public security departments across the country insisted on focusing on both prevention and control and controlling the source, and mainly adopted measures in three aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, focused on carrying out a special attack on &quot;eradicating pornography, gambling and controlling the source&quot;.

In accordance with the unified deployment, public security agencies in various places carried out a series of special projects to &quot;eradicate pornography and gambling and control the source&quot; and arrested more than 7,000 suspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to deepen special operations to crack down on gun explosion crimes. Together with relevant police departments, we launched a cluster campaign on 4 major gun-related cases focusing on the three key areas of domestic manufacturing and trafficking, online sales, and overseas smuggling. We checked 3,084 clues involved and solved 53 cases. During the &quot;Summer Operation&quot;, the Ministry of Public Security organized more than 170 cities across the country to carry out intensive activities to destroy illegal firearms and explosives, safely destroying more than 140,000 firearms such as air rifles and shotguns, as well as a large number of explosives, detonators and other explosives confiscated in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to carry out in-depth special work to crack down on &quot;scalpers&quot;.

An old man had entered the last moments of his life, and a relative with whom he had a very good relationship was out of town. The old man’s children considered letting them see each other for the last time, so they prepared to use the ultimate method to Medical means extend the life of the old man and let him &quot;wait&quot; for his arrival. He considered and refused again and again, on the grounds that it would add unnecessary pain to the old man before he died. Even if it &quot;makes sense&quot; to him, it&#39;s not humane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone is afraid of the word &quot;old&quot;. Many people are desperately looking for beauty treatments, no matter how much money they spend, they are not afraid of getting old. There are also many people who are obviously old, but they are taboo about being called &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;. But physical aging is an objective law that no one can resist. &quot;Are you young? It doesn&#39;t matter, you will be old in two years.&quot; Zhang Ailing&#39;s famous saying fully expresses the impact of the law of aging on the illusion of &quot;eternal youth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Old&quot; can be divided into two situations. One is that the body ages and the body functions become weaker. The original straight back has collapsed, the original beautiful features have turned into a &quot;mess&quot;, the original speedy steps have turned into slowly moving steps with a cane... The second is psychological or spiritual aging. Some people have a good mentality and appear young, even if they are seventy or eighty years old, they are not old. Some people age faster than their peers under heavy pressure. The so-called &quot;a 30-year-old has a 60-year-old heart&quot; and &quot;premature aging&quot; all have this meaning. The latter type of people is actually more common. Their hallmark is that they want to work hard on the &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; every day, and they also frown and sigh all day long, accompanied by white hair and wrinkled faces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who are not involved in childbirth and are pampered, it is relatively easy to achieve the goal of aging slower. Even at different stages of a person, there are big differences. For example, the &quot;Sha Wujing&quot; who was leisurely swimming in the Liusha River back then must be more beautiful than the Sha Wujing who was walking on the road to seek Buddhist scriptures, eating and sleeping in the open and carrying everyone&#39;s luggage on his shoulders. Appear youthful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most people cannot have freedom of wealth, nor can they rely on others to support themselves without working. This will inevitably lead to people plotting for rice and trying their best to get tomorrow’s steamed buns. Because in reality, it is not easy to make a living, and there are all kinds of internal and external frictions all the time, so there are nine out of ten people who are exhausted both mentally and physically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What to do? As ordinary people, since we cannot change our situation, the only thing we can do is to take it lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once had a neighbor who was in his nineties and could ride a bicycle very fast. Why? In fact, he was not strong when he was young. Instead, he had problems here and there, but he just had a good mentality. Whether you encounter a small trouble or encounter a hurdle that others may think is almost insurmountable, you should be able to deal with it calmly, think less, and worry less. Such people should live longer. &quot;Be heartless and live a long life&quot; may not sound good, but the words are rough and rational, and the mentality of &quot;if you can afford it, let it go&quot; is worth learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person should work hard when working, and should also &quot;try hard&quot; to rest when resting. That is, he should neither be distracted when he should be working, always thinking about lying down, nor should he be lying down when he should be working. I always think about work when I am resting, and as a result, my work is not good and my rest is not good either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can enter the world and you can emerge from it. This is the highest state of life. It seems difficult to achieve, but it is not. How to work and how to rest is a science. As an individual, you must learn to adjust, relax the tight strings at the right time, balance work with rest, and laugh at gains and losses. This is a skill that can be mastered. If you can&#39;t do it the first time, do it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are afraid of old age and even talk about death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Speaking of &quot;die faster&quot;, this does not conform to the philosophy of many Chinese people. In contrast, it is greed for life and fear of death. Even if you die a moment later, it seems to be good. This is instinctive and understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to die slowly, many people (mainly family members of the deceased) do whatever they can to survive. As long as they can breathe one more breath in the human world, they are willing to suffer all kinds of hardships. This mentality has far-reaching influence. Most of the savings of many people&#39;s lives are not spent while enjoying life and raising children, but are thrown into the water in a &quot;surprise attack&quot; one or two months before death. Death is already an irreversible outcome. No matter how much money is spent, it is in vain. At most, it can delay the death a little. In the end, one person will lose both his life and property, and even his children and grandchildren will be burdened with heavy debts. It is really not worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of disease, some people are even &quot;scared to death&quot;. As soon as they heard that they had an incurable disease, they would fall into a state of panic and disorder, causing physical and mental harm and exacerbating physical diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult thing in life is to remain transparent on the subject of death. If a slower death equals long-term torture—including torture for children—then the meaning of life will also change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father told me that there was an old lady in the family who lived alone and lived to a ripe old age. She had done &quot;white things&quot; during her lifetime, and she became a favorite story in the village. If a person has seen through life and death, and the true meaning of &quot;disappearance&quot;, what is there to be afraid of, and why must he do it even though he knows it cannot be done? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To let go of life calmly is a kind of great love. It’s not about going against the trend and forcibly delaying death, it’s about cherishing life. Knowing the deadline, waving your hands and going away, isn’t it a kind of optimism towards life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is no need to doubt the significance of saving lives and healing the wounded. Reducing illness and pain in life is a legitimate pursuit. But what we need to take warning from is gambling-like “fighting” in order to die slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are reports that after someone learned that he had terminal cancer, he specifically told his closest relatives not to needless treatment, let alone to &quot;intubate&quot; himself when he was dying, so as not to spend more money. . Having such an open heart is a rational choice after insight. Of course, financial hardship is also one of the reasons, but in general, it is still based on optimism about life and great love for family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To grow old slowly and die quickly is my creed and pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
