Recently, a 30-year-old Ms. Zhu from Guangzhou developed fever, chills, weakness in her limbs, and coughed up yellow sputum. She originally thought it was a common cold, but she didn&#39;t get better. After a bronchoscopy, it was discovered that it was &quot;mycoplasma pneumonia.&quot; After targeted anti-infection He was discharged after improvement after treatment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;She has an inexplicable high fever that persists and cannot be relieved by ordinary treatments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;30-year-old Ms. Zhu is usually in good health, but she suddenly developed a fever recently. The maximum body temperature was 39.8°C, accompanied by chills, chills, and weakness in the limbs. She went to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor gave her ibuprofen to reduce fever and cephalosporins to fight infections, her symptoms were not significantly relieved. She then coughed up yellow and white sticky sputum that was difficult to cough up, especially at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, Ms. Zhu came to the outpatient department of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital to seek treatment. Dr. He Yaowei discovered through chest CT examination that she had an infectious lesion in the lower lobe of her right lung, so she was admitted to the hospital to further improve the examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The doctor found through bronchoscopy that there was a large amount of yellow-white sticky sputum in Ms. Zhu&#39;s right lower lung bronchus. Through rapid etiology testing, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; was discovered. In other words, Ms. Zhu suffered from the recently popular &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of her situation, the doctor gave her levofloxacin for targeted anti-infection and symptomatic support treatment such as cough and phlegm reduction. Ms. Zhu quickly improved and was discharged. &lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0c6bbfe3c842916de7086c6ad38f2062.jpeg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/0c6bbfe3c842916de7086c6ad38f2062.jpeg&quot; data -key=&quot;258779&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chest CT before treatment: Multiple small flakes and patchy increased density can be seen in the lower lobe of the right lung , the density is uneven, the boundary is blurred, patchy consolidation shadows can be seen, and air bronchial shadows can be seen within them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/2a7c361a222986c53f627af6426d6189.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/2a7c361a222986c53f627af6426d6189.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258778&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Thorax CT after treatment: Multiple small flakes and patches of increased density in the lower lobe of the original right lung were significantly less dense than before. light. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mycoplasma pneumoniae is also an important causative agent of adult pneumonia&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Ruilin, director and chief physician of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital, explained that mycoplasma pneumonia is Acute pulmonary infection mainly caused by interstitial lesions caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae is significantly different from pneumonia caused by common bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae in clinical manifestations. Therefore, it is clinically distinguished from Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae and acute pneumonia. Pneumonia caused by other atypical pathogens such as grammaticis is collectively referred to as &quot;primary atypical pneumonia&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current epidemiological survey results of multiple adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in China show that Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are important pathogens of adult CAP in my country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, the incubation period of mycoplasma pneumonia is 1 to 3 weeks, and the onset is diverse. Most patients only have low fever and fatigue, and some patients may have sudden high fever accompanied by obvious headache and myalgia. and nausea and other systemic symptoms of poisoning. The most prominent respiratory symptoms are dry cough, which often lasts for more than 4 weeks, is often accompanied by obvious sore throat, occasionally chest pain, and blood in sputum. In a few severe cases, respiratory failure may occur, manifesting as respiratory distress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the non-respiratory symptoms, earache, measles-like or scarlet fever-like rash are more common, and a few patients may be accompanied by gastroenteritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and hemolysis. anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, arthritis and hepatitis, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having few positive signs in the lungs and obvious imaging manifestations are important features of mycoplasma pneumonia. The lesions are mostly cloud-like patchy infiltrates with blurred edges and low density, radiating from the hilum to the peripheral lung fields. When the lung parenchyma is involved, large consolidation shadows may also appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quinols and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice for adults with mycoplasma pneumonia&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports, commonly used drugs for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia include macrolides, fluoroquinolones and Tetracyclines and macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin and clarithromycin) are currently the drugs of choice for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia in children. Quinolones and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice for adults with mycoplasma pneumonia. However, there are also mycoplasma pneumoniae and macrolide antibiotics. Lactone antibiotics are resistant, so the clinical selection should be based on the individual situation of the patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will mycoplasma pneumonia cause &quot;white lung&quot;? A small number of mycoplasma pneumonias invade a wide range of lesions or have poor mucus drainage, involving the bronchi, alveoli, and interstitium of the lungs, causing &quot;atelectasis&quot; and even &quot;white lungs&quot; on imaging. Through effective anti-infection, expectoration, and shooting, Back and bronchoscopy treatment and other methods can cure the disease in a short time, and most patients have a good prognosis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors remind that Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can occur throughout the year, especially in late summer, autumn and winter, when the incidence is high. The main sources of infection are patients and carriers, which are mainly spread through air droplets, such as coughing and sneezing. Preschool and school-age children and adolescents over 5 years old are at high risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The preventive measures for mycoplasma pneumonia mainly include: ① Stay away from the source of infection, regularly open windows indoors for ventilation, and it is recommended to wear a mask when going to crowded and closed places. ② Perform good hand hygiene, wash hands frequently with soap (hand sanitizer) and running water, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to wipe your hands. ③Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits, drink enough water, get enough sleep, and exercise moderately to enhance immunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Ruilin, director and chief physician of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Second Provincial Hospital, reminded that during the period of high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, if you have upper respiratory tract infection symptoms such as cough and fever, it is recommended to seek medical treatment as soon as possible to find out the cause. Treat in a targeted manner and do not take medicine on your own to delay the condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[体验“人生的旷野”后，两位985大学生选择回归国企和考研]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260901]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 05/14/ZJx5I7atgzPCjqiRvBFQtetVpSN3VGDPyg6VvrzP.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2449&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/05/14/ZJx5I7atgzPCjqiRvBFQtetVpSN3VGDPyg 6VvrzP. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;234068&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;>;Click to play this podcast↑&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Every year during the school recruitment season, we can hear different employment stories of college students.

This bilateral exercise is the first joint exercise since the &quot;Reciprocal Access Agreement&quot; between the two countries officially came into effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week ago, the fifth &quot;2+2&quot; meeting between Japan and the UK&#39;s foreign ministers and defense ministers was held face-to-face again after a lapse of five years. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the two sides made it clear that they would increase the frequency of joint exercises. In addition, Japan will also provide cooperation with the United Kingdom in dispatching an aircraft carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific in 2025. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Providing cooperation for the deployment of British aircraft carriers to the Indo-Pacific is just the latest step in deepening defense cooperation between Japan and countries outside the Asia-Pacific region. At present, Japan is promoting the joint development of next-generation fighter aircraft with the United Kingdom and Italy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan not only extended military cooperation invitations to European countries, but also played diplomatic cards in Southeast Asia. Previously, from November 3 to 5, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited the Philippines and Malaysia for the first time. Since the beginning of this year, the Kishida government has frequently visited Southeast Asia, covering almost 10 ASEAN member states. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan&#39;s efforts to win over countries in and outside the Asia-Pacific region such as the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and the Philippines are nothing more than wanting to revisit its old dream of the Russo-Japanese War and seek more interests for itself. While the United States continues to promote its Indo-Pacific strategy &#39;, and in the context of great power competition, relevant countries have also followed suit, trying to get a share of the regional game.&quot; Teng Jianqun, director of the Diplomatic Research Center of Hunan Normal University, told Southern Weekend reporters that in the context of multipolarization of international politics and global economicization, At the moment, Japan is trying to win over a large number of countries to stir up trouble in the Asia-Pacific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 9, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK responded to the erroneous remarks about China in the UK-Japan “2+2” joint statement, saying, “China has indisputable territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the East China Sea and South China Sea. rights and interests. China will unswervingly safeguard its sovereignty and rights and interests, and firmly oppose relevant countries to sow relations between regional countries and create confrontation and confrontation. If the UK and Japan really want to become responsible countries, they should stop fanning the flames and stirring up trouble everywhere. Do things that contribute to regional peace and stability.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/E8VmoXNPlqgtjxiaGlfabmI7LvYMgX0hrypTsScd.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height=&quot;1133&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/E8VmoXNPlqgtjxiaGlfabmI7LvYMgX0hrypTsScd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258739&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 11, 2023, local time, London, England, British Prime Minister Sunak (right) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in London Towers sign defense agreement. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Winning over&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 7, Fumio Kishida met with the US Secretary of State at his official residence Lincoln talks, exchanged views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and confirmed that the two sides will cooperate on related issues. The day before, Blinken had just concluded his &quot;whirlwind diplomacy&quot; in the Middle East and arrived in Japan to attend the Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers&#39; meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, held in Tokyo from November 7th to 8th, was the last offline meeting hosted by Japan during its tenure as the G7 Presidency. During the meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa held talks with the foreign ministers of Canada, Germany and other member states, and took the opportunity to hold 95-minute consultations with the British Foreign Minister and Defense Minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In talks with defense ministers from various countries, the concept of a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific&quot; was frequently mentioned by Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan&#39;s reaffirmation of the &#39;Indo-Pacific Concept&#39; through the G7 Foreign Ministers&#39; Meeting is just a rehash of old tunes with nothing new. What really deserves attention is Japan&#39;s gradual advancement in implementation.&quot; China Institute of International Studies Tang Qifang, associate researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, analyzed this to a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the Japanese government adopted three security documents: the revised &quot;National Security Strategy&quot;, &quot;National Defense Strategy&quot; and &quot;Defense Force Preparation Plan&quot;, which not only clearly stated that it must have counterattack capabilities, but also emphasized that While taking the Japan-U.S. alliance as the foundation, we will deepen cooperation with so-called &quot;friendly countries that share values&quot; and strive to realize the concept of a &quot;free and open Indo-Pacific.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than a month after the &quot;Three Security Documents&quot; were released, Japan and the United Kingdom signed a &quot;Reciprocal Access Agreement&quot;, allowing both sides to conduct larger-scale and more complex military exercises on each other&#39;s territory. At this point, the United Kingdom has become the only European country that can conduct bilateral military exercises on Japanese territory, and is also the second country to sign this agreement with Japan after Australia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the promulgation of the new security strategy, Japan&#39;s defense policy has shifted from defensive to offensive, and the weapons and equipment, combat posture, and troop deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Force have also changed from defensive to offensive.&quot; Teng Jianqun pointed out, &quot;The signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement means that the relationship between Japan and relevant countries is entering a paramilitary alliance. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces can use this to go out and send troops to the United Kingdom and Australia to achieve the so-called &#39;national normalcy&#39; in a roundabout way.&quot; At the same time, Japan also wants to take the opportunity to release its military production capacity and accelerate the entry of weapons and equipment into the international market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to linking up with countries outside the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines has also become a key target for Japan to try to win over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 3, Fumio Kishida arrived in the Philippines and held talks with Philippine President Marcos. In Manila, Fumio Kishida delivered his first speech to the Philippine Congress. In his speech, Kishida Fumio praised that bilateral relations between Japan and the Philippines have entered a &quot;golden age.&quot; At the same time, Japan and the Philippines also reached a consensus on launching negotiations on the Reciprocal Access Agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The targets chosen by Japan are all core members of the US military alliance. Australia is known as the US&#39;s &#39;Southern Anchor&#39; in the Asia-Pacific region, and the UK is its core ally in Europe.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;Although the Philippines is weak, the new President Marcos has tilted his foreign policy toward the United States after taking office. The United States is trying to turn it into a sharp thorn wedged in the South China Sea.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Linkage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Japan is not only &quot;casting a wide net&quot; on the road to expanding its &quot;paramilitary alliance&quot;, but also continues to promote joint military exercises with relevant countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese media reported that the goal of the &quot;2+2&quot; talks between Britain and Japan is to enhance military coordination and interoperability by holding &quot;more frequent and more complex military exercises.&quot; After the signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement, the first joint military exercise between Japan and Britain is on the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the meeting of the G7 foreign ministers, the United States dispatched two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan and USS Vinson, and the Japanese helicopter carrier USS Hyuga to conduct joint military exercises in the Philippine Sea. Rear Adm. Carlos Sadillo, commander of the U.S. Navy&#39;s First Aircraft Carrier Strike Group, pointed out that the exercise was designed to &quot;demonstrate how the United States and Japan can quickly respond to crises and interoperate and coordinate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Australia, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is seeking to normalize military deployment. Japan plans to station F-35, F-15 and F-2 fighter jets at air bases in Australia as early as fiscal 2024, with each deployment lasting several months. Japanese media pointed out that there is no clear legal basis for dispatching permanent troops to Australia or providing security assistance when necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Reciprocal Access Agreement facilitates joint military operations between Japan and Britain and Australia, and the same equipment purchased from the United States provides a sufficient platform for mutual integration and interoperability.&quot; Military Expert Wang Qunhuai told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the United States approved the sale of 105 F-35 fighter jets to Japan. Adding the 42 previously purchased, Japan will have a total of 147 F-35 fighter jets. Australia and the United Kingdom are also &quot;die-hard fans&quot; of F-35 fighters and have ordered a total of 210 F-35 fighters from the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in 2023, the United States successively agreed to sell hundreds of &quot;Tomahawk&quot; cruise missiles to Australia and Japan to enhance its naval long-range strike capabilities. It is worth mentioning that the United States has always been very cautious about the export of &quot;Tomahawk&quot; missiles. Prior to this, Britain was the only country besides the United States to possess this type of missile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In fact, the sale of weapons and equipment is an important tool for the United States to strengthen alliance relationships. The more American equipment is used, the deeper the relevant countries will be tied to the United States, and the more military sovereignty concessions will inevitably be made.&quot; Analysis by Wang Qunhuai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s military assistance to the Philippines came more directly. &quot;The Kishida government not only wants to provide money and equipment, but also tries to send troops to the Philippines.&quot; Tang Qifang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his visit to Manila, Fumio Kishida sent a &quot;maritime gift package&quot; to the Philippines. According to a senior Japanese government official on November 3, Japan will provide five sets of fixed coast surveillance radars to the Philippines. This is the first time Japan has provided defense equipment to a foreign country under this mechanism since it established the &quot;Government Security Capability Strengthening Support&quot; (OSA) framework in April. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, Japan focused on relying on &#39;government development assistance&#39; (ODA) and using economic diplomacy to expand its international influence, but now it has turned to improving the security capabilities of recipient countries.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;Japan It is hollowing out the peaceful constitution step by step, trying to transform from an economic power to a military and political power.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Team formation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Japan and the United Kingdom , the Philippines and other countries inside and outside the Asia-Pacific region &quot;form a circle&quot; and actively carry out defense cooperation, each getting what they need and utilizing each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and proposed the &quot;Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy&quot; for the first time in the joint communiqué. &quot;Since then, Japan has continued to promote this proposition in diplomatic settings, intending to cooperate with the United States in enhancing its intervention capabilities in the East China Sea, South China Sea and even the Asia-Pacific region, and to demonstrate its presence and enhance its international status and influence.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tang Qifang’s view, Japan’s continuous breach of red lines in defense policy is inseparable from the acquiescence and connivance of the United States. &quot;The United States expects Japan to act as a &#39;pawn&#39; in the Asia-Pacific and help it reduce its burden and pressure. Japan also hopes to vigorously develop its military power and pursue becoming a military and political power. Although the interests of the two sides are different, the strategic goals are basically the same.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The United Kingdom, Australia and other countries also have their own plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After Brexit, the UK has become an &#39;outcast&#39; in Europe. Based on geopolitical considerations, the UK hopes to use Japan as a &#39;bridgehead&#39; to strengthen its military deployment in the Asia-Pacific and highlight its status and From the perspective of business interests, the UK attaches great importance to the economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; Teng Jianqun analyzed that this is also the main reason why European and Asia-Pacific countries are willing to cooperate with Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as March 2021, the British government released &quot;Global Britain in the Era of Competition: A Comprehensive Assessment of Security, Defense, Development and Foreign Policy&quot;, which pointed out for the first time that the UK&#39;s global strategy must move towards the &quot;Indo-Pacific&quot; &quot;region&quot; tilt, and in May of that year dispatched the most advanced &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; aircraft carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific region for the first time to conduct so-called &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the British aircraft carrier&#39;s &quot;global journey&quot; did not go smoothly. Two destroyers accidentally separated from the formation. In September 2023, the British Navy&#39;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; aircraft carrier conducted joint patrols with allies along the coast of Norway and the North Atlantic. Due to the significant reduction in the number of British Air Force fighter jets, the British aircraft carrier, which can normally carry about 30 F-35B fighter jets, only carries 8 fighter jets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The wish of &#39;Global Britain&#39; is very good, but Britain is no longer the &#39;Empire on which the sun never sets&#39; in the past. Whether its strength can match its ambitions is still a question. And the Philippines is not only weak in strength. On the other hand, the determination to follow the United States is not as strong as that of Japan, Britain and Australia.&quot; Tang Qifang pointed out, &quot;It remains to be seen how important the relevant countries can play in the so-called &#39;Indo-Pacific strategy&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts As a die-hard ally of the United States, Japan is not willing to become a &quot;tool&quot; of the United States and still hopes to regain its autonomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy announced that they would jointly develop a common airframe for next-generation fighter aircraft. The three countries are determined to integrate their respective capabilities in cutting-edge air combat technologies such as stealth and high-tech sensors. By 2035 The latest fighter jet was launched years ago. It is worth noting that this is the first time since World War II that Japan has participated in a joint research and development program for advanced fighter aircraft that does not include the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Japan has specially set aside funds in its defense budget for fiscal year 2024 and plans to develop an air-to-air missile for use by the next-generation fighter aircraft jointly developed by the three countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Japan does not want to put all its eggs in the American basket, nor does it want to hand over its military industry dividends to the United States.

This shop has been open for more than three years and is currently experiencing difficulties. During this period, the monthly turnover could not cover employee wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told reporters from Nandu·Wancaishe that this year there has been a wave of store openings in the coffee industry. Some people who do not know how to open stores blindly open stores and occupy market space. Professional community coffee shops have attracted customers who know how to taste fine coffee. , and the spatial experience originally provided by independent coffee shops has become no longer rare, because chain coffee shops are also setting up large stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The chain coffee brands with larger store areas have taken away the in-store customers, and the community coffee shops along the street have taken away the in-store and take-out coffee cups. In short, now coffee shops The density is too high.&quot; Lin Li lamented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d33e2d4d182d5e6ae80bb77a5591e6b9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d33e2d4d182d5e6ae80bb77a5591e6b9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258785&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, Coffee chains are making every effort to open stores. Recently, Cudi Coffee, which was founded just one year ago, announced that it has more than 6,000 stores, setting a new record for domestic coffee stores; Luckin announced that it has more than 13,000 stores and predicts that it will open 15,000 stores by the end of this year; Starbucks is also speeding up Expanding stores, it &quot;opens a new store every 9 hours in China&quot;; Manner, a specialty coffee brand founded in Shanghai, is also running wild. Yesterday (October 30), its number of stores officially exceeded 1,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, amidst the craze for coffee, a large number of coffee shops failed to survive this year. Statistics from the third-party platform Kamen show that in the first nine months of 2023, the number of newly registered coffee-related companies was approximately 45,000, an increase of 74.10% over the same period last year, and 9,825 coffee companies were deregistered, with the number of cancellations increasing by 58.95% year-on-year. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, reporters from Nandu Bay Financial News visited a number of independent cafes, trying to understand whether they can survive the &quot;9.9 yuan cup of coffee&quot; storm and the increasing density of coffee shops. , what do they rely on to survive? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cafes are everywhere, and the 9.9 yuan price war continues&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Nearly 10,000 coffee companies closed down in the first nine months&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Li works as a manager at an independent coffee shop on Beijing Road in Guangzhou Store manager, this store has three floors. The first floor of the store serves as the entrance. The second and third floors are bright and comfortable with simple decoration. There are large floor-to-ceiling windows on the side near the corner, allowing you to have a panoramic view of the outside scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coffee products sold in the store include classic American coffee, milk coffee, special coffee and hand-brewed specialty coffee, with prices ranging from 20 to 100 yuan. There are also some baked simple meals for single consumption. The amount is about 50 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/4b6280e9848604abf3a19a02f5a9a56c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/4b6280e9848604abf3a19a02f5a9a56c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258786&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told Nandu ·Wancaishe reporter, &quot;There used to be many customers on weekdays, and the daily turnover could reach tens of thousands of yuan.&quot; It is located in a tourist area, and it is &quot;extremely busy&quot; on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since the adjustment of epidemic prevention and control measures this year, the operation of the store has turned from profit to loss. In this regard, Lin Li said that he originally thought that there would be more customers this year, and he also vigorously promoted some creative and special products at the beginning of the year to attract traffic, but the effect was not good. &quot;Currently, the turnover is only two to three thousand yuan on weekdays and tens of thousands of yuan on weekends.&quot; However, after deducting the high cost of 65,000 yuan in shop rent, water, electricity and raw materials, there is still more than 10,000 yuan left, which is not even enough to pay employees&#39; wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is located in a popular tourist destination, tourists do not help its business much. During the National Day this year, boss Lin Li visited nearby coffee shops. Although the streets were crowded, there were many empty seats in the coffee shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li told reporters an observation: Foreign tourists are basically adults with children, and they do not have the habit of drinking coffee. On the contrary, Guangzhou locals did not travel abroad last year and came to coffee shops to kill time. There are more people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to changes in consumer customer groups, the increasing number of coffee shops on the streets has also impacted store business. Lin Li bluntly said that there has been a wave of store openings in the coffee industry this year. Some people who do not know how to open stores blindly opened stores, squeezing the market space. “The chain coffee brands with larger store areas have taken away the customers who come to the store, and the community coffee shops along the street have taken away the customers. The number of coffee cups sold in stores and for takeaways has increased. In short, the density of coffee shops is too high now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The density of coffee shops in the Beijing Road business district is indeed increasing. Nanduwan Financial News reporter learned through Dianping that there are about 200 coffee shops within 2 kilometers of the Beijing Road business district. As of October 27, about 30 coffee shops have opened in the past three months, that is, every Within three days, a coffee shop opened in the Beijing Road business district. Among them, there are many well-known chain large space coffee shops such as Lavasa Coffee, store by.jpg, M Stand, and Starbucks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since this year, chain coffee brands have indeed been making great efforts to open stores. For example, Kudi’s stores have exceeded 6,000, and Luckin’s stores have exceeded 13,000. Statistics from Kamen show that in the first nine months of 2023, the number of newly registered coffee companies was approximately 45,000, an increase of 74.10% compared with the same period last year. At the same time, many coffee shops have fallen in the coffee wave. Kamen data shows that in the first nine months of 2023, 9,825 coffee companies have been canceled, and the number of cancellations has increased by 58.95% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to intensive store openings, leading coffee chain brand Luckin Kudi Tims has also successively launched promotions of 9.9 yuan/cup or 8.8 yuan/cup, lowering the selling price of coffee in order to seize the market share. customer. Although there is a big difference between the customer base of low-price coffee and the customer base of independent coffee shops, the impression that a cup of coffee only costs 9.9 yuan is still engraved in the hearts of many consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/b5d8d224b36f1aa66eb98e4984ecbc14.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/b5d8d224b36f1aa66eb98e4984ecbc14.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258781&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Li revealed, A customer once was surprised when he saw the price list after entering the store, &quot;Americano coffee actually costs more than 20 yuan.&quot; However, Lin Li believes that &quot;six or seven years ago, the Americano and latte we drank were more than 20 yuan a cup.&quot; Yes, this is the normal price.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill, another independent cafe operator, also encountered customers who were confused about the price at his store. Bill thought, &quot;American and American cuisine cost more than 20 yuan. The nine-yuan American style uses different coffee beans, and the taste is different, so the price is naturally different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, due to the competitive pressure brought by the store opening wave and price wars, Bill&#39;s store coffee Some price adjustments have been made. For example, the price of iced Americano coffee has been reduced to 20 yuan, and many stores have launched a beverage promotion of &quot;42% off in the morning and 32% off in the afternoon on weekdays&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce the store area and shift towards high-end customers&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;Independent cafes are also planning to change&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the numerous stores that are still struggling with losses, Bill will The coffee shop moved from a shop along the street in Guangzhou to a community, and its store went from losing money to being able to continue operating. Although the operating area of ​​Bill&#39;s store has only been reduced by about 10 square meters, the rent burden has been cut in half, down to four digits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bill is a coffee fan with more than 20 years of coffee experience. Out of interest, he opened his first coffee shop in 2019. However, the rent of this shop is high due to the location where it is located. , but the flow of people is not much, and it has been affected many times by the epidemic before, so it is not profitable. Last year, Bill accidentally saw a store in the community for rent, so he closed the old store and started over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new coffee shop covers an area of ​​about 20 square meters, and most of the coffee drinks sold in the store are hand-brewed coffee. Bill manages it by himself because costs have dropped. According to his estimate, he can run the business with only 300 yuan a day. On the day when a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News visited, he sold several hundred yuan of coffee beans and several hundred yuan of coffee drinks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue, who lives in Guangzhou, also wanted to open a coffee shop. Before opening the shop, she did some research. Mingyue found that although there were many coffee shops in Guangzhou, most of them had different decoration styles and menus. The drinks on the menu are all very similar. “As soon as I look at the menu, I can imagine what this cup of coffee will look like and taste like.” Moreover, what confuses Mingyue even more is that even though there are so many coffee shops, when she wants to When drinking a cup of hand-brewed coffee, she didn&#39;t know where to consume it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/90b868772cf40aeccd71515e58371d9d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/90b868772cf40aeccd71515e58371d9d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258782&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, last year , Mingyue opened an independent cafe in the Yanyun West Community of Huifu East Road, Guangzhou. In order to distinguish it from most coffee shops in the market, she positioned the shop as a high-end cafe targeting high-end customers. The cafe is located in a quiet community. It has a two-story store with an area of ​​about 200 square meters, a monthly rent of 25,000 yuan, and three employees. The price of coffee products in the store ranges from 38 to 168 yuan, and competition-level premium hand-brewed coffee is also available. However, the supply of such products is small, and the pricing depends on the type of beans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year after opening the store, Mingyue confessed to a reporter from Nandu Bay Financial News that the coffee shop business is not easy. Not many people know about the newly opened store. It is a process of slowly accumulating word-of-mouth and popularity. , until last month, the store was still losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the situation has been slowly improving. The differentiation of positioning and the ability to brew coffee have helped her a lot. Mingyue said, &quot;We suffered the most when we first opened, because at that time Severely affected by the epidemic... Only half of this month (October) has passed and we have recovered our capital. This month is a steady profit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Independent cafes survive on high-quality beans&lt;/h4 >; &lt;h4>;But it may be difficult for novices to identify the route&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After visiting these independent cafes, reporters from Nandu Bay Financial News learned that the reason why there are so many coffee shops in operation is difficult, in addition to the location where they are located. In addition to the problem and the influence of coffee competition, one of the problems is that the target group positioning is not clear enough. His customer group includes white-collar workers, freelancers, and office workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why stores like Mingyue and Ah Bill can survive is that in addition to working hard to accumulate regular customers in terms of cost and positioning, it is also very important that they have good quality and cost-effectiveness in the supply chain. A channel for coffee beans that are high quality and in line with market tastes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d27afb385794723e0854e23204cf3d24.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; height= &quot;534&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d27afb385794723e0854e23204cf3d24.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258784&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Coffee beans sold at Mingyue store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ming Yue attaches great importance to the selection of coffee beans. The positioning of her coffee shop is to make competition-level specialty coffee, and she can often get some micro-batch specialty beans. Mingyue told Nandu Bay Finance reporters that she had drank more than a thousand beans from April this year to now, and finally finalized more than a dozen beans. &quot;Finding beans can represent a lot of things. To make boutique coffee in the end, it is actually fighting for her own selection.&quot; Her feeling is that she can find good coffee beans and the guest groups of the store -those who know the goods and are willing to spend. For customers who drink valuable beans, they are very competitive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to high -quality coffee beans, another key to the selection is to let customers drink cost -effective coffee. Mingyue improves the cost -effectiveness of coffee in the store as much as possible. If its stores sell for 68 yuan, American coffee uses green beans with green beans. Yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/9bb65a681121dcf9ca50165b21d30b73.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;800 &quot;height = &quot;1200&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/9bb65a681121dcf9ca50165B21d30B73.jpeg&quot; data- key = &quot;258783&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; High quality Coffee beans offer coffee drinks. Selling coffee beans is also the main way for some independent cafes to make money. Some cafes will buy coffee raw beans and come back to roast it by themselves, make coffee cooked beans before selling, but selling beans usually do cooked customer business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter from Nandu · Bay Financial learned from a number of coffee practitioners that after getting out all processing costs, the price of cooked beans is about three times that of raw beans, and a coffee raw bean price is 100 -120 yuan/kg, then converted, the coffee coffee beans sell for about 300 yuan/kg, which will be different from each coffee shop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For A Bill, he would rather sell coffee beans than selling coffee. A Bill roughly estimated that 50 % of his store&#39;s turnover comes from selling coffee beans and 50 % of them to consume in the store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A Bill&#39;s coffee menu has a full three pages of hand -made coffee beans. In addition, he also took out more than a dozen beans from the cabinet and introduced it to reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/7567eda90cc92F0E3473473.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; 800 &quot; height = &quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/7567eda950cc92f0e34c20047344c3c3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258788&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在制作On the coffee, there are not many coffee equipment in the Bill shop. A Italian machine is the main tool for him to make American and milk coffee. A Bill said frankly, &quot;When I opened the store, I planned not to sell coffee drinks directly, but think about it.&quot; This decision is right. Half of the currently flowing water in the store is still from these coffee drinks. &quot;These are used for it. Stabilize the basic disk. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The hand -rail coffee sold by Bill ranges from more than 30 yuan to one cup of 100 yuan. He said that the price of beans is directly linked to the quality of coffee, and the expensive beans will have obvious layers of rich and lovely flavor, such as the flavor of buddhas, lemon, tropical fruits, and the cheap beans are relatively light and low. The price is low. The price is low. The price is low. It is expected that the flavor of this cup of coffee will not be so rich. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The same sale of coffee beans in Mingyue store. Her turnover is 70 % from the store consumption and 30 % come from selling beans. However, Mingyue said that because the store opening time is still short, there are not many accumulated cooked customers. In the future, the business of this part will have a lot of room for growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d892AB5957BE5431C884A1A444.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;800 &quot;height = &quot;1067&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/d892ab5431c882bca384a1a444.jpeg&quot; data- key = &quot;258787&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;P STY le = &quot;color : #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; Mingyue won the award in coffee events. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the ability to obtain high -quality coffee beans has helped A Bill and Mingyue, but because of the uneven quality of coffee beans and more supply channels, it is difficult for novices to understand the doorway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lin Li calculated a account for reporters, opened a cafe, except for the renovation and equipment in the early stage of opening the store, about 300,000 yuan, the price span of coffee beans on the market was very large -raw raw Beans from 30 yuan/kg to tens of thousands of yuan/kg, coffee cooked beans 80 yuan/pound to tens of thousands of yuan/pound. &quot;It is difficult for layman students to distinguish the real price of a bean. The beans are not clear ... and now there are many companies that provide coffee shops to open shop planning. People who do n’t know if they buy beans directly from them, the money is basically earned by them. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;H4>; Conclusion: &lt;/h4>; &lt;H4>; Consumers choose more &lt;/h4>; &lt;H4>; The era of coffee subdivision or has been opened. We are also thinking about where to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After discussing with the boss, Lin Lai planned to terminate the business in November this year, and wanted to change another small store to reopen. As for the future competitive direction of the store, he said that he was still thinking, &quot;Maybe you may make the product more refined, don&#39;t do everything, milk coffee, special, hand -made everything.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/f7624557efce35d6d08cf44daf90061e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1067&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/f7624557efce35d6d08CF44DAF90061e.jpeg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258789 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style: #9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 9; Text-Align: How fast is the change of the coffee market, and the people in it are the clearest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mingyue is very glad that he was aimed at the high -end boutique coffee track. Mingyue revealed that a year ago, a predecessor told her that opening the chain of popular coffee shops was the most profitable trend, but recently, this predecessor told her that his chain coffee shop could not do it anymore. The big chain coffee brand is going on, and he is going to find a new way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mingyue has seen that the coffee market is gradually segmented, and some customers have already &quot;gone forward&quot;, such as the COMBO product that it previously launched (that is, &quot;one bean eat more&quot;), It is the suggestion made by customers.

Among them, I have to mention the Bai family ranked first in the four major families. Without the Bai family&#39;s head Bai, I am afraid that there will be no four families in the Jianga area. The relationship territory comes completely from a betrayal of Bai Cheng in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bai&#39;s boss Bai is the authentic courage. Born on April 1, 1950 in Myanmar&#39;s Belief Red Rock. Since Peng Jiasheng&#39;s establishment of the &quot;Jianga People&#39;s Revolutionary Army&quot; in 1965, Bai Jiacheng began to follow Peng Jiasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mr. Song, who gave Peng Jiasheng for many years, recalled that Bai Xuncheng was very heroic and willing to move his mind, so he was promoted quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1967, Peng Jiasheng joined the Burma Communist Party. During the people&#39;s army of the Burmese Communist Party, Bai Sacao stepped from the soldiers to the commander of the battalion step by step in the Sheng of Peng Jiasheng. In 1989, Peng Jiasheng led the Ministry of Burma and stopped war with the Myanmar government. The Myanmar government then acknowledged the autonomy of Guogan. At this time, under the promotion of Peng Jiasheng, Ren Guogu&#39;s deputy commander of the Allied Army became a veritable second leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The famous &quot;88 Incident&quot; occurred in 2009. Bai Cai reached an agreement with the Myanmar government forces privately. . Peng Bubu was defeated by leaving the country. With the support of the Myanmar government, Bai Cheng became the leader of the jealous area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The four big families established in 2009 are Bai, Wei, and Er Liu. Among them, the Bai family&#39;s Bai Chengcheng, Wei Chaoren of the Wei family, and Liu Guoxi&#39;s Liu Guoxi&#39;s old ministry, three The people&#39;s conspiracy colludes the Burmese government forces to expel Peng Jiasheng, just like Zhao, Wei, and Han who were divided into Jin. Liu Zhong&#39;s Liu Abao (Liu Zhengxiang) has always been the pretty local power of the Myanmar government, so it is theoretically not the alliance traitors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The consequences of Bai Cheng dare to change the policy of Peng Jiasheng to the Myanmar government. The Peng Jiasheng era is completely independent of Myanmar, and government forces must not enter the alliance defense zone. Bai Chengcheng announced his obedience to the leadership of the Myanmar government and allowed the Myanmar government forces to enter the Kokang Autonomous Region. Local armed forces were adapted into the power of the pro -government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/40zhghxze9vbbleypc2k0bydsfbda0aeux.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;620&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/40zhghxze9vbwbleypc2k0bydsfbda0aeux.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258754&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; On February 4, 2022, nearly a thousand cadre soldiers in the jealous security department arrived in Baifu to visit the New Year. = &quot;COLOR: #AAA;&quot;>; (Jianga Volkswagen/Figure) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the Peng family left the pretty dare, although the Myanmar government has obtained the control of the jealous area in name, the local main ethnic group For the Han people in Myanmar (the Burma), the government&#39;s decree still needs to be implemented by the local real power. Under this modern toast system, the four major families have begun to grow up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first big family Bai&#39;s family has made a courage to attach the leader, and power is naturally indispensable.

Since the Drugs of Peng Jiasheng, the pillar industry established in the local area is gambling and surrounding entertainment industry (prostitution). . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Myanmar, gambling and other industries are actually illegal industries, but northern Myanmar is not a direct jurisdiction of the central government of Myanmar, so these gray industries are booming. The main economic sources of the four major families of the cigarette also come from this type of gray industry and related surrounding economic activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wei Chao Ren, who ranked second among the four major families, had officially worshiped the first brigade of the Northeast Military Region during the Burmese Communist Party. Peng Jiasheng ruled the chief of staff of the Kokang Dai Dai Dai, and belonged to the three leaders of the Allies. After the establishment of the Kokang Autonomous Region, Wei Chaoren served as the leader of the political and legal system of the autonomous region and participated in the &quot;88 Incident&quot; expelled Peng Jiasheng in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/bs6oersyvfxulez3a3awysgifc45bjdd.jpg&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/bs6oersyvfxulez3a3awysgiFWSAGC45bjdd.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258753&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; 2022, Wei Chaoren (third from right) at home &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; P>; After becoming one of the four major families, Wei Chaoren also actively embarked on the line. He used to be a member of the Myanmar Federal Parliament and a member of the Kokang Autonomous Region Committee. Wei Huairen&#39;s third brother Wei Huairen served as commander of the Kokang Border Camp. He had a private armed for 2,000 people and controlled the police forces in the jealous area. Wei Chaoren&#39;s daughter Wei Rong is the chairman of Henry Group and operates industries such as entertainment, real estate development, mineral development, gold jewelry and other industries in Southeast Asian hotels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With Wei Chaoren&#39;s position in Myanmar&#39;s political scene, the development of Henry Group has already gone out of the jealous area. There are a large number of hotels, casinos, finance, and jewelry businesses in Burmese, Cambodia, Laun State and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wei Rong is also good at using new media means to promote, not only inviting celebrities to endorse, packing himself as a charity president, but also a lot of Myanmar anchors, promoting the recruitment of people to travel to northern Myanmar ——Mestr. The most famous is the Internet celebrity Li Saigao. This person is the Internet celebrity anchor recruited by Henry Group in the Punjun area. The netizens were revealed to be a group of fraud groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Henry Group can say that it has created the model of gray -producing and switching media, and has also attracted many Chinese people&#39;s attention to northern Myanmar. It is worth noting that Wei Qingtao, the eldest son of Wei Chaoren, has been captured by the Chinese police and repented through video. Wei Rong, who has always been high -profile, may have absconded out of the jeal area and temporarily avoid the trend in Myanmar or other Southeast Asian countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Guoxi of the Liu family is also the old minister of Peng Jiasheng, but this person has been a cultural cadre during the Myanmar Communist Party, serving as the Minister of Finance of the Northeast Bureau of the Ninth Burma. . During the period of Peng Jiasheng, Liu was also a government official, but he did not master military power. After the &quot;88 Incident&quot;, Liu Guoxi served as the vice chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region and was elected as a member of the National Council of the Federal Parliament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/kvugckzgbb7SCl1JRDNXS0W8QTeusgr6kquu.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;721&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/kvugckzgbb7orW4SCl1JRDNXS0W8QTeusgr6kquu&quot; data- key = &quot;258752&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; In 2018, the Gong Gong Fa with the party held a public meeting. Liu Guoxi delivered a speech at the meeting &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; /span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although Liu Guoxi is under the old minister of the Burmese Communist Party, the pretty degree of the Kokang Allied forces has a low degree of hostility to this person, because Liu has always been a government official in charge of finance. This person did not participate in any battle. Mr. Song, who was the Guardian of Peng Jiasheng, also revealed to me: Liu did not have the blood debt of the Koko Allied forces in his hands. He was a civilian and could not surrender the old Burmese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Guoxi died in 2020. His third son and one daughter operated minerals, casinos, hotels and other businesses in the jealous area. Among them, the third son Liu Dehong was a member of the Council of the Jiangang area. Although Liu Guoxi is regarded as one of the four families, it is one of the relatively low -key one. Especially after Liu Guoxi&#39;s death, his children did not hold real duties in the jealousy government. Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The only non -Peng family&#39;s Shengtai is Liu Abao (Zhengxiang) Liu family. Liu Zhengxiang initially used the head of the vice township of Jitei Hongyan Township and used the identity of the township. Come to the group, it is said to be the richest man in the chief dare, mainly operating the industry covers cultural tourism, hotels, commerce, real estate, finance, etc., spreading throughout Myanmar and Southeast Asia, with more than 10,000 employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/jwom8w7pswnx9veishugw9wnrf2bncmokob.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;625&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/jwom8w7pswnx9veishugq2dtgw9wnrf2bncmokob.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258755&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; On July 7, 2023, Liu Zhengxiang, director of the Urban Construction Development and Development Supervision and Management Committee of the Kokang Autonomous Region, inspected the road construction work &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; /Figure) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liu Zhengxiang is a model for the two flowers of politics and business. On the one hand, it is used to use government relations to do business. On the one hand, it uses commercial profits to operate government relations. One of the people&#39;s connections is also closely related to the Burmese military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, since Liu Abao did not participate in the activity of the rebellion Peng Jiasheng, the allies were not highly hated. It is rumored that the Kokang Allied forces launched the &quot;1027 operation&quot;, and they did not fight against Liu Abao, and they also did not crack down on Liu Abao. Shortly after the war, Liu Abao expressed surrender and was willing to cooperate with China to clearly pay its electricity -related business. Other industries are still operating normally. It can be said that he is a typical color -changing dragon merchant. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; The Ming family later lived in &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; If the influence of the political and business regions in the jealous area before Ming Xuechang&#39;s life, the Ming family surpassed the Liu Guoxi family for a long time, for One of the newcomers of Dengke. However, this person&#39;s qualifications are relatively shallow, and they have always been considered to be ranked behind in the jealous political community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the Myanmar Communist Party, Ming Xuechang was only a correspondent of Zhao Ming, commander of the Northeast Military Region. Although the leadership trust, his position is very low. During the period of Peng Jiasheng, the highest position of Ming Xuechang was just the deputy head of the Kokang County. It can be said that it was far from the core power circle of the Kokang, and it was not a cadre who could report to Peng Jiasheng directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Until the &quot;88 Incident&quot; in 2009, Ming Xuechang followed Bai Cheng&#39;s backward Ge Peng family, and was relying on the Myanmar government. After the incident, it was promoted to the vice chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region and a member of the Benba State Parliament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is rumored that Ming Xuechang has a good relationship with the Myanmar government forces. Guardian police officer 21 battalion commander&#39;s head of the battalion, and later could not be the principal due to injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because of the low generation, Ming Xuechang was far less high -profile as the Wei family and the Bai family. It was not until his 69th birthday of Hong Kong and Taiwan star records of VCR. It was widely known by the Chinese Internet. Later, it was reported that his long Sun Mingguang was accepted by Peking University (not real) before he was famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/ken6bvhjkmpdppx96cucj8cuqdwspm7thirz3av.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/Ken6bvhjkmpdppx96cucj8cuqdwSPM7thirz.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258756&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; July 23, 2023, Ming Xuechang and his wife celebrated their 69th birthday &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; (Guatan Volkswagen/Picture) &lt;/ SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The Crouching Tiger Villa of the Ming Xuechang family is a infamous telecommunications fraud base, and it may involve cases of kidnapping, extortion, intentional injury, and even killing a number of Chinese citizens. The Ming family also became the primary goal of Chinese police to fight telecommunications fraud, and after surrounding Old Street, the Kokang Alliance took the lead in launching an attack on the Ming family site and became the last straw that crushed the Ming family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With Ming Xuechang&#39;s suicide and many people being arrested, it can be said that the influence of the family and business in the jealous area has basically been zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h2>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Agent politics &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of the five families, except In addition to Liu Abao, who was born in business, the other four were rising rapidly after the &quot;88 Incident&quot; Peng Jiasheng department in 2009. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This has a lot to do with the special political environment of the Kokang area. Although the Myanmar government has obtained the nominal control in the jealous area in 2009, most local residents are not the Burmese people. They have always been quite quite a lot of people in the Myanmar government. Relief and national identity are not strong. This is the common status of non -Myanmar residential districts after Myanmar ’s independence. The Myanmar government also knows this. In order to rule such regions at a low cost, the Myanmar government generally appoints agents of the nation&#39;s bloodlines as representatives of the Myanmar regime. As a result, these agents have obtained political rights higher than normal levels to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the past to the present, there are various gray and black industries in the border ethnic area of ​​Myanmar, which are caused by local independent or semi -independent political status. This situation is not unique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In history, in addition to telecommunications fraud, there are also a series of serious black production problems such as drug trade, illegal smuggling, protecting wildlife trading, prostitution, and illegal gambling. Kokang is one of the typical examples. Under the protection of the five major families, the huge profits generated by the commercial kingdom can be protected within the Myanmar government through corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/WSDHIJ4OPBYUP6QRLBTUU3VJ0ZMNV82ya.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;widt =&quot; 0 &quot;widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;719&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/wsdhij4opByup6qrlbtu3vj0zmnv82qku2ya.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;258757&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Since September 2023, public security organs such as Yunnan Xishuangna and Pu&#39;er and other places have successfully eliminated a large number of overseas fraud denominations through launching border police law enforcement cooperation with related local law enforcement departments in Myanmar.

Telecom fraud is not unique to the jealous areas. There are also a large number of telecommunications fraud parks such as Panbon and Miaowa La. However, under the trend of international cooperation to combat telecommunications fraud, such activities have begun to converge sharply, and a large number of suspects who operate telecommunications fraud have also been transferred to the relevant national police for processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Lang State Autonomous Region in northern Myanmar quickly responded to the call of cracking on electrical fraud. After searched more than 40 parks, they handed over more than 4,000 electrical fraud personnel to the Chinese police. China provides computers and mobile phones used by tens of thousands of electricity fraud, including millions of intelligence and evidence of fraud groups, and even the official investigation of officials involved in electrical fraud in the Pangang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this series of anti -electrical fraud storms that cooperate in multi -country cooperation, the jealous region has contributed to law enforcement operations, and only provides hundreds of people to China symbolically. And even plan to expand against the trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/Yuoxpe6BM0Daasqkub5vi9uzTakyijobuf.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/Yuoxpe6h3bm0dojdaasqkub5vi9uztakyijobuf.jpg&quot; data- key = &quot;258758&quot;>; &lt;/>; &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; In order to resolutely curb the high incidence of criminal crimes involving telecommunications network fraud in northern Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security deployed the Yunnan public security organs to strengthen border police cooperation and continue to carry out multiple rounds of crackdown. The picture shows the suspect involved in fraud, handed over to us &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (provided by the Ministry of Public Security/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The reason why the telecommunications fraud business has expanded rapidly in recent years because of the crackdown on telecommunications fraud in neighboring countries such as the Philippines, Cambodia, and Laos, which led a large number of practitioners to escape from the &quot;electrical scam town&quot; from Cambodia West Port and other &quot;electrical fraud town&quot; to northern Myanmar to carry out business. After the surrounding areas and other surrounding areas cooperated with China to combat electrical scams, Henry Group and Wohu Villa are still lucky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the strong dragon does not overwhelm the ground snake, if the ground snake actively bits the border, and it is not converged after being warned, it is another thing. After this rectification, the territory of political and business relations in the Jokang area has to be reshuffled again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一方提分手，另一方都应同意：或体面结束，或不受要挟]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260903]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-19 17:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; It is not uncommon for falling in love by the other party. The question is, should you agree? My opinion is that one party lifts up, whether it is a real breakup or a breakup to score the other party to accept their own conditions, the other party should agree. 36 氪 &quot;2022 Chinese Couple Breaking Report&quot; shows that more than 60%of girls first propose to break up. We use the woman to analyze with their hands, but the truth is the same in turn, and it is also applicable to the man of the man to break up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Some young netizens found a interesting phenomenon around them: girls broke up, and boys basically agreed. TA further said that because some girls like to break up as a means, boys generally take breakups as results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Let&#39;s discuss the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the first situation, girls proposed to break up are serious, and in the general cognition of boys, proposing a breakup is equivalent to notifying the breakup. You all notified, what can you do if you do n’t accept it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; And, I really want to break up, the other party is very decent, and it is not good? If one party wants to break up, the other party may cause tragedy if it is not forgiven, which is what many people who are in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I agree with the point of &quot;serious breakup&quot;. Breaking up is equivalent to the death of love. Naturally, a person who loves life should also love feelings and cannot hang &quot;breakup&quot; on his mouth, unless you can&#39;t continue, you must say. In other words, don&#39;t say &quot;breakup&quot;, there will be no room to say -when the &quot;breakup&quot; exit, that is, &quot;one sword sealed throat&quot; to the old days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the second situation, girls propose to break up are hypothetical, the purpose is to make her boyfriend a fan. On the Himalayan, some netizens talked: Girlfriend often broke up, the purpose is to give me gifts to her. What kind of psychology is this? A group of netizens followed the accent: This kind of girlfriend just wants to want you. If it is not too deep, it is better to leave decisively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In reality, there is indeed such a situation: the girl who lifts the hand is to use the breakup as a means of game, forcing boys to make compromises to meet their requirements. In this case, boys begging for no distinction is the &quot;cooperation&quot; of game techniques, and it is also a unnecessary sacrifice to self -rights and stances. This may lead to various passive situations. Standing from the standpoint of human nature, if the girl broke up unreasonablely, it has received a good results -for example, her boyfriend has never heard of hearing and dare not violate himself. Then this girl is difficult to gain a sense of accomplishment, and deliberately makes them an inertia, making the other party continue to flourish according to the owner&#39;s intention like a bird locked in the cage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As long as a person is not abused, it is unlikely to experience the other party&#39;s teasing and degradation and tolerate the extreme and not collapse. It is completely accepted by non -scoring requirements. Falling in love is like this easily and compromising. After marriage, if the other party is divorced without saying a word, what should you do? Some people say good: &quot;Break up now, and you will definitely divorce in the future.&quot; Is this true, is it still to continue to compromise? If this is the case, what is the happiness and trust in marriage? I am afraid that it has long been exhausted by the willfulness of one party, the bully, and the weakness of one party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It can be seen that whether it is true or fake, it is the best choice. A person is in front of a person who does not love himself, in front of a person who always trys to &quot;test&quot; himself, except for a bit of hard gas, there is no trick. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, people&#39;s hearts are long meat, and they have been together for a long time, and it is really difficult to make it. Human nature is always complicated. When he still loves each other deeply, he is &quot;kicked&quot; by the other party. It is really amazing and painful. Therefore, some people who have been broken up have reserved for their past love. Strange, but the facts show that people who have long pain are not as short of pain. It is wise to leave the &quot;wrong payment&quot; relationship earlier. The choice is difficult, and the heart is painful, and it is better to get out of the mud that makes yourself fall into emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You know, hesitant to hesitate to break up, not only makes yourself and the other party be tired, but you are more likely to be ridiculed and affected by crying and restlessness all day long. future. After all, death itself means losing self -esteem and &quot;low to dust.&quot; In addition, hesitant, weak and bullying can also bring bad situations, even evil results. In life, some couples &quot;have a long time, and they must be divided for a long time.&quot; After wasting their good youth, they ended up with a breakup, which is equivalent to doing a useless work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In my hometown, some rural couples have noisy for a lifetime, and often one party wants to leave one party. As a result, the two people do not reconcile, which also affects the children’s life. If you break up early, you can be able to break up. Is there such a thing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with these results, I resolutely agreed to break up. There are not only a lot of unnecessary troubles, but also &quot;let go&quot;. Isn&#39;t the best result obtained? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Besides, the decision of the breakup is also a lesson to the other party. A psychological expert told a story that one of her friends was in love, and her mood was very low. She thought she was dumped by others. When asked, she knew that it was her initiative to break up. The point is that she didn&#39;t want to break up, but she threatened her boyfriend again, but this time her boyfriend did not keep her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Break up to see character&quot;. It is not easy for the so -called do not want to do what they do not want to do. It is not easy for two people who love each other to come together. They should operate their feelings well and jointly resist the risks encountered in the journey of life. ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that some people like to say that they break up and break up with people, not only disrespect for each other, but also to complete a rules. Some people just enjoy the sense of accomplishment of &quot;taming each other under their feet&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Because there is no time limit for rules, this situation should be vigilant. Resisting rules is the responsibility of people in every &quot;emotional castle&quot;. Life is not long, we can prepare to spend this life with a person, and we can also prepare to see the machine. In order to avoid being troubled and restrained by the lack of quality, we should do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[领航鲸“搬家”分几步？为啥要抹凡士林？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260907]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-19 16:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; On November 17th, two pilot whales with a length of more than 4 meters and a weight of about 800 kilograms, from Hangzhou Departing from a certain marine park, &quot;relocation&quot; to a marine park in Zhoushan, more than 200 kilometers away, stays in a more spacious &quot;new home&quot;. One ends of 800 kilograms, giving such a large piece of long -distance &quot;moving&quot; battle is not small. Not only do you use cranes and trucks, but also more than 20 adults.

In order to allow the pilot whale to stay safely, what are the preparations for the staff to protect? &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; How many steps do you &quot;move&quot; for the pilot whale? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; It is not easy to give the pilot whale with a weight of about 800 kg, and it is not easy. So, how many steps are the &quot;moving&quot; for the pilot whale? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The staff introduced that this time the &quot;moving&quot; of the pilot whale was divided into five steps. Step 1: Capture and handling. After capturing the navigable whale from the breeding pool, it is carried to the box; the second step: in the box and hanging; the third step: the check -in frequency of the pilot whale before transportation, including Check the mental state, etc.; the fourth step: monitoring during transportation, including the monitoring of water temperature, temperature, animal mental state, activity, respiratory frequency, etc. during transportation; . &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; What are the living habits of the pilot whale? Why do you get the name? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; To &quot;move&quot; to the big blocks such as the pilot whale, you need to understand its physiological characteristics and living habits. Next, let&#39;s get to know the large marine life -pilot whale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The pilot whale is a mammal of the whale -oriented dolphin family. Because of its huge body, it is also called &quot;giant whale&quot;. The pilot whale is divided into two types of long limb collar whales and short -limbs pilot whales. The long limb collar whales are mainly distributed in high latitude waters, and short -limb pilot whales are distributed in tropical and temperate waters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22F96179BF7552D09428FAC69b7.jpeg&quot; 0 &quot;0&quot; 0 &quot;OPA City: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 1280 &quot;height =&quot; 659 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22F69F9617552D0949B7.jpeg &quot;Data-KE y = &quot;258780&quot;>; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Subsidon Sun Dong, an associate researcher at the Second Ocean Research Institute of the Ministry of Natural Resources: &lt;/strong>; The pilot whale generally likes to gather into a large group in the environment of the ocean natural environment. The scale of this population can usually reach 200 to 300 This is a large scale, which is rare among whale. The pilot whale is more lively in the whale. When the pilot whale is sailing on the sea, sailors often see that they are willing to accompany the surroundings of sailing or ships, and they are playing and making trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In recent years, due to the damage of the marine environment, the number of labels has been declining, and it has been included in the second level of my country&#39;s &quot;National Key Protection of Wildlife List&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; What are the difficulties of the &quot;big block&quot; leading whale &quot;moving&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In addition to large body shape and heavy weight, what are the difficulties of &quot;moving&quot; to the pilot whale?

But water cannot be placed very little. If it is very small, one will cause its skin to dry and dehydrate. Desertication is a very serious event for whale. The second is the huge body of whales It requires the buoyancy of water to support its weight. The other is the temperature, which is the whale, especially the temperature rising, which will cause it to overheat shock. This is to be strictly avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Why do the pilot whale &quot;go out&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Every detail is important to &quot;big heads&quot; and &quot;moving&quot; like pilot whales.

Why did you do this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Quansheng, technical person in charge of a certain marine park in Hangzhou: &lt;/strong>; The pilot whale smearing Vaseline is a role, preventing dehydration, because when the temperature is too high, the whale and dolphin are easily dehydrated. After covering this Vaselin, it will prevent water from being distributed. After applying Vaselin, we will cover a wet towel. In this way, there is a water retention effect, that is, one is anti -dehydration and the other is moisturizing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Experts told reporters that this time the two heads of whales &quot;moved&quot; to apply them on their bodies with almost no harm of their skin, and the part of the key part was the back skin exposed in the air, but Avoid the pores in the application. The two ends of the whale arrived in the &quot;new home&quot; of Zhoushan. Before entering the water, the staff would also use a towel to wipe the Vaselin on the pilot whale. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; How to reduce the stress response of the pilot whale during transportation? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; From Hangzhou to Zhoushan, it spans more than 200 kilometers. To ensure the safety of animals, the vehicles must maintain a stable driving at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour during transportation. This has increased the original two -hour drive to 5 hours. Long -distance transportation, how can we reduce the stress response of the pilot whale and reach the &quot;new home&quot; safely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Quansheng, the person in charge of the technical leader of a pole marine park in Hangzhou: &lt;/strong>; We will stop eating 24 hours before transportation, and will gradually reduce its bait volume in the first three days. This is the first ；第二个，我们会在运输途中，保证适宜的水温跟空气的温度，我们这次领航鲸，给它设定的是23.5℃的水温，就是比较适合饲养它的水温；第三个，我们We need to ensure that it is circulating in this transportation vehicle. We must not be too sullen or too windy, and we must be closed; fourth, we will have a veterinarian to stroke it with long -term raising it. A communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了让领航鲸尽快适应新环境，舟山“新家”在室温、水温、灯光等各方面按其生活的自然环境进行设定。不过在刚抵达的前两天，工作人员还会采取少量投食的方式，等领航鲸慢慢适应后再恢复正常饮食。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[商务部清理歧视外资措施，废除“特斯拉禁入”是个好的开始丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;商务部发言人日前在例行新闻发布会上表示，近期商务部组织专项清理，进一步排查可能存在的歧视外资企业的规定和措施，为外资企业营造更加公平的市场竞争环境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据商务部网站，11月8日商务部外资司发文，要求对含有内外资不合理差别待遇内容的规定及措施进行专项清理。清理范围包括各地政府、部门出台的法规、规章、规范性文件、其他政策性措施，以及相关部门制定的与经营主体相关的各类措施。文件还列举了多项具体的清理事项，包括在准入领域针对外资的限制，以外资品牌为由歧视或者排斥外资企业及其产品和服务，排斥或者限制外资企业参加政府采购等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商务部开展这一专项清理行动，是有的放矢的。近年来，随着中国经济实力提升，以及外部“脱钩断链”等贸易摩擦，国内出现了一股“已经足够强大，不再需要外资”的论调。社交媒体上也出现了越来越多敌视外资品牌产品的言论，甚至一些地方出现了限制外资品牌产品的现象。前段时间，湖南岳阳三荷机场以“涉密管制”为由，禁止特斯拉电动汽车进入机场。在引起极大关注后，岳阳机场取消了这一限制，但类似现象在很多地方部门仍然存在。除了特斯拉，受到特别“关照”的还有苹果公司的手机等电子产品。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种针对外资品牌的限制并没有法律依据。 2023年9月，外交部发言人毛宁曾在记者会上表示，中国没有出台禁止购买和使用苹果等外国品牌手机的法律法规和政策文件。有些部门和企业禁止特斯拉汽车、苹果手机等的理由，是其摄像头、麦克风等传感器可能获取周围环境信息上传到国外，涉及“国家机密”“个人信息安全”等。但是，根据特斯拉的声明，其汽车的“哨兵模式”所拍摄的视频只存储在车辆本地的存储设备中，并不会联网上传。其他的车辆数据，也只会上传到公司在中国境内设立的数据中心。苹果公司国内用户所使用的iCloud服务，也由国内的大数据公司“云上贵州”负责运营。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;特斯拉、苹果虽然是外国品牌，但其在国内销售的产品基本上都是在中国境内的工厂生产的，其在上海的超级工厂就有1万多名员工。此外，特斯拉汽车零部件的国产化率已超过95%，更拉动了上游产业链诸多国内企业的发展，不仅为这些企业的员工带来了收入，也提高了企业的生产水平。这些企业生产能力的提升，也为国内其他汽车厂家的发展提供了能量。苹果公司也是如此，不仅其在国内的代工厂直接为数十万人提供了工作岗位，而且通过对国内供应商的严格管理，大大提升了国内产业链的能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;引进外资，引进的绝不仅仅是那些几亿甚至几十亿金额的金钱，更重要的是企业家精神和才干，是发现甚至“创造”市场机会，并抓住机会、创造社会财富的能力。改革开放过程中，引进外资对中国经济发展起到了巨大的推动作用。这种推动作用，并不仅仅来自金钱本身。中国引进外资的目标，也不只是解决国内发展资金不足的问题，更重要的是“学习西方先进的技术与管理经验”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，对推动中国发展起到更大作用的，可能正是随着外资而来的竞争、管理等理念。正是外资倒逼下，中国市场化改革得以加速，国内企业也在与外资竞争中强身健体，发展了起来。即使现在中国已经成为全球第二大经济体，但仍然需要引进外资。因为在很多领域，中国仍然需要国外的技术和企业家才干。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年8月，国务院发布“吸引外资24条”政策措施，强调要营造“市场化、法治化、国际化一流营商环境”。而市场化、法治化的营商环境，就要求对外资企业一视同仁，实行国民待遇，只要不在国家规定的负面清单范围内，就不能对外资进行任何的歧视、限制。对国内的外资企业所提供的产品、服务，也应该与其他国内企业的产品和服务一视同仁。就像虽然“政府采购法”规定一般情况下政府采购“应当采购本国货物、工程和服务”，但财政部2021年专门发文，要求除了涉及国家安全和国家秘密的采购项目外，政府采购不得区别对待内外资企业在中国境内生产的产品。只要是在中国境内生产的，无论其供应商是内资还是外资，都应保障其平等参与政府采购。本次商务部的专项清理行动，也把限制外资企业参加本地招投标、政府采购的问题列入清理事项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商务部清理行动开始之后，社交媒体的信息显示，一些地方机构“禁止特斯拉入内”的标牌已经被拆除。禁止歧视外资企业，这是一个好的开始。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人为什么变胖，问题可能没那么简单]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260883]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The global obesity and overweight problems have become increasingly apparent in recent decades. According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2016 Nearly 40% of adults worldwide are overweight, of which 13% are obese. There are approximately 2 billion overweight people. This increase continues despite public health measures to prevent and slow obesity in many countries. Along with the obesity epidemic comes a large disease burden. How to better manage weight has become an urgent problem in the field of health sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Balancing the quality and quantity of carbohydrates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carbohydrates, as a major source of dietary energy for people, have long been the focus of weight loss. Coping strategies such as the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; of eating less or no staple food, or even strictly limiting carbohydrate intake have been derived. The &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; cuts off carbohydrates as an energy source and attempts to promote weight loss by burning fat to provide energy. Although this method has some short-term experimental support, what will happen if it is persisted in the long term is still a mystery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; requires maintaining a high level of fat intake while maximizing carbohydrate intake, which may increase the risk related to cardiovascular disease. In addition, it will also put pressure on the liver, kidneys and maintenance of nutritional balance, and there is a risk of a series of adverse reactions such as cognitive decline, constipation, fatigue, and nausea. Therefore, long-term adherence to such a diet for weight loss remains controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, compared with the controversial &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; that strictly limits carbohydrate intake, a diet that reasonably controls carbohydrates has actually been widely recognized, including paying more attention to nutritional balance and simplicity. Processed “Mediterranean Diet” etc. Recently, scientists from Harvard School of Public Health and other institutions also found through long-term observational studies that instead of focusing generally on the total amount of carbohydrate intake, it is better to pay more attention to the quality and source of carbohydrates, so as to achieve better long-term weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because their research data shows that some carbohydrate-containing foods do make you fatter as you eat them, but there are also some carbohydrate-rich foods that may actually have a weight loss effect if you eat too much of them. Overall, higher glycemic index and glycemic load will lead to weight gain. Adding 100 grams of starch or added sugar per day increased weight gain by 1.5 kilograms and 0.9 kilograms respectively over four years. Relevant research was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in September 2023. The main sources of daily starch are seeds and tubers such as wheat and rice, which are various staple foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starchy vegetables such as potatoes and peas, and refined grains are also associated with weight gain. A 100-gram daily intake increase will increase weight gain by 2.6 kilograms and 0.8 kilograms respectively. But if it is non-starchy vegetables and whole grains, the increase in intake will actually reduce weight gain and help control weight. Increasing the intake of non-starchy vegetables by 100 grams per day will reduce weight gain by 3 kilograms, and the intake of 100 grams of whole grains will reduce weight gain by 0.4 kilograms. Similarly, consuming carbohydrates through fruits can also help reduce weight gain, with a daily intake increase of 100 grams corresponding to 1.6 kilograms less weight gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these data are limited to four years to assess weight change is because some health data in the study are updated on a four-year cycle. Using data from more than 130,000 people in projects such as the Nurses&#39; Health Study, researchers analyzed the relationship between people&#39;s diet and weight changes over more than two decades and discovered these overall patterns of carbohydrates. Over the past two decades, people&#39;s average weight has increased by 8.8 kilograms, about 1.5 kilograms every four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly processed carbohydrates have become a target&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If a person pays more attention to the management of carbohydrate quality and sources, use equal amounts of non-starchy vegetables, fruits and Substituting whole grains for foods like refined grains, starchy vegetables, and sugary drinks will result in less weight gain. In addition to foods such as vegetables and whole grains that are consumed in large amounts, an increase in dietary fiber intake also helps with weight management. Every 10 grams of increase per day corresponds to a reduction of 0.8 kilograms of weight gain. Considering that the age of the people in the study happens to span the middle-aged and elderly stages, including the critical period of weight gain in middle age, this large-sample long-term follow-up study has important reference significance for middle-aged people to strengthen weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, although the latest research data has the advantages of large volume and long follow-up time, and can capture more changes in diet and health, there are still some limitations, such as carbohydrate intake and Information such as weight is reported by the respondents themselves. There may be certain errors in these data, which will affect relevant conclusions and interpretations. To better understand the long-term health effects of carbohydrates, more randomized, controlled, long-term studies are needed to further confirm the conclusions in the latest findings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why people become obese, the most popular explanation is energy imbalance, which is commonly known as &quot;eating more and moving less&quot;, but this is not the exact answer to the common obesity phenomenon in humans. As obesity rates remain high, some scientists think the problem may not be that simple. Two common explanations currently take into account more complex body system factors. For example, one view is that on the basis that energy intake exceeds consumption, because modern people eat too much ultra-processed food with high energy density, there may also be endocrine, metabolic and nervous system effects, making it more difficult for people to eat food. Self-control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another explanation related to insulin is that the hormonal response triggered by a large amount of ultra-processed carbohydrates causes the body to store more energy in fat, resulting in a lack of energy required for basic metabolism of the body. , after the brain recognizes this state, it will issue a hunger command, thus entering a vicious cycle of getting fatter and overeating. While the understanding of obesity remains controversial, these analyzes and a host of health studies have focused on carbohydrates in processed foods, including all types of so-called &quot;junk food&quot; that are high in sugar and fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultra-processed carbohydrates are classified as &quot;junk food&quot;, which is not unrelated to the current scientific community&#39;s understanding of the functions of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the only macronutrient for which there is no minimum intake requirement. In reality, in some places people eat a lot, but in other places people eat very little. What specific ranges of carbohydrate intake humans need to maintain in order to survive, be healthy, and even live longer are specific questions that need to be answered by scientific evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The risks and costs of eating out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an evolutionary perspective, larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans, and larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans. The brain needs more energy support. After humans entered agricultural civilization, typical lifestyle changes included growing and eating grains, which are foods rich in carbohydrates. For this reason, the human digestive system has become more adapted to starch, but accordingly, new eating habits have also brought about a series of new health problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Latest research suggests that the mechanisms by which carbohydrates, glycemic index, and glycemic load may have negative health effects on weight may include enhanced responses to changes in insulin and other hormones that favor fat accumulation. . In recent years, some studies have shown that in addition to weight gain, the quality of carbohydrates may also increase a series of other health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, a systematic analysis study published in The Lancet showed that compared with those who ate the least dietary fiber, people who ate the most dietary fiber had better health outcomes. The risks of a range of diseases are 15% to 30% lower, including lower cardiovascular disease mortality, coronary heart disease incidence, stroke incidence and mortality, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. In addition, clinical trial data also shows that eating more dietary fiber will lower blood pressure and total cholesterol. The lowest risk dietary fiber intake is 25 to 29 grams per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, studies have found that whole grain intake may also help reduce overall disease risk. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber in the daily diet, replacing refined grains with whole grains, and eating more coarse grains will not only help with weight management, but also improve people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that with the epidemic of obesity in recent years, scientists have tried to verify a variety of weight loss and weight management strategies, most of which are related to &quot;eating&quot;, including the total energy of meals and the amount of food consumed. time. In 2022, a one-year intermittent fasting trial carried out in China found that while restricting food energy, arranging eating times from 8 am to 4 pm every day and not eating at other times, such a The weight loss effect of this dietary pattern is no better than that of energy restriction alone, indicating the importance of controlling energy intake for weight loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in April 2023, Australian researchers further narrowed the eating time window to 8 am to 12 noon every day, limiting the intake of 30% of the required energy to only these four hours. And you stick to this eating method for three non-consecutive days in a week, and you can eat whatever you want at other times. The experimental results found that under certain circumstances, intermittent fasting that limits meal times still has its own unique effect, not only can Lowering the weight of trial participants could also improve people&#39;s glucose tolerance and reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leonie Heilbronn, a professor at the University of Adelaide School of Medicine and others who have long studied fasting and meal times, explained to Southern Weekend reporters that human metabolism is governed by biological rhythms The brain operates downwards, alternating between day and night 24 hours a day. Improper eating time will cause the brain&#39;s light and dark rhythms to be out of sync with the biological clocks in other organs and tissues. Moving meals earlier and avoiding eating at night will help the body coordinate these rhythms. combine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, a randomized controlled trial in the UK also supported the conclusion of eating early, but it was not because of differences in metabolism at different times, but because the study at that time found that if you eat more in the morning, your overall health will be reduced throughout the day. If the meal time is moved forward, people will not feel too hungry that day, and appetite and total energy intake will be controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Weight management should be a long-term plan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For weight control, no matter what the strategy is or how difficult it is, whether it can be persisted in the long term is the key to weight management. key. Otherwise, no matter how radical and rapid the weight loss method is, it will rebound when you can&#39;t persist, and destroy people&#39;s confidence in weight management during the continuous rebound. Some people whose obesity problem is particularly serious and whose weight loss through conventional methods has been ineffective can only reduce their health risks through extremely limited methods such as bariatric surgery. However, this method requires the removal of part of the stomach, which is extremely invasive and does not work. Not suitable for most people who have less severe weight problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, the latest research controls weight by managing the source of carbohydrates, which does not involve harsh food intake restrictions or long fasting times, and has positive implications for people&#39;s long-term weight management. significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the researchers also found that the relationship between carbohydrate sources and weight management was more obvious in overweight or obese people than in people of normal weight, indicating that these people may be more susceptible to weight changes. Sensitive, more fragile, but in turn suggests that those who pay more attention to the sources of carbohydrates in their diet may benefit more from this type of weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reflected in specific foods, it is necessary to limit sugary drinks and various types of steamed, fried, and baked refined rice noodles, and instead eat more roughly processed grains, fruits, and non-starchy foods. Vegetables etc. The &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; widely praised by scientists is actually more scientific in managing carbohydrate sources and maintaining nutritional balance. In addition to consuming more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, it also eats more beans and nuts, and more Fish and moderate amounts of poultry and dairy, but not a lot of red meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[拿电动汽车对比主战坦克：券商的“奇葩研报”为何层出不穷？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260891]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a screenshot of a research report comparing BYD’s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks was exposed. This screenshot of the research report comes from the special research report on BYD released by the Western Securities R&amp;D Center on October 24, 2023: &quot;BYD (002594.SZ) first coverage report: Cost is the shield, technology is the spear, and the sword points at the global automotive leader&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On page 26 of the research report, in order to present the output power of BYD&#39;s Yi Sifang four-wheel motor, Western Securities compared the output power, engine, and body of BYD&#39;s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks. , amphibious, on-site U-turn, lateral travel, zero-hundred acceleration and the number of driving wheels, and concluded: &quot;The technical indicators of Yi Sifang&#39;s four-wheel motor are comprehensively leading the industry.&quot; Looking up at the amphibious and lateral travel functions of U8, T -90 tanks are &quot;none&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Blue Whale Finance, a relevant person from Western Securities responded that the report was not written by an intern, and that the comparison of BYD’s U8 with main battle tanks was affected by relevant publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the impact of relevant publicity? Previously, many self-media compared BYD’s U8 with tanks. Regardless of whether the research report of Western Securities was influenced by self-media, but comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, and then claiming that its technical indicators are comprehensively leading the industry, whether the relevant arguments and conclusions are rigorous and reasonable will naturally be questioned by investors and public opinion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in June this year, Western Securities and analysts were punished for research reports. According to the warning letter from the Shaanxi Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission: After investigation, the internal control mechanism for the securities research report publishing business of Western Securities is not sound, individual surveys did not fulfill the pre-approval procedures, sales staff participated in the assessment of research report analysts, and compliance management did not cover expert consulting services. The main business links; the quality control and review of research reports are not strict, and some research reports have unreasonable valuation forecasts and imprudent conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant securities research report produced by Luo Yamein, the signed analyst of BYD’s research report, has problems such as imprudent research methods, lack of reasonable justification for some assumptions, and insufficient basis for some conclusions. Not only was it shown The warning letter is also recorded in the securities and futures market integrity files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than half a year later, Western Securities and the same analyst released another controversial research report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this was not done by a securities firm called Western Securities. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of securities companies being fined for &quot;weird research reports&quot;. On December 30, 2021, the Jiangxi Securities Regulatory Bureau issued two law enforcement documents, punishing Guosheng Securities and its researchers for their conduct related to the research report &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot;. On October 18 of that year, a report titled &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot; by Guosheng Securities attracted public attention. In the report, it is explained in detail how the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; dominate the market&#39;s time cycle, and how to apply the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; in timing. Liu Fubing, who issued this research report, has been in the industry for more than 12 years and has been listed as the best analyst of New Fortune 8 times, including No. 1 6 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we say that the above-mentioned research report is &quot;even if it is not shocking, it will never stop&quot;, so it has become a talking point for people. There is also a type of &quot;weird research reports&quot; that are more likely to mislead investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the Jiangsu Securities Regulatory Bureau posted an administrative penalty decision against two analysts Ma Haobo who signed the research report &quot;Fucheng In-depth Report 2: Three 10 billion to support doubling of market value&quot; , Tang Weiliang were fined a total of 200,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a research report released by Soochow Securities boldly predicted that Fucheng Shares (600965.SH), &quot;the number one A-share funeral stock&quot;, would be the absolute leader in the funeral industry in the future. And gave Fucheng shares a &quot;buy&quot; rating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 25 of that year, Fucheng Shares issued a &quot;clarification announcement&quot; to clarify the relevant contents of the research report. Soochow Securities&#39; &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the number of tombs after the completion of the third phase of Fucheng&#39;s pagoda cemetery will reach 400,000. Based on this data, it was concluded that Fucheng&#39;s net profit would be 15.5 billion yuan. After investigation, Fucheng Co., Ltd.&#39;s pagoda cemetery plans to build about 125,000 tombs. &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; also stated that the industrial merger and acquisition fund jointly established by Fucheng Co., Ltd. and an investment company has a total scale of 10 billion yuan. The current scale is 1 billion yuan, and the follow-up fund scale will be 9 billion yuan. After investigation, as of October 2016, the size of the above-mentioned M&amp;A fund was only 1 billion yuan. The status of subsequent funds will need to be made by Fucheng Shares based on the progress of the first-phase fund and the quality of the assets acquired. Third, &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the company&#39;s major shareholders have 10 billion in cash and have sufficient funds to serve as the backend of the above-mentioned merger and acquisition funds. After investigation, as of October 2016, the major shareholders had not made a decision in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant quoted data in the research report released by Soochow Securities is far from the actual data of Fucheng Shares. I am afraid that the source of the information and whether the data has been investigated and verified are all a mess. How can a research report like this deserve market credibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called research reports are analysis reports prepared by financial institutions such as securities companies, fund companies, banks, etc. They mainly include company analysis reports, industry analysis reports, investment strategy reports, etc. The purpose of the research report is to help investors better understand the market, the company, and the industry so that they can be used as a reference when investing. However, the content is full of errors and omissions, pointing the research direction towards Feng Shui, or making gimmicks of comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, which reflects that some brokers do not pay attention to the professionalism of the research report, and even use the research report as a tool for speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The motivation behind securities firms’ “weird research reports” cannot simply be attributed to sensationalism. In financial markets, information release is a form of power to some extent. Therefore, regulatory authorities have corresponding standards for financial institutions, listed companies, and media to release various types of investment-oriented information. As professional information providers, brokerage research reports influence investors&#39; decisions to a considerable extent. However, in the process of pursuing so-called market influence, some securities companies make some shocking remarks to attract attention and attention. There will be traffic or profit considerations, and they may even interfere or distort market trends. Since brokerages are also one of the important stock holders in the stock market, if a brokerage publishes a research report that is &quot;bullish&quot; or &quot;short&quot; on a listed company or a certain sector in an exaggerated way, and secretly buys or sells the corresponding stocks, wouldn&#39;t it be typical? Manipulation of the stock market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, regulatory authorities have also promulgated relevant new management policies many times in recent years. In May last year, the regulatory authorities sent the &quot;Notice on the &quot;Double Random&quot; On-site Inspection of the Securities Research Report Business to all securities firms. The report shows that in 2022, a special &quot;double random&quot; on-site inspection of research and reporting business will be carried out in the entire industry, covering a total of 45 securities companies and 300 research reports. In September of that year, the China Securities Association reiterated the self-regulatory management of the securities research business of securities firms, including that holdings of more than 1% of the research target stocks must be disclosed and that reverse operations are not allowed within two trading days of the release of the research report; however, various management measures do not seem to hinder The continuation of &quot;Weird Research Reports&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that for strange research reports, the regulatory authorities’ punishment and supervision need to be strengthened. Warning letters, inclusion in integrity files, etc. cannot touch the core interests of relevant personnel and securities companies, so that they would rather have short-term market effects than adhere to compliance. Only by clarifying the responsibilities of securities firms in the production and release of research reports and continuing to increase penalties for violations can the regulatory authorities stop the vicious cycle of &quot;bad coins eliminating good coins&quot; in securities firms&#39; research reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
