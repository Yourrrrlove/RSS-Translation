Based on the physical and mental development characteristics and brain development characteristics of infants and young children, providing them with scientific, rich, and appropriate information stimulation and training can develop children&#39;s physical and mental potential and promote their all-round development. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early education can be divided into two stages: 0-3 years old, infants and young children do not go to kindergarten, but early education can already be carried out; after 3 years old, children can formally When entering kindergarten, in addition to systematic early education in schools, early education institutions outside schools also play a supplementary role. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For a long time in the past, the concept of early education in China was not popular, and many parents were not aware of the function of early education. After the 1990s, with the continuous development of China&#39;s economy and the closer economic and ideological exchanges with foreign countries, foreign early childhood education concepts began to influence Chinese parents, and a number of early childhood education institutions came into being. However, the industry is still in its infancy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second decade of the new century, the early childhood education industry has truly ushered in rapid development. As Chinese people become richer, they pay more attention to their children’s education and are more willing to invest in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people born in the 1980s and 1990s have become parents. Young people are more likely to accept some new educational concepts. They pay more attention to their children&#39;s early education than their parents, believing that this is the first and most important thing for children. But it is also the &quot;starting line&quot; that has been ignored in the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, foreign early childhood education institutions represented by Mejim have entered our country in a large scale. The more mature and systematic operating models they represent have emerged from first- and second-tier cities. It continues to spread to third- and fourth-tier cities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Data from Zhiyan Consulting shows that since 2014, the number of investment events in the domestic early childhood education service industry has increased, and the amount of investment has increased significantly. The number of investment and financing events in 2014 was nearly 50, and it exceeded 110 in 2015. From 2015 to 2018, there were more than 90 investment and financing events every year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From 2012 to 2016, the amount of investment in the early childhood education industry has increased year by year, exceeding 4 billion yuan in 2017. In 2018, the investment amount soared to 9.644 billion Yuan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to &lt;/span>; research reports, the market size of my country’s early childhood education industry has increased year by year from 2016 to 2020, with the market size reaching 327.6 billion yuan and 327.6 billion yuan respectively in 2021 and 2022. 350 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the number of newborns is decreasing each year as the fertility rate declines, the early education market, a &quot;hundred billion cake&quot;, is still favored by the outside world due to its huge population base. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/f504711fea7233163eb90242fcedefc6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/f504711fea7233163eb90242fcedefc6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253570 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;From unlimited glory to the edge of thunder&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the pre-epidemic era, the early childhood education industry has been in a state of expansion: various online and offline institutions have shown their respective Supernatural powers; there are various subdivisions - English, mathematical thinking, Chinese language, children&#39;s songs, picture books, young children&#39;s animation, etc., all of which have formed specialized tracks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2018, Mejim successfully landed on the A-share market and became the “No. 1 early childhood education stock”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Meijim’s 2018 financial report shows that the company’s total revenue in 2018 was 265 million yuan, and its total profit was 60.49 million yuan; in 2019, the company’s total revenue increased by 137.35% year-on-year %, to 630 million yuan, and the total profit increased by 302.54% to 243 million yuan; as of Q1 2019, there were 451 US Jim centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The arrival of the epidemic has had a huge impact on all offline industries, and Mejim is no exception. Mejim&#39;s total revenue in 2020 was 356 million yuan - almost halved compared to 2019. The total revenue in 2021 was 336 million yuan, and the total revenue in 2022 was 154 million yuan - only half of 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2023 was only 29.54 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company&#39;s operating profit is even worse. The total profit in 2020 was -531 million yuan, and the total profit in 2021 was -57.4551 million yuan. The total profit was -610 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sluggish early childhood education industry raises the risk of “explosion” because almost all early childhood education institutions are in the form of prepaid consumption, that is, the institutions sell lesson packages to parents, and a lesson package can easily cost It costs tens of thousands of yuan, and the course package covers a period ranging from a few months to a few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although in August 2018, the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Regulating the Development of Off-Campus Training Institutions&quot;, it put forward clear requirements for early childhood education and other off-campus training institutions to collect tuition fees from &lt;span>;educated persons: &quot;No A one-time charge for a time span of more than 3 months.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, it is common for early childhood education institutions to charge a one-time fee for a time span of more than 3 months, and it has even become Industry practice. When the institution is operating normally, the course package format will be more &quot;favorable&quot;; once the institution becomes unsustainable and the offline institution closes, parents will have no place to take the remaining courses they purchased and would like&lt;/span>; a refund. But it is also difficult to get a refund, which is like a &quot;thunder&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that the epidemic is an important reason for the difficulties encountered by many early childhood education institutions. In fact, the crisis of many early childhood education institutions has already been laid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, blind expansion leads to a sharp increase in costs. Early childhood education institutions are mostly offline education. They are usually rented in bustling shopping malls, with an average area of ​​about 200 square meters. The monthly rent and labor costs are very high, and the monthly operating costs can easily reach tens of thousands of yuan. If customer renewal and new acquisition are not ideal, you will lose money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the pre-epidemic era, many early childhood education institutions were eager for quick success and expansion too fast, and had already shown signs of operational difficulties. The impact of the epidemic has completely erupted the crisis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Secondly, due to the rapid development of the early childhood education industry in the past few years, many people want to get a piece of the pie and have opened early childhood education institutions. Due to the lack of standards and insufficient teachers in the early childhood education industry, many practitioners do not even have kindergarten teacher qualification certificates and can directly take up their posts after simple training. This has also resulted in the overall level of the early childhood education industry being low, and many parents have lost trust in early childhood education institutions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Under the impact of the epidemic, many parents found that their children actually grew very well without attending early childhood education classes. They couldn’t help but reflect on whether the early childhood education classes they enrolled in before were paying attention.&lt;/span>; IQ tax. Nowadays, many parents will search for relevant information on social media when registering for classes. Once there are more voices of &quot;distrust&quot; of early childhood education institutions, parents&#39; willingness to register for classes will decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, although the epidemic is over, early childhood education institutions have not &lt;span>; experienced the rapid recovery expected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Standardized development will have a future&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early childhood education is still a market worth hundreds of billions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the fertility rate has declined, Chinese parents currently attach great importance to their children’s education; under the “double reduction” policy, the early childhood education industry has not been greatly affected, but instead the discipline The weakening of training has made many parents more willing to invest in their children in aspects such as painting and physical fitness, and these are areas that early childhood education has always been involved in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The early childhood education industry is now facing difficulties, which is an opportunity for the industry to take a break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, in the pre-epidemic era, although the early childhood education industry developed rapidly, it was generally in a state of barbaric growth: there were no standards and a lack of regulations. &lt;span>;For example, my country&#39;s nurseries and kindergartens adopt a &quot;dual-track system&quot; model. Childcare services for infants aged 0-3 years old are separated from care and education for children aged 3-6 years old. The former is managed by the Health Commission and the latter is managed by the education department. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In terms of curriculum connection, our country currently has clearer educational suggestions for the learning and development goals and child care work of children aged 3 to 6 years old. Relatively speaking, children aged 0 to 3 years old There is a lack of educational advice for infants and young children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This gives many early childhood education institutions room to fish in troubled waters. Although parents spend a lot of money to send their children to institutions, there is actually no way to judge whether the courses are reasonable and whether the teachers are qualified. I don&#39;t know if it has any effect. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as this &quot;fuzzy&quot; space exists and the standards of excellence and inferiority are not clear, it will be difficult to establish the rules of survival of the fittest. To establish industry norms, not only early childhood education institutions need self-discipline, but also relevant departments such as education need to gather industry experts and issue relevant standards so that early childhood education has rules to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, regarding the current prepaid consumption problem that is common in early childhood education institutions, it is necessary to effectively strengthen the supervision of funds to prevent early childhood education institutions from misappropriating funds, which in turn triggers the risk of thunderstorms. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early childhood education institutions should be more cautious when expanding and not misappropriate consumers&#39; money to do risky things. Only when funds are safer, the industry is more orderly, and parents&#39; trust is established, can the early childhood education industry truly develop in the long run. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《大宅门》导演郭宝昌去世]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258485]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On October 11, 2023, Guo Baochang died in Beijing at the age of 83.

When she was critically ill, she asked to see Xu Zhimo&#39;s ex-wife Zhang Youyi, and the two finally met. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A century ago, an ordinary village in southeast England witnessed an extraordinary event. The village is called Shaxton, and the protagonists of the incident are two young Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boys have been studying in the United States and the United Kingdom for more than two years, and the girls just left a conservative small town in China a few weeks ago; the boys are auditors at Cambridge University, and the girls have only learned basic daily English for a few weeks. ; The boy wants to be a pioneer in the new era and become a blockbuster, while the girl just hopes to adapt to life in a foreign country and have the opportunity to learn some new knowledge; the boy falls in love with a girl who comes from a reformist family and is studying in the UK at the time. Not long after the girl arrives in London, she vaguely notices her husband. There is another person that I like, but I still hope that my husband, who has always regarded me as a &quot;country bumpkin&quot;, can communicate more with me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This couple is Xu Zhimo and Zhang Youyi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1921, less than nine months after Zhang Youyi was sent to England by her parents-in-law, Xu Zhimo suddenly filed for divorce and left without saying goodbye a week later, leaving her who was more than three months pregnant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2001, Hong Kong scholar and writer Kong Huiyi passed through Shaxton. The size of the town expanded and the old houses were demolished, but the practical and boring temperament did not change. She thought at the time: The struggle of a young Chinese woman in the early 20th century was buried in this inconspicuous place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, she thought again: How could the story of Chinese women be buried in just one or two places? The idea eventually evolved into a book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese women&#39;s movement began in the 1880s, with two major slogans: &quot;anti-foot-binding&quot; and &quot;promoting women&#39;s education.&quot; At that time, both the reformers and the revolutionary men believed that self-improvement was the basis for national salvation, so they included women&#39;s issues on the social reform agenda. At this time, the expectations for women were still limited to being good wives and mothers. Although they had greatly developed physically and mentally compared with their predecessors, they still only fulfilled their traditional family roles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The New Culture Movement broke the traditional family operating model of elders and younger ones, striving for personal and individual liberation. This new trend created another ideal image of free and independent women. To be called a &quot;May Fourth&quot; new woman with an independent personality, she must meet several conditions: receive education in a new-style school; have a career after graduation; be independent in marriage; and participate in public life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, education is the foundation. For adult women, they are unable to strive for new educational opportunities, so in the era of drastic changes, they are labeled as backward and feudal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Huiyi hopes to break this simple label division and &quot;explore whether the women of the May Fourth era can be revalued in a fair manner and whether the world they face can be seen from their perspective.&quot; In &quot;May 4th Marriage&quot;, she went against the tradition of male-centered biographies and turned her pen to seven women: Zhu An, Xu Guangping, Jiang Dongxiu, Cao Peisheng, Zhang Youyi, Lu Xiaoman, and Lin Huiyin, trying to explore through their life circumstances the problems faced by women at that time. practical problems, depicting the various faces of Chinese women in the period of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The trend of &quot;escape from marriage&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the new cultural movement or the new concept of women, they all have the same core issues: marital autonomy and divorce. Since most young people had entered into arranged marriages at that time, there was a trend of &quot;escape from marriage&quot; - young men leaving home alone to start a new life in order to get rid of their old wives. According to a 1922 women&#39;s publication, 70% of the old-style wives abandoned by the new youth in Henan Province ended up committing suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality of marriage and divorce in the new cultural period is a mirror that reflects how the drastic changes in social norms affect women from different backgrounds, and how they deal with the tide of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Huiyi wrote about Zhu An, hoping to &quot;find their voices for a generation of women who have suffered a lot and are speechless.&quot; When Lu Xun started his second marriage, he did not abandon his first wife Zhu An financially and nominally. However, the blow to Zhu An was emotional and spiritual. When she was still alive, Lu Xun and the people around him regarded her as a gift that could not be refused. She might be worthy of pity, but not respect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous biographies surrounding Lu Xun, descriptions of Zhu An often tended to indicate that he was &quot;inadequate&quot;. Kong Huiyi pointed out that this historical perspective of discrimination against old women is based on prejudice and does not really reflect the mentality and personality of the person involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu An was interviewed by reporters in her later years. When talking about her relationship with Lu Xun and Xu Guangping, she once said: &quot;Mr. Zhou was not bad to me. There were no quarrels between us. We each have our own lives. I He should be forgiven... Mr. Xu treats me very well, she understands my thoughts, and she is willing to support me... She is indeed a good person.&quot; It can be seen from her words that she puts Lu Xun and Xu Guangping on an equal footing with herself On the other hand, she had no jealousy towards Xu Guangping, but instead established a mutually respectful relationship with her. This is no easy task, and this shows that her heart and character cannot be summed up simply by the label &quot;old woman&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu An was sacrificed between the old and the new. In contrast, Xu Guangping had the opportunity to receive modern education and enter the world of new women. However, the marriage relationship established through free love and personal choice caused Xu Guangping to lose his original independent status. She had her own career before she and Lu Xun lived together. After arriving in Shanghai, she actively looked for a job. However, she later became Lu Xun&#39;s secretary and assistant, embarking on a completely different path than she originally expected - becoming a virtuous person in the new cultural norms. A good wife and mother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guangping has always kept three hundred yuan in savings as &quot;emergency money&quot; and publicly told Lu Xun and his friends that if their relationship breaks down, the money can temporarily maintain her livelihood until she resumes her life. Get a job. A meager three hundred yuan became Xu Guangping&#39;s only way to maintain his independent personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traditional concept of &quot;men taking charge outside and women taking charge inside&quot; has not been diminished by the New Culture Movement. When Lin Huiyin faced Liang Sicheng, who was pragmatic and capable and treated her well, she could not help but complain that she was burdened with housework and was unable to develop her talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1950s and 1950s, although many women had successful careers, they were unable to get rid of the dilemma of marriage and love throughout their lives. Cao Peisheng is an extreme example. She married the husband arranged by her parents at the age of sixteen. With the support of her brother studying in the United States, she continued to study at the Women&#39;s Normal School when she was eighteen. When her husband&#39;s family decided to have a concubine, Cao Peisheng resolutely left the marriage. Soon after, she fell in love with Hu Shi. At that time, Hu Shi had been married to Jiang Dongxiu for six years and had three children. Hu Shi failed to divorce, and the two fell in love for three years, but the hopeless relationship was finally shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first female professor of agriculture in China, Cao Peisheng has made extraordinary achievements in cotton and potato research and genetics. However, her bitter love with Hu Shi lingered throughout her life. She filled in a lot of words, constantly remembering the passionate love that year. After his death, he was buried on the only road from his hometown to Hu Shi&#39;s hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Huiyi believes that Cao Peisheng’s situation reflects the conflict between old and new culture. New women and their love partners often cannot control the compass of life. Although their eyes are on the new world, they are faced with the reality created by the old tradition. Stumble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/hr2KLTa7VdEADCwhMyt0UrsUlRnkbZScs5KLBFGv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;671&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/hr2KLTa7VdEADCwhMyt0UrsUlRnkbZScs5KLBFGv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253794&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1930, Xu Guangping took a photo with her husband Lu Xun and son Zhou Haiying. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Between the Old and the New&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Cao Peisheng was born in 1902 In that year, the Qing government issued an edict to &quot;anti-foot-binding&quot; and &quot;promote women&#39;s education.&quot; There is a gulf between what government says is one thing and how society works is another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actual effect of the ban was very small. The custom of foot binding continued to flourish until the early years of the Republic of China, and Cao Peisheng was not spared. She left her hometown in 1915 and followed her married brother Cao Chengke&#39;s family to Wuchang. Cao Chengke asked a tutor to teach his sister instead of sending her to a new school. This also shows that although the slogan of &quot;promoting girls&#39; education&quot; has been shouted for more than ten years, the results are still limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the new cultural transformation stage, the boundaries between the old and the new are far less clear-cut than imagined. Xu Guangping was born in Guangzhou. His mother is from Macau and his maternal grandfather is an overseas Chinese. However, his mother&#39;s family attaches great importance to the &quot;three-inch golden lotus&quot;, so they forced Xu Guangping to bind his feet. However, his father did not agree. However, the reason was that Xu Guangping had been married since he was a child. , she will marry into a country family in the future, and her small feet will be an obstacle to her married life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elders on the father&#39;s side did not allow girls in the family to study, thinking that it would dampen the ambition of boys. Xu Guangping&#39;s mother, who had studied with her brothers, raised objections and won the opportunity for her daughter to enter a private school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guangping’s parents had conflicting views on their daughter’s foot-binding and schooling issues, which reflected the social background at that time: even though they lived in Guangzhou and Macau, which had a lot of contact with the outside world, the people’s understanding of “new” and “old” The measurement is still uneven, there is no fixed standard, and opinions are mostly affected by personal experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, the term &quot;new woman&quot; also has multi-layered connotations. Jiang Dongxiu, newly added to the simplified version of &quot;May Fourth Marriage&quot;, has never attended a new school and has no career of her own. However, she learned to write letters in vernacular after marriage and tried to write an autobiography. Twenty years of living in Beijing transformed her. He has his own opinions and social circle, and also fights for the rights of Liang Zongdai&#39;s first wife, appearing in court as a witness in their divorce lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She is not limited to any frame. She is neither a traditional woman who &#39;obeys her husband&#39; or &#39;submit her son&#39;, nor is she a new-style Yun Niang who follows her husband and his wife, nor is she a Western-style lady who likes to dress up fashionably.&quot; In Kong Huiyi&#39;s view, Jiang Dongxiu, who has an independent personality and individuality, is also an atypical &quot;new woman&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared to Jiang Dongxiu who &quot;steps out of the box&quot;, Lu Xiaoman, who seems to be trendy, is actually the one who &quot;falls into the cracks&quot;. She reflected another common new image of women in society at that time - leisurely at home, dressed fashionably, and her daily life consisted of shopping, attending theaters, playing cards, and dancing. In her early years, she was in and out of social circles and was the envy of everyone. Xu Zhimo made her leave her original life track. The new social circle forced her to face the scrutiny of another new female standard. In Xu Zhimo&#39;s circle of friends, no one would think that a modern woman who is accustomed to the life of an official wife is the new woman in their eyes. Lu Xiaoman is like a lost person, falling into the cracks of culture. Among them, the influence of family cannot be ignored. The female model she can refer to - the circle in which her mother hangs out, are such upper-class wives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the first wives of new culture celebrities, Zhang Youyi has left the farthest. Today, people associate her name with successful career women, but they tend to ignore the various conditions required for old women to grow into new women. Reflection on this point is the book&#39;s deep attention to female identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trapped alone in England became a turning point in Zhang Youyi&#39;s fate. After joining her brother in Europe, she regained her ideal of studying at a normal school before marriage and studied in Germany for more than three years, which had a decisive impact on her path after returning to China. Later, it was a story that people talked about: he took charge of the Shanghai Women&#39;s Bank, served as the manager of Yunshang Clothing Company, and became famous in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after having a successful career, Zhang Youyi still felt inferior and could not let go of the fact that she had received less new education. In her later years, she recounted the past to her grandniece Zhang Bangmei and said: &quot;In China, women are nothing: they obey their father at home, their husbands when they get married, and their sons after their husbands die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this book, the last person to appear is It was Lin Huiyin, who was also born the latest among the seven women. As the leader of the May Fourth New Women in many people&#39;s minds, Lin Huiyin has achieved a rare balance between career and marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Douban netizen wrote a comment for &quot;May Fourth Marriage&quot;: &quot;Leaving Lin Huiyin for the last time really has a special meaning. This sense of strength is both the intentional cultivation of the family (father) and personal sensitivity and wisdom. , and cannot be separated from Liang Sicheng&#39;s inner stable &quot;freedom&quot; - which is also the only equality and autonomy in several relationships. Even so, it is difficult to escape the troubles of upbringing and family chores, not to mention the repeated hammering of the great waves of the times. The author has already stated that it is difficult to turn around: one must be young, have a good family background, and have fathers and brothers who are sensible and supportive of women—Zhang Youyi’s luck is a personal achievement and indeed a gift from fate.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;&lt;strong>;“To this day, women still face a lot of traditional pressure”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The order of the characters in this book seems to have a special meaning. Have you had any special considerations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before I started writing, I felt that the descriptions of the so-called old women and new women failed to show the reality of the period of cultural drastic changes. To change the traditional conclusion about women, in addition to the author&#39;s basic position, we must also have substantial and reliable materials. As far as first-hand information is concerned, I always think it is inherently insufficient. How to remedy it? Choosing characters whose life lines have intersected can provide readers with overlapping visual effects, allowing everyone to better understand that things are not black and white. I feel that this book is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle with some missing pieces, relying only on the integration and comparison of the existing pieces to give readers a rough idea of ​​the overall picture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Seven women have various contrasts. Among them, Cao Peisheng There seems to be a sharp contrast with Zhang Youyi, one who has a successful career but is trapped in love all his life, and one who donates autumn fans but shines in the workplace. When you first read and sorted out the life experiences of these women, did you intuitively experience a sense of reflection? Or experienced a deepening of cognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Their experiences have some similarities. For example, after their marriages failed, they both received valuable opportunities for further study, and also gained valuable opportunities in their respective lives. The industry writes a new page for women. I think the differences between them in life are mainly due to their personalities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When collecting materials, I did not deliberately make comparisons, but the process of writing a book is like making friends with the characters in the book. The understanding will deepen, just like making friends in reality, and you will embrace them. Looking at their lives with an understanding attitude, they often have the feeling that &quot;people are different and each has their own face.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You emphasize the merging of boundaries between the new and the old in the new cultural transformation stage It’s not as clear as imagined. Is this one of the important starting points for you in writing this book? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is indeed a very important point. I have always been skeptical of black and white discussions, because our own experiences constantly remind us that life is not black and white. To this day, women still face many traditional pressures. For example, if you study for two more degrees, you will be warned that you will not be able to get married; if you don&#39;t get married, you will become the target of preaching every time relatives get together; if you get married and don&#39;t have children, you will be accused of being &quot;selfish.&quot; All these are just trivial matters, but they are annoying enough. Not to mention being belittled and taken advantage of in the workplace. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This kind of narrative in the book can also be seen as old and new Ambiguity of concept and identity: Unlike Zhu An and Lu Xiaoman, Jiang Dongxiu has truly gained respect in her husband&#39;s circle of friends. What factors do you think lead to this difference? At that time, were the standards for evaluating women in cultural circles complex and diverse? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Tang Degang said that Jiang Dongxiu was lucky. I agree very much because her husband has a gentle personality and a Western gentlemanly demeanor towards women, which makes her She can play to her strengths. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the cultural circle is not a single one. Each circle has its own internal operating standards. For example, when Zhu An was in the big Xintaimen family of the Zhou family, he would not be considered unqualified; Lu Xiaoman was the envy of everyone when he was in and out of social circles in his early years. It is only after entering a new circle that they are measured by another standard. Even if it is not a period of cultural upheaval, there are examples of such situations. For example, when an ordinary family marries a wealthy family, both parties will face new standards of measurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“When it comes to women’s experience, economic issues always rear their heads”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The article mentions that Lin Huiyin is regarded by many as China&#39;s leading new woman in the 20th century, and the same appreciation is revealed between the lines in your words. Lin Huiyin&#39;s consistent choices in career and relationships, in addition to her rationality and determination, does she have any deeper qualities? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What I appreciate most is Lin Huiyin’s calm attitude. As she said herself, she is a person with equally strong reason and emotion, so I believe that her decision is not purely driven by reason, but &quot;love&quot; also plays a large role. Speaking of being calm, I think this may be the reason why she wanted to see Zhang Youyi when she was critically ill - because Zhang Youyi&#39;s abandonment had something to do with her, she couldn&#39;t be calm. It is impossible to know what she wanted to say at that time. If I put on my hat as a novelist and made up a sentence for her, it would be &quot;I admire you.&quot; However, maybe she really doesn&#39;t need to speak: Zhang Youyi is willing to see her, she has the demeanor of a successful lady, and she has children and grandchildren around her, so she can feel at ease. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why was the character Jiang Dongxiu not included in the first edition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a very important question. When I wrote the first version, I felt that Jiang Dongxiu was elusive. Looking back, it was a bit paradoxical, because I later realized that the biggest obstacle might be mahjong. This is related to the situation of big family gatherings when I was a child. During every festive occasion, the elders would always play mahjong when they got together, which we children found very noisy. But it was mahjong that finally broke the psychological barrier for me: One of my great-aunts was critically ill and was hospitalized. When relatives came to visit, she said in confusion, &quot;Ask the servant to open the table for you.&quot; This finally made me understand the role of mahjong in that generation. social function. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xu Guangping &quot;founded through free love and personal choice The marriage relationship actually caused her to lose her original independent status.&quot; In your observation, what are the significant similarities and differences between the situation of contemporary Chinese women in the workplace, marriage and love, compared with those during the New Culture Movement? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t know much about the lives of the younger generation in mainland China, so it is difficult to make in-depth comparisons. All we can say is this: Human nature is basically the same, and this is largely the source of women’s distress. For example, everyone thinks that women are attentive and good at taking care of others, so the young and old in the family are all supported by women. Even in the West, the women&#39;s movement has been booming for decades. When a couple gives birth to a child, the financial burden of childcare is too heavy. If one of them is required to stay at home to take care of the child, the woman will always resign or work part-time, and the man will be responsible. Raising children is a hit or miss, and the result is that when retirement comes, women&#39;s pensions are far lower than men&#39;s. When it comes to the female experience, financial issues always rear their heads. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the differences between now and the May Fourth Movement, the main reason is that the social structure is different. The population has moved to big cities, and urban culture provides more opportunities for women. Population policy has also left many families with only one daughter. Now girls are treated much better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After nearly ten years of revising this book, what new understandings have you gained? and thinking? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first realization is to see your own blind spots, which are Jiang Dongxiu and Mahjong mentioned above. In addition, you can appreciate the role that details can play. For example, in the chapter about Xu Guangping, the new edition provides a lot of figures, including her salary in Guangzhou and prices in the 1940s, so the narrative is broader. Of course, the pursuit of details cannot be endless, and in the end you have to face the shortcomings calmly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Passing through Shaxton was an opportunity to write a book.

Can you share one or two of your travels that touched you the most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What impressed me most was seeing the Zhou family’s Xintai Gate in Shaoxing, the interlocking dowry beds in the museum, and the sitting The boat goes from Jianhu Lake to Yuewang Temple. Regarding Zhu An&#39;s written materials, except for her letters in her later years, they basically have to be filtered out from other people&#39;s accounts like gold mining. To understand the environment of her early life, one must rely on that one-week trip to Shaoxing. In addition, I was very moved when I read the original letters of correspondence between Zhu An, Xu Guangping and Hai Ying at the Lu Xun Museum in Beijing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that it was several years before I conceived this book. A Shanghai scholar accompanied me to the former residence of Lu Xun. When he stood outside the door, he said: This is also the former residence of Xu Guangping. I felt very &quot;comforted&quot; because there were also male scholars who noticed this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
