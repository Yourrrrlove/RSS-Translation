Big attention. On September 26, the Datong City Joint Investigation Team reported that it was confirmed that two 9-year-old male students &quot;repeatedly committed serious bad behaviors such as insults, beatings, and bullying&quot; against another male student in the same dormitory. The offender &quot;will be reprimanded in accordance with the law and ordered to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification&quot;, and his or her guardian &quot;will be reprimanded and ordered to receive family education guidance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This official notification did not calm public opinion, but instead caused greater controversy, because the punishment for the two bullies was too light, and it was not even a punishment at all. The vague statement in the official report that &quot;repeatedly committed insults, beatings, bullying and other serious bad behaviors&quot; is actually so shocking that even adults can&#39;t imagine it. It is difficult to recount, but I can only say that in addition to long-term insults and beatings, it also included serious personal insults and sexual assaults. If these acts were committed by adults, they would undoubtedly constitute the crime of child molestation. Given the severity of the circumstances and the severity of the impact, they would likely be sentenced to the fullest possible sentence. If the victim is a girl, it is a crime of rape of a young girl, and the death penalty may not be an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference in punishment caused by the age difference between the perpetrators has been a matter of widespread public concern for a long time. Two little boys committed such serious crimes, but because they were only 9 years old, their punishment could only be &quot;admonishment, forced psychological counseling and behavioral modification.&quot; How can such a painless treatment comfort the victims? This is unacceptable to the public. However, according to a well-known police influencer, &quot;At this age, it really can only be like this.&quot; Is the law really powerless against young devils? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the purpose of &quot;protecting minors&quot;, China&#39;s criminal law does stipulate that minors under a certain age who commit crimes will not be held criminally responsible. Before the 11th Amendment to the Criminal Law comes into effect, minors who are over 14 years old and under 16 years old are only required to bear criminal responsibility when they commit eight serious crimes. Those under 14 years old are not criminally responsible for any crime they commit. . Even though the Criminal Law Amendment (11) stipulates that those who are over 12 years old but under 14 years old can be held criminally responsible for intentional homicide or intentional injury if the circumstances are serious and the impact is serious, but those under 12 years old are still absolutely exempt from criminal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the previous criminal law also stipulated that those who are not subject to criminal punishment due to age can, in addition to ordering their guardians to discipline them, also be &quot;cused and educated by the government&quot; when necessary. In 2019, after the C&amp;E system was abolished, the new criminal law changed this to &quot;specialized correctional education in accordance with the law.&quot; The new law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency makes specific provisions on this type of specialized correctional education: If a minor commits an act stipulated in the criminal law and is not subject to criminal punishment because he is under the legal age of criminal responsibility, the education administration shall, upon evaluation and approval by the Specialized Education Steering Committee, The department, together with the public security organ, may decide to provide special correctional education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; here is compulsory. It only requires the evaluation and approval of the Specialized Education Steering Committee and is decided by the education administration department in conjunction with the public security agency. It does not require the consent of the guardian. The objects of this type of specialized correctional education, even in specialized schools, must receive education in &quot;specialized places.&quot; This specialized place must &quot;implement closed-loop management. The public security organs and judicial administrative departments are responsible for the correction of minors. The education administrative department shall be responsible for the education of minors.” There is no age limit for the subjects of this kind of specialized correctional education, and there is no &quot;no less than 12 years old&quot; rule mentioned by the aforementioned big V. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, there are no legal provisions for the treatment of young serious offenders. Although being sent to a specialized school for correctional education is not a criminal punishment, it is at least much stronger than indifferent treatments such as &quot;reprimands and orders to undergo behavior modification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in reality, these legal provisions are rarely applied. The first reason is that there are few specialized schools, and the second reason is that most places have not yet established corresponding departments and procedures. According to research data from the Ninth Procuratorate of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, which is responsible for the prosecution of minors, as early as 2019, the central government proposed that &quot;local governments at or above the county level should reasonably set up specialized schools according to needs.&quot; However, as of May 2022, there are only There are more than 110 schools, and 9 provinces have no specialized schools, and many provinces and even the most populous provinces only have one specialized school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are many minors who need to receive such &quot;specialized correctional education&quot;. According to data from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, in 2021, procuratorial organs in various regions, in collaboration with relevant departments, sent 2,159 minors who had committed crimes to vocational schools for correctional education. Hainan Daily also reported a few days ago that 4 specialized schools have been built in Hainan province, and have admitted 276 students in the first eight months of 2023 (the report did not specify how many of these students were forced to receive specialized correctional education in accordance with the law). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient places and institutions leave many delinquent minors who should be forced to receive &quot;specialized correctional education&quot; with nowhere to send them. They can only be &quot;reprimanded&quot; and let go. This may allow some minors to regard the Minors Protection Law as a talisman and engage in illegal and criminal activities without restraint: they will not be severely punished anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to providing powerful &quot;special corrective education&quot; for minors who have committed crimes, their guardians should also pay a greater price for poor education. For example, the amount of “mental damage compensation” in current Chinese legal practice is too low and has been criticized. Judicial practice should greatly increase the upper limit of the amount of mental damage compensation. On the one hand, this can better compensate the victims, and on the other hand, it can also improve the deterrence of illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the protection of minors is not the protection of minors from crime. Only by severely punishing and dealing with minors who break the law and commit crimes can we better reduce minors&#39; violations and crimes and protect more minors. The compulsory specialized correctional education system should be implemented as soon as possible and implemented effectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为了避世、高考、不流浪……：在鹤岗买房的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257724]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[走向抽象化的数学]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257669]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/jQiplTYJng0JKlmMwDq1HulW9MYmPLvLsk4KRtjJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/jQiplTYJng0JKlmMwDq1HulW9MYmPLvLsk4KR tjJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252166&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: left;&quot;>;The real counterpart to &quot;abstract algebra&quot; should be &quot;abstract art&quot;, which specifically refers to Those paintings without any identifiable subject, the Russian painter Kandinsky is considered the first &quot;abstract painter&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Set Theory and Axiomatization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;The changes in geometry and algebra in the 19th century brought rapid development and unprecedented prosperity to mathematics in the 20th century. Modern mathematics is no longer just a few traditional subjects such as geometry, algebra, and analysis. It has become a knowledge system with many branches and a complex structure, and it is still developing and changing. The characteristics of mathematics are not only strict logic, but also add two other characteristics, namely high degree of abstraction and wide application, and thus form two major scopes of modern mathematics research, namely pure mathematics and applied mathematics. Some of the latter developed the computer, which, apart from its importance, has provided more employment to mankind than all other branches of mathematics put together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pure mathematics was initially driven by two factors, namely the penetration of set theory and the application of axiomatic methods. Set theory was originally founded by Cantor in the late 19th century. It was opposed by many great mathematicians, including Kronecker. It was later recognized because of its increasingly obvious role in mathematics. Sets were initially built on number sets or point sets, and soon the scope of the definition was expanded to include any set of elements, such as a set of functions, a set of geometric figures, etc. This allows set theory to enter different fields of mathematics as a universal language, causing profound changes in basic concepts such as integrals, functions, and spaces in mathematics. It also stimulates the changes between intuitionism and formalism in mathematical logic that will be discussed in this article. Further development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor was a Dane born in St. Petersburg. His Jewish parents did business in Russia when they were young, and their business expanded to Hamburg, London and even New York. Like Kelly, he can be said to be a role model for the children of businessmen outside the country, but Cantor&#39;s grandparents came to St. Petersburg. At the age of 11, Cantor moved to Germany with his parents, where he spent most of his life. He went to high school in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and later went to Zurich, Switzerland, and several universities in Germany. He gradually fell in love with mathematics and decided to make it his career, although his talent in painting once made his family proud. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Cantor&#39;s eyes, a set is a totality of objects, whether they are finite or infinite. When using one-to-one correspondence to study sets, he came to a surprising result: rational numbers are countable, that is, they can correspond to natural numbers one-to-one. At the same time, he proved that all real numbers are uncountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, Cantor also gave a non-constructive proof of the existence of transcendental numbers. In fact, Cantor proved that algebraic numbers are countable just like rational numbers, and that real numbers are uncountable. In this way, since all algebraic numbers and transcendental numbers constitute the real numbers, transcendental numbers not only exist but are much more numerous than algebraic numbers. The study of transcendental numbers later became a landscape of number theory research in the 20th century. However, when Cantor determined that infinity was a real existence, he was opposed and attacked by his colleagues for a long time, especially Kronecker (1823-1891), a Jewish professor at the University of Berlin. The latter was not only an outstanding mathematician but also a successful mathematician. businessman and the most powerful fighter in scientific debates, while Cantor was so weak and incompetent that he spent his entire life as a professor at a third-rate university, although the truth was on his side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cantor introduced the theory of cardinal numbers to set theory, calling the cardinal number of all integers Alev zero, and calling the subsequent larger cardinal numbers Alev one, Alev two, and so on ( Aleph is a Hebrew letter and Cantor is also Jewish). That is, he classified the infinite. He also proved that the cardinality of the entire set of real numbers is greater than Alev zero. This leads to the so-called Cantor continuum hypothesis: there is no other cardinality between Aleph zero and the cardinality of all real numbers. At the beginning of the 20th century, when the German mathematician Hilbert delivered his famous &quot;Mathematical Problems&quot; speech at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, he listed this hypothesis or conjecture at the forefront of the 23 mathematical problems left for the 20th century (Transcendental Number Problem is listed at No. 7). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Cantor discovered that the &quot;mathematical body&quot; was seriously ill and that the disease transmitted to it by Zeno in ancient Greece had not been relieved, he couldn&#39;t help but want to cure it. However, his Promethean attack on the infinite problem caused his own nervous breakdown when he was only 40 years old. He died much later in a mental hospital in central Germany. The year after Hilbert gave his speech, Russell also expressed his views:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeno cared about Three problems: infinitesimal, infinite and continuous. The best minds of every generation have tried to solve these problems, but literally, they have gotten nowhere. ...Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor solved them thoroughly. Their answers were so clear that they no longer left any doubt. This achievement may be the greatest that this era can boast. ...The problem of infinitesimals was solved by Weierstrass, the solution of the other two problems was started by Dedekind and finally completed by Cantor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The axiomatic method was summarized by Euclid as early as the ancient Greek era and adopted in his famous work &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;. As we all know, this book uses 5 postulates and 5 axioms. However, the axiom system proposed by Euclid is not perfect. The German mathematician Hilbert redefined the modern axiomatic method. He pointed out, &quot;Whether these objects are points, lines, surfaces, tables, chairs, or beer glasses, they can all become such geometric objects. For them, , the relationships expressed by the axioms are all true.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take points, lines, and surfaces as examples. Euclid gave these objects descriptive definitions, but in Hilbert&#39;s eyes they are all These are purely abstract objects with no specific concrete content. In addition, Hilbert also examined the interrelationships between the axioms and clearly put forward the basic logical requirements for the axiom system, namely compatibility, independence and completeness. Of course, axiomatization is just a method and is not as rich in content as set theory. Nevertheless, Hilbert&#39;s axiomatic method not only gave geometry a strict logical foundation, but also gradually penetrated into other fields of mathematics, becoming a powerful tool for synthesizing and refining mathematical knowledge and promoting specific mathematical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hilbert was born in 1861 on the outskirts of Königsberg in East Prussia, which now belongs to the divided Russian territory, surrounded by Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea, and has long been renamed Kaliningrad. Although the greatest citizen born in that city was the philosopher Immanuel Kant (who spent his entire life in this remote city), he had an indissoluble bond with mathematics. It turns out that the Pregel River flowing through the city is divided into two branches. There are seven bridges on the river, five of which connect the river bank to a small island in the river. So a mathematical problem arises. Suppose that a person can only cross each bridge. Can you cross all seven bridges once? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seemingly simple problem later became the starting point of topology and was solved by the Swiss mathematician Euler. However, it was a boy from the same city who was two years younger than him, Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), who directly guided Hilbert firmly on the path of mathematics. Hermann was born in Kaunas, Russia (now Lithuania), and moved to Königsberg with his family when he was 8 years old, just across the river from Hilbert&#39;s family. This talented Jewish boy won the Mathematics Prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences just after he turned 18. His 6-year-old brother Oscar is the &quot;father of insulin&quot; and discovered the connection between insulin and diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Associating with such a peerless talent, Hilbert&#39;s talent was not only not buried, but was honed and hoarded, prompting him to work quietly and lay a more solid foundation. The friendship between the two men (who later became brothers) lasted for a quarter of a century, stretching from Königsberg to Göttingen. Minkowski later died young of acute appendicitis, while Hilbert lived to Over eighty years old, he has accomplished the great achievements of a generation of masters. In 1900, Hilbert raised 23 mathematical problems at the World Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, which pointed the direction for the development of mathematics in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstraction of mathematics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory and the axiomatic method gradually became the paradigm of mathematical abstraction in the 20th century. After they are combined with each other, they become more It has the power to lead the development of mathematics to a more abstract path, leading to the rise of the four major branches of abstract mathematics: real variable function theory, functional analysis, topology and abstract algebra in the first half of the 20th century. They can be called the four abstract branches. The flower of mathematics. Interestingly, the five mathematicians mentioned in the previous section (including Kronecker) are all Germans. They may be one of the nations best at abstract thinking. Mathematics is of course the most abstract branch of science, and Germany is also home to a large number of talents whether in the most abstract art - music, or in the most abstract humanities and social sciences - philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The viewpoint of set theory first caused the reform of integral calculus, which led to the establishment of the theory of real variable functions. At the end of the 19th century, the rigor of analysis forced many mathematicians to seriously consider so-called &quot;ill-conditioned functions&quot;, such as the everywhere continuous but everywhere non-differentiable function defined by Weierstrass, and the everywhere defined by Gauss&#39;s student Dirichlet. Discontinuous function. On this basis, mathematicians have studied how to extend the concept of integrals to a wider class of functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first person to succeed in this regard was the French mathematician Lebesgue (1875-1941). He used set theory methods to define the concept of measure (Lebesgue measure) as the successor to the original concept of &quot;length&quot;. Generalization, the so-called Lebesgue integral was established, thus generalizing the concept of definite integral. On this basis, the reciprocity of differential operations and integral operations was used to reconstruct the basic theorem of calculus of Newton and Leibniz, thus forming a new branch of mathematics - the theory of real variable functions. Likewise, this new thing was rebuked by some mathematical authorities, and Lebesgue himself was unable to find a job for almost 10 years after publishing the results. Today, people refer to Lebesgue&#39;s previous analysis as classical analysis, and his subsequent analysis as modern analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to real variable function theory, another important component of modern analysis is functional analysis. The so-called &quot;functional&quot; can be regarded as &quot;a function of functions&quot;. This term was introduced by the French mathematician Hadamard (1865-1963, famous for being the first to prove the prime number theorem in number theory). Many mathematicians have made important contributions in the theory of functional analysis. Among them, Hilbert introduced a set of infinite real numbers. After defining concepts and operations such as &quot;inner product&quot;, he established the first infinite-dimensional space. , the so-called Hilbert space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the viewpoint of set theory helped to establish real variable function theory and functional analysis, axiomatic methods were also penetrating into the field of mathematics. The most representative result was the formation of abstract algebra. Since Galois proposed the concept of groups, it has developed from finite groups and discrete groups to infinite groups and continuous groups. Algebraic objects are also expanding, and other algebraic systems are further produced, such as rings, fields, lattice, ideals, etc. Since then, the center of algebraic research has shifted to algebraic structures. This structure consists of a number of binary composite operations between the elements of the set. It has the following characteristics: first, the elements of the set must be abstract; second, the operations are performed through stipulated by axioms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is generally believed that the &quot;Ideal Theory in Rings&quot; published by the German mathematician Noether (1882-1935) in 1921 is the beginning of abstract algebra. She is one of the most innovative mathematicians in this field. , and her disciples are all over the world. Noether is considered to be the greatest female mathematician to date, that is to say, surpassing the four famous female mathematicians before her, namely Hypatia of ancient Greece and Agnesi (1718-1799) of modern Italy. ), Germain of France (1776-1831) and Kovalevskaya of Russia. Despite this, due to gender discrimination, Noether was not able to be a lecturer at the University of Göttingen for a long time. Until the Nazi government came to power, she was not a professor at over fifty years old. After arriving in the United States, she was only a professor at a women&#39;s college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, we want to talk about topology. The German-American mathematician Weyl (1885-1955) said that the topological angel and the algebraic devil launched a magnificent fight to occupy every piece of mathematical territory. This shows the importance of these two subjects. In comparison, topology has earlier origins and more interesting examples than abstract algebra, such as the Seven Bridges Problem of Königsberg (1736) and the Four-Color Problem of the Map (1852). , and the Möbius Strip (1858). Topology studies the continuous properties of geometric figures, that is, properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformation (stretching, twisting but not cutting and bonding). The word topology was introduced by a student of Gauss (1847), whose Greek The original meaning of the text is &quot;the knowledge of position&quot;. Although it originally belonged to geometry, its two major branches are algebraic topology and point set topology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Point set topology is also called general topology. It regards geometric figures as a collection of points and the entire set as a space. Mathematicians started from the concept of &quot;neighborhood&quot; and introduced a series of concepts such as continuity, connectivity, and dimensionality, plus properties such as compactness, separability, and connectivity to establish this discipline. It also has some interesting examples. For example, at the North Pole of the earth, every direction faces south, which is a defect of longitude and latitude; there is always at least one place without wind (the center of the typhoon) at any time on the earth. These two completely different facts correspond to the fixed point theorem in topology: the continuous transformation of an n-dimensional simplex to itself has at least one fixed point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The founder of algebraic topology was the French mathematician Poincaré. Just like a wall made of bricks, he divided geometric figures into a finite number of interconnected small figures. He defined the so-called high-dimensional manifolds, homeomorphisms and homology. Later mathematicians developed the theory of homology and homotopy, and transformed topological problems into abstract algebra problems. One of the earliest famous theorems in this field was proposed by Descartes (1635) and discovered by Euler (1752), that is, the number of vertices plus the number of faces minus the number of edges of any polyhedron without holes is equal to 2. There is also the so-called Poincaré Conjecture (1904), which states that any three-dimensional simply connected closed manifold must be homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere. A $1 million reward was offered for proof of this conjecture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four-dimensional space is a special form of non-Euclidean geometry. When people are still debating non-Euclidean geometry and the philosophical consequences of violating Euclid’s fifth postulate, Poincaré taught us to imagine this. In the four-dimensional world, &quot;the images of external objects are depicted on the retina, and this retina is a two-dimensional painting; these images are a perspective view...&quot; According to his explanation, since a scene from the two-dimensional surface is viewed from the three-dimensional surface As a projection from the three-dimensional plane, an image on the three-dimensional surface can also be regarded as a projection from the four-dimensional plane. Poincaré suggested that the fourth dimension could be described as the succession of different perspectives on the canvas. According to the visual talent of the Spanish painter Picasso, he believed that these different perspectives should be displayed in time simultaneity, so there was &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon&quot; (1907) - the pioneering work of Cubism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that among the many readers of &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot; (1902), there was a Paris actuary named Plance. On the eve of the birth of Cubism, he was the lover of the Spanish painter Picasso. Member of the &quot;Laundry Boat&quot; artist circle. It was under his introduction that new geometry became a new artistic language &quot;explored with passion&quot;. Apollinaire, Picasso&#39;s friend and Cubist interpreter, concluded, &quot;The fourth dimension is not a mathematical concept, but a metaphor, which contains the seeds of new art.&quot; In the poet&#39;s view, &quot;Cubism uses an infinite The universe has replaced a finite universe centered on humans.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;geometric figures are essential to painting, and geometry is as important to plastic arts as grammar is to writing.&quot; Perhaps we can think that Cubism is a literary and art Since the Renaissance, painting and geometry have had another wonderful encounter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Abstract in Painting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The word &quot;abstract&quot; as a noun in Spanish means abstract, and it is often placed in an article. Begin your mathematics paper, below the title, author&#39;s name, and affiliation. In the field of art, it can be understood as something extracted from nature. Just as the emergence of abstract mathematics such as set theory once caused some controversy, the word has long been used in art with a somewhat derogatory connotation. It is also a matter of endless debate. Since Aristotle, painting and sculpture have been treated as imitative arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the mid-19th century that artists began to lean toward a new artistic concept, that is, painting was an entity of its own existence, not an imitation of something else. Later, a kind of art gradually emerged, in which the theme became an accessory or something bent and deformed in order to emphasize the shape or means of expression. It was an art that did not aim at expressing nature. Cézanne can be said to be the pioneer of this art. He discovered that the eye views a scene continuously and simultaneously. His concepts of nature, people and painting are all displayed in the mountains, still lifes and portraits of his hometown of Provence. For Cézanne, abstraction was primarily a method aimed at recreating natural scenes in independent paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cézanne (1839-1906) is known as the &quot;Father of Abstract Art&quot; or &quot;The Father of Modern Art&quot;. Under his guidance, artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries set off waves of modernism, typically Fauvism represented by the French painter Matisse (1869-1954) and Spanish painter Picasso. of Cubism. However, there are still some recognizable themes in the works of these painters, so they can only be called &quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;semi-abstract&quot; art. Here, abstract is just a general adjective, not a proper noun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real counterpart to the mathematical term &quot;abstract algebra&quot; should be &quot;abstract art&quot;, which refers specifically to paintings without any identifiable subject. The Russian painter Kandinsky is considered the first &quot;abstract painter&quot;. Since the 18th century, Russia, under Peter the Great and Empress Catherine, has long employed great scientists such as the Bernoulli brothers and Euler. At the same time, it has also begun a tradition of sponsoring the arts and has continued to have close ties with the West. In order to make contact, Russians often traveled to places such as France, Italy and Germany. Since the 19th century, Russian literature and music have reached a very high level, and drama and ballet have also made great progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1866, the year Riemann died, Kandinsky was born in Moscow. A few months later, Baudelaire also died in Paris. Kandinsky’s father’s lineage was a tea merchant from Siberia, and he was of Mongolian aristocratic descent. It is said that his grandmother was a Chinese Mongolian princess, and his mother was an authentic Muscovite. When Kandinsky was a child, he traveled to Italy with his parents and aunt, and soon moved to Odessa (now part of Ukraine) on the coast of the Black Sea. After his parents divorced, he lived with his aunt, attended high school in Odessa, and became a piano and cello player and an amateur painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 20, Kandinsky entered Moscow University to study law and economics until he obtained a doctorate. During this period, he still maintained great interest in painting, and once went to the northern Vologda state to work on it. While investigating racial history related to law, I became strongly interested in the colorful non-realistic style of local folk paintings. In 1896, the 30-year-old Kandinsky determined to become a painter. He resolutely gave up his position as an assistant professor at Moscow University and went to southern Germany to study at an art academy in Munich. He graduated after four years. Among his classmates were 13 years younger than him. The 20-year-old Swiss Klee (1879-1940) later joined hands to become the master of painting in the 20th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was while in Munich that Kandinsky&#39;s style of painting of non-objective objects or without actual subjects began to take shape. After some exploration, he found and established his artistic goal: to express a spiritual reaction or decision through lines and colors, space and movement, without reference to visible natural objects. His early education in law also helped him become the most theoretical among painters. In the book &quot;On the Spirit of Art&quot;, he talked about the first time he noticed the artistic conception in the works of the French Impressionist painter Manet (1832-1883). The question of the dematerialization of objects continues to fascinate him. Revolutionary advances in natural science also shattered his belief in a tactile and perceptible physical world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Kandinsky, we can feel an inner power of mysticism, which is a spiritual product rather than a product of external scenes or manual skills. He himself wrote, &quot;Strictly speaking, the harmony of color and form must be based solely on the principle that touches the human soul.&quot; There is also such a description in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; published in his middle age: &lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The colors that left a deep impression on me at first were bright emerald green, white, magenta, black, and brown and yellow. These memories date back to when I was three years old. I have observed them on various objects, and now the shapes of those objects are far less clear in my eyes than the colors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As he grew older, Kandinsky began to evolve towards geometric abstraction, with circles and triangles as the main forms. This can also be seen from the names of his works, such as &quot;In Black&quot; &quot;In a Circle&quot; &quot;One Center&quot; &quot;Yellow Red Blue&quot; &quot;Three Voices&quot;. In his theoretical work &quot;From Points and Lines to Surfaces&quot; published in his later years, he even analyzed the imaginative effect of abstract factors in pictures, believing that horizontal lines represent coldness and vertical lines represent heat. Kandinsky is such a painter. He may not have a particularly memorable masterpiece, but any of his works has distinctive images and bright colors that will make you recognize it immediately and bring you pleasure or deep thought. This seems to indicate that abstract art (like non-Euclidean geometry) has a broader space for expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Kandinsky, the representative painters of abstract art include at least his compatriot Malevich (1878-1935), the Dutch Mondrian (1872-1944) and the American Pollock (1912) -1956). Malevich brought abstraction to a final geometric simplification, for example, by drawing a diagonal black-edged square on a white square. But Malevich and Kandinsky represent two directions of abstract art. He and his contemporary Mondrian were directly inspired by Cubism; while Pollock adopted the unconscious action technology of Surrealism to create With the technique of dripping and pouring paint on canvases and even car hoods, he and de Kooning (1904-1997), who smuggled themselves to the United States from the Netherlands, were the first New World artists to become world-famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人也会得老年病，关注阿尔茨海默症]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257699]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[外婆索要带孩费：“家务劳动补偿”的自然延伸？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257707]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Grandma sued her daughter and son-in-law for taking care of her children, demanding payment of remuneration from February 2018 to July 2023 192,000 yuan. Recently, the Guang&#39;an District Court of Guang&#39;an City, Sichuan Province ordered the daughter and son-in-law to pay 82,500 yuan to the grandmother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the court, because the child Xiaobao’s mother Hu and father Zhu had been working in Chengdu and were busy with work and had no time to take care of the child, they left Xiaobao in the care of his grandmother Duan. Hu said: She and her husband give her mother 1,000 yuan a month for living expenses and 2,000 yuan for child care. Hu said that he and Duan had signed an agreement on Xiaobao&#39;s custody, but the child&#39;s father did not know about it. When my grandmother tried repeatedly to get her, but to no avail, she filed a lawsuit in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court held that Hu and his wife had the rights and obligations to raise, educate, and protect Xiaobao, and were able to earn income through labor and had the ability to support the child. Duan had no legal obligation to support the child, so Hu The couple should pay the grandmother the necessary expenses incurred for daily care and nursing of the baby. However, the child&#39;s father, Zhu, said: The fundamental reason why the old man asked for &quot;child care fees&quot; was that he and the child&#39;s mother had a divorce dispute. &quot;The person she really wants to sue is me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a couple divorces, it is not difficult to understand why the elderly come up with unique strategies to obtain more benefits for their children. Of course, there is no problem with the court&#39;s decision. The current marriage and family section of the Civil Code stipulates that both husband and wife jointly bear the obligation to raise, educate and protect their minor children (Article 1058); Children and grandchildren have the obligation to support them (Article 1074), which is essentially consistent with the previously applicable marriage law provisions (Articles 21 and 28). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, statutory law and judicial practice now recognize small families, and large families only exist in the sense of customary law. Under normal circumstances, in the sense of statutory law, the elderly have neither any rights nor any responsibilities and obligations towards their small family members. Therefore, for the elderly of either party to help take care of the children is a matter of affection, not a duty. The elderly can choose to take them or not; they can take them voluntarily for free, or they can ask for compensation before or after the event. These are the rights of the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time a similar verdict has been issued. There is a famous case in Nanjing. In 2010, Su married her husband Li. In August 2014, her son was born and was taken care of by her grandmother Fang. In August 2019, the two divorced. In December 2020, the court ruled that the divorce was granted, and the child was raised by Su. On October 10, 2020, Fang sued his daughter and son-in-law, who had not yet divorced at the time, demanding more than 200,000 yuan in childcare fees. The court held that Fang had no obligation to take care of the child and ordered Li to pay a total of more than 160,000 yuan in childcare fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judges have discretion and may make contrary decisions. There is a case in Tai&#39;an, Shandong. Yao married her husband Su in 2013 and had a daughter. The two divorced in 2021. During the marriage, both husband and wife worked, and Grandma Li took care of the children. In 2021, Li sued Yao to pay 100,000 yuan.宁阳县法院认为：现在双方虽已离婚，但孩子与父母、祖辈的亲情仍在，不应将长辈的纠葛加注在孩子身上，“爱幼护幼，不予支持”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，老人索要带孩费，也是“家务劳动补偿”的自然延伸，值得关注与辨析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在司法实践中，离婚案较多出现“家务劳动补偿”的概念。一方工作挣钱，为家庭创造财富，给全职在家者与孩子提供转移支付；另一方则全职在家。按照夫妻共同财产制度，离婚时家产一人一半，例如家产200万，一人分100万。但按“家庭劳动补偿”的思路，全职挣钱者还要额外补给全职在家者一些钱。这种分法背后的逻辑是，认为全职在家者比全职挣钱者对家庭的贡献更大。理论上看，因为共同财产本身已经意味着对全职在家者的补偿，所谓的“家务劳动补偿”其实是二次补偿。合理与否？争论不休。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现实的离婚案时中，从前千般好的夫妻一方，都能以全职在家为由向另一方额外索要“家务劳动补偿”。那么，一方或双方的老人向小家庭索求“带孩费”就更合理了，因为带小孩本来就不是老人的分内事。这就是为什么当离婚案件“家务劳动补偿”越来越多，老人索要“带孩费”的案件也越来越多，两者既有正相关，也有因果关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从前，哪怕成文法意义上带孙辈只是情分，不是本分，一方或双方的老人向小家庭索求“带孩费”的案例极少，原因很多：或因为受到传统大家庭观念与习惯法的束缚，或因为怕伤害与孙辈的情分，或因为“怕被别人笑话”。但当夫妻在闹离婚时一方都可以向另一方索求“家务劳动补偿”，对老人的这些观念禁锢无形之中就松弛了，甚至消失了；甚至夫妻一方暗中向自己的父母支招，让老人起诉自己与配偶，能多争一些就多争一些，“肉烂在自己人锅里”。这就是我们看到此类案件与报道越来越多的原因所在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贷中贷，“瑕疵案”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257726]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdpTWWeaVi6i.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height=&quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/VZjva2GziqcXupA02j2W8YDlQPOVfdp TWWeaVi6i. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252272&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, today’s Mujiangwang Village, Baqiao District, Xi’an City . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past nine years, Shaanxi businessman Hu Xufeng has been involved in 273 lawsuits. The origin of the 273 lawsuits is the urban village reconstruction project of Mujiangwang Village in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City that he began to develop in the 2000s. He was only 27 years old when he won this project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Huashang Daily&quot; report, on July 5, 2009, the Xi&#39;an Urban Reform Office released for the first time a list of 83 projects that had obtained the &quot;Approval of the Urban Village Renovation Plan&quot;. In terms of area, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project covers an area of ​​785 acres, making it the largest one on the list. Based on the average sales price of commercial real estate surrounding the project, Hu Xufeng estimated that the market value of the project around 2016 was about 4 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the project development process, Hu Xufeng pledged the company&#39;s shares due to two private loans, and therefore lost control of the company. One of them was a cumulative loan of 6 million yuan from Wang Jian, a Zhejiang businessman who has lived in Xi&#39;an. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to regain his equity, Hu Xufeng launched a lengthy lawsuit against creditors and administrative agencies, and the lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the Supreme People’s Court made a judgment on the civil case involving Hu Xufeng’s party suing Wang Jian, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court, but found that the “Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement” on January 10, 2012 was illegal. The true expression of intention of the parties does not have the effect of equity transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng sued the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau based on this, petitioning to revoke Wang Jian&#39;s share change registration, but lost both cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng lodged a protest with the procuratorial organ. In July 2020, a prosecutor from the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People&#39;s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. After the protest, Hu Xufeng still lost the case in the retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Hu Xufeng’s opponent, the current shareholder of Hongrun Real Estate, applied to the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau to change the legal representative, but was also rejected. On August 18, 2023, the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court made a second-instance judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case. The court ordered it to administratively handle Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in this equity war that has lasted for nine years, the administrative agencies involved must make the final decision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Xi’an Market Supervision Bureau had not responded to an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two private loans&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;International Happy City is located in the southeast of Xi&#39;an&#39;s central city, about 20 minutes&#39; drive from the city center, and close to the East Third Ring Road . Property staff said that at the end of 2022, with the opening of the subway Mujiangwang Station next to the community, the rent in the community will also increase slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This real estate project with good market conditions is the origin of a series of lawsuits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng was born in Taibai Village, Shuigou Township, Shangnan County, Shangluo City, Shaanxi Province in 1980. After dropping out of junior high school, he went out to work. He claimed that he received advice from businessmen while working in other provinces, and returned to Xi&#39;an to do computer wholesale business and made his first pot of gold. Later, he was introduced to Xi&#39;an and started contracting projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Hu Xufeng established Shaanxi Hongrun Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Group&quot;) in Xi&#39;an. In May 2006, Shaanxi Hongrun Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Hongrun Real Estate&quot;) was registered and established. Hu Xufeng, who is only 26 years old, has the ability to buy a first-floor office building as the company&#39;s office space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, the Xi&#39;an Municipal People&#39;s Government issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Transformation of Urban Villages&quot; (Municipal Administration [2005] No. 92), proposing to &quot;encourage social capital investment to participate in urban village transformation projects to make up for the government&#39;s Fund shortage situation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave of urban village (shanty town) renovation, Hu Xufeng was introduced by someone and signed a joint development contract with the Mujiangwang Village Committee of Baqiao District in March 2007. After that, Hu Xufeng injected capital to start the project. While demolishing and demolishing, he built relocation housing and built commercial housing for sale to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hu Xufeng’s statistics, from the start of the project to the borrowing from Wang Jian in 2012, it invested a total of 820 million yuan in the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project, with the funds coming from self-raised and private loans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports of the year, the renovation of Mujiangwang Village was the largest project among the first batch of urban village renovations in Xi&#39;an. As for why it borrowed money from the private sector, &quot;the main reason was that the city&#39;s urban reform at that time was characterized by incomplete materials and insufficient procedures.&quot; Hu Xufeng&#39;s explanation was that the project land was developed first without the government purchasing and storing it, and the developer did not obtain the land use rights. Unable to get a bank mortgage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng named the commercial housing he built International Happy City, and the first batch of about 100 units were sold out within three days. During the development process, in 2010, Hu Xufeng’s friend Zhu Yaojiang proposed to take a stake. Judgment No. 1377 of Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu shows that Zhu Yaojiang was born in Shengzhou City, Zhejiang Province in 1966. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that in his early business activities, Zhu Yaojiang provided help. When buying shares, Zhu Yaojiang introduced him to the actual investor Li Bin and introduced Li Bin’s identity as a social worker in Shaanxi Province. President of the Charity Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 14, 2010, Zhu Yaojiang lent 80 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate in the name of Xi&#39;an Zhongsha Investment Co., Ltd., and Hu Xufeng transferred 18% of Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s shares to Zhongsha Company for free, agreeing that The shares will be returned free of charge after Zhongxia Company obtains 18% of the project income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng said that when he borrowed money from outside the country before, no creditors asked him to mortgage his equity. &quot;Most of them were mortgages for houses that we have not yet opened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 2012, Zhu Yaojiang introduced Wang Jian to lend 6 million yuan to Hongrun Real Estate. The loan materials obtained by Southern Weekend reporters show that Wang Jian was born in 1968 in Taizhou, Zhejiang. The term of this loan is 3 months. Hu Xufeng will transfer 75% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian for free. After Hu Xufeng repays the loan, Wang Jian will transfer it back to Hu Xufeng for free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the market value of the Mujiangwang Village renovation project at that time, the proportion of pledged equity corresponding to the two loans of Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian did not conform to normal business logic. In the subsequent lengthy litigation, Hu Xufeng compared it to a &quot;snake swallowing an elephant&quot;, but did not provide a precise explanation for the abnormal equity pledge ratio. According to Hu Xufeng, he repeatedly asked for repayment of debts, but both creditors proposed to change the cooperation method, and the debt repayment was abandoned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1038&quot; height= &quot;778&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/lm6tN82Qv6ijldU6z94DFvOHB4Ewn60YEuvNgeSH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252273&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2023, 16 years after the project was launched, many unfinished buildings can be seen at the site of Mujiangwang Village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhai Xingli/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Forged signature&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In this regard, Hongrun Real Estate, which was originally 100% controlled by Hu Xufeng and his wife, is left with only Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen and Hongrun Group holding a total of 7% of the shares. In March 2013, the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate was changed from Hu Xufeng to Zhuyaojiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hu Xufeng claimed that he only learned about the fact that only 7% of the equity was left in July 2014, more than two years after the loan agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his account, in the previous two years, he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, operated, and recovered. During the treatment, the capital chain of Hongrun Real Estate was broken. Although Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian jointly obtained Hongrun Real Estate 93% of the equity, but no further capital injection into the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng tried to restart the project. He went to the industrial and commercial department to inquire and found that on January 10, 2012, the industrial and commercial department received the application materials for registration of changes in equity interests of Hongrun Real Estate shareholders and approved the application on the 31st of that month. Registered the change of 75% of the equity of Hongrun Real Estate to Wang Jian&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the application materials, there is a &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012, which is the document recognized by the Supreme Court. The content is that the Hongrun Real Estate Shareholders Meeting has studied and approved the transfer of 75% of the equity. Transferred to Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The date of the loan agreement between Wang Jian and Hongrun Real Estate is January 11, 2012. Hu Xufeng applied for an appraisal from the Judicial Appraisal Center of Northwest University of Political Science and Law. The appraisal opinion shows that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on this shareholder transfer capital contribution agreement are not their own signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted Wang Jian after many attempts. Wang Jian responded via text message to a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;The whole lies and stories fabricated by Hu Xufeng have troubled me for more than ten years and caused a lot of pressure and shadow to me and my family. At present, there are irresistible problems in all aspects.&quot; Overturning the conclusion, I don’t want to be entangled with such social liars, ruffians, and scoundrels anymore, and I don’t want to explain anything in this matter. The government department will definitely come up with a conclusion about who committed the crime in violation of the law, but before the time comes, the company will go bankrupt. Everything will be revealed during liquidation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Wang Jian refused to explain the facts about his loan situation with Hu Xufeng, equity disputes and handwriting identification. He asked: &quot;He was really rich and capable back then. Do you want to engage in such a big project?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Hu Xufeng and his wife took Hongrun Real Estate to court, claiming that the signatures on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; were forged and completed without the knowledge of Hu&#39;s wife Chen. On the grounds that the transfer of 75% of the shares violated Chen’s right of first refusal, the court requested the court to invalidate the “Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” and restore the industrial and commercial registration information of Hongrun Real Estate to the state before the change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 29, 2015, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court made a verdict. The court found that the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, and Wang Jian himself had no objection to this. The court ruled that the agreement was invalid, but rejected the Hu Xufeng couple&#39;s other claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jian refused to accept the decision and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. Wang Jian argued to the court that although the signatures of Hu Xufeng and Wang Jian on the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 were not signed by the two of them, there was another agreement signed by Hongrun Real Estate on January 10. The &quot;Shareholders Meeting Resolution&quot; transferring 75% of the shares to Wang Jian has the signature of Hu Xufeng&#39;s wife Chen. Chen cannot prove that her signature is forged, so Chen knows and agrees to the agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly asked Hu Xufeng and his wife for verification. They insisted that the signature was not signed by Chen, but &quot;because the appraisal fee was very expensive and they were short of money at the time, they only authenticated the &quot;Shareholder Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; &quot;The signature on the &quot;Shareholders&#39; Meeting Resolution&quot; was not authenticated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, 2015, the Shaanxi Provincial High Court made a judgment. The court found that after signing the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; on January 10, 2012, Hu Xufeng and his wife confirmed the authenticity of the agreement several times at the Hongrun Real Estate shareholders&#39; meeting and external agreements on March 15, 2013. The validity of the agreement was not raised and no objection was raised. Therefore, its appeal to determine that the agreement was invalid &quot;has no factual and legal basis and this court will not support it in accordance with the law.&quot; The second-instance judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court revoked the first-instance judgment of the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the lawsuit, and the lawsuit eventually went to the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On May 29, 2019, the Supreme People&#39;s Court issued (2017) Supreme Court Judgment No. 171, upholding the judgment of the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. However, the Supreme People&#39;s Court found that the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; signed on January 10, 2012 was a pledge guarantee by changing the equity holder, and it did not have the effect of equity transfer because it was not the true expression of intention of the parties. As for both parties, &quot;whether the equity pledge in the loan relationship complies with legal regulations can be resolved through separate legal channels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Administrative Protest&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reason why the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau became the defendant is also because of the above two signatures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng requested the court to order the bureau to cancel the change registration and re-register the shares under the name of Hongrun Group on the grounds that the bureau relied on the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; with forged signatures in the change registration. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case was assigned to the Xi&#39;an Xincheng District People&#39;s Court for trial. On July 8, 2016, Xincheng Court issued an administrative judgment. The court found that when the bureau reviewed the change registration application materials submitted by a third party, it did not find that the signatures on the shareholder capital contribution agreement were not made by the company&#39;s legal representative and shareholders. &quot;It was a flaw in the industrial and commercial change registration and did not affect the administration.&quot; the legality of the conduct”. Hu Xufeng lost the lawsuit. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Intermediate Court, which upheld the original verdict. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 2019, Hu Xufeng filed a protest with the Xi’an Municipal People’s Procuratorate, and the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate supported the protest. The Shaanxi Provincial High Court ordered the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court to conduct a retrial. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the prosecutor of the Seventh Procuratorate Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate appeared in court to protest. According to the official website of the court, this is the first time that the Shaanxi Provincial People’s Procuratorate has sent personnel to attend the retrial court for administrative protest cases after the internal institutional reform of the Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate and the establishment of a separate administrative prosecution department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau argued that the law requires administrative agencies to conduct a formal review for the registration of changes in shareholder equity. The change application materials at that time were complete and met the formal requirements stipulated by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Administrative Licensing Law, formal review is a concept corresponding to substantive review. Formal review refers to the review that the application materials submitted by the applicant are complete and in compliance with the legal form, while substantive review refers to the administrative agency’s review of the applicant. The authenticity and legality of the content of the materials provided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau argued that &quot;Although the &quot;Shareholder Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; was not signed by me, the content of the agreement represents the true intention of the parties, and there is evidence to prove that the facts of the agreement are recognized by both parties.&quot; In addition, although The Supreme People&#39;s Court determined that the &quot;Shareholders Transfer Capital Contribution Agreement&quot; is in the nature of an equity guarantee and does not have the effect of equity transfer, &quot;but it does not affect the outcome of the administrative case. Our bureau has fulfilled its reasonable review obligations and has no responsibility to revoke this administrative action.&quot; and obligations”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bureau emphasized to the court that administrative actions have conclusive power, and the registration of equity changes reflects the true meaning of Hongrun Real Estate’s equity transfer guarantee in appearance, and cannot antagonize bona fide counterparts. Likewise, it does not affect administrative matters. Effectiveness of behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng&#39;s litigation attorney objected, &quot;Equity transfer guarantee and equity pledge are two completely different legal relationships.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Civil Code, equity transfer guarantee means that the debtor transfers the equity to the name of the creditor. After the debtor pays off the debt when due, the creditor should return the equity to the debtor. Equity pledge can only obtain equity ownership after the debt matures through auction, (liquidation) or negotiation procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the finding in the Supreme Court&#39;s judgment that a pledge guarantee is made by changing the equity holder, it does not have the effect of equity transfer because it is not the true intention of the parties. The parties in the dispute case have argued that Each has its own understanding and expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 18, 2020, the Xi&#39;an Intermediate People&#39;s Court issued a retrial verdict, and Hu Xufeng lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the application of law to the aforementioned two focus issues in this dispute, the Small and Medium Enterprises Business Environment Research Group of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics commissioned the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society on August 31, 2023. Four legal experts, namely Yang Lixin, vice president, Cui Jianyuan, vice president of the Civil Law Research Society of the China Law Society, Wang Xizhen, executive director of the Administrative Law Research Society of the China Law Society, and Wang Bo, dean of the Law School of Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics, organized the seminar and issued a legal Opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legal opinions put forward by the experts at the meeting include: Hu Xufeng’s signature in the “Equity (East) Transfer and Capital Contribution Agreement” dated January 10, 2012 is forged. This document is a false material, and any agreement based on this false material should be revoked. Administrative decision on the registration of change of equity transfer of Hongrun Real Estate; the agreement reached between Wang Jian and Hongrun Group is an equity transfer guarantee, not an equity pledge. If the aforementioned change registration is regarded as a valid equity transfer guarantee registration, Wang Jian will act as a creditor , has no right to exercise shareholder rights and can only receive priority repayment for the equity involved in the case; Hongrun Group, as the debtor and guarantor, has the right to request Wang Jian to return the equity and change the equity registration after repaying the loan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The final chapter is coming&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the dispute that lasted for more than ten years, the Mujiangwang Village reconstruction project experienced unfinished work, changed hands, and the villagers many times During the petition, Southern Weekend reporters saw at the scene that there are still 10 buildings in unfinished condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the villagers of Mujiangwang Village that around 2015, the government-funded relocation houses were delivered, and the last batch of villagers moved back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, the Xi&#39;an Bahe New District Management Committee changed the project subject from Hongrun Real Estate to Shaanxi Jiaxinyuan Industrial Co., Ltd. The government department advanced 140 million yuan to build some relocation houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The control of Hongrun Real Estate is still being contested by all parties. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced by the Keqiao Court in 2017. According to the law, he can no longer serve as the legal representative of Hongrun Real Estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, 2017, the People&#39;s Court of Keqiao District, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province issued the (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment. Zhu Yaojiang was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment for the crime of embezzlement and illegal absorption of public deposits. 13 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are Hu Xufeng’s witness statements on pages 22 and 33 of this judgment. However, Hu Xufeng insisted that he was traveling between Xi&#39;an, Beijing and other places at the time and had not received any inquiries or evidence collection from Shaanxi or Zhejiang public prosecutors and law enforcement departments regarding the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on September 20, 2023, the Keqiao District People&#39;s Court responded to Southern Weekend reporters that after verification, during the handling of the case, the Economic Investigation Brigade of the High-tech Branch of the Xi&#39;an Public Security Bureau transferred 46 files along with it. A set of case materials, including Hu Xufeng&#39;s witness testimony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xufeng’s sister said that on September 23, 2023, she contacted the police officer handling the case at the time, and the other party said that a report record had been made when Hu Xufeng reported the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report refers to the fact that in August 2014, Zhu Yaojiang’s sister was arrested by the Xi’an police on suspicion of illegally absorbing public deposits. Hu Xufeng reported to the Xi’an Public Security Bureau at that time that Zhu Yaojiang was the mastermind behind the case. Hu Xufeng produced the original reporting materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are crime report transcripts equivalent to witness statements submitted to the court? The policemen handling the case and Hu Xufeng each held their own opinions. However, (2016) Zhejiang 0603 Xingchu No. 1377 Judgment shows that Zhu Yaojiang was only criminally detained in November 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2017, Hui Xiping, then director of the Hongqi Subdistrict Office in Baqiao District, Xi&#39;an City, said in an interview with CCTV&#39;s &quot;News Investigation&quot; program that Zhu Yaojiang and Wang Jian collectively acquired 93% of the shares of Hongrun Real Estate. Later, it was discovered that the actual controller of Hongrun Real Estate was not these two people, but the aforementioned actual investor Li Bin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are different opinions about Li Bin’s life. Some media once quoted the article &quot;&quot;Luxury Monk&quot; Li Bin&quot; published in the 14th issue of &quot;China Entrepreneur&quot; magazine in 2007 to introduce his life. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to find the original text of the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned in Li Bin’s parents’ neighborhood that his father was a team worker at Xi’an Film Studio. He returned to his hometown in Mei County, Baoji City a few years ago. Li Bin also worked in Xi’an Film Production The factory worked briefly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the relationship between Hu Xufeng and Li Bin is concerned, since losing control of Hongrun Real Estate, Hu Xufeng said that he can no longer contact Li Bin. After Hu Xufeng started litigation to defend his rights, Li Bin reported Hu Xufeng to the public security agency on the grounds of gang involvement. Hu Xufeng also publicly reported Li Bin with his real name for the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 25, 2019, the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department handed over to Xi&#39;an the clues that Hu Xufeng reported about Li Bin and others&#39; suspected crimes in the form of a Director&#39;s Supervision Order (Supervision of Crime Leads No. 044) Verification by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi’an Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that regarding the two people’s reports of each other, the public security organs did not find any illegal or criminal facts on both sides after a lot of work. Whistleblower”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a series of processes such as notarized delivery, convening of extraordinary shareholders&#39; meetings, and announcements, Hongrun Real Estate submitted materials for changing the legal representative to the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau in April 2022. The bureau issued a &quot;Notice of Refusal to Registration&quot; on August 22 of that year, rejecting the application for change of registration on the grounds that the identity of the convener of the shareholders&#39; meeting did not comply with the provisions of the Company Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the processing results alone, Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau did not support Hu Xufeng&#39;s application for change of registration, nor did it support the applications of Li Bin and Wang Jian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hongrun Real Estate then sued the bureau to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Court. On December 30, 2022, the court issued a first-instance judgment in which Hongrun Real Estate won the case. The court ordered the Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau to re-administer Hongrun Real Estate&#39;s change application within 60 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau was dissatisfied and appealed to the Xi&#39;an Railway Transport Intermediate Court. On August 18, 2023, the second-instance court made a final judgment and upheld the original judgment. The Xi&#39;an Market Supervision Bureau lost the case again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the bureau must re-administer the change application of Hongrun Real Estate within 60 days after the judgment takes effect. This equity war that has lasted for 9 years will come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（注：西安市公安局就移交胡绪峰证人证言一事接受了采访，和新闻科副科长魏桦有交流，对方后要求不体现求证了他们，有微信记录。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[陕西咸阳警方通报“女子被住建局保安踩在脚下”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257734]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 09:10:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/5abd26a9848878c70264abe4914d0df2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;826&quot; height=&quot;1076&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/5abd26a9848878c70264abe4914d0df2 . jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252279&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[美伊“换囚游戏”，各有“算盘”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257728]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-27 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pXNmTFP3LTBZpdcgUFIz9GGXcNd69gQQhcrdELuM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;701&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pXNmTFP3LTBZpdcgUFIz9GGXcNd69gQQhcrdELuM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252249&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;当地时间2023年9月18日，卡塔尔多哈，五名被关押在伊朗的美国公民获释，并与家人一起抵达多哈国际机场，这是卡塔尔斡旋的伊朗和美国之间囚犯交换协议的一部分，该协议还释放了五名伊朗人。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;prisoner exchange&quot; between the United States and Iran shocked the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, 2023, the United States and Iran exchanged five prisoners detained in the United States and Iran, allowing them to see the light of day again. The week before, the United States and Iran publicly reached a &quot;prisoner exchange agreement.&quot; The content of the agreement includes the United States unfreezing $6 billion of Iranian oil funds in South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This move caused waves in the political arena. The Biden administration has been strongly criticized by US Republicans, saying that unfreezing US$6 billion is equivalent to paying a &quot;ransom&quot; and is an &quot;appeasement policy.&quot; What puzzles the outside world is why the two countries, as &quot;old enemies&quot;, &quot;swap prisoners&quot; during this time period? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters that the United States and Iran have their own calculations behind this move, but it remains to be seen whether it can be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Prisoner Exchange&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Who are the arrested Americans? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before his arrest, 51-year-old businessman Siamak Namazi worked as the director of strategic planning at Dubai-based Crescent Petroleum Company. He was arrested by Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards in October 2015, while his 86-year-old father Bakr was arrested in February 2016 after Iranian officials allowed him to visit his son in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The British Broadcasting Corporation reported that they were eventually sentenced to ten years in prison by Iran for &quot;cooperating with foreign hostile countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, the United States has repeatedly proposed to rescue or extradite Namazi. Because these people obviously serve the United States or have made great contributions to the United States, the United States is unwilling to Give them up,&quot; said Li Shaoxian, director of the China Arab Studies Institute at Ningxia University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another 59-year-old Iranian-American businessman Emad Shaji moved to Iran from the United States with his wife in 2017. In November 2020, Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Court summoned him and informed him that he would be convicted of &quot;espionage&quot; and sentenced to 10 years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April of the following year, his daughters told the Washington Post that their father, Shaji, was in &quot;a deplorable situation&quot; in prison and that prison guards only allowed him to make a few brief, monitored phone calls. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabaz, a 67-year-old businessman, was arrested together with eight other Iranian environmentalists in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The BBC reported that Tabaz’s organization, a member of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, has been using cameras to track critically endangered wild Asian cheetahs and was accused of using its environmental projects as a “gathering of confidential information” cover&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tabaz and his colleagues deny Iran&#39;s accusations against them. But in the end Tabaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2019. He is being held in Evin prison in Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, these arrested American businessmen were released due to the &quot;prisoner exchange agreement&quot; between the United States and Iran. The names and circumstances of the other two Americans released have not yet been released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a statement after his release, Namazi expressed his gratitude and was very interested in knowing the progress of updating mobile phone equipment. &quot;When I was arrested, the iPhone 6S had just come out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side of the prisoner exchange, Iranian media confirmed on the afternoon of September 18, 2023 that five Iranian citizens imprisoned in the United States had also been released. . Of the five Iranians released, only two chose to return to Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Cavlani and Kashani were accused of violating &quot;sanctions.&quot; Afrasiabi, a political scientist living in Boston, was arrested at his home in 2021 on charges of being an &quot;agent of the Iranian government.&quot; Ansari and Hassanzadeh were accused of &quot;links to Iranian security forces.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian said that the prisoner exchange matter contemplated by the United States and Iran is not a temporary decision. In fact, in the US-Iran relationship, the two sides have been fighting for each other to release their own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States and Iran have always been &quot;old enemies&quot; and have no diplomatic relations. Qatar served as the mediator for this &quot;prisoner exchange&quot;. According to public reports, negotiations between the two parties were also conducted in Doha, the capital of Qatar. After at least eight rounds of back-and-forth between Qatar and Qatar, the United States and Iran&#39;s &quot;air-space negotiations&quot; finally reached a prisoner exchange agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, after Iran proposed its latest nuclear agreement plan, the United States believed that Iran had regressed and decided to withdraw from the negotiations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Iran&#39;s reason is that since the United States has withdrawn from the nuclear agreement, Iran is the official representative, so it does not need to face the United States. Face-to-face talks will not occur until the United States resumes the nuclear agreement.&quot; Li Shao said that at that time The EU agrees and agrees with the United States and condemns Iran, so it cannot continue to be the middleman now. &quot;Qatar therefore plays a very important role in this negotiation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Thaw&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The agreement, brokered by the Qatari government, represents It marked an unusual moment of cooperation between the United States and Iran and a rare agreement between two long-time enemies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This deal is an important stepping stone.” Sanan Wakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House in the UK, said that the months-long negotiations have restarted the US-Iran relationship. Indirect bilateral dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bloomberg reported on September 19, 2023 that according to the prisoner exchange agreement, while the United States and Iran exchanged detainees, Iran’s previously frozen oil export payments of US$6 billion in South Korea were remitted to Qatar through Switzerland. Domestic Iranian bank account. The prisoners were released hours after the funds were unfrozen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Korea is a &quot;large consumer&quot; of Iranian oil, and the $6 billion that was unfrozen was previously South Korea&#39;s payment for Iranian oil. In 2010, the Central Bank of Iran opened Korean Won accounts in two South Korean banks specifically to collect payments from South Korea. At that time, Iran could withdraw the funds in the accounts at will. In September 2019, the Central Bank of Iran was included in the sanctions list by the United States, and US$6 billion in payments were frozen in the account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Iran is rich in oil and natural gas resources. For Iran, US$6 billion is a small amount of money under normal circumstances.&quot; Li Shaoxian analyzed, but for Iran in the past few years, &quot;it is definitely a timely help.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reuters reported that after Qatar and Switzerland confirmed that the funds were in the account, Qatar sent a plane to take five U.S. citizens and two of their relatives out of Iran. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yin Gang, an expert on Middle East issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Iran is not only economically difficult, but also diplomatically. At present, Iran can accept such conditions, which shows that Iran urgently needs to ease its international status and change its international balance of payments situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, both the United States and Iran have &quot;different ideas&quot; regarding the implementation of the negotiation results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that when the two sides reached a prisoner exchange agreement, Iran also specifically added the validity period of the agreement. That is, if the frozen payment is not received within two months, the prisoner exchange agreement will automatically be invalidated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The two sides have no trust at all, so they just set a deadline.&quot; Li Shaoxian said that this matter is relatively sensitive for both parties, and the United States and Iran have many different voices in the country. &quot;I think the two-month limit is considered from a realistic perspective, and it also reflects that both parties want to accomplish this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that US Republicans are criticizing the Biden administration&#39;s prisoner exchange. At the time of the move, it was stated that the unfreezing of 6 billion US dollars was equivalent to paying a ransom and may lead to more &quot;hostages&quot; being held. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although this group of U.S. citizens have been released, there is no guarantee that other Americans who decide to go to Iran despite long-term warnings from the U.S. government will get similar results.&quot; On September 18, the U.S. Secretary of State announced Lincoln warned the people at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Win or Lose&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The outside world has received mixed reviews about this prisoner exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al Jazeera reported that Sina Tusi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank, said that the prisoner exchange was an &quot;important first step.&quot; She said, &quot;This creates a basis for the United States and Iran to get rid of hostile and confrontational policies, and is expected to reach a broader diplomatic agreement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States will hold a presidential election in November 2024, and at this stage, the two sides have restarted negotiations Friendly relations are unrealistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tusi said Biden was unlikely to make concessions to Iran before the vote, which would draw attacks from Republican hawks. Iran, on the other hand, hopes to maintain its influence &quot;in case Trump returns to power.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported on September 19 that the prisoner exchange agreement was a signal of partial easing of US-Iran relations. It marked a breakthrough in relations between the United States and Iran, long-time enemies, although the two countries remain at odds on a range of issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Objective analysis shows that the United States has made a compromise.&quot; Li Shaoxian pointed out that in addition to US$6 billion, the Biden administration actually &quot;turned a blind eye&quot; to Iran&#39;s oil exports. Therefore, Iran&#39;s oil exports have increased significantly in recent months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;On the one hand, this move can be seen as a sign of the easing of bilateral relations between the United States and Iran. On the other hand, the United States also wants to reduce the diplomatic pressure on South Korea.&quot; Yin Gang analyzed the current relationship between the United States and South Korea Also very important. If South Korea does not pay oil to Iran, it will have great dissatisfaction with South Korea and will bring great difficulties to South Korea&#39;s diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But American Republicans have different opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, former US President Trump publicly stated, &quot;The United States, which was highly respected three years ago, has now become the laughing stock of the world.&quot; Former Vice President Pence criticized Biden, Allowing Iran to “foment terrorism across the Middle East.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian analyzed that the struggle between the two parties in the United States is now booming, and the two parties are even more sharply opposed on the Iran issue and the Iranian nuclear issue. Although Biden did not lift sanctions on Iran after taking office, his goal is to restore the nuclear agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, on the day of the prisoner exchange, Biden issued a statement saying that the United States would impose sanctions on former Iranian President Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Intelligence Ministry on the grounds that relevant individuals and Institutions are complicit in “wrongfully imprisoning” American citizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wall Street Journal commented on September 19 that the Biden administration has been trying to ease tensions with Iran, but it is clear that exchanging prisoners while imposing new sanctions on Iran will complicate the problem again. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于美国持续实施制裁，世界各国在某些领域面临限制措施，似乎已成为常态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;伊朗总统莱希表示，美国无权决定伊朗将如何使用即将被解冻的60亿美元资金。 He emphasized that the frozen funds originally belonged to the Iranian people and the Iranian government, and the use was not determined by the U.S. government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaoxian analyzed that Iran’s nuclear technology capabilities have improved very quickly. &quot;The United States is very anxious, and Europe is also anxious.&quot; He said that in this case, although the United States publicly did not lift sanctions, it gradually released its policies to whet Iran&#39;s appetite. Iran also deliberately slowed down the production of highly enriched uranium. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“国际社会一直有传言这笔交易达成的幕后，是伊朗承诺在核问题上，下一步将和美国展开积极的对话。”殷罡表示，就目前来看，整个中东局势处于缓和趋势，伊朗和阿拉伯国家之间缓和，伊朗和美国之间也会缓和。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长时间停滞的伊核谈判，何时才能有所突破，美伊之间的紧张关系是否会逐渐缓解等问题，也都将影响全球政治格局的走势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（南方周末实习生徐子仪对本文亦有贡献）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[失落的1945——张爱玲“笔误”解谜丨云端]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257677]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MOoJJcgGQN3BIjhiUWiurpcBJO2W25OAjeX0Mvgd.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;以往印象中，张爱玲的坏记性集中于日期和数字。比较著名的“公案”，有关那篇诞生了张氏金句“生命是一袭华美的袍，爬满了虱子”的《天才梦》。直到晚年，张爱玲还对19岁时在《西风》征文中遭遇的“不公正待遇”耿耿于怀，但学者和张迷们考证，无论是征文字数限制、征文格式乃至奖项等，她都记错了，而且可能当年就没看清楚征文广告具体条款。征文字数限制5000以内，她误以为500；她最终得到的名誉奖第三名，她写成“特别奖”；甚至把自己获奖文章的一千五百多字，记成四百九十多字。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久前翻家中旧杂志，无意间找出2004年7月号的《印刻》，这期的张爱玲专辑里，刊载了一封1966年6月4日她写给驻华盛顿英国大使馆的信件。事缘其时张爱玲有意应聘某大学驻校作家，需学历证明，她因文件遗失致函港大要求补发，但港大注册处只证明其“两进两出”，只字不提她成绩优良获奖学金等荣誉，几番交涉未果。当时香港仍为英国管治，她于是去信驻华府的英使馆求助。为说明自己的状况，千余字的信里有这样一段：“……1955年我移民美国，60年代嫁给一位美国人，获得美国籍。我的母亲已归化英国籍，于1958年在伦敦过世……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这封信以前没读过，饶有兴致，可读到此处心里真是一惊：她和赖雅登记结婚是抵美第二年的1956年8月14日，8月18日她还写信告诉邝文美，怎么忽然变成了“60年代”？其母黄逸梵1957年10月11日在伦敦病故，10月24日她在给宋淇夫妇的信里准确地报告，母亲已“在两星期前去世”，给使馆的信里却白纸黑字写成“1958年”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/J7ek9M46hhsAvN7cc670HxW3bYAzesTK5Rxozede.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;所以，当我在张爱玲与宋淇夫妇的书信集里看到那么多的“我记错了”“我又忘了”，不再惊奇莫名。张爱玲在美国很大程度上靠稿酬生活，却连皇冠出版社某个时期固定给她的稿费是半年还是一年2000美金都弄不清楚。更离谱的是，1955年她离港赴美前，在宋淇帮助下向电懋公司预支了两部剧本的全部稿费，五年后却忘了个一干二净，经邝文美提醒才想起确有这回事。一个最怕欠人钱、欠人情的人，居然忘记这么一笔款项，简直不可思议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这几天翻阅书评人刘铮的一本随笔集，赫见有篇文章名为《张爱玲记错了》，记载了张爱玲作品中的字句错误、出处错误、情节错误、张冠李戴，总共22例，让人大开眼界。引用方面的错误，我在陈子善所著《张爱玲丛考》中也读到过，说张爱玲在《谈吃与画饼充饥》中，把鲁迅翻译的苏联作家淑雪兼珂（也译左琴科）1926年的短篇小说《贵家妇女》，误记为《包子》；而张爱玲所写的“包子”，鲁迅实际上译为“肉馒头”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈子善和刘铮都眼尖，火眼金睛有学问打底，但对张爱玲他们还是很尊敬。刘铮这么说：“在人情物理上，在遣词造句上，张爱玲都可说是个心思极细的人，不过，她对引用是否精确，似乎并不怎么措意。加之彼时查检资料匪易，张爱玲又没有藏书的习惯，引用时有些误记是再平常不过的事情。往大处说，张爱玲显然没有&#39;照相式的记忆能力&#39;，也许有的只是一个poor memory（差记性）；她留下的笔误着实不能算少。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘铮解释，自己读书时记下这些并无他意，只是觉得好玩——张爱玲也会记错哦！文章末尾还引了桑塔格小说《火山情人》里的一句：“天才啊，就跟美一样，一切，好吧几乎一切，都会被谅解的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有意思的是，和他把笔误皆归结于记性和未查证资料。相反，张爱玲在《对照记》里说：心理分析宗师佛洛依德认为世上没有笔误或是偶而说错一个字的事，都是本来心里就是这样想，无意中透露的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但也正是在《对照记》里，张爱玲留下了另一个著名“笔误”：把有案可查的1945年7月21日在沪上一场“纳凉会”里与李香兰的合影，注写成“1943年在园游会中遇见影星李香兰”。而仿佛循着张爱玲所说弗洛伊德的思路，至今已见两位学者试图分析，张爱玲这个“一错两年”的“笔误”，只因记性太差，还是背后另有意味深长的缘由。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;1945&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;纳凉会/1943园游会&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;《对照记——看老照相簿》是张爱玲最后一部作品，也是她仅有的自传体图文对照集。书中的“图四十一”为一张珍藏了近五十年的与李香兰合照，她写：1943年在园游会中遇见李香兰，要合拍照片，她太高，两人并立会相映成趣，有人就让她坐下，李香兰侍立一旁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/iEioqzjAsX9CGyu33WRvaDrFnNz5X5Lb1h9JvdFX.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1943年，张爱玲与李香兰（右）在上海合影。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“《余韵》书中提起我祖母的一床夹被的被面做的衣服，就是这一件。是我姑姑拆下来保存的。虽说&#39;陈丝如烂草&#39;，那裁缝居然不皱眉，一声不出拿了去，照炎樱的设计做了来。米色薄绸上洒淡墨点，隐着暗紫凤凰，很有画意，别处没看见过类似的图案。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“1943年”，这个年份错得离谱，正确的时间地点是：1945年7月21日，上海咸阳路二号，由《杂志》月刊社主办的“纳凉会”。依据是1945年8月的《杂志》，上面刊有《纳凉会记》一文，配图除了这幅张爱玲与李香兰，另有一张合影：保持同样姿势的李香兰与张爱玲之外，还见张爱玲的姑姑张茂渊和闺蜜炎樱，一位身份不明的陈女士，两个长衫男子——汪伪时期的申报社社长陈彬龢、平报社社长金雄白。而据中国留日学者、现在日本任研究员的邵迎建在《张爱玲的传奇文学与流言人生》一书中考证，咸阳路，就是如今的陕西南路在1943年到1945年的路名，它更为老上海人熟悉的名称是“亚尔培路”。咸阳路二号，那时是金雄白的私宅花园。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出版《对照记》的1994年，是张爱玲离世前一年，急景凋年的她，对当年那条祖母老被面改成的裙子，从质地、颜色、图案、花纹，到来历、款式、设计、裁缝，都记忆犹新历历分明，为什么偏偏把拍照的时空记错了？这个1943，这个“笔误”，透露了怎样的信息？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;邵迎建认为，懂得张爱玲的一生，这个谜便不难破解。对张爱玲来说，1943年至1945年是今生今世最辉煌的日子，短短两年写出《传奇》和《流言》，初出茅庐便跃上文坛巅峰，“在大脑的数据库里，这是一份完美无缺的档案，没有细目，整块展现在记忆的屏幕上。”——这个说法甚为诱人：烈火烹油鲜花着锦的人生阶段，记忆是混杂一片，条理不清的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于邵迎建指出的张爱玲把“纳凉会”写成“游园会”，在我看来似乎不算笔误，就像有些人说去“戏院”或是“电影院”看电影，并无实质分别。但邵研究员咬住这两个词的差别，找到了他的答案——有意思的是他自己也“笔误”了，查几个版本的《对照记》，张爱玲写的都是“园游会”而非“游园会”——他从陈年的《申报》中翻检到，1944年7月8日，汪伪“上海新闻联合会”在哈同花园的中央广场举办了有工商各界千人参加的“市民游园演讲会”，节目包括红星歌唱、电影名片放映。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然并未具体提及当晚的演唱红星和到会名流，邵文却认定，红星“极可能”就是炙手可热的李香兰，已属海上文坛名流的张爱玲，“顺理成章”也应在场。他由此推导出，张爱玲与李香兰，正是在这个场合首次会面：“……有声有形的第一次相见，是在这次游园会上。对其印象之深刻，不可磨灭。随着岁月的推移，后来的印象都浅了，平了，只留下这一道刻痕。多少年后，在张爱玲的大脑库存里，与李香兰所有的缘分都并入了这一回。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他进而说，当年张爱玲站在公寓（爱丁顿公寓，今常德公寓）的阳台上，是能看到哈同花园一角的。哈同花园也算是张爱玲的街坊。张爱玲1944年在《万象》连载的《连环套》里，也两次提到这座传奇的园子。“金雄白的私宅花园与哈同花园，规模虽不能同日而语，但局部应有相似之处：都是带花坛草坪的西式洋房。光凭照片的背景及西式软垫椅，在张爱玲记忆中，不知不觉，金雄白私宅花园置换成了哈同花园，&#39;纳凉会&#39;也随之化为了&#39;游园会&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是耶非耶。有一点是肯定的：张爱玲从未提到，至今也没见任何资料显示她到过哈同花园那场“游园会”，所以，邵先生建立在假设基础上的论述，推理成分浓厚，更像一则想象力丰富的虚构。遗忘之谜扑朔迷离，令人信服的剖析，出自香港大学比较文学系主任黄心村教授。她在一篇精彩论文里，以六页半的篇幅，探讨拍摄于日本投降前夕三个星期的张爱玲与李香兰合照，提出了一个意味深长的“或许”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“这一年内一件事也不记得”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;《对照记》“图五十”是一幅1955年张爱玲离开香港去美国前的照片，妆容精致侧脸垂目。张爱玲记述从香港乘船途经檀香山，海关关员是个瘦小日裔青年，在她的入境表格上赫然填写：身高6呎6吋半，体重102磅。她憎笑此青年的粗心大意，把5呎6吋半写成6呎6吋半，犯了Freudian slip（弗洛依德式的错误）。“我瘦，看着特别高。那是这海关职员怵目惊心的记录。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/g8ajGWryb6p5fYU92Aa3zTiqI33SZTgtDdLC5XE5.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;《对照记》收录的1955年张爱玲离开香港去美国前的照片。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《对照记》“图四十一”，张爱玲“粗心大意”误记为“1943年”的那帧与李香兰合影，被学者认为是她上海时期最重要的照片。黄心村教授有一篇论文《光影斑驳：张爱玲的日本和东亚》，其分析就从这张照片开始。摄于1945年7月21日，距二战终结和日本投降仅仅三周，“它的奇特构图及不甚协调的视觉风格亦令人印象深刻。熟识照片背景的观者甚至将它视为一个描绘日本帝国崩毁前夕，日中组合摇摇欲坠的视觉寓言。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄教授对照片的分析，围绕张爱玲和李香兰的不同神情，相片的蹊跷构图，两人迥异的装扮风格，尤其是张爱玲乖张的坐姿，偏离镜头的朝下视线，种种细节，抽丝剥茧。她说，“张爱玲的脸部表情和身体，或许暗示着抗拒抑或是蔑视，但更重要的是，她显然懂得将摄影镜头对她的凝视，反转为深化自身形象的助力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我更感兴趣的是，张爱玲、姑姑、炎樱，在日本战败的三周前，是抱着怎样的心情赴这一场“园游会”？8月15日日本无条件投降，时局骤变，曾任汪伪政府要员的胡兰成遭国民政府通缉仓皇逃亡，又如何给张爱玲带来震惊惶恐？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;忽然想到应该重温《小团圆》。1945年长长的夏天发生了什么，书里都有叙述。而且，第八章开头，张爱玲写九莉的那些话，简直就是预先对自己后来的那个“笔误”作了注解：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从这时候起，直到第二次世界大战结束，有大半年的工夫，她内心有一种混乱，上面一层白蜡封住了它，是表面上的平静安全感。这段时间内发生的事，总当作是上一年或是下一年的……这一年内一件事也不记得，可以称为失落的一年。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她刚认识他的时候就知道战后他要逃亡，事到临头反而糊涂起来，也是因为这是她&#39;失落的一年&#39;，失魂落魄。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失魂落魄，她在心里摈除了1945年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“或许张爱玲自己也不愿意相信，这照片竟拍摄于日本战败前夕。”黄心村写在论文“注释”里的一句话让人心颤。是的，没有1945，只有1943，只有上一年或下一年。虽然《对照记》问世的1994年，离那段不堪和混乱的日子已有半世纪之久，而她也依然记得，有一种叫作弗洛伊德式的错误。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于记忆和遗忘，心理学有很多说法。张爱玲在去世前一年留下有缺陷的记忆，是因大脑海马体损伤造成逆行性失忆，还是情绪性记忆的主动遗忘，至此已不是问题。当然，探讨其间隐秘非为“祛魅”，如黄心村所言，只为“还原一个历史的张爱玲”“更复杂的张爱玲”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下意识地屏蔽不堪回首的以往，删除记忆晶片上的黑暗块面，我们自己，很多普通的“人”，何尝不是如此？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我很同意这样的说法：最终构成人一生的东西，不是阅历、灵性与任何事件，而是对所有这些经验的记忆、描绘和阐释。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;松尾芭蕉有俳句：寺庙的钟声／停了，但花中余音／持续地回响&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[二十届中央第一轮巡视完成反馈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257717]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;根据党中央部署，二十届中央第一轮巡视反馈工作近日全部完成。本轮巡视反馈采取集中反馈和巡视组“一对一”反馈相结合的方式进行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月19日，中央巡视工作领导小组召开二十届中央第一轮巡视集中反馈会议。会议传达学习了习近平总书记听取中央第一轮巡视情况汇报时的重要讲话精神，通报了巡视发现的共性问题，对抓好巡视整改作出部署。中央书记处书记、中央巡视工作领导小组副组长刘金国出席会议并讲话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月20日至22日，15个中央巡视组分别向本轮巡视的30家中管企业党组、5家中管金融企业党委和国家体育总局党组进行了“一对一”反馈。根据中央巡视工作安排，各中央巡视组向被巡视党组织主要负责人通报了巡视发现的突出问题，并向领导班子反馈了巡视情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反馈指出，近年来，中管企业、金融企业面对复杂严峻的外部环境和疫情冲击影响，经受考验、勇挑重担，在打赢脱贫攻坚战、促进高水平科技自立自强、服务构建新发展格局、推动高质量发展、统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展等方面作出了重要贡献，体育强国建设取得新进展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反馈严肃指出了国企、金融、体育领域存在的突出问题。有的落实党中央决策部署不到位，对肩负的职责使命认识不深刻，履职担当有差距；有的统筹发展和安全不到位，风险意识不强，防控机制不够健全；有的落实管党治党责任不到位，压力传导层层递减，贯彻严的基调不力，“一把手”等关键岗位廉洁风险比较突出，“靠企吃企”问题多发，“四风”问题突出，违反中央八项规定精神问题仍有发生；有的领导班子、干部人才队伍建设存在薄弱环节，基层党组织政治功能有待加强。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反馈要求，被巡视单位要深入学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，认真学习贯彻习近平总书记听取巡视情况汇报时的重要讲话精神，全面贯彻党的二十大部署，坚持和加强党的领导，牢固树立和践行正确政绩观，完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，坚守职能定位，聚焦主责主业，推动高质量发展。要坚决落实防范化解重大风险政治责任，树牢底线思维、极限思维，全面梳理排查风险隐患，堵漏补缺、化险挽损，切实维护好国家利益。要认真落实全面从严治党“两个责任”，增强对“一把手”监督实效，加大腐败案件查处力度，严肃纠治“四风”问题，深化以案促改、以案促治，一体推进不敢腐、不能腐、不想腐。要深入贯彻新时代党的组织路线，切实加强领导班子、干部人才队伍和基层党组织建设。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反馈强调，要在巡视整改上较真碰硬，把严的基调、严的措施、严的氛围传导下去、一贯到底。被巡视党组织要坚决扛起整改政治责任，“一把手”是整改第一责任人，班子其他成员要认真履行“一岗双责”，严格对照反馈意见，建立问题清单、任务清单、责任清单，把巡视发现的问题与主题教育检视问题结合起来，与上次巡视整改不到位的问题结合起来，系统整改、一体整改，以实际行动践行“两个维护”，以整改成效体现忠诚担当。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反馈要求，要压实整改各方责任，促进同向发力推动问题解决。纪检监察机关要加强整改日常监督，聚焦重点问题，盯住具体人、具体事，强化实地检查，掌握真实情况，对敷衍应付、虚假整改的，抓住典型严肃问责。组织部门要结合巡视情况加强调研指导，推动解决领导班子、干部人才队伍和基层党组织建设中存在的突出问题。相关职能部门要综合用好巡视成果，对巡视反映的共性问题和深层次问题加强日常监管，深化重点领域改革，优化政策供给，完善体制机制。巡视机构要加强统筹督促，建立完善整改工作机制，重要情况及时向党中央报告。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据了解，中央巡视组还收到反映一些领导干部的问题线索，已按有关规定转中央纪委国家监委机关、中央组织部等有关方面处理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访胡歌：如果不做演员，生活里的我应该什么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257715]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;整个9月，胡歌的工作被排得满满当当。他前脚刚刚出席威尼斯电影节的相关活动，后脚就飞回北京参加电影《不虚此行》首映式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/i696A6YUsdAgCij7tPH3N2q1voWbuMVhpkbNsLQz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/i696A6YUsdAgCij7tPH3N2q1voWbuMVhpkbNsLQz.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;为了宣传这部小成本文艺电影，胡歌九天跑了七个城市，马不停蹄地向一批又一批观众分享自己对男主角闻善的感受。他说：“遇到喜欢的角色，我不是在扮演他，而是成为他。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该片导演刘伽茵则表达了对胡歌的“嫉妒”：“这个角色明明是我写的，我却觉得你似乎比我更了解他。我现在明白了，这多出来的一点，就是你自己。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;闻善年近四十，曾是一名失败的编剧，因为相信“普通人也可以是主角”，始终无法写出让甲方满意的剧本。久而久之，他对自己渐渐失去信心，放弃了这份职业，写不出来的角色则成为他内心的一部分，化作一个叫做小尹的男孩，常常从脑海里跳出来和他对话。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在学校读书的时候，闻善喜欢去殡仪馆和动物园做生活笔记，后来成了一种生活习惯。生活陷入窘迫后，他阴差阳错找到新工作——替委托人写文章悼念他们逝去的亲友，完成一篇可以得到四千元，正好能解决他在北京郊区的食宿开销。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;闻善总是穿着洗过太多次、有些松垮的衣服，习惯性驼背，头发长得有些遮眼睛，常年打字所以勤剪指甲，喜欢买大桶矿泉水，并且直接举起来喝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乍看上去，失意的闻善和胡歌本人之间没有多大联系，除了后者在工作中也曾接触过不少编剧。胡歌有些遗憾地对南方周末记者说：“这个行业有时候是挺畸形的，除非编剧是个大腕儿，否则几乎没有表达的权力，大部分时候只能等着被评价，甚至没有反驳的机会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在胡歌眼中，闻善是一个不愿意妥协的人，他不是不知道怎么写（剧本）才可以得到青睐，但他不愿意做自己不想做的事情。“我希望成为这样的人，很多时候却做不到，我很羡慕他。”胡歌说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年初，胡歌在微博上突然公开了结婚生女的消息，很快登上热搜榜，网上议论不断。他不吝分享初为人父的喜悦：“我第一次抱着女儿的时候，就好像抱着一块豆腐，我怕我一晃就把她给晃坏了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“结婚生子的事情以前也考虑过，但没有付诸行动。作这个决定是在出演闻善之后，这个角色带给我挺多改变和影响的。演完这个角色，我就有了很多底气，要去做我认为应该做的选择。”胡歌告诉南方周末记者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出道二十年，胡歌早就不是《仙剑奇侠传》里李逍遥那样的毛头小伙，更接近《琅琊榜》里九死一生的梅长苏。细心的观众会发现，每当《不虚此行》的镜头给到胡歌的特写，右眼的伤疤清晰可见，他早已能够直面2006年那场车祸带给自己的影响。车祸发生后的头两三部戏，胡歌还曾用刘海挡着这道伤疤，后来就放下了：“我自己都过不了这一关的话，怎么让别人接受？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《琅琊榜》《伪装者》等作品后，观众开始关注胡歌的演技，他则决定“停下来”“放下现有的一些工作，专心去体验生活”。时隔数年，《不虚此行》或许可以看作胡歌的答卷，凭借这部影片，他获得了第25届上海国际电影节最佳男演员奖，在颁奖典礼上，他说：“当一个演员真正爱上一个角色的时候，他就会把自己完全地交给这个角色。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;以下是胡歌的自述：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;他身上有我不具备的坚定&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;《不虚此行》讲的是普通人，让很多观众从中看到了自己。（我）跑了七个城市做路演，观众在交流的时候愿意分享自己面对亲友离世的经历，这是我最能够感同身受的地方，这个剧本和我自己的生活有很多交集。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几年前，我母亲去世了，悼词是我自己写的。所以我最初读剧本的时候，代入的不是闻善，而是他的某一个委托人。我到现在也没有从这段经历中完全走出来，还需要很长时间去接受生命终结这件事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此之前，我没有想过生活中还有像闻善这样的人。在我们的传统文化里，我们似乎非常避讳去谈论死亡和生命的终结。因此当至亲离开后，通常情况下，也很难找到人去分享和倾诉，这个剧本给了我温暖的感觉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;闻善对我来说还有另一层意义，用现在的话说他是一个“i人”（编者注：近年流行的MBTI人格测试的一种结果，与“e人”相对，二者近似于分别对应内向的人和外向的人），内向的人。他不善于表达，也不善于和人相处。说实话，真实的我可能就是这样一种性格。但他身上有我不具备的坚定，不会因为外界的评价和所谓世俗的标准去改变自己的选择，这一点是让我羡慕的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在他身上看见了我做不到的自己，是我理想的样子，我很想成为他。你别看他不是一个存在感很强的人，但骨子里还是很轴的。这种轴对我来说是一种勇气，也是一种坚持，更是一种魄力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我骨子里是i人，但看上去不太像，这可能和职业与环境都有一些关系。同样是i人，闻善更能坚持自己的选择，我却经常做不到。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一名编剧，闻善好像没有那么成功，不是因为能力问题，而是选择问题。他坚持自己的审美，不愿意改变自己的创作方向。他整个职业生涯几乎没有自己表达的机会，总是没来得及完成作品就被别人否定了。但难得的是，他从来没有说一定要去征得别人的认同，这是一种内在的坚持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;闻善人生的转机是机缘巧合中有了给别人写悼词的工作，虽然这份工作和做编剧完全是两回事，但同样都是在用文字创作。在工作中，闻善找到了一种认同感，这并不是说大家夸他写得很好，而是他用自己的善意与真诚，在不断交流中带给他人的影响。比如片中的王先生，他通过闻善的悼词，重新理解去世的父亲，这才是闻善工作的意义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/pf6D5BNM6E4lSzTB57y1Lxai5d60id3WlXYJbTCa.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;电影《不虚此行》中，客户王先生的儿子对胡歌饰演的闻善（右）袒露心中的秘密，闻善由此发现这家人彼此之间无言的爱。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（片方供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但我并不认为《不虚此行》主要表达的东西是死亡，它借着死亡讲的是我们怎样书写人生。闻善从一个编剧到写悼词的人，他在用笔创作人物，书写别人的故事。回过头看，我们在用每天的生活书写自己的人生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每一个阶段人会变化，但和具体的年龄无关，反而和经历有关。2019年，我的母亲去世了，接着我们又经历了三年的疫情，看到了很多生离死别。这个过程中，我想不仅仅是我，很多人都会对生命有更多的思考。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;大部分人都是主角&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;什么叫普通人？普通人并不是通常理解的特别平庸的人，而是相对于那些带有主角光环的人而言的。后者身上往往有特别强的戏剧冲突，在生活中发生了很多奇迹。但生活中普通人才是大部分，我们生活中很难遇到偶像剧主角那样的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;影片强调的“普通人也能做主角”，就是说大部分人都是主角。我们对于成功的定义好像太标准化了，一切事情都变得很功利。其实每个人的轨迹都不一样，有时候把眼光和目标放得太统一了，很容易就错过人生真正重要的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于个体来说，我们原本就在自己的故事里，在自己的成长轨迹中，你当然就是自己的主角，为什么非要当自己是配角呢？（为什么）非要把符合所谓概念中的成功的人物形象称为主角呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我是一个经常容易纠结的人，内心的自我和闻善很接近，只不过因为我的各种好运气，让我的人生过得和偶像剧一样。从内心来说，我确实对自己的人生是有问号的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;闻善和我以往塑造的角色都不一样，几乎所有的角色都带有主角光环，即使带着某些缺陷，也一定有特别厉害的能力，是所谓的“悲情英雄”。我以往塑造角色都是在做加法，要在身上叠加各种能力才能抵达人物，但这一次是做减法，需要把现在身上附加的各种东西卸下来，回到最初的自己。说得简单一点，如果我不做演员的话，我在生活里应该是什么样？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次我并没有刻意设计什么动作，我塑造闻善，并不是去演这个人物，而是成为他，所以没有用一些特别外化的方式，而是先靠近人物的内心，其他的东西就是一种自然流露。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小尹是闻善内心的镜像，作为一个倾听者，闻善是孤独的，很少能够找到让他可以倾诉的对象，他不得不学会和自己相处。小尹的存在就是用了一个特别的方式去呈现孤独的人如何与自己相处，这样他至少不是寂寞的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MC2AiDpZGMtuM4xiW492lOe04yepgJnApFZGdZ0L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/MC2AiDpZGMtuM4xiW492lOe04yepgJnApFZGdZ0L.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;电影《不虚此行》中，胡歌饰演的闻善（左）和他内心的小尹（右，吴磊饰）。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（片方供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;真正可悲的是孤独的人还要承受寂寞，孤独却不寂寞，是一个相对理想的状态。小尹是闻善心中更积极大胆的部分，但这一面一直被压抑着，他的内心一直存在着自我对抗和纠结。小尹一直在推着闻善更加勇敢地面对现实。最后小尹消失了，代表闻善找到了自信，可以作为编剧继续创作，让小尹回到了剧本世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我自己的身体里恐怕不止一个小尹，经常有些小小的分裂。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;演员是动物园里的大猩猩&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;闻善会经常观察周围的环境和人物，做生活笔记，片中最重要的两个场景殡仪馆和动物园，都是闻善爱去的地方，他可以静静观察周围的人和物。我自己可能也有所谓的职业病，喜欢观察遇到的人，并不是说我演了某个角色，我才要去找一些人物作为参考，而是和福尔摩斯似的，看见一个不认识的人从眼前走过，忍不住会猜测对方的职业履历和家庭关系，会想象这个人刚才在做什么，又经历过什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我不习惯去给过去的角色贴标签，每一个角色对我都很有意义。都说电影电视就是遗憾的艺术，没有办法重来，但我会经常反思，每当演完一个角色，就会去想自己哪里演得不好。可能我并不是一个那么有自信的人，即使别人说如何的好，我还是会给自己挑出毛病来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看完《不虚此行》的剧本，我就开始了和导演刘伽茵长达半年的网络交流。那段时间，我一直在《繁花》剧组，基本每天都要开工，只能和刘伽茵导演通过微信沟通，我们第一次见面就是定妆那天，我都已经进组开工了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合作过这么多导演，每一位的工作方法都不一样，和演员的交流相处也不一样，我觉得对于导演来说，如何启发演员、引导演员，是工作中特别重要的一部分。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孔笙导演会给演员特别大的空间，他可能会给你一个大的方向，然后具体的表演方式他会特别放心地交给演员。姜伟导演同时还是非常优秀的编剧，他的剧本所有的台词都无法调整，就连语气词都非常准确。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王家卫导演给我的感觉反而和之前一些媒体报道的不同，他之前的电影在拍摄的过程中可能没有特别具体的方向，但这次我感到他特别知道自己想要什么，也会表达得十分具体。当然有时候他也会让你去突破，如果能够给到他意料之外的火花，也就是更好的即兴的表演，他也会非常欣赏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有时候，角色就是不同形状的瓶子，演员就是水。每次进入到不同的角色里，演员就变成了不同的样子。所以表演是流动的，水进入瓶子之后才被固定成一个形状。我觉得导演最需要的是那个流动的瞬间，从艺术上来说，这一刻才是最美好的表达，而不是那个固定的样子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于演员来说，很多时候因为成名了就忘记如何平视生活。平视生活是非常重要的。忘记自己从哪里来，这是一件特别要命的事情。不演戏、不工作的时候，就是回归生活，要忘记自己的职业和身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我很羡慕那种可以卸下自己演员身份的生活状态，所以没事的时候，我总是想往远的地方走走。我每次去青海做志愿者，就有网友说我去捡垃圾什么的。其实我就是想去洗涤一下，把身上一些不属于生活的东西洗掉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多时候大家对演员有想象，往往都带着角色滤镜，以为我们和普通人不一样。当你卸下演员这个职业回到生活里，我日常所处理的东西，无非也是今天这只猫生病了，明天那块墙皮掉下来了，浴室的热水怎么不热了……这些构成了生活，面对这些日常，我经常感到自己能力有限，比不上很多人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我常常思考演员好像是动物园里的大猩猩，一天24小时的一举一动都在大家的关注之下。很多时候大家将自己的各种好奇、审视和监督都投射在演员身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾想过冲破这个牢笼，不在这个动物园待了，想要跑到大街上去。但你要知道，猩猩在动物园的时候有笼子隔着，跑到大街上可能会受到更多关注，岂不是要被围追堵截了？所以既然选择了这份职业，在得到很多的同时，就要承受它的压力，这是公平的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
