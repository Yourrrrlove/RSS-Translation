There is indeed a necessity and urgency to clarify ethical boundaries and build social consensus, because this is not just a matter for individual scientists or the so-called &quot;internal&quot; matter, but a &quot;matter for everyone&quot; involving everyone&#39;s rights. During this period, some misunderstandings about scientific research ethics also need to be analyzed and clarified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, &quot;Scientific research activities are benevolent or at least neutral, so there are no restricted areas for scientific research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientific research is different from scientific research and cannot be generalized. Mathematicians use paper and pencil to perform calculations, while physicists use astronomical telescopes to look into the universe, and use particle accelerators to try to blast apart atomic nuclei to peer into microscopic mysteries. There is no problem in saying that these scientific research are benevolent. It not only expands the boundaries of human cognition and sets a benchmark for truth-seeking, but also has no impact on the values ​​​​that support the survival of human society, but rather adds to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The human trials of drugs, human brain interfaces, artificial wombs, and the manipulation of human embryos and DNA are obviously very different. This kind of scientific research not only directly uses people as research subjects or people themselves as participants, but also the research process and possible results have real and potential major impacts on human society itself, including but not limited to lifestyles and values, and must be treated with caution. Again, proceed cautiously and with social consensus, which is the responsible attitude towards society and civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be more serious, if anti-human elements are allowed to conduct such research and use such discoveries for anti-human purposes, it is not impossible that human society will be destroyed as a result. For example, the cost and acquisition threshold for genetic modification and editing technologies are getting lower and lower, and this technology is not neutral to the survival of human society. Appalling things have happened in the past: using human bodies as test subjects to develop bacterial weapons is a crime against the entire human race. Therefore, in the 1970s, the international community formed the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibited the development, production and stockpiling of such weapons. Nowadays, genetic technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. If such technologies are not regulated, the entire human race will face unprecedented threats. This threat is much higher than the probability of nuclear annihilation. The most terrible thing is not to have risks, but to ignore the risks and fall into arrogance and arrogance. The importance of science and technology ethics can be seen here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, the saying that “scientific research has no restricted areas” is difficult to establish. Scientific research includes research purposes/effects and research methods. In terms of purpose/effect, there are many possibilities such as good/beneficial, neutral, bad/unfavorable, and good/evil/mixed of pros and cons; in terms of means, there are also different situations such as legal, ethical, illegal, and ethical violation. For a specific scientific research field or a specific scientific research activity, should a restricted area be established? What kind of restricted area should be established? Should the restricted area be established from the beginning of the research and development process or should it be established in the dissemination process? The specific scientific research purpose must be systematically measured/ Effects and means cannot be generalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. &quot;Scientific research is a matter for scientists, and the public has no say.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the analysis of the first point, it is not difficult to infer that this point is also untenable. Scientific research activities are high-level cognitive activities that scientists engage in. It is true that they cannot be carried out without a certain amount of talent and professional training. &quot;Debating whether coal should be washed with water or anthracite for rocket launches,&quot; even if professionals reply seriously, they will lose. But beyond that, there are many things that the public or taxpayers have the right to ask about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, if scientific research activities are originally funded by taxpayers’ money, taxpayers certainly have the right to interfere with the rationality of the use of the money, including but not limited to: the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge and the impact of this project on society. What are the benefits and possible impacts on values, whether the cost budget is reasonable, whether the scientific research methods are ethical, and whether the results have achieved the expected goals. If it is private funding, the private sponsor also has the right to ask similar questions. Whoever contributes money has the right to intervene. This reflects the basic ethics of human society: &quot;Being entrusted by others and being loyal to others&quot; is the ethical prerequisite for engaging in any activities, including scientific research activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as mentioned in the first point, if the research field or research activity uses human research objects, or/and has an impact on human life style, values, civilization and even the existence of Homo sapiens as a species, Impact or threat, that is, it is related to everyone&#39;s vital rights and interests. Every member of society has the right to intervene. Research is not funded by taxpayers or &quot;individual freedom&quot; or &quot;scientific research is noble and sacred and an elite activity&quot; are not evading the public. Reason for intervening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, the two major reasons why the public has the right to intervene are the roots of the need for scientific and technological ethics. In this sense, science and technology ethics are not mysterious. They are just the embodiment of universal ethics and values ​​that everyone in human society must follow in the field of scientific research: If any activity you engage in is funded by someone, then you must accept it. Accountability of funders; if the activities you engage in have actual or potential &quot;negative externalities&quot; on third parties or society, you must effectively control them and not do whatever you want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have a halo, but having a halo does not mean that they can ignore ethics, or be dismissive of the public’s right to intervene, thinking that &quot;scientists can just rely on self-discipline.&quot; Scientists are also members of society. They must abide by the ethics that everyone abides by in daily life and follow the guidance of scientific and technological ethics in scientific research activities. Only in this way can scientific research be good and not lose its way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[棉校服里塞碎布条？校服何时成了家长的负担？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258343]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a parent of a student in Dunhua, Jilin, posted a short video saying that his daughter’s school uniform “looks glamorous on the outside but is unpalatable on the inside.” &quot;He will not be allowed to enter the school without wearing a school uniform&quot;, which triggered a heated discussion on the Internet. On the evening of October 9, the Dunhua Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department responded that the strips in the video were peeling waterproof coatings and that the sample uniforms had been sent to the provincial authority for quality inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/8ll6wJV9z5ffF1B0vKyoQp7WafGhsXcwwN1MQSBd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1341&quot; height= &quot;1140&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/8ll6wJV9z5ffF1B0vKyoQp7WafGhsXcwwN1MQSBd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253590&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Strips scattered inside the cotton-padded clothes in the video&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshots/pictures issued by CCTV)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that regarding the rumors that &quot;people who are not wearing school uniforms are not allowed to enter the school&quot;, the local government responded that there are no relevant regulations, but at the same time, it also stated that &quot;there are basically requirements for students to wear school uniforms when going to school.&quot; . It is not difficult to see that parents and students do not have much freedom to choose whether to wear school uniforms or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, in July this year, a middle school in Dongguan, Guangdong issued admission instructions for new students, requiring students to pay more than 4,000 yuan in school uniform fees, which caused controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/246663d7527f58bcab18c4db676eb3e5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; height= &quot;503&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/246663d7527f58bcab18c4db676eb3e5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253591&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Screenshot of school fees&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Dongguan Guangzheng Experimental School WeChat public account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to reduce the burden on parents, the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening the Management of School Uniforms for Primary and Secondary School Students&quot; issued a few years ago mentioned that &quot;students voluntarily purchase school uniforms.&quot; But in practice, school uniforms are often a necessity for school. This means that the school uniform business is usually a hard-to-need business. According to a report released by Hangzhou Zhongjing Zhisheng Market Research Company, the market size of my country&#39;s school uniform industry is 112-118 billion yuan, which shows that school uniforms are a big market. The resulting chaos such as school uniform apportionment, school uniform monopoly, and school uniform corruption has also led to frequent problems with the quality of school uniforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are school uniforms really a necessity?

Interestingly, Japanese Zhidang research is also troubled by political issues. Although there were scholars like Shigeo Matsueda who were loyal to Chido before the war and began to translate and study it, due to political reasons after World War II, there were very few scholars who studied Chido, and translations were also rare. I have seen only one copy, which is &quot;Essays of Zhou Zuoren&quot; translated by Shigeo Matsueda (Toyamabo Encyclopedia Library, 1996), this book is a new compilation of an old book. After World War II, Matsue also co-translated &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s Hometown&quot;, but his new translation was only this one volume. Hu Shih&#39;s treatment was even worse. Only recently has a biography been published. It was a translation of &quot;Hu Shih and the Chinese Renaissance&quot; by American sinologist Grider, which has been published in China for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after I started graduate school in the mid-1990s, a teacher gave me &quot;The Sorrow of the Oriental People: Zhou Zuoren and Japan&quot; written by Liu Anwei, a PhD student in comparative literature at the University of Tokyo. More than ten years ago, Liu Anwei went a step further and wrote a book called &quot;The Biography of Zhou Zuoren: The Spiritual History of a Literary Man of the Zhini School&quot;, which won the prestigious Watsuji Tetsuro Cultural Award. In order to study Zhitang, Liu Anwei even studied ancient Greek. He discussed the ancient Greek classics translated by Zhitang in the book. This made me curious and wanted to read it in full one day. Recently, Liu Anwei also co-published the Japanese translation of &quot;Reminiscences of Zhitang&quot;, which provides Japanese readers with good biographical information. In addition to Liu Anwei, some Japanese scholars have also been doing Zhitang research in recent years. For example, Professor Ogawa Toshiyasu, who participated in the editing of &quot;Notes from Zhou Zuoren to Shigeo Matsueda&quot;, recently published &quot;Traitor and Hermit: Zhou Zuoren in the 1920s&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, some of Chido&#39;s works have been published in Japanese, such as &quot;Nihon Tan Yi Shu&quot; (Toyo Bunko, 2002) compiled by Chinese literature expert Kiyama Hideo, which includes four &quot;Japanese Glimpses&quot; There are forty-six essays included. As the title of the book indicates, they are all about Japanese culture. The most important one should be the five-volume &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Reading Miscellaneous Notes&quot; compiled by Nakajima Nagabumi, a Chinese literature expert and one of the translators of &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; (Toyo Bunko, 2018). When I saw an advertisement for Toyo Bunko published in the Asahi Shimbun five years ago, the author was shocked because I had the impression that Toyo Bunko had never published five books by the same person. I really admire the courage of this publishing house. After all, it is an old publishing house that has published Japan&#39;s best encyclopedia and &quot;Collected Works of Lin Dafu&quot; and other good books. By chance, I recently borrowed this set of books and read several translations and explanations carefully. I found that it is indeed a good translation that has put a lot of effort into it. It is worth introducing it to domestic readers and seeing how Japanese scholars read it. Zhitang&#39;s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/WmMqi6PYTz5zGEB8gOK40WZxUx6wNB8MsL1VybUE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;627&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/WmMqi6PYTz5zGEB8gOK40WZxUx6wNB8MsL1VybUE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253505&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Zuoren and his friends are in Kuyu Zhai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The best Japanese version of Chido&#39;s works&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;We know that Zhitang read countless books throughout his life, and many of the articles he wrote were related to books. In the words of his student Zhang Zhongxing, Zhitang ranks among the best among the older generation in terms of the amount of reading and the variety of reading. Therefore, Professor Nakajima compiled and selected Zhidou&#39;s articles from the perspective of reading. It was a very insightful decision to name this set of books &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Reading Miscellaneous Notes&quot;. It can be said that it captured the main thread of Zhidou&#39;s lifelong pursuit of knowledge. The text used as the translation base was &quot;Zhitang Shuhua&quot; which I had read back then. However, he used a newer version, a two-volume version published by Renmin University of China Press in 2004. The &quot;Chitō Preface and Postscripts&quot; that was published at about the same time as &quot;Chitō Shuhua&quot; was basically not included in the collection, because in Professor Nakajima&#39;s opinion, Chitō wrote the preface and postscript to the books he had personally seen, and as a translator, he had to verify them one by one. It&#39;s not easy, I have to give up. In order to fully reflect the complete picture of Chitou&#39;s works, Professor Nakajima said that he also referred to &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Collected Works&quot;, &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Humanities Collection&quot;, &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Complete Prose Collection&quot; and &quot;Zhou Zuoren&#39;s Complete Translations&quot;, which means that it is a fact Above are five volumes selected from all the works. The translator&#39;s seriousness in choosing the original text for translation is truly admirable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After determining the general direction, how to arrange the specific volumes is also a very difficult matter. After all, the articles written by Zhitang cover a wide range of knowledge and the number of articles is amazing. In his own words, his knowledge is &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;miscellaneous knowledge&quot;. Therefore, Nakajima simply placed the autobiographical article &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot; at the beginning of the first volume. This is the best introduction, allowing Japanese readers who are not familiar with Chido to have an overview of this foreign literati and thinker. learn. After all, compared to his brother, his popularity in Japan is vastly different. Lu Xun&#39;s articles have even been included in Japanese middle school Chinese textbooks. The first volume is after &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot;, and the translator also divided it into sub-categories such as reading theory, banned books, and book records, and included related articles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/BFTwoxiZlzn2Qnf35InJvKi9MDrcUHerQuqXJzTg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;897&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/BFTwoxiZlzn2Qnf35InJvKi9MDrcUHerQuqXJzTg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253506&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two scholars who had a greater influence on Zhou Zuoren are Ailisi on the left and Kunio Yanagida on the right. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second volume is mainly articles related to folk customs. Zhitang&#39;s concern for folk customs lasted throughout his life, and he was a very prominent figure in the history of modern Chinese culture. In Nakajima’s words, in terms of mythology and folklore, Chido can be regarded as the founder of modern Chinese related knowledge. He is not only familiar with the knowledge of the British classical master Ms. Jane Harrison, but also highly respects modern Japanese folklore. Kunio Yanagida, the founder of the school. The third volume includes articles related to women and sexuality. Nakajima said that Chido’s motivation for being very concerned about women and sexual issues is still unclear even now, but at least he was ideologically influenced by the British scholar Ellis. Including relevant articles in the third volume is also a very discerning choice. After all, this is an extremely important part of Zhitang&#39;s lifelong study and thinking. Zhitang said that the one who had the greatest influence on him was Elisabeth. According to Zhang Zhongxing, Zhitang has read more than three million words of Elis&#39;s works, including the seven-volume &quot;Research on Sexual Psychology&quot;, which shows the great influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is no unified standard for the classification of this set of Japanese translations of Chido&#39;s reading miscellanies. Nakajima said that starting from the middle of the third volume, the classification changed from title to classification. He said that it was actually inspired by &quot;I The influence of &quot;Miscellaneous Studies&quot; is basically similar to the classification of Zhitang Shuxue. The fourth volume is composed of Zhitang&#39;s articles discussing old and new Chinese literature. The fifth volume contains many articles about notes, as well as old novels. Zhitang loved to read notes throughout his life. We can know from his collection that he read a large number of notes from past dynasties. Needless to say, his writing style was also affected. Many of his own articles are good notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After carefully reading Professor Nakajima’s selection and classification, the author feels that the articles he selected have included Chido’s lifelong academic thoughts. The author has also read some translations, and the quality is very good. It should be said that these five volumes of translations have provided Japanese readers with trustworthy texts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/yviJvXqfXrRQF1Q5rv3EoAwXtz8iZwH82btzm5K3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;838&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/yviJvXqfXrRQF1Q5rv3EoAwXtz8iZwH82btzm5K3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253507&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Professor Liu Anwei from the Institute of Liberal Arts Education, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and his representative work &quot;The Biography of Zhou Zuoren&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Tokyo Institute of Technology website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;An unmissable explanation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Me It turned out that I had been reading Chitou&#39;s works for many years, and I didn&#39;t care if I didn&#39;t read the explanations attached to each book. However, after reading a few pages, I discovered that I was completely wrong. When I patiently read the five-volume commentary, I was first moved by the translator&#39;s efforts, because each commentary was very long, some nearly thirty pages, and the shortest nearly ten pages. In order to make it easier for Japanese readers to read, in addition to introducing a lot of background materials, the most interesting part is the part where Professor Nakajima talks about his views on Chido. There are not only praises, but also sharp criticisms, and some from the Japanese perspective. Some of his profound insights have never been discovered before. Here are some selected ones to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when talking about Zhitang&#39;s concern for mythology and folklore, Nakajima pointed out that Zhitang&#39;s related work was all carried out in his study, and he only collected two hundred works in Shaoxing in 1913. A nursery rhyme. Nakajima said that this was very different from Yanagida Kunio, whom Chitou admired. Yanagida Kunio traveled all over Japan to collect folklore materials and established a set of learning rules for Japanese folklore. Nakajima also pointed out that as both study-type scholars, Chitou is different from Fraser, the author of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, because he does not engage in classification work or analyze data, which means that he does not do systematic work. This point is indeed to the point. Maybe it has something to do with Zhitang&#39;s way of doing academics. After all, he has never felt the need or pressure to write a paper, and has always written in the form of essays. Nakajima&#39;s criticism also made the author have some associations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard a saying before that Zhou Zuoren is known as the best Japanese scholar in China, but he is not a real scholar who studies Japan. At first glance, I was shocked because I instinctively refuted it. Is there any Chinese scholar who knows more about Japanese culture than Chitou? But thinking about it calmly, Chido did not conduct research on Japanese culture by writing a paper. He mainly wrote his observations and analysis of Japanese culture in the form of essays. The same goes for his work on folklore and mythology. Nakajima pointed out that the same characteristics are also reflected in Chido’s focus on and research on women and sexual psychology. He said that Zhitang&#39;s method is based on conscious individuals and is not combined with mass movements, so in practice the effect is zero. In other words, Zhitang wanted to enlighten people through articles, but the result was like waiting for the Yellow River to clear up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/V8zfMLkNUczfDZ2Tuxrg5j0WLCv7gX9cU7keGaF0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/V8zfMLkNUczfDZ2Tuxrg5j0WLCv7gX9cU7keGaF0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253508&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Zuoren in his later years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a saying that the best way to read is to translate. As a translator, Nakajima can be said to have thoroughly read Chido&#39;s major works, and as a result of repeated scrutiny, he has an understanding of Chido&#39;s texts that ordinary readers do not have. For example, one of the issues pointed out by Nakajima, which I have not paid much attention to before, is the understanding of Yanagida Kunio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chido has an article about Yanagida Kunio&#39;s masterpiece &quot;Tono Monogatari&quot;, and the title of the article is &quot;Tono Monogatari&quot;. Nakajima said that when Chitō read Yanagita’s book, he read it in the same way as when he read Hao Yixing and Yu Zhengxie, that is, based on the criteria of thoroughness of thought and readability of the article, but for the most important thing Yanagida’s article wanted to convey, It&#39;s folklore, but I don&#39;t pay too much attention to it, that is to say, I don&#39;t look at it from a cultural perspective. In other words, Chido admits that Yanagita&#39;s book has both the beauty of writing and the value of folklore, but he seems unable to see what he has excavated from Yanagita&#39;s folklore and what he has elaborated on it. Such criticism reminds me of Chido’s own words. He said he just likes to read miscellaneous books and learn more about things. I am neither a scholar nor a scholar, I am just doing odd jobs. Comparing the two sides, it may be easier to understand. Nakajima also said that there is no harm in appreciating Yanagita&#39;s article as a good text, but if the folklore meaning is not read, misunderstandings are likely to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Sino-Japanese relations were deteriorating, Chitou expressed his confusion about his Japanese research. For example, in &quot;Japanese Insights No. 4&quot; written in June 1937, he said that he admired the beautiful Japan cannot be linked to Japan, which invaded China in reality. Chitou confessed that he could not understand Japan like that, and said that he usually felt that the Japanese nation was very different from China, and that was religious beliefs. To borrow Yanagita Kunio&#39;s statement, the Japanese worship rituals often show a state of &quot;harmony between gods and gods&quot;. Chido said that Japan&#39;s upper-class intellectual circles have absorbed Chinese Confucianism and Indian Buddhism, and in modern times have added Western philosophy and science. However, the fundamental belief of the nation seems to be Shintoism from Southeast Asia, which has always dominated the thoughts and feelings of the people. . Nakajima also talked about this part. He said that although Chitou said that he did not understand, in fact, he had basically pointed out the truth of the matter here, because Chitou said that if he could understand the psychology of the strong man who carries the shrine, he would Able to understand Japan&#39;s actions against China. Nakajima said that here Chido finally made full use of Yanagita&#39;s folklore results not from a literary perspective but from a folklore perspective. The analysis of Japan&#39;s invasion of China was not just from the perspective of upper-class politicians, soldiers and intellectuals, but from the perspective of upper-class politicians, soldiers and intellectuals. Turn your attention to the people. Yanagita&#39;s purpose in studying folklore is to unearth those thinking and psychological mechanisms that cannot be simply rationalized. They are accumulated in the unconsciousness of the group and restrict the behavior of the people. Nakajima said that Chido had studied Yanagita for so many years, and now he really understood what Yanagita was talking about. Nakajima&#39;s analysis is indeed very sharp, because this is an issue that is difficult for us Chinese readers to detect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/7foPziv5ixeyj6RBwyROIxk3eYlqFwezpIuIEz8w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height= &quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/7foPziv5ixeyj6RBwyROIxk3eYlqFwezpIuIEz8w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253513&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese scholar Yoshikawa Kojiro. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I remembered the words of another great scholar, Kojiro Yoshikawa, recalling his meeting with Chitō. . At the beginning of the article &quot;The Significance and Methods of Foreign Studies&quot;, Yoshikawa said that he met Chido in Beijing shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. He said Chitou told him that his Japanese studies paid too much attention to the Chinese-influenced aspects of Japanese culture and did not pay enough attention to Japanese religion. These were fatal flaws. Yoshikawa said he answered bluntly that it was indeed the case. In fact, he spoke highly of Chido&#39;s Japanese studies, because in his opinion, most Chinese people at that time did not recognize the uniqueness of Japanese culture, but Chido loved Japan deeply and advocated that Japan had its own culture. In this regard, Yoshikawa believed that Japan People and the Japanese government should express their gratitude. However, in his view, Zhou Zuoren’s Japanese research was actually too biased towards the Heian period, towards the late Edo and Meiji periods of a certain school of literati (should refer to the Shirakaba school), and although these can be said to represent Japanese literature era, but it cannot represent the era of Takeshi in Japan. Even if we cannot say that these are very Chinese parts of Japanese culture, they are indeed an era that Chinese intellectuals can easily understand. Yoshikawa went on to say that Japan still has eras of representative martial arts, such as the Kamakura shogunate, and the religions of Nichiren and Shinran that emerged in the Kamakura period play an important role in Japanese history. These Japanese people are very aware. However, it has been almost completely ignored in Chido&#39;s Japanese studies. The reason for this is that Yoshikawa believes that the Chinese people attach great importance to literature. Japan&#39;s national character of attaching importance to martial arts is inconsistent with Chinese tradition. Yoshikawa said there is another reason, and that is the lack of religion in Chinese culture. Yoshikawa believed that Confucianism was strongly opposed to the idea of ​​finding an ideal world after death, in a super-sensory place separated from the human world. Although this tendency was weakened by the entry of Buddhism, it soon rebounded and was completely finalized by the time of Confucianism in the Song Dynasty. Japan is the opposite of China, and it is here that Japan has its most special place. In Yoshikawa&#39;s view, because Japan was the opposite of China in terms of religion, even the erudite Chido was not interested in it, so his research on Japan was biased, which also led to his inability to understand Japan&#39;s military operations. Yoshikawa even said that Japan’s China studies should take Chido as a lesson and reflect on whether they have made the same mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/QLGfbMLg0t57Taac0rf6AigiLRR5K4hQIArMoTnh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height= &quot;807&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/QLGfbMLg0t57Taac0rf6AigiLRR5K4hQIArMoTnh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jiang Baili. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yoshikawa&#39;s analysis and criticism of Chido&#39;s Japanese studies can be seen together with Nakajima&#39;s More complete. The author believes that Jiang Baili, a contemporary of Chitang, has the most accurate understanding of the martial side of Japanese culture. After all, Jiang Baili had a military background, attended a Japanese military academy, and had some friends in the Japanese military circles. He was very familiar with Japan. The grasp of characteristics is most accurate among Chinese Nippon Tongli, and some views even predicted the outcome of the war. We will understand after reading his &quot;Japanese—A Study of a Foreigner&quot;. Although Chido is proficient in Japanese culture and has many friends in the literary and art circles in Japan, his Japanese studies do have problems with the study style. His misjudgment of the situation may also have something to do with this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Zhitang&#39;s unique literary outlook, of course he will mention his high evaluation of short essays in the late Ming Dynasty. Nakajima&#39;s explanatory essays not only set off a craze in China, but also influenced Chinese literature researchers in Japan across the sea. The author is very ignorant and this is the first time I have heard of this. Nakajima said that as far as he knew, at least two famous scholars were affected. One was Iriya Yoshitaka, and the other was Ogawa Tamaki, who was the first to introduce Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Selected Annotations to Song Poems&quot; in Japan. Yoshitaka Iriya has researched Ming Dynasty literature and is also known for his research on Zen Buddhism. According to Nakajima, Ogawa Tamaki did not directly study the late Ming Dynasty sketch essays, but he always loved reading Chitou&#39;s articles. He followed the lead and collected most of the books mentioned in Chitou&#39;s articles, and now they are all collected in the Ogawa Bunko. Nakajima said that he benefited a lot from Ogawa Bunko when translating. When I read this, I thought it was a coincidence, because I have a set of &quot;Collected Works of Ogawa Tamaki&quot; published by Chikuma Shobo, which is very close to Chido&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/tlWHtV0tNa5wFO8rUzmU751NJYEPwcQ0G0F2ZXMx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height= &quot;766&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/tlWHtV0tNa5wFO8rUzmU751NJYEPwcQ0G0F2ZXMx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253514&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hello Takeuchi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Enlightenment and falling into the water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In summary Zhitang When it comes to the characteristics of a lifetime&#39;s work, Nakajima said it can be summed up in four words: &quot;physical human feelings.&quot; For Zhitang, this &quot;physical favor&quot; is not only the standard of value for judging literary works, but also the standard for judging all things. This point of view is completely consistent with Zhang Zhongxing&#39;s point of view in the article &quot;Re-Talk about Kuyu Zhai&quot;. Nakajima also said that to sum it up in more popular terms is &quot;reasonable thinking and humane feelings&quot;, which is the essence of the Enlightenment spirit that Chido absorbed from his own civilization and foreign ideas. At the same time, this is also the most important prescription Zhitang wants to use to solve China&#39;s fundamental problems. Nakajima said that precisely because of this, his contribution should not be erased because of political missteps. Interestingly, Nakajima changed his tone at this time and talked about the difficulties encountered by this enlightenment spirit in the 21st century. He said that he originally thought that this &quot;physical human relationship&quot; that integrated the essence of Eastern and Western thought would still be effective in another hundred years. However, after entering the 21st century, he found that almost all his ideals were shattered, so he began to doubt whether this enlightenment spirit also had limitations. . The reason for this suspicion is that the Japanese have already led a life of abundant food and clothing, and education is universal. Almost everyone can enter high school, and nearly 60% of them can enter university. Regardless of quality, this is an astonishing number. It stands to reason that this number is very close to the ideals held by people with lofty ideals in modern times, but irresponsibility is prevalent in society where no one is responsible (this is reminiscent of the &quot;irresponsibility system&quot; said by the famous political thinker Maruyama Masao) ), the democratic system seems to have turned into populism, which can be said to have the tendency of obscurantism. In this case, how to promote &quot;physical favors&quot;? If that were the case, wouldn’t all the efforts of the enlightenment sages back then be in vain? This question is too big, and I am not capable of answering it. However, Nakajima is very keenly aware of the serious problems that modern enlightenment may bring. Adorno and Horkheimer, who wrote &quot;Dialectics of Enlightenment&quot;, have long warned about this. , Nakajima is just repeating an old story. However, he was able to discuss the enlightenment concept of &quot;physical human relations&quot; together with the enlightenment trends in modern times, which shows his broad vision, because after all, our enlightenment is closely related to the West. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to write about Zhitang without mentioning his falling into the water. As mentioned earlier, Professor Nakajima believes that he cannot be completely dismissed because of this incident. This is consistent with the spirit of Mr. Zhong Shuhe’s saying that people should return to their own people and the article should return to the article. But how do you view this matter from a Japanese perspective? I remember that many years ago when I was reading Takeuchi Yoshi&#39;s &quot;Inside China&quot;, I saw him mention Chitou, and he said that we Japanese were sorry for him. Professor Nakajima said something similar in the explanation, but more specific, which moved me as a Chinese reader very much. He said that it was our grandfathers and fathers’ generation who carried Chitou out like a scarecrow in a wind and rain festival, made him sit on the shrine, and then threw it to the roadside outside the village. In other words, the great-grandfathers or great-grandfathers’ parents of those working in society today. Their names cannot be remembered, but they are all Japanese. We should not forget this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, no matter what the external reasons are, it is Chitou’s own judgment after all, and the blame cannot be placed on others. However, the opinions of Takeuchi Yoshi and Nakajima Nagafumi, two Japanese scholars who have studied Chinese culture all their lives, If there is any Zhitang who knows this, he will definitely be very moved by these words. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Something about the translator of Zhitang&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After reading Professor Nakajima’s last explanation, I felt particularly respectful. He said that this translation work was originally proposed by the editor of Pingfanshe in 2005, and it took a total of 13 years. It was really a long and protracted battle. Considering his physical strength and age, it was not easy to last until the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Japanese Chido translators, he highlighted Shigeo Matsueda and Hideo Kiyama and paid tribute to them. In his later years, when sorting out Chitou&#39;s letters, Matsueda Shigeo once said, &quot;Half of his life, he fell in love with the Dream of Red Mansions, but his whole life, he fell in love with Zhou Zuoren.&quot; The former refers to his translation of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, and the latter, of course, refers to the correspondence between him and Chitou from their student days to Chitou&#39;s later years. Communicated. It is said that Matsueda Shigeo once planned to translate all of Chido&#39;s works, but was unable to realize this long-cherished wish. In 1973, his student Hideo Kiyama collected Chido&#39;s articles on Japanese culture and compiled them into the book &quot;Japanese Culture&quot;, which was the predecessor of &quot;Nihon Tan Yoshiro&quot; included in Toyo Bunko.木山还通过采访知情者，写出了关于知堂落水的著作《周作人对日合作始末—〈北京苦住庵记〉补注及续篇》，是所有对那段历史有兴趣的读者都无法绕过的著作。他还协助耄耋之年的老师整理出版了先前提到的《周作人随笔》，收入知堂到三十年代为止的名篇三十九篇。除了翻译，很寡作的松枝先生写过《周作人先生》一文，虽然是1941年写的，但是笔者所看到的最好的写知堂的文章之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;读了这么多年知堂的文章，总算有机会写一写知堂。还是钟叔河先生的那句老话，人归人，文归文，知堂在政治上的失足，的确令人惋惜，让仰慕他的读者为他感到不值，因为胡适说过智者应该是识得轻与重的，但他却做出了令国人大跌眼镜的判断。但他的著作自有传世的价值，毕竟知堂给中国文化史和思想史留下了一笔宝贵的财富，有些思想至今不失光辉。据说胡适上世纪五十年代回台湾后，托人到处收集知堂的著作，说五四以来还值得一读的就是这位老友的著作。虽然不无夸张，但也说出了不可否认的真相。而本文介绍的东瀛学人的工作，也可以为我们提供一些理解知堂的新思路吧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[解构“讲课费”，数读藏起来的医药腐败丨H5]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258351]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打击缅北电诈有重要突破！揪出幕后“金主”、组织头目23名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258333]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;span>;今年6月25日至9月30日，公安部党委针对夏季治安特点和安全稳定形势，统筹指挥全国公安机关全警动员、全力以赴，开展了一场严打各类违法犯罪、严整突出治安问题的夏季治安打击整治行动，简称为“夏季行动”。 10月10日，公安部召开新闻发布会，介绍全国公安机关扎实开展夏季治安打击整治行动举措及总体成效等情况。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/12bb94e7ad11a35ebaacaedc57bc199b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/12bb94e7ad11a35ebaacaedc57bc199b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253568&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;公安部：抓获缅北涉我违法犯罪嫌疑人2317名&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公安部“夏季行动”办公室副主任、治安管理局副局长尹春吉在10日召开的新闻发布会上表示，公安部在“夏季行动”中坚持以打开路，形成严打高压态势。公安部部署开展打击缅北涉我违法犯罪专项行动，加强边境警务合作，抓获并移交我方涉诈犯罪嫌疑人2317名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据公安部消息，在云南省公安厅的指挥部署下，普洱公安机关进一步扩大战果，209名电信网络诈骗犯罪嫌疑人于10月1日成功移交我方。 At the same time, Lincang Public Security Bureau&#39;s border police law enforcement cooperation has made significant progress.

It may sound a bit confusing at first, but in fact it explains the truth of life very clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it simply, a person should try his best to age slowly, keep his mind young, live a quality and glorious life, and once he faces death and there is no way to recover, he should have a good time. , be optimistic about life, and don’t go against objective laws and make meaningless “struggles”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend talked about an incident. An old man had entered the last moments of his life, and a relative with whom he had a very good relationship was out of town. The old man’s children considered letting them see each other for the last time, so they prepared to use the ultimate method to Medical means extend the life of the old man and let him &quot;wait&quot; for his arrival. He considered and refused again and again, on the grounds that it would add unnecessary pain to the old man before he died. Even if it &quot;makes sense&quot; to him, it&#39;s not humane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone is afraid of the word &quot;old&quot;. Many people are desperately looking for beauty treatments, no matter how much money they spend, they are not afraid of getting old. There are also many people who are obviously old, but they are taboo about being called &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;. But physical aging is an objective law that no one can resist. &quot;Are you young? It doesn&#39;t matter, you will be old in two years.&quot; Zhang Ailing&#39;s famous saying fully expresses the impact of the law of aging on the illusion of &quot;eternal youth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Old&quot; can be divided into two situations. One is that the body ages and the body functions become weaker. The original straight back has collapsed, the original beautiful features have turned into a &quot;mess&quot;, the original speedy steps have turned into slowly moving steps with a cane... The second is psychological or spiritual aging. Some people have a good mentality and appear young, even if they are seventy or eighty years old, they are not old. Some people age faster than their peers under heavy pressure. The so-called &quot;a 30-year-old has a 60-year-old heart&quot; and &quot;premature aging&quot; all have this meaning. The latter type of people is actually more common. Their hallmark is that they want to work hard on the &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; every day, and they also frown and sigh all day long, accompanied by white hair and wrinkled faces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who are not involved in childbirth and are pampered, it is relatively easy to achieve the goal of aging slower. Even at different stages of a person, there are big differences. For example, the &quot;Sha Wujing&quot; who was leisurely swimming in the Liusha River back then must be more beautiful than the Sha Wujing who was walking on the road to seek Buddhist scriptures, eating and sleeping in the open and carrying everyone&#39;s luggage on his shoulders. Appear youthful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most people cannot have freedom of wealth, nor can they rely on others to support themselves without working. This will inevitably lead to people plotting for rice and trying their best to get tomorrow’s steamed buns. Because in reality, it is not easy to make a living, and there are all kinds of internal and external frictions all the time, so there are nine out of ten people who are exhausted both mentally and physically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What to do? As ordinary people, since we cannot change our situation, the only thing we can do is to take it lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once had a neighbor who was in his nineties and could ride a bicycle very fast. Why? In fact, he was not strong when he was young. Instead, he had problems here and there, but he just had a good mentality. Whether you encounter a small trouble or encounter a hurdle that others may think is almost insurmountable, you should be able to deal with it calmly, think less, and worry less. Such people should live longer. &quot;Be heartless and live a long life&quot; may not sound good, but the words are rough and rational, and the mentality of &quot;if you can afford it, let it go&quot; is worth learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person should work hard when working, and should also &quot;try hard&quot; to rest when resting. That is, he should neither be distracted when he should be working, always thinking about lying down, nor should he be lying down when he should be working. I always think about work when I am resting, and as a result, my work is not good and my rest is not good either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can enter the world and you can emerge from it. This is the highest state of life. It seems difficult to achieve, but it is not. How to work and how to rest is a science. As an individual, you must learn to adjust, relax the tight strings in a timely manner, balance work with rest, and laugh at gains and losses. This is a skill that can be mastered. If you can&#39;t do it the first time, do it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are afraid of old age and even talk about death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Speaking of &quot;die faster&quot;, this does not conform to the philosophy of many Chinese people. In contrast, it is greed for life and fear of death. Even if you die a moment later, it seems to be good. This is instinctive and understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to die slowly, many people (mainly family members of the deceased) do whatever they can to survive. As long as they can breathe one more breath in the human world, they are willing to suffer all kinds of hardships. This mentality has far-reaching influence. Most of the savings of many people&#39;s lives are not spent while enjoying life and raising children, but are thrown into the water in a &quot;surprise attack&quot; one or two months before death. Death is already an irreversible outcome. No matter how much money is spent, it is in vain. At most, it can delay the death a little. In the end, one person will lose both his life and property, and even his children and grandchildren will be burdened with heavy debts. It is really not worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of disease, some people are even &quot;scared to death&quot;. As soon as they heard that they had an incurable disease, they would fall into a state of panic and disorder, causing physical and mental harm and exacerbating physical diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult thing in life is to remain transparent on the subject of death. If a slower death equals long-term torture—including torture for children—then the meaning of life will also change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father told me that there was an old lady in the family who lived alone and lived to a ripe old age. She had done &quot;white things&quot; during her lifetime, and she became a favorite story in the village. If a person has seen through life and death, and the true meaning of &quot;disappearance&quot;, what is there to be afraid of, and why must he do it even though he knows it cannot be done? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To let go of life calmly is a kind of great love. It’s not about going against the trend and forcibly delaying death, it’s about cherishing life. Knowing the deadline, waving your hands and going away, isn’t it a kind of optimism towards life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is no need to doubt the significance of saving lives and healing the wounded. Reducing illness and pain in life is a legitimate pursuit. But what we need to take warning from is gambling-like “fighting” in order to die slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are reports that after someone learned that he had terminal cancer, he specifically told his closest relatives not to needless treatment, let alone to &quot;intubate&quot; himself when he was dying, so as not to spend more money. . Having such an open heart is a rational choice after insight. Of course, financial hardship is also one of the reasons, but in general, it is still based on optimism about life and great love for family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To grow old slowly and die quickly is my creed and pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有冇蛋散？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257980]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/LSoqRSrnSyZBlr1s57t36ByNrvH2VbqJ0Lb9A70o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LSoqRSrnSyZBlr1s57t36ByNrvH2Vb qJ0Lb9A70o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Song Dong&#39;s work &quot;You Are There&quot;.

They were wearing uniform white short T-shirts. It was probably a summer vacation activity organized by a nearby school. On August 29, 2023, the second GDMoA Annual Artist Academic Nomination Exhibition was launched at the Guangdong Museum of Art and will last until October 8. The works of the 21 nominated artists are displayed in several exhibition halls on two floors. They are rich in types and styles, attracting a steady stream of visitors. For several consecutive weekends, the admission quota for 1,000 people every half day has been reserved early, and there is a long queue at the entrance of the Guangdong Museum of Art. When the crowds are the strongest, it takes an hour to queue to enter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most photographed exhibit on social media in this exhibition is the &quot;big egg powder&quot; in front of these students. It was made by artist Feng Yu using bamboo curtains and wooden frames, and is called &quot;Wei&quot;. The work is introduced as &quot;an exploration of ancient space emotions, and also an extreme mechanical challenge to traditional Chinese soft materials.&quot; The bamboo curtains and wooden frames are curled and twisted to form several looping and twisting pipes, occupying nearly half of the venue, standing tall and full to the left and right. The promotion speech written by Zhang Zikang, director of the Central Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum, described it this way, &quot;The artist uses the relaxing combination of the movement rhythm of Chinese calligraphy to form a unique spatial scale experience and emotional experience. Every viewer will have a different feeling when entering it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feng Yu’s work &quot;Wei&quot; is called &quot;Dan San&quot; on social media and is widely circulated&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Lang/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the feedback, in the audience’s feelings, it has derived an image that is more suitable for the Internet context - Dansan. Egg powder is a traditional snack in Guangdong. It is made of flour, gluten flour, eggs and lard, fried in oil until light yellow, scooped up and dipped in maltose before eating. In Cantonese, Dan San also refers to a timid or unpromising little person, taking his characteristic of being &quot;not strong enough&quot;. The color of the bamboo curtain and wooden frame is very similar to the light yellow color of the eggs when they come out of the pot, and the irregular bends are like the appearance of the eggs on the plate. Compared with the words in the recommendation, &quot;This spatial art installation will no longer be retained as the exhibition closes. Just like fireworks and life, no matter how gorgeous and bright they are, they will eventually pass away with the wind...&quot;, it is obvious that &quot;the eggs are scattered&quot; Closer to young people’s daily experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A work that is also highly visible on the Internet is the artist Song Dong&#39;s &quot;You&quot;, which is very Cantonese from its name - &quot;无&quot; comes from Cantonese, pronounced mǎo, meaning nothing, This word was first seen in &quot;Guangdong Tongzhi&quot; compiled by Huang Zuo during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty. From the perspective of word creation, the word &quot;无&quot; is the provincial meaning of the word &quot;有&quot;. Song Dong, who was born and raised in Beijing, has a close connection with Guangdong. His works were included in the first Guangzhou Art Biennale as early as 1992. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Guangzhou Fei Art Museum invited Song Dong to hold a solo exhibition. He walked around the vegetable market next to the art museum for a long time and thought that the smoky-looking vegetable market should not be separated from the tall Class A office buildings and private art museums next door. Can you make an unbounded wall? So, he built a 106-meter wall made of old windows. It was made of glass and walls. Various exhibitions could be held inside. The name of the work was &quot;Wall without Borders&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The art museum invites residents from surrounding communities to put in small items that they are reluctant to throw away at home, including Teresa Teng’s audio tapes, thermos bottles with double happiness printed on them, and even BB cameras. During the launch, the museum held a long street banquet. Everyone gathered around the 106-meter wall and chatted while eating Poon Choi: &quot;Where is the boundary between life and art?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Have You&quot;, Song Dong continued his previous style. A rectangular fishing net is pulled out on the second floor of the art museum, and it is covered with about 200 old mirrors. They have different shapes, but they have a unified sense of age. On the back of the mirror are yellowed figure paintings, calendar scenery, and various block letters. words, or clean and old brown wooden boards. When you stand under the work and look up, you will see yourself in the mirror, caught in a fishing net, with age symbols on the left and right. This is where different eras, regions and yourself come together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Dong wrote: &quot;The title of &quot;You&quot; uses the local characters of Guangdong, expressing the juxtaposition of the words &#39;have&#39; and &#39;no&#39; to form the title. I have always believed that nothing is the ultimate The big being is the great nothing. The mirror is not only an indispensable object in life, but also a philosophical object for thinking and understanding. I have been asking &#39;what is a mirror&#39; for a long time, and I think &#39;everything is Mirror&#39;, the mirror divides the world into real and virtual, existence and non-existence. It also integrates real and virtual, existence and non-existence into one place. It is the critical interface between &#39;being&#39; and &#39;empty&#39;. I use a big net to catch The collected mirrors form a &#39;diaphragm&#39;, dividing the space into virtual and real worlds. These mirrors have seen different people and objects, and they are constantly refreshed and vacated. As the saying goes: everything is a mirror body and place. , catching all emptiness and nothingness in one sweep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This thinking text received another interpretation from the students. After they stared at the &quot;Egg Powder&quot; for a few minutes, the teacher asked: &quot;Do you want to go in and have a look? The original intention of this artwork is to hope that the audience can walk among it, interact with the work, feel the changes in the space, and have different emotional experiences.&quot; .

Driving 250 kilometers northeast from Hailar, the central city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, is Genhe, the county-level city where Aoxiang is located. It borders Mohe, the northernmost part of China, and is the &quot;China Cold Pole&quot; certified by &lt;span>;National Climate Center&lt;/span>; ”——The annual average temperature is minus 5.3 degrees Celsius, and the heating period is 9 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Genhe, the name that is more famous than &quot;China&#39;s Cold Pole&quot; is undoubtedly &quot;Ewenki&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki are one of the ethnic groups with a small population in China. According to statistics from the seventh census, there are 34,617 people in this ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, there were three tribes of the Ewenki people. Among them, the safari Yakuts are called the &quot;deer tribe&quot; because they raise reindeer. The Ewenki people in Aoxiang are descendants of the Shilu tribe, also known as the Shilu Ewenki people. Their population has always hovered between one and two hundred people. They are the smallest micro-group within the tribe and the only ethnic group that raises reindeer in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rudolph the Red-Nosed, who pulls Santa’s sleigh, is the star among the reindeer. This is an animal that lives in the tundra around the Arctic Circle. Its two towering antlers are more than one meter long and have many branches like tree branches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reindeer in Aoxiang are facing a survival crisis. Lao Ge judged that the reindeer that died this time had a high probability of suffering from a blood parasitic disease with a very high fatality rate. He was &quot;not surprised&quot; by this situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In 2003, Genhe implemented the &quot;ecological immigration&quot; policy. The Evenki people who originally lived in the deep forests put down their shotguns and went down the mountains to settle. Lao Ge suspected that the reindeer&#39;s illness may be related to the small animals that come with tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the Ewenki people are called &quot;China&#39;s last hunting nation.&quot; Today&#39;s Ewenki people are ending hunting and embracing a modern lifestyle. They also face the process of adaptation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for this micro-ethnic group, which has been maintained at a scale of a hundred people for a long time, it is also a choice that must be made in order to survive and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 18, 2023, tourists fed reindeer in the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I miss you very much in Aoluguya&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Ewenki originally means &quot;people who live in the mountains and forests.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, both humans and deer lived in the deep forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and reindeer had never been heard of contracting infectious diseases. &quot;It&#39;s hard for reindeer to work in the mountains.&quot; Lao Ge sighed, &quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do to make money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being a veterinarian, Lao Ge also has another identity - the operator of the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. By. On the way to see a doctor, his cell phone rang almost every ten minutes. Most of the calls were made by acquaintances who wanted to waive the 70 yuan ticket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors who visit the reindeer park for the first time are often surprised: the reindeer roam freely in the scenic area without fences, and people can freely have close contact with them. If you spend 20 yuan to buy a basket of fresh moss, you will soon be stared at by the reindeer&#39;s big round eyes, its round and soft nose will come over, and it will dig straight into the basket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff teaches tourists how to take very dynamic photos: lift a bamboo basket filled with moss above your head and run, and the herd of reindeer will follow obediently. However, most tourists were so frightened that they dropped their bamboo baskets on the ground when they heard the hoofbeats of the reindeer behind them. At this time, you can always hear the staff shouting from behind, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, don&#39;t be afraid, the reindeer will not hurt people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides the reindeer, Lao Ge himself is considered the second &quot;star&quot; in the reindeer park. &quot;. He is 51 years old, a mixed race of Ewenki and Russian, with curly silver hair, a high nose bridge, deep eye sockets, and bronze skin. It is said that he looked like the French movie star Alain Delon when he was young. Tourists who have done some planning in advance often take photos with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If reporters visit, the local propaganda department will most likely bring them to Lao Ge. He has a strong desire for expression and a vivid Northeastern dialect, which always makes reporters come home with a full load. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time, tourists can find him in the most luxurious hotel in the park. Choluozi is the traditional residence of the Ewenki people in the mountains and forests. More than ten pine trees are intertwined to form a cone shape, and a layer of birch bark is spread outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why the tuoluozi is said to be &quot;luxurious&quot; is because the birch bark is densely surrounded by a layer of roe deer skin. There are dozens of them. According to Lao Ge, the cost is &quot;worth seventy-eight dollars at least.&quot; Ten thousand&quot;. In the past, that was a treatment enjoyed only by &quot;old hunters&quot; (the term given to experienced hunters). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going west from Luyuan, less than 10 minutes’ drive by sightseeing bus, you will find the settlement of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2003, the Evenki hunters had just moved to this settlement. There were 62 bungalows with red roofs and white walls in the settlement. In 2008, in order to develop tourism, the Aoxiang government renovated the house and specially invited a Finnish construction company to design it. The exterior facade was covered with dark brown wooden boards and the sloping eaves were wider, aiming to create a &quot;Nordic style&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, except for a dozen families who still live here, most families have moved into residential communities in Genhe City. Their houses in Aoxiang have been converted into B&amp;Bs and specialty shops. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I miss you in Aoluguya&quot; - the now pervasive Internet celebrity street signs have also invaded Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the street sign is the most conspicuous house with a huge reindeer mural painted on the exterior wall. It is a B&amp;B run by Yang Lan, the granddaughter of Maria Suo, &quot;the last female chief in China&quot; . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maria Suo is the prototype of the protagonist in Chi Zijian&#39;s novel &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. She died on August 20, 2022, at the age of 101. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many tourists are attracted by the old man’s legendary experience and follow his footsteps. On a sightseeing bus, the tour guide told the tourists the story of Maria Soo adopting a dozen orphans. &quot;How come I didn&#39;t see any of them?&quot; the sightseeing bus driver muttered after hearing this fictional story. The title of &quot;the last female chief&quot; is somewhat of a packaging color. There is no chief among the Ewenki people, but Maria Suo is indeed the most respected elder among the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Can&#39;t you tell some true stories?&quot; However, for this driver, there is nothing to complain about. Driving a sightseeing bus in scenic spots gives him an extra 3,000 yuan in monthly income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to climate restrictions, Aoxiang’s tourist season is short. In previous years, Aoxiang’s attractions were only open from June 1st to October 8th. In 2023, due to the influence of the Zibo Barbecue Fever, the working season of the reindeer was advanced one month. At the end of April, before the snow had completely melted, the scenic spot opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1099&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Migration route map of the Ewenki people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The third settlement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the tourist season, Whenever he gets the chance, Lao Ge still likes to jump to the deer spot on the mountain. There was no cell phone signal there, and no one could find him. It was quiet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the 32 reindeer that come down the mountain to &quot;work&quot;, most of Laoge&#39;s reindeer are still herding deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After some hunters came down to settle down in the mountains, they still maintained &quot;deer spots&quot; where reindeer were grazed on the mountains. Officially, Deer Point is also called Hunters Point to distinguish it from the settlements at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 26, 2023, Lao Ge set off from Aoxiang, traveled more than 200 kilometers north to Alongshan Town, and then drove into the forest fire road from the only main street in the town. On the road, birch trees and larches are scattered at random, rose-red willows grow wildly on the roadside, and sables pass quickly in front of the car from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Walking another 60 kilometers along the fire road, you can reach his deer spot, a place that cannot be pinpointed on the map. Lao Ge hired four relatives to take turns guarding the more than 180 reindeer on the mountain. As soon as we got off the car, the air was filled with a strong scent of pine. Four or five hounds approached Lao Ge with their tails wagging, and the sound of deer bells could be heard in the nearby woods. This is the environment the Evenki people are most familiar with. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, the Ewenki were divided into three tribes: Solon, Tungus and Yakut, each engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting. In 1957, after ethnic identification, these three tribes were collectively called the Ewenki. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv Guangtian, an ethnology scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has verified that as early as 2000 BC, the ancestors of the Evenki people lived on the shores of Lake Transbaikal and Lake Baikal. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Shilu Ewenki people (hereinafter the Ewenki people are specifically referred to as the &quot;Shilu tribe&quot;) came to the Greater Khingan Mountains on the right bank of the Ergun River, the border river between China and Russia, and never left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People living in the mountains and forests&quot; began to descend from the mountains after the founding of New China. At that time, the Ewenki people were hunting on the right bank of the Ergun River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region approved the establishment of Qigan Ewenki National Township. Since then, allowing the Evenki people to settle has become a goal that the party committee and government hope to achieve. After the government built the wooden house (a typical Russian dwelling made of wood and mud), the Ewenki people had a place to settle for the first time. However, although they have a home at the foot of the mountain, except for the township head and the director of the supply and marketing cooperative who live there all year round, the rest of them live in a state of settlement and hunting. They hunt in the mountains for a long time and occasionally live at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, the Ewenki settlement moved eastward from Qigan to a place 17 kilometers north of Mangui Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi, who once served as deputy director of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Genhe City, is a researcher of Ewenki culture. He said that the location of the relocation was very particular: in order to resolve the conflict between hunting and settlement, the settlement was chosen to be close to the hunting grounds and suitable for reindeer living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is the original and real Aoxiang, so named because it is surrounded by the Aoluguya River. In the Ewenki language, &quot;Aoluguya&quot; means a place with lush poplar trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to distinguish it from Aoxiang after the relocation in 2003, the settlement chosen at that time was habitually called &quot;Old Aoxiang&quot;. For the Ewenki people, the period after the relocation was their &quot;golden years.&quot; Schools, grain depots, post offices, hospitals, cultural stations and banks were built where 126 Evenki people originally lived. In order to develop the economy, the township has also set up wood processing plants, hunting production teams and ethnic trading companies. Foreigners also came. At its peak, there were more than 500 people living in Lao Ao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi recalled that in Lao Ao Township, the Ewenki people were considered &quot;nobles&quot;. Maria Suo&#39;s family became the first 10,000-yuan household in the township in the 1980s. Many Ewenki families have bought cameras, bicycles, and &quot;several watches.&quot; It does not cost money to go to school and see a doctor, and students can also receive living allowances. &quot;All outsiders are willing to marry Ewenki people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, young Ewenki people had settled at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Kong Fanzhi, by the 1980s, 40 of the 71 Ewenki adults in Aoxiang had jobs, becoming the first generation of teachers, doctors, drivers, and waiters among the tribe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;However, nearly 40 years after moving to Lao Ao Township, the public facilities have begun to age, the government buildings have cracked, and the power grid and dams need to be repaired. The repair cost is estimated to be more than 10 million yuan, which is greatly exceeded. Root River&#39;s financial ability to pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, the State Council launched the Western Development Plan, with funds earmarked for ecological migration. Therefore, the leaders of Genhe City decided that instead of repairing in situ, it would be better to apply for &quot;ecological immigration&quot;, and the funds would also come from a source. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leader’s idea led to the third settlement in the history of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;At 8 a.m. on August 10, 2003, the first batch of relocated 11 households with 37 people and 260 reindeer took 12 Dongfeng extended vehicles and headed for the new rural address more than 200 kilometers away. ——Departs from a place only 4 kilometers away from Genhe city. Teams organized by towns along the way lined the road to see off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Genhe City Chronicle records that at 4 p.m., the convoy arrived at the new Aoxiang in the drizzle. &quot;The new township site had colorful flags flying, gongs and drums roaring, and two elderly yangko teams singing and dancing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten days before the move, Kong Fanzhi started busy receiving reporters. They recorded the last class of the school in Lao Ao Township, the &quot;minimum post office&quot; with only one employee, and the last bonfire before departure. Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Return to hometown after one day down the mountain&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This relocation attracted Xie Yuanyuan, a Ph.D. in sociology from Peking University. On September 18, 2003, she arrived in Aoxiang and began a one-year field investigation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What aroused her interest was the reversal of the hunters&#39; emotions. Before setting off, she noticed the report in &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, the title was &quot;&lt;/span>;China&#39;s last hunting nation&lt;span>;The Ewenki people returned home after just one day of going down the mountain. Township&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Reporters at&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Hunter&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;relocation times&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Visiting Aoxiang on the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; day, I found that the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;yard was surprisingly quiet&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, and &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;some houses were empty&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. Some hunters made a rough calculation: the annual income of a reindeer is about &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;200 Yuan &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; no &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; investment when raising stock in the mountains. After going down the mountain, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;we have to &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reindeer &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; in captivity &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; just the feed money, every day A reindeer costs thousands of dollars every year. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Originally, what the government promised was that the hunters would move, the reindeer would be kept in captivity, and someone would feed them. “The hunters would just hold the wine bottle and watch the reindeer smile.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reality is that there is no feed at all in the rows of deer pens blocked by brick-red barbed wire in the settlement. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;During the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, some reindeer were lost, injured, and some were not used to eating bean cakes and choked to death. A total of more than 90 reindeer were lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Li Mengchu, chairman of the Aoxiang People’s Congress, was the Minister of Armed Forces of Aoxiang at the time. He recalled that at that time, the township government mobilized cadres to go up the mountain to collect moss, mushrooms and willow twigs. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A reindeer can eat a sack of moss in a day&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, which is equivalent to what one person can harvest in a day. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A few days later, the hunters &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; took the deer out of the deer pen and led &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; back to the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;first &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reared them around Aoxiang, but &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;the moss in the mountains and forests around the city did not grow well&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Go north again&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and continue deep into the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Mountains&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, there are 14 deer spots scattered in the mountains and forests of Xinlao Ao Township. &lt;p>; span>;20 years later, when talking about this matter, a former deputy mayor of Aoxiang said bluntly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Writer Chi Zijian visited Aoxiang in 2004 and found that there was not a single reindeer in the deer pen, only a group of lazy goats wandering along the overgrown path. Go shopping. The butterfly effect caused by this situation was that the Ewenki people descended from the mountain and became the origin of the writing of &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;While reindeer were being raised in captivity&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; also put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, as early as 1988, with the promulgation of the Wildlife Protection Law, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; it was clear that &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; hunting was prohibited , killing national key protected wild animals&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;common prey of the Ewenki people, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;moose&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, black bear, roe deer, gray rat &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They are all on the list&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. In 1996, the Gun Management Law was promulgated, which imposed stricter regulations on civilian use of guns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xie Yuanyuan obtained a document clarifying the meaning of &quot;ecological migration&quot; of the Ewenki people from the then director of the Ethnic Affairs Bureau of Genhe City. She was attracted by a few &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; short sentences with strong tone: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1. If the mode of production does not change, settling down will become a sentence Empty words. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2. Without changing the mode of production, it will be difficult for various economies to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The material clearly expresses the point of view: to change the production method, reindeer must be kept in captivity so that hunters can put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This also makes the third settlement essentially different from the first two: in the past two settlements, the government did not restrict the Evenki people’s choices, but instead increased their travel options. An alternative to hunting. But this time, the goal of letting the Evenki people go down the mountain to settle down is more clear. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;We must change the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;safari &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; such &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &quot;production&quot; Way&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ecological immigration has accelerated the process of closing guns. Li Mengchu remembered that the Public Security Bureau confiscated the guns of the Ewenki hunters right after they moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gu Taozeng, a documentary director who filmed the &quot;Ewenki Trilogy&quot;, recorded&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;this process&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. Li Mengchu&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;is concerned about&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;that the Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;have hunted for generations to survive&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and their guns are gone. , which means a change in the tradition of hunting people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Changes inevitably bring confusion. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Two months after the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;More than a month later, the then Aoxiang Party Committee Secretary&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Liu Panchang&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s nose bone was hunted by Ewenki The people interrupted, and the township head Gu Xianglian, who was also an Ewenki, was sued by his own aunt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Xianglian’s aunt wrote to the then Secretary of the Hulunbuir Municipal Party Committee: “In the past, without subsidies or assistance, the hunters lived quite well. But now, in Genhe &quot;To subsidize life is just like begging for food.&quot; &quot;This is not trying to achieve a well-off life, it&#39;s just trying to make us eat chaff!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as it&#39;s time to go to work, a circle of people rush into Gu Xianglian&#39;s office. The long sofas on both sides of the room were filled with villagers, and the radiator by the window was also crowded with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancient fragrant lotus has nothing to do with it. She complained to Xie Yuanyuan: &quot;I have no selfish intentions at all. I don&#39;t have a house of my own, so I live in a hunter&#39;s business. It&#39;s worse than a hunter&#39;s house! If you were to be the mayor of the township, what would you do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are problems everywhere. In November, the temperature in Aoxiang reached subzero, the new house began to get damp, and black hair grew on the walls of the house. The floor made of wooden boards in Lao Aoxiang was replaced by milky white ceramic tiles. &lt;span>;The designer obviously doesn’t have much experience in rural life. As soon as you enter the house in winter, the snow stuck to the soles of your shoes melts quickly, and you may slip&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; accidentally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Making a living has become difficult&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the Ewenki people used to be respected in Lao Ao Township&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;It seems&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is gone too. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Their appearance is easily identifiable: high cheekbones and deep-set eye sockets. When Xie Yuanyuan and Ewenki women went shopping in a store in Genhe City, they would always see the clerk pointing out, &quot;Look, that&#39;s from Aoxiang.&quot; The restaurant owner also laughed at Xie Yuanyuan for their old-fashioned ways: they only served free side dishes and drank almost all the wine. Before the main dishes were served, I paid and left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan recorded the scene she saw in the winter of 2003: except for the hunters raising reindeer, there was almost nothing for others to do. The only way for pure hunters to amuse themselves is to drink, drinking low-quality liquor that costs 1.5 yuan per pound and is filled with mineral water bottles. &quot;There are three or five people, very quiet, not talking or laughing, just leaning on the sofa or leaning on the bed.&quot; Drinking like that. It feels like they want to get into a state of &#39;drunkness&#39;, the sooner the better.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Twenty years have passed, and Gu Xianglian, who was the township head at the time of the relocation, is now the deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Genhe Municipal People’s Congress. &quot;There is no need to talk about the past.&quot; On July 28, 2023, in her office, she quickly interrupted the reporter&#39;s question, &quot;Go to Aoxiang and see for yourself. I don&#39;t know how much everyone&#39;s living standards have improved. . That&#39;s a huge change.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1014&quot; height=&quot;758&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253539&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Ewenki hunter settlement in Aoxiang is full of Nordic style. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“Almost forgotten everything”&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The latest improvement in living standards &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; celebrates &quot;ecological migration&quot; &quot;20th anniversary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 12, 2023, at the celebration ceremony, 15 dark green high-power tractors were lined up, which were allocated to the mountain&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Deer point. A month ago, the township &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;had &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;replaced &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; each deer spot with 5,000-watt solar energy storage panels. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;When fully charged &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , the solar panel &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; can provide &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;8 kWh of electricity. This means that you can use a refrigerator, TV, rice cooker, and even hot pot at the same time on the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summer travel season has also met expectations, ushering in a major outbreak three years after the epidemic. The price of accommodation in the two hotels in the scenic area is about 1,000 yuan per night. The price of a B&amp;B with simple facilities not far from the scenic spot starts at 500 yuan per night, and it must be booked at least a week in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Genhe, a resource-based city built for forestry, has now positioned the cultural and tourism industry as the &quot;city-building industry&quot; in the government work report, and &quot;Aolugu Ya&quot; has become a key focus The “brand” created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The living standards of hunters have improved a lot in recent years, and the original oppositional emotions have almost been forgotten.” Kong Fanzhi said when talking about the development of Aoxiang in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Change cannot occur without reindeer. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, three years after the relocation, Li Mengchu was appointed deputy mayor of Aoxiang. How to allow the Ewenki hunters to make a living under the mountains became a difficult problem that he had to face as soon as he took office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after taking office, he organized the first Reindeer King Competition, hoping to build the reputation of the reindeer. According to the plan, the antlers of the top three deer kings will be auctioned on site. Worried that no one would bid, Li Mengchu specially arranged a few &quot;trustees&quot; in the auditorium. Unexpectedly, the person in charge of a company auctioned off all the top three antlers, and the most expensive pair was auctioned for 7,000 yuan. At that time, an adult reindeer was worth only 5,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government also took over the entire township’s deer antler business. Deer antlers are deer antlers that have not yet been boned. In traditional Chinese medicine, they are considered to have nourishing properties. Starting in 2005, Li Mengchu led the township cadres to various deer spots to cut the antlers, which would be processed by the township, packaged and sold. &quot;After the sales are completed, the hunters will be given money, and they will be happy with every penny they receive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a few years of unified sales, hunters no longer need government support. After the rise of tourism in Aoxiang, deer antlers are sold by the same gram as ginseng, with prices ranging from 8 to 20 yuan per gram depending on the quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reindeer is the spirit of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the treasure of the Ewenki people.&quot; Lao Ge often repeated this sentence when interviewed by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one can say how the tourism industry in Qing Ao Township became so popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the Ewenki people came down from the mountain, the Aoxiang government made plans for tourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xie Yuanyuan was investigating in Aoxiang, the government had built a &quot;folk custom village&quot;. At first, there were only two buildings: a tent and a tuoluozi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government arranged for Asuo, a young male hunter, to live in a tent and raise 6 reindeer nearby. As long as he stays there, Asuo can receive a monthly salary of 100 yuan. However, Asuo&#39;s situation seemed awkward: he stayed there alone, drinking, dazed, and being sucked by mosquitoes. Later, the township leaders said that the &quot;Folk Custom Village&quot; was located in a remote location and lacked &quot;life&quot;, so Asuo&#39;s &quot;work&quot; was stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, hunters gradually took over the business of the folk village, but they were all in a slump. In 2007, with the support of the township government, Lao Ge invested more than 100,000 yuan, and the township government signed a ten-year contract to take over the business of the reindeer park. &quot;I never dreamed of it, but it started slowly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Mengchu’s impression, around 2008, Hulunbuir’s tourism business suddenly became popular. At that time, tourists drove around Genhe and couldn&#39;t find a place to stay. &quot;They were all confused at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge’s specific feelings about Aoxiang’s tourism industry “taking off” come from the increasing number of reporters visiting. Several groups of reporters from different CCTV channels came. The camera crew of Japan&#39;s NHK&#39;s &quot;China Railway Journey&quot; also came, as well as teams from Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea. Reporters from various countries came to see it all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also took reindeer to Changsha to record the variety show &quot;Happy Camp&quot;. Lao Ge clearly remembers the broadcast time of the March 5, 2011 issue. He chartered a truck, hired two drivers, and took the reindeer with him, and it took him 85 hours to reach Changsha. Finally, the Ewenki clip appeared on the show for 5 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge was originally worried that the reindeer would be frightened after coming on stage and run wild all over the place. The result was good, the deer was calm and even peed on the stage. On the contrary, he himself was very nervous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This deer was later named &quot;Little Hunan&quot; by Lao Ge. The day after returning to Aoxiang, &quot;Little Hunan&quot; disappeared. Half a month later, a forestry worker 40 kilometers away discovered it. Its mouth and body were covered with hunter&#39;s nooses. &quot;Little Hunan&quot; did not survive that autumn and passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, a Hunan tourist made a special trip to the reindeer park and bought the antlers of &quot;Little Hunan&quot; for 2,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height= &quot;514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 28, 2023, tourists watched birch bark boats at the Aoxiang Museum in Genhe City, Inner Mongolia. This was the most commonly used means of transportation by the Ewenki people half a century ago. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;No longer follow the order of the past&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In 2022, Lao Ge’s reindeer park began to be “regularized”, and the Aoluguya Tourism Development Company controlled by the Genhe Municipal Finance Bureau signed a three-year contract with him. Tickets are 70 yuan each, and he takes a 10% commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He is a busy man!&quot; Speaking of Lao Ge, He Xie had not seen him for some days, let alone drank with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xie, the eldest son of Maria Suo, the &quot;last female chief&quot;, is known as Boss He. He always likes to wear a military green jacket and sits on a bench outside his home with his wife Zhuoye. He rarely speaks, holding a 3 yuan and 5 bottle of Hailar beer in his hand, and the volume of the radio on the window sill is turned to the maximum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was young, he enlisted in the army and served as a firefighter. After changing his job, he was assigned to work as a judicial assistant in the township government. At that time, he had thick, long black hair with natural curls, like a rock star. Now, he is 56 years old, his hair is gray, his face is covered with wrinkles, his eyes are squeezed to only a slit, and almost all his teeth are missing. Aging has completely overcome him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distance from the bedroom to the bench is less than ten meters, which is the distance Zhuoye moves every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty-six years ago, He Xie was cleaning a gun at home, and the gun went off. The bullet penetrated the thin wall panel and entered Zhuoye&#39;s head. It has not been removed yet. The accident left her with no mobility in her right leg. After that, she stopped going out and became increasingly fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a curious tourist passes by the door and asks the couple about their Ewenki story, He Xie always walks slowly into the house and takes down two large photo albums from the top of the refrigerator - there is no smartphone yet. In the popular era, visiting reporters and photographers would always mail them to him after developing their photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the photo, they are skiing, singing, and drying dried meat in the forest. If you want to eat meat, pick up your gun and go out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to hunting, the energetic young hunter will briefly return - He Xie is the &quot;old hunter&quot; among the tribe who never misses. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Things in my memories are long enough. Most of the Evenki hunters in the photo have passed away, and the cause of death is somewhat related to alcohol. Of Maria So&#39;s seven children, only He Xie and his sister Dekesa remain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If I hadn&#39;t looked at him, he would have been gone.&quot; Zhuoye said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you don&#39;t drink, what else can you do?&quot; He Xie pushed back. His memories seemed to linger forever in the mountains and forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Lan, a researcher at the Institute of Ethnology of the Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences, has been following the Ewenki people for more than 30 years, and has become old friends with He Xie&#39;s family. Sometimes, Bai Lan would receive a voice message from Zhuo Ye, lamenting that there used to be people in front of her house, but now, they are the only ones left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are all busy now, so how can we have time to drink with him.&quot; In Bai Lan&#39;s view, He Gong&#39;s arrogance as &quot;Boss He&quot; disappeared. He Xie loves to make money, and as soon as he has some money, he calls friends and invites people to drink. But today&#39;s Aoxiang no longer follows the order of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 23, 2023, He Xie was in front of the graves of his mother Maria So and his father Rajmi He. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young Evenki people have their own way of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;36-year-old Gu Musen has 300,000 fans on the short video platform. In 2022, he founded his own media company, signed up young people in the countryside to be &quot;artists&quot;, and attracted tourists by relying on the fans he accumulated on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people who went to big cities to make a living have also returned. After graduating from college, Jue Le originally worked as an administrator in a hospital in Beijing, bought a house, got married, and had children in Beijing. But he felt that the work in the hospital was boring, and staying in the cubicle &quot;was like turning on the mechanical mode.&quot; In 2016, Juele returned to Genhe and ran a tourist spot not far from Aoxiang. &quot;It was very open, just like playing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doing tourism business in Aoxiang can indeed bring considerable income. Juele estimates that he will earn more than 100,000 yuan from tourism in the summer of 2023, which will be enough to support his family throughout the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Lan gave He Xie some advice. The couple was humorous in their dealings with others, and He Xie played the harmonica well. If they could clean up their house and start a small business in the tourism industry, they could make money. He Xie was not willing to do it and thought it was &quot;boring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xie still maintains a rough drinking method: drink vigorously for a few days to get stronger, then sleep for a few days and nights, wake up, then get up and continue drinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Lie, who was once envied by others, has become a person who is left behind and &quot;has not made progress&quot; in the eyes of his relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of July 2023, He Xie returned to Lao Ao Township. Not long after the Ewenki people moved out, the land was acquired by a real estate businessman in Daqing with plans to develop an international hunting ground. As a result, the plan was aborted, the hunting ground was not built, and all the old wooden carving houses were demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old Aoxiang became a deserted land, and the weeds on the roadside grew as tall as half a person. He Xie walked around Lao Aoxiang with his hands behind his back, but he didn&#39;t recognize where his house was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A fellow traveler asked him if he would be willing to come back to raise deer again. He thought about it seriously. This place had been uninhabited for a long time, and there were more wolves and lynxes nearby. &quot;It might not be appropriate to come back again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Romanticism&quot; and &quot;Realism&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As National Day approaches, a brown bear has become big news in Aoxiang . At around 5 o&#39;clock in the morning on September 26, 2023, Lao Ge received a call that a bear had entered the reindeer park - he entered through the ticket gate, and he was familiar with the road. This is the third time it has visited the deer park in half a month. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge joked, &quot;If it comes again, then we will have to deal with it.&quot; When it comes to the beasts that appear more and more frequently, the deer herder on the mountain doesn&#39;t sound so relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a brown bear visited Yang Lan’s deer spot and killed 7 reindeer in one night. In another household, after the arrival of the wolves, only 8 of the more than 30 reindeer were left. In the year when the beasts were most serious, the entire Aoxiang lost more than 200 reindeer, and the total number of reindeer was more than 1,300. In other words, one out of every six reindeer died due to beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Really annoyed, Yang Lan&#39;s father complained to her that if the guns could be returned to the hunters for a week, the problem of animal harm could be solved. Otherwise, in a few years, deer farmers will face personal danger even if they survive in the mountains. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the speaker and the listener know that this is just angry talk. They are all nationally protected animals, who would dare to fight them? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki people are also gradually losing their ability to survive in the mountains and forests, which makes Bai Lan feel a little anxious. How to choose between modernity and tradition? &quot;Everything has given Ewenki an external intervention, so this culture will inevitably have its flaws.&quot; Bai Lan put forward this point of view in an interview with the media at the beginning of the ecological migration in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She felt that if hunters could decide their own development model, obtain certain resource management and use rights in ethnic areas, and be able to engage in moderate logging and hunting, the situation might be different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“That’s the view of literati.” In 2003, Kong Fanzhi had a remote debate with Bai Lan. When he mentioned it again now, he still couldn&#39;t agree with Bai Lan&#39;s point of view. &quot;We can&#39;t just let the Ewenki people live in Zuoluozi in order to protect their traditional culture, right? Who doesn&#39;t want to live a modern life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xie Yuanyuan&#39;s view, these two attitudes come from completely different things. value judgement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the research, she and Maria Saw lived in Deer Point for more than half a month. Get up at around five o&#39;clock in the morning and work, such as beating legba, milking deer, picking wild fruits, cooking leather, and sewing leather goods... The days are simple and repetitive, and no one thinks that life needs any changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Ewenki people of different ages have different pursuits. When younger hunters see the broader world, they will naturally feel that their nation&#39;s customs are backward and want to make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan also wrote at the end of her doctoral thesis that traditional hunters who are attached to forest life do not have the right to speak and cannot easily sacrifice things that are more valuable and meaningful to the long-term development of mankind.&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, doctoral student Xie Yuanyuan became a researcher at the National Institute of Strategic Studies of Tsinghua University. Today, in her opinion, Bai Lan’s views are “romantic”, while Kong Fanzhi represents the “realist”.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It is inevitable for social development for micro groups to enter modernization. Now Xie Yuanyuan feels that from the perspective of national governance, this is a sacrifice that must be made for the development of the nation. Faced with reality, rational The attitude is to remember those people and give them and their descendants a certain amount of compensation. &quot;This is the reality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, since the Ewenki first settled and came into contact with the outside world, Some traditions are slowly changing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki language has no written characters and can only be passed down orally from generation to generation. Even people as old as He Xie and Lao Ge cannot speak the Evenki language as well as Half of them are old people. The birch bark boat, the most commonly used means of transportation by the Ewenki people half a century ago, has long since drifted into the museum from the rivers of the Greater Khingan Mountains. When Lao Ge was young, he began to tie several rubber tires together to use as a boat. , much simpler than making a birch bark boat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Ewenki hunters first settled in 1957, the young people who are now returning home to raise deer and run the tourism industry are already the third generation since the settlement. .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What about the next generation? &quot;&amp;nbsp;Bai Lan feels that the third generation who grew up in the mountains and forests have some affection for reindeer. The fourth generation of children who are not yet adults have lived on the cement floor since they were young. &quot;What will reindeer be in the future? Maybe I don’t care anymore.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi believes that the reindeer will not disappear in Aoxiang. It is now the most important symbol of the Ewenki people and the reason why tourists rush to Aoxiang. “Others Nothing more to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Reference books:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Kong Fanzhi &quot;The Ancient Ewenki of Aolulu&quot; 》&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Xie Yuanyuan &quot;Ecological Migration Policy and Local Government Practice: Taking Aoluguya Ewenki Ecological Migration as an Example&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ;&quot;>;Gu Tao&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Aoluguya·Aoluguya&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:25:13 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方通报“北极鲶鱼”事件：深圳市原交通局货运管理分局局长钟庚赐被开除党籍]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258327]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 11:18:38&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, the Shenzhen Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision investigated Zhong Gengci, the former director of the Freight Management Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Transportation Bureau, for serious violations of discipline and law.
