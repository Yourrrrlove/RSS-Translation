According to the plan, she was going to visit the Jewish Museum of Tel Aviv University and then go to the ancient city of Jaffa. In Rehovot, Chinese chef Zhang Feng is getting ready for work. This is the busiest time of the week for Chinese restaurant business. Many Israelis choose this day to go out to eat and relax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an area near the Gaza Strip, 27-year-old female music fan Millet Ben Haim and her friends were partying all night at a music festival. At this moment, she and her friends were looking forward to for several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the young Israeli scholar Haim Ketzman stayed at his home in Holit, which is only 1.5 kilometers away from the Gaza Strip, as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A sudden attack suddenly changed the course of their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of them witnessed the white tracks of rockets streaking across the sky, some heard gunshots from all directions in the wilderness, and some encountered Hamas armed forces head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Crisis, from South to North&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, young music fans sang and danced at the &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; Music Festival In full swing. This music festival originated in Brazil and has a history of 23 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters saw from the timetable announced by the organizer that the music festival will start at 23:00 on October 6th and continue until the afternoon of the 7th. This means fans can head out for an &quot;all-night dance party.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Music fans are looking forward to this long-awaited music festival, and Milit is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The music festival is held near Rem Kibbutz, which is about 1.25 hours&#39; drive from Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s largest city. Many music fans drive here. At the same time, it was only a few kilometers away from the Gaza Strip, which foreshadowed the subsequent tragedy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn, danger begins to fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, and many armed personnel used homemade simple gliders to infiltrate into the disputed area from the Gaza Strip isolation area. Videos and pictures that appeared on social media showed that Hamas militants also entered Israeli-controlled areas in pickup trucks and motorcycles. Those along the Palestinian-Israeli separation zone bear the brunt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Around 6:31 in the morning, the music stopped and the siren sounded.&quot; Millit recorded the moment with a video on social media. &quot;More and more rockets were flying into the sky and we realized we had to leave immediately,&quot; she wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A video circulating on social media showed dozens of young people running in panic in an open field, surrounded by abandoned cars and followed by intensive gunfire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along the flight route of the rockets, air defense sirens continued to sound in many places in Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the central city of Rehovot, Chinese chef Zhang Feng was also woken up by a &quot;sound&quot; at around 6 a.m. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is between the Gaza Strip and Tel Aviv. Zhang Feng saw &quot;wave after wave&quot; of rockets passing over the city and heading north, &quot;many of which were intercepted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the attack began, Zhang Feng and his colleagues squeezed into the small bomb shelter again and again, listening to the sound of air defense sirens, flying artillery shells, and explosions after being intercepted. The first wave of attacks lasted for two or three hours. After more than two years in Israel, Zhang Feng felt that &quot;this was the most powerful one.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Feng works in a restaurant in Rehovot. On the morning of the 7th, he and his colleagues received a holiday notice, which surprised them. According to him, every Saturday, many Israelis take their families out to eat, which is often the busiest time for restaurant business. Although they have experienced air raid warnings many times before, they will still go to work normally after the danger is lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We rarely had holidays in the past. The fact that we can have a holiday this time shows that the situation is very serious.” Zhang Feng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the northern city of Jerusalem, Liu Zihui and her companions set off from the hotel by car at around 9 o&#39;clock. Taking advantage of the National Day holiday, she embarked on an &quot;in-depth cultural tour&quot;. According to the original plan, they would arrive in Tel Aviv on the morning of the 7th, stay one night and then return home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, not long after setting off from Jerusalem, Liu Zihui and his party heard an air raid siren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The driver stopped immediately and the tour guide took us to hide in the concert hall on the roadside.&quot; Liu Zihui heard from the staff of the concert hall that they also received a short notice to cancel the performance. After the alarm was lifted, the staff also made a special trip to apologize, saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry for causing you such a bad experience during your trip.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For safety reasons, the originally planned trip was canceled and the tour guide took everyone directly to the hotel. Because the reserved room was not ready yet, the group of people waited in the hotel lobby, and lunch was ordered and delivered from a nearby Chinese restaurant. Liu Zihui&#39;s room is on the 10th floor, and &quot;helicopters flying over&quot; can be seen directly outside the window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 7 p.m., air raid sirens sounded several more times in Tel Aviv. Liu Zihui said that everyone had to eat dinner in the hotel&#39;s safe room. It didn&#39;t become calm until after 9 p.m. &quot;My companions and I slept in the same clothes, and we didn&#39;t dare to take a shower or pack our things until three o&#39;clock in the morning.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Evacuation, crowds flocked to the airport&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the crisis occurred, Chinese tourist Amy was taking a bus to the center of the Israeli vortex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amy loves traveling and has always been curious about the religious Middle Eastern countries. In previous years, she has been to Egypt and Turkey, and the destinations of this trip are Jordan and Israel. Amy and her husband plan to enter Israel from Jordan so that the two countries can play together and &quot;it is also very convenient to apply for a visa on arrival.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Amy and her husband, there was also a young Arab-American carpooling together. According to the plan, the group was going to take the border crossing in central Jordan, but after the raid, the crossing was temporarily closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When the driver said he couldn’t go, we couldn’t believe it and insisted on going over to find out, but there were also police stopping us on the road. When we saw the bloody scene displayed by the driver, the three of us were shocked. &quot;Amy said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for a long time, and Amy and her group didn’t take it seriously at first. As more and more news of the conflict came in, they decided to abandon their original plan and proceed via the northern border crossing instead. &quot;Time was very tight, and we couldn&#39;t think too much. Coupled with the language barrier, the driver said no matter what, so we went along,&quot; Amy said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The northern Jordanian border crossing is relatively remote and sparsely populated. Amy and her husband wanted to find someone to carpool with and asked multiple transit passengers, but they were all rejected. When Amy was about to call the insurance company for help, they &quot;miraculously&quot; hailed a taxi on a street farther away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, people at the border crossing were saying that it was impossible to fly today, and we were worried that the flight would be cancelled. In addition, it was the Sabbath and there were few people going to work, so we were also worried that we would not be able to get to the airport on time.&quot; Go to On the way to the airport, Amy and her husband repeatedly called the airline to confirm whether the plane was taking off normally. At the same time, they had to call the insurance company to inquire about the claim settlement. &quot;They were on tenterhooks all the way.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They arrived at the airport at 3:30 pm and saw many passengers waiting in line. &quot;Thankfully, I checked in early. If I missed my flight, it would be more difficult to return home in the future,&quot; Amy said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amy’s worries are not unfounded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the raid, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines canceled flights from New York to Israel scheduled for the 7th and 8th. Lufthansa also announced on the 7th that it would significantly cancel flights to Tel Aviv. In addition, the Feichangzhun App shows that the recent round-trip flights from Shanghai and Shenzhen in China to Tel Aviv in Israel have also been cancelled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Amy&#39;s &quot;multiple countries in one day&quot;, Liu Zihui took a flight home the day after the attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early in the morning on the 8th, Liu Zihui packed her luggage. According to the plan, they will fly from Ben Gurion International Airport to the capital Beijing. After arriving at the airport, Liu Zihui found that although there were many people, they were in good order. During the exchange, Liu Zihui discovered that some people arrived on the first day because they were afraid that the airport would be closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The big flight screen was all red, leaving only sporadic green. &quot;A large number of flights have been cancelled, and only a few are flying normally.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It wasn&#39;t until the plane took off that Liu Zihui&#39;s hanging heart fell to the ground, and she fell into a deep sleep for the rest of the journey. At 5:28 a.m. on October 9, the plane landed at Beijing Capital International Airport, and warm applause erupted in the cabin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I saw the bright lights on the ground in Beijing through the port window, and I felt a little excited. I have landed countless times, and I have never been as excited as today.&quot; Liu Zihui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Unfortunate news&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Not everyone can evacuate as smoothly as Amy and Liu Zihui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 9, staff of Jiangsu Zhonglan Overseas Employment Company, which engages in overseas labor dispatch business, told Southern Weekend reporters that as of 11 a.m. that day, the company knew that three people were missing in Israel, and the others were missing. The situation is still being updated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 10, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant embassies and consulates abroad have issued safety reminders in response to the current situation in Israel and Palestine, advising Chinese citizens not to travel to Israel and Palestine for the time being. Local Chinese citizens and institutions remain highly vigilant, strengthen safety precautions, prepare for emergencies and take shelter on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Millit experienced a &quot;near escape&quot; while attending the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Milliet’s account on social platforms, she and her friends initially fled in a car. When they crossed a main road, they encountered a double attack from the attackers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Someone was screaming and attackers were shooting at people who were going there, so I turned around as fast as I could. Two minutes later, I saw there were more attackers going in the other direction,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Millet and her friends escaped in the wilderness. After about three hours, weak and frightened, they hid in the bushes and covered themselves with leaves. During this period, they tried to call the police, but the police did not respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Millet&#39;s experience has attracted the attention of many media, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; quoted her experience in a report on October 8. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the attack, the organizers of the &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; music festival issued a bilingual announcement in Hebrew and English to search for missing persons. Comment sections on social platforms are crowded with anxious people. They kept leaving messages asking about their missing relatives and friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are shocked and pained.&quot; The organizer &quot;New Star Tribe&quot; said in the announcement that it is making every effort to assist the security forces in searching for missing persons in the area. The organization also provides an online missing person statistics form, where family members can upload their details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We pray that good news will come to you and me soon,&quot; the announcement said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also close to the border with the Gaza Strip, the young Israeli scholar Haim Ketzman died in his home in Holit. On October 8, Katzman’s mother announced the news on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kettsman is a young scholar engaged in Israel studies. His resume is still hanging on the official website of the University of Washington. It can be seen from this that he studied for bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees at the Open University of Israel, Ben-Gurion University, and the University of Washington. His research interests include Israeli religion and politics. Katzman’s mother, Hannah, works for an Israeli NGO. After Katzman was killed, the organization also publicly mourned on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the information released by Ketzman’s mother, it can be seen that at first she mistakenly believed that Ketzman had been “kidnapped”. For this reason, she also posted missing person information on social platforms. When the bad news came, the missing person information was corrected, &quot;He died at home.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Avital Alajem, Katzman’s neighbor and friend, was interviewed by CNN on October 9. She said Ketzman hid in the closet with her when Hamas militants broke in and shot her. She herself was not injured in the attack and &quot;Katzman saved my life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kettsman received the 2019 &quot;Kimmerlin Best Graduate Thesis Award&quot; from the Israel Studies Association. The award honors the memory of Baruch Kimmerling, an Israeli public intellectual and sociologist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winning essay, Ketzman had this speech: Dedicated to all forms of life between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ketzmann’s friend Marwa Maziad wrote in her eulogy, “He truly believed that all life forms were equal and beautiful, including the plants in his care. Israel /Palestine, Arab-Muslim/Jewish, may his soul rest in peace.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Zihui, Zhang Feng, and Amy are pseudonyms, Southern Weekend interns Xu Ziyi, Bao Jingyue, and Zhai Huan also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[用利息生活小组火了，但攒钱，能不能攒到]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258341]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/60fb01dc9ced91e2ce8a37e4e3964ea2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/10/60fb01dc9ced91e2ce8a37e4e3964ea2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253561&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Young people who were once considered the most individualistic, advocating instant gratification, and embracing &quot;consumerism&quot; have begun to quietly save money and clock in. I don&#39;t know when. A saving trend is taking over social media. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;How hard can young people of this generation work to save money? It can be said that only you can’t think of it, but there is nothing young people can’t do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The new hobby of contemporary people: not consuming, but saving money like crazy&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;In Between going to work and making progress, this generation of young people choose incense; between buying bags and getting drunk, they are more likely to choose to buy lottery tickets; between ideals and reasons, financial management is the favorite of young people - the main thing is One saves money and makes money! &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Douban&#39;s &quot;Living with Interest: Savings Group&quot; now has more than 100,000 members in the group, &quot;Living with Interest: Investment and Financial Management&quot; group , the number of team members exceeds 600,000. Not to mention the &quot;Stingy Women&#39;s Association&quot; and the &quot;Stingy Men&#39;s Association&quot;, with a total of millions of people joining the groups. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to save money, some people choose to keep accounts and plan carefully, some choose to live with interest, manage finances and buy funds, and some choose to do both their main business and side business, and become a slash youth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When using the accounting APP, sorting out personal bills regularly is just an entry-level step. Learn from the collective wisdom of various money-saving groups and discover various wool-gathering artifacts, shopping red envelopes, Membership discounts, point deductions, live group buying, multi-platform price comparisons, and resolutely not letting go of any hidden benefits are the new life wisdom that young people get. For example, there are young people who squat after midnight every day to grab expired food and leftovers. boxes to reduce the cost of food expenses. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;These are the evolved actions of young people, and students at higher levels have already started saving money by playing special forces. Compare banks across the country to see whose interest rates are better. Higher, choose to travel thousands of miles to go. Some media reported that after bank interest rates were lowered this year, some young people traveled 2,000 kilometers a day and spent 330 yuan on fares just to earn an extra 1,800 yuan in interest. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people feel that this is too unfair to themselves. The reason why young people are happy to live in peace with the &quot;hard life&quot; is that there is a high probability that saving money will snowball and see themselves The small treasury is getting fuller day by day, and the sense of accomplishment can, to a certain extent, make people forget the hardships in the early days. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As the Japanese writer Yataro Matsuura once wrote in &quot;Getting Rich Slowly: Money and Work Rules to Make Your Life Richer&quot;: &quot;It is easier to save money than to spend it. After all, there are many ways to spend money, but there is only one way to save money, and that is to &#39;spend less&#39;.&quot; Because the path is single and clear, as long as the goal is firm enough and you continue in the established direction, you will always succeed. Realization, and therefore, attracts more and more young people to join the game. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Rejecting the trap of consumerism, young people have truly become sober in the world. I am no longer obsessed with following trends and buying the latest electronic products; I no longer order takeout frequently, but choose to go to the market with the aunts to buy food and bring my own meals; I no longer have to take a taxi every time I walk, but can walk. Walk, take the subway and never take a taxi. The money saved at every step is like a trickle, which eventually converges into a stream or a river. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/db7bc1d8642781493c9860d7666c2e84.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/db7bc1d8642781493c9860d7666c2e84.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253558 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Saving money, can you save money&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So when it comes to saving money, to what extent do young people hope to save money? A report shows that more than 53.7% of 30-year-olds believe that saving 100,000 yuan can be regarded as having a certain basis for savings. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, the cold reality is that a survey by China Business News shows: with a deposit of more than 100,000 yuan, you have already surpassed 53.7% of your peers. More than half of young people have less than 100,000 in savings, and it is a reality that they are &quot;powerless&quot;. Young people who are trying their best to save money find that money is like fine sand. The tighter you hold it, the more it will be lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The road to financial freedom is full of thorns. However, the will of young people is gradually firming up, and they are no longer attracted by the lavish spending of consumerism. Instead, they do not want to buy and save everything, and everything is compromised for the enrichment of their small coffers. What social trends does it reflect that young people are working hard to save money? Some people&#39;s ambition to save money is to retire early and implement a FIRE plan (Financial Independence, Retire Early); others are saving money for more security and more confidence to cope with the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the greater the balance, the greater the sense of security. Money means having enough protection against unknown risks. It can help young people live without panic and ask for help less when encountering problems. In the final analysis, it is essentially due to the inherent risk aversion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As Ulrich Beck said in &quot;Risk Society&quot;, life risks are always present, and individuals are forced to face the individualization process, which is constructed in the early modernization stage. The security system can no longer provide protection for individuals, and individualization has therefore entered a new stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Increased social mobility, the increasingly blurred boundaries between unemployment and employment, the disintegration of clan-based family relationships, work and intimate relationships, all of which are unavoidable issues for this generation of young people. Making young people aware of risks also inspires their desire to cling to something stable when the wave of risks strikes, so as to seek peace and tranquility in their own years. But before the dawn of dawn, money becomes the coordinate axis of reality, and saving money is the magic weapon for young people to resist risks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If you think that young people save money without spending it, you are totally wrong. Different from the older generation who simply save money, young people focus on saving money and spending money when they should. In this Houlang’s value perception, saving money is to spend money better, to spend money wisely, and to pursue a higher sense of value and cost-effectiveness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bill Gates once said: &quot;It is as difficult to spend a sum of money wisely as to earn it.&quot; Therefore, if you feel it is worthwhile, travel to see the world and learn New skills and new experiences are worth saving money to achieve. However, if you feel that it is not worth it, such as a takeaway meal that has increased in price, or expensive ugly clothes in the mall, then you are not willing to pay extra for it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Young people who often surf the Internet have given various &quot;painless money saving&quot; methods a new title, naming them &quot;Princess Money Saving Method&quot; &quot;365-day money saving method&quot; &quot;Muyu money saving method&quot;...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even in order to increase the sense of ritual of saving money, when achieving the goal, you will appropriately increase yourself Rewards, such as saving 50 yuan a day and saving up money for a concert ticket in three months, will not affect your normal living standards, but at the same time, you can satisfy your hobbies and interests, just like making a coin-operated wish, in the wilderness of life Here, brave people are at the forefront, enjoying the world first and creating their own unique style and lifestyle. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bulk up your wallet and enrich your life. Are you in love with this young generation’s view on saving money? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[主持人实名举报，法院12368热线能不能外包？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258377]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 11:13:55&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Host Zhang Zequn.

He said in multiple updates that the court&#39;s 12368 litigation service hotline was outsourced, and &quot;the staff did not know what a collegiate bench was, and there was dereliction of duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Immediately, Zhang Zequn’s report became a hot search topic, attracting the attention of netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that outsourcing of the court’s 12368 hotline is relatively common. According to a cursory search, dozens of courts at the provincial, municipal, and county levels across the country , there is a phenomenon of public bidding for hotline outsourcing services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some netizens raised questions about the functions, responsibilities and positioning of the 12368 hotline.

Can it be outsourced? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In order to meet the multi-level and diverse judicial needs of the people, the People&#39;s Court has established a 12368 litigation service hotline and vigorously promoted the &#39;one-stop service&#39; work.&quot; Supreme Court Liu Xuemei, deputy director of the filing division of the People&#39;s Court, once told the media that as of the end of 2022, all four levels of courts across the country had opened a 12368 litigation service hotline, helping to resolve an average of 59,000 claims every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;As of the end of 2022, all four levels of courts across the country have opened litigation service hotlines, and an average of 59,000 claims have been resolved every day.

Judicial information public welfare service number common to the national court system. Beijing is the first pilot area for the &quot;12368&quot; judicial service hotline, which was officially opened on January 7, 2009. The &quot;Beijing Court 12368 Hotline&quot; has set up a main platform in the Beijing High Court, and has set up sub-platforms in all middle and grassroots courts. Six courts, namely Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai and Daxing, have set up direct dial lines and do not need to be forwarded through the Municipal High Court&#39;s main platform; calls from other court sub-platforms will be uniformly answered and accepted by the Municipal High Court&#39;s main platform, and will be forwarded according to the situation of the call. The case shall be handled by the lower court on separate platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the &quot;Rule of Law Daily&quot; report in 2021, the 12368 direct sub-platform of Xicheng Court consists of 5 lines, and staff will receive more than 200 calls every day , looking for judges, investigating cases, answering questions, receiving opinions, making demands, etc. According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing High Court, if parties call the 12368 hotline to ask for simple matters such as checking the progress of the case, submitting applications and materials, and procedural litigation consultation, the hotline will &quot;answer the lawsuit&quot; as soon as possible and give a direct reply; If the exercise of judicial power or matters closely related to the case require a response from the judge, the hotline will issue a work order to the judge, who will handle it in a timely manner within the specified time limit to ensure that the contact rate of the judge reaches 100%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Zequn reported to the Chaoyang Court 12368 hotline. On October 8 and 9, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters called the hotline several times to inquire about the &quot;collegial panel&quot; and hotline outsourcing. On one occasion, the operator responded that he could ask the judge about the legal terms and the circumstances in which they appeared, and he would give a reply within two days. Another time, the operator replied that 12368 is mainly responsible for registering complaint information and cannot directly handle complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another call occurred at around 8 pm. The artificial intelligence voice assistant provided a self-service intelligent voice query service. When the keyword &quot;Collegial Court&quot; was mentioned , gave a more detailed answer. However, artificial intelligence voice assistants may have unclear or inaccurate hearing from time to time, and if there is a semantic recognition error, they will continue to output large sections of legal or procedural regulations and cannot be interrupted manually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The role of 12368 focuses on information consultation.&quot; A lawyer surnamed Liu told a Southern Weekend reporter that the customer service line of the 12368 hotline mainly relies on the query system. No special professional answering ability is required; more professional questions related to court functions can mainly be completed by calling the legal aid hotline 12348 or going to the court case filing window. Lawyer Liu often interacts with courts and does legal knowledge popularization work on Internet platforms in his spare time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also introduced that many parties involved in the case have little contact with the court and do not understand the existence of 12368. In contrast, lawyers entrusted by parties are the group who have more contact with the 12368 hotline. For lawyers, 12368 is mainly used to understand the progress of the case and to inquire about other channels for detailed consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Outsourcing is more common&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;April 2023, Beijing The &quot;Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court 12368 Hotline Litigation Platform Service Fee Project Winning Announcement&quot; published by the Municipal Government Procurement Network revealed that China Mobile Online Services Co., Ltd. won the bid for &quot;Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court 12368 Hotline Litigation Platform Service&quot; at a price of 7.74972 million yuan. &quot;Fees Project&quot;, the service period is 12 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Introducing the &quot;overall model&quot; in the announcement, the 12368 manual hotline service adopts the access model of the main platform of the High Court and the sub-platforms of the middle and grassroots courts to provide the society with 5× 8 hours service. The bidder provides workplace wiring services, as well as operation team recruitment, training, management, call quality inspection, callback, etc. The number of seats in the operation team shall not be less than 65, and there shall be no less than one full-time call quality inspector. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to media reports, in 2022, the number of manual calls to the Beijing Court’s 12368 hotline reached 1.4942 million, a year-on-year increase of 67.2%, ranking first in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;You will know after going to the court a few times to do things. They really have a lot of things to do and are very busy.&quot; Wang Cailiang, director of Beijing Cailiang Law Firm, once organized lawyers to go to the court. The &quot;Legal Aid Hotline 12348&quot; of the judicial system provides free consultation. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that it is very common not only in the court system, but also in some government agencies and institutions to outsource hotlines involving legal issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He said that if normal bidding procedures are followed, this kind of outsourcing behavior is not a bad idea. The key is that the legal professionalism of the outsourcing unit must be excellent so that it will not be criticized by the outside world. &quot;If you are not professional, wrong and knowledgeable, you will not be able to satisfy the masses,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people are unwilling to do consultations and receive public consultations.&quot; Wang Cailiang explained that staff in some units regard receiving public consultations as a kind of burden and therefore tend to outsource this work. He believes that communication and consultation are originally good opportunities to resolve conflicts. If used as a burden, conflicts will accumulate and expand, thus consuming more judicial resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter&#39;s search found that the outsourcing of &quot;12368&quot; is common in courts at all levels across the country, but the specific bidding details vary greatly. Due to different levels of economic development, the business volume of courts in various regions varies greatly, and the contract amounts therefore vary significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, a provincial high court in an economically underdeveloped southern province issued a bidding announcement in July 2023, which showed that its “12368 litigation service hotline outsourcing The project&#39;s budget is only 600,000 yuan; while the contracting budget of another large city district court in March 2023 reached 1.5 million yuan. In addition to the separate bidding model for each court, a province in East China has adopted a model of &quot;provincial centralized deployment and social outsourcing of the 12368 litigation service hotline of the province&#39;s courts&quot;, with an overall budget of more than 24 million yuan, requiring intelligent voice, intelligent work orders, Intelligent agent assistance and a unified litigation service knowledge base empower the core engine, open up the litigation service system, and realize the entire process of consultation, inquiry, appointment, and processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The contract period of these outsourcing services usually ranges from 1 to 3 years, and subcontracting and subcontracting are expressly prohibited. Among the winning bidders, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises It’s both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Currently, there are no regulations that clearly allow or prohibit outsourcing.&quot; Wu Liwei, a lawyer at Beijing Beidou Dingming Law Firm, often calls the court hotline because he needs to check the progress of the case. Consultation was conducted, but I felt that many outsourcers did not understand legal issues. &quot;Since it is a litigation service hotline, it is to facilitate parties, lawyers and other people who may be involved in the lawsuit to understand relevant legal issues and litigation processes. From this function, internal court personnel should be responsible for answering calls and answering questions.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, Wu Liwei also believes that outsourcing the court hotline may involve leaking privacy. He explained that lawyers and clients often need to call the hotline to inquire about the progress of the case. Although the specific details of the case will not be involved, the &quot;cause of the case&quot; itself contains a lot of private information. &quot;For example, who files a divorce lawsuit against whom, and who sues whom for defamation, insult, or damage to reputation, all involve the privacy of the parties involved.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[误认家长为人贩子被打：一场基于双向误解的冲突]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258369]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a netizen told an experience of his on social media, which caused widespread attention and controversy. The blogger herself described the version as follows: She said she had a &quot;facial fracture&quot; and was beaten by her parents. The reason was that she felt that her parents looked like human traffickers, and her sense of justice was overwhelming. In the end, the two parties went to the police station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She wrote: At the police station...it was said that I hit him with a pole first, and then he hit me. In fact, I just followed them from beginning to end, constantly asking the little girl: &quot;Kid, is he a member of your family?&quot; Once or twice I tried to gently hold her hand to confirm with her what the relationship between this man and her was. The little girl didn&#39;t say anything, and I didn&#39;t dare to confirm whether he was a trafficker, so I kept delaying time and told him to stop and not leave. My purpose was to wait until the police came to investigate clearly. He was too fierce, and I was afraid that he would beat him. I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then he was really beaten: Later, when he walked near his car, he suddenly put down the child, turned around and punched me on the head several times... and broke the handle (of the camper) with all his strength. He hit me on the head with the broken end of the metal handle...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this Weibo, there are those who sympathize and support, but also those who ridicule and ridicule. Of course, what we can see so far is the blogger’s unilateral perspective and description, which may not be accurate or complete. To understand the full truth, the media should interview the other party or ask the local police for information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the subject of the facts described by the blogger is true, that is, he is well-intentioned, suspects that the parents are human traffickers, and then follows them, talks to the child, and &quot;once or twice tried to gently hold her hand.&quot; &quot;Hand&quot;, because the child kept silent, &quot;I had to keep stalling for time to tell him to stop and not leave.&quot; This is one party’s perspective. What if we look at it from the perspective of the child’s father? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a father, he carried his child to a private car. Suddenly a stranger appeared and was following me. He also approached the child and kept saying incomprehensible words. He also tried to touch his child and questioned whether he was the child&#39;s biological father. A normal reaction would be to get angry.等走到自己汽车附近，感觉孩子安全了，决定教训一下对方，让孩子知道父亲会保护自己，也出出心中的恶气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应该说，保护自己的孩子，是任何一个为人父母者的正常反应。有陌生人不断持续此种言行，在带着孩子的父母看来就是挑衅，或存心不良。至于小孩不回答陌生人的问话，也很正常了，或者性格内向，或者由于学校或家庭的安全教育，不愿跟来历不明的陌生人搭话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坊间流传：人贩子为了从父母手中抢走小孩，一个套路就是乘父母不注意一把从父母手中夺走小孩，然后对留驻的路人谎称自己才是小孩的父母，或谎称是夫妻之间闹矛盾抢小孩，以打消路人干预的念头，这样路人干预的意愿就下降了。而这些都市传说（Urban Legend），其实都是有所本的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位父亲发视频介绍，2023年7月13日晚，他妻子带孩子出去玩，一名女子直接要抢孩子，还好自己离孩子不远才及时制止，“女子一直对别人说是她的小孩，旁边的人都不敢插手，后面她想跑，我把她制服了”。根据当地警方通报：涉事女子有多次精神疾病就医治疗史。虽然该女子被证实是精神病而非人贩子，但抢孩子时用了“是她的孩子”的说法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;神智正常者当众抢人孩子的也有。 2019年12月17日，王女士和母亲带着2岁的双胞胎儿女来到上海站，准备乘车回郑州老家。当她们在车站东南出口处休息时，一名推着婴儿车、身穿黑色外套的中年女子在大庭广众之下，竟然抱起了她的小女儿准备离开。王女士和周围旅客急忙将该女子拦下，并立即报了警，该女子谎称“抱错了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到文章开头的案例，其逻辑链条较大的可能是：该女子认为小孩父亲疑似人贩子；反过来，小孩父亲恐怕也把她当疑似人贩子或精神病，这就导致了一场基于双向误解的冲突。涉事博主的出发点值得肯定，但实际上，一个大人抱着小孩在街上走，从“先验概率”（prior probability）看，是父母抱着自己孩子的概率还是极高的。同时，也没有道理说父母带着孩子在外面必须随时随地保持亲密互动才是正常的。如果被抱着的小孩大哭大闹说要妈妈，明确说了“你是谁，我不认识你，我要妈妈”。那才确实是有些可疑的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而这一事件也提醒我们，有爱心、有正义感是好事，但应该从常识与理性出发，基于可靠判断、在维护自身安全的前提下挺身而出；遇见确实的可疑情况，也不要直接跟对方起冲突，最好用法律手段解决问题。见义勇为当然应该提倡，但必须客观上真的在见义勇为，例如阻止了现行犯。如果误判了事情的性质，实际上在侵犯别人的人身自由与名誉权利，难免衍生出误判与错误行动的后果，这是孰是孰非之外的启示所在。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;68岁的洪建明站在霓虹灯通明的饭店大堂前，看着老友们三两结伴，互相搀扶着穿过斑马线，直至消失在马路对面的黑暗里，他才迈出步子。 “他们都不知道我住在这附近，不想让他们知道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他们，是洪建明在上海徐家汇的宜家餐厅认识的单身老人，冲着“多吃几个花样的菜”，每个礼拜二聚在一起吃饭。彼此都不知道姓名，也很少过问，因为没必要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;到宜家餐厅的单身老人，大多是想找个伴。他们一面冲着心仪对象大胆示爱，一面又出于自我保护止不住地猜疑与提防，唯恐吃了亏。日子久了，大家变成了保有边界感的熟人，聚一块只是图个热闹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;孤独，终归是这里的底色。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月12日下午3时，南方周末记者初到宜家餐厅，一眼望过去，布置近700个座位的用餐区，被零散坐开的老年人完全占据，过道里始终有人走动，相互搭讪聊天。偶尔有人走到记者跟前，打量着年轻的新面孔问道：“是来找伴的不？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这是一处上海老年人自发设定的相亲角。开业于1998年的徐汇商场，是宜家在中国大陆的第一家门店。很难说清楚，它的餐厅是怎么被一群老来单身的人相中并占据的。只要购买一杯7.9元的咖啡，免费续杯，就可以端着马克杯在餐厅晃荡一整天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;71岁的陈翠霞记得，18年前，徐汇商场还是一栋很小的两层楼，单身的她和姐妹6人来玩，底下商场兜一圈，发现二楼还有饭吃。 “这边蛮好的，完了以后我们就讲好，下次再来好不好？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来，人越聚越多，最多的时候，三百多号单身老人聚过来，都是来找伴的，整个大厅得靠喊话沟通，“声音吵&lt;span>;得&lt;/span>;能把房顶掀翻”。有人提出，大家挑日子聚，周二是大日子，周四是小日子。陈翠霞觉得，老人们其实没有其他地方可以去聊天&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;“除了这里，就是人民公园，缺乏一个供老年人交流的平台。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;上海是全国老龄化程度最高的超大型城市。据2022年上海市老年人口和老龄事业监测统计信息公布数据，2022年上海户籍的60岁及以上老年人口553.66万人，占总人口近&lt;span>;四&lt;/span>;成，其中，独居老年人数30.06万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;宜家餐厅无疑成了他们排遣寂寞的一块自留地。每周二，一位90岁的老太太会乘坐456路公交，从三林出发，花40多分钟时间来到餐厅后，只是默默坐在角落看人头攒动；旁边另一位上了年纪的女人与老太太以姐妹相称，她用塑料袋包些南瓜子给老太太吃，俩人自打在餐厅认识至今已有四五年之久。当被问及是不是来找伴时，她们摇摇头，“就聊天，阿拉（上海话，我们）开心就好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;张贵成则从更远的地方赶来，他每周二从奉贤区出发，要坐两个半小时公交和地铁，到这里唠嗑、吃饭，再回去，一天七八十元没了，只是因为孤单。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;71岁的他是上海人民公园的媒人出身，干了几十年，如今也面临找不到伴的困境。 “老年人相亲跟年轻人相亲一样，都是做生意，你条件好不好？有多少钱？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;张贵成说，跟所有相亲角一样，这里最重要的条件也是钱。大家的开场白，无外乎是几个问题：你是上海人吗？多大年纪了？有儿女吗？有劳保（退休金）吗？有房子吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一个65岁的老太太告诉张贵成，自己想要50万元彩礼，张贵成也把这套问题抛给她：有劳保吗？没有；有房子吗？ nor.张贵成一句话没憋住，“你啥都没有，人为啥给你50万，你就是不要彩礼，也没人要你的。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;女人们也掌握了时尚的秘诀，墨镜、丝巾和旗袍都是提升气质的必备品。还有人以苗条身段吸引众人目光，用黑色口罩遮住爬满皱纹的脸，多了一丝神秘感。另一个来自甘肃的六旬女人戴一顶缝有硕大花朵的紫色礼帽，说话温声细语，满含微笑，但因为她是外地人，至今没有找到伴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;过往的教训告诉这里的老人们，“陷阱”是五花八门的。在老人们的讲述中，有男人穿金戴银，谎称自己家中富得流油，只是为了和“上钩”的女人睡一觉；有女人称自己身体健康，等在一起后才暴露出浑身是病，男伴不得不天天领着她跑医院；还时常有一些外地的年轻女人来到这个地方，专盯八九十岁、无儿无女的单身上海男人“谈朋友”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;宋小飞就是大家口中“中招”的“糊涂人”，一个80岁的老中医，清瘦，嘴角弥留一道黏糊的食物残渣。 40多岁的王秀敏坐在对面为他剥桂圆，两人几个月前才走到一起，因为年龄差距悬殊，对外以父女相称。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;宋小飞每月领取8000元的退休金，这在餐厅属于相当高的档次。退休金全部交由王秀敏保管，宋小飞每天会分到50元零花钱，被他卡进退役军人优待证的夹层里，用来买烟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王秀敏说，她心疼宋小飞的经历。宋小飞经历过三次失败的婚姻，第一个老婆让他痛苦了18年。两人离婚后，女方娘家的房子分了一套给宋小飞。这套房子在第二次婚姻中被分出一半，直至第三次婚姻结束后，房子彻底分没了，如今宋小飞只能在上海租一处房子住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;第三任老婆，就是宋小飞在宜家餐厅认识的&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;“她说她有三套房子，我们打了结婚证，后来才知道，她一套都没有。”宋小飞果断离了婚，又成了孤身一人。 “第三个良心很凶的，我现在就想找个良心好的。”宋小飞看了旁边的王秀敏，“她良心就蛮好的”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王秀敏形容宋小飞的遭遇，是牛变成羊子，羊子变成鸡蛋，最后鸡蛋壳都没了。宋小飞听了笑笑，“无所谓，我看得很透的，混到哪天算哪天，走了都是一场空了”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;为了避免坠入“陷阱”，老人们最常用的方式，就是不打结婚证，也不让渡房产证的名字。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;以前，王立仁在餐厅里谈过一个漂亮的女伴，“刚开始处得蛮好，后来她让我往房产证上提个她名字。我说要是没有儿子，死了以后三套房子全部给你，但我有儿子”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;最后，考虑到俩人已经睡过觉了，王立仁给了女伴2000元作为弥补，女伴攥着钱愤愤地离开了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;谁也不愿意自己的财产在暮年时被人分割。 “老太婆、老头子之间谈得不好，领证亏的嘞！比如你有50万，想离婚了，你就要给她25万。”一个男人挑起眉毛，以老&lt;span>;到&lt;/span>;的口吻说，自己早就看透了眼前的这帮女人。一旁的女人听这话不乐意了，她更支持流行的一句话：不以结婚为目的的恋爱，都是耍流氓。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有人拿餐厅中有一对成功的伴侣举例：男方的经济条件不如女方，但退休金高，便将退休金全部交给女人，住进了女方的家。几年过去，俩人没打结婚证，感情也好好的。 “彼此有个伴儿就行了，不打证也一样过。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;孤独感&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“我就为儿子把自己卖了”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;餐厅里的常客老张，也是宜家餐厅出了名的“糊涂人”，被一些老人形容是“捣糨糊的”（方言，形容瞎混），也捣坏了餐厅的风气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他78岁了，牙齿已经掉完，要靠布满黑色牙根的牙床摩擦进食，只能吃土豆泥和流食，嚼一小口炸鸡排，需要缓慢咀嚼七八十次才能完全吞咽，软软的下巴牵动松弛的脖颈皮肤一上一下，沉甸甸的金链子跟着闪动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;大家习惯管他叫“小裁缝”，这是他穷苦时代的标签。以前在服装厂工作时没钱，他成宿在离厂子近的澡堂子里过夜。但8年前，因为上海的老房子动迁，老张拿到了500万拆迁款，一夜暴富，围在他身边的女人开始多了起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;老张图便宜，花了150万在江苏启东买了两套92平米的房。几乎每半个月都要从宜家餐厅带走一个女伴，搭客车回启东看房子，他管这种女人叫“临时工”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我花钱买人陪我，照顾我，给我做饭，洗衣服，一天200到1000块钱。”老张说，他会根据年龄和长相定价，越年轻漂亮的，越贵，“年轻的四十多（岁），要睡一起，搂搂抱抱的”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;48岁的沈素芬就是老张叫过来的“临时工”，她伺候过老张一段时间，一天300元。有一回，到老张启东的房子里，臭味熏天，冰箱里的东西放了一两个月，都是老张在外面吃饭打包带回来的。蚊虫、蛾子快要把天花板扑满，沈素芬足足收拾了三天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“我女儿不管我，忙。”每隔两三个月，女儿会来看老张一次，给一沓3000元现钞，老张把这些钱全部挥霍在了人生三大爱好上：咖啡，麻将和女人。 “每天一个人很孤独的，身边有一个人，最起码丰富一点。”其实老张最担心的是，如果有一天自己病倒了，身边连个打120的人都没有。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;发生在宜家餐厅里的相亲故事，并不全是情情爱爱，其中一些老人为下一代活着，又被下一代抛弃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;过去很长一段时间，餐厅里有一个漂亮的女人四处找伴，1975年生人，对要找的男人不限年龄和长相，唯一的条件就是给她两百万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;之所以提这样的要求，是因为儿子临近结婚，凑不够钱。只要有了200万元，就足够在儿媳的老家置备一套房子和车子，&lt;span>;彩&lt;/span>;礼也够付。女人说，“我就为儿子做这么一件事情，把自己卖了。”后来，她成为老人们口中的“神经病”，再没来过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;洪建明讲起另一个故事，一个穿着绿色连衣裙的上海单身女人，时常流连于餐厅。 10年前，女儿让她在家里帮忙带小孩，现在小孩带大了，女儿女婿都要她出去住。找了几年伴，没人要她，如今仍住在女儿家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“她亲口跟我说，她们是两房一厅，房子大，等女儿一家都睡觉了，她悄悄地进去，洗漱完睡觉，不跟他们见面。”说话间，洪建明招手让女人过来聊天，女人摆摆手。 “她脑子已经坏掉了，没别的想法，就是找个老头带她回家住。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;老面孔&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“成不了对象，至少有共同话题”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;傍晚5点过后，老人们起身陆续回家，68岁的潘银花选了一个角落位置孤零零地坐着，她摆开从家里带来的冷馒头，接一杯热水，开始用自己的晚餐，“不想回到那个家，看到他就吵吵”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他，是潘银花的前夫。他们离婚已经有10年，但谁也不想从房子里搬出去，至今仍做着室友。潘银花希望找个有房子的上海男人结婚，然后从那个家搬出去。 “我刚开始离婚的时候，一门心思想找个好的很方便的，离就离了。没想到这么难找，已经灰心了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有一次，潘银花跟一个80岁的男人相互中意，男人带她回家看了一圈，潘银花也比较满意。 “但那房子不是他的，他只有使用权。”潘银花看出来，男人有结伴的想法，“但我看他可怜，没有子女，只想跟他保持朋友关系。他年纪大了，有难处打电话来，我能帮他”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;最终，80岁的男人被来餐厅的一个四十多岁的沈阳女人看中，他将上海的房子租出去，跟着女人回了东北。 “如果这个女的良心好的话，照顾他多活两年。如果老头倒下来要花大钱，她肯定不花的。”说到底，潘银花还是放心不下，“他跟我很聊得来的，你是记者，你能去沈阳找一下这个老头子吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;常来宜家餐厅的人都知道，在这里找对象是顶难的事。老年人的相亲是迅速果断的，在“门当户对”的基础之上，陪伴的作用远大过爱情。按照一贯的流程，只要第一面有眼缘，就意味着过了第一关，一般男方会主动邀请女方去自己家里看看，聊得好就同居，聊得不好，也不要浪费彼此时间。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;往往双方聊半个小时以后，洪建明会客客气气地把对方送到楼下的地铁口，叮嘱她回家慢点。但洪建明最想要的是另一种送客场景：“我跟她说，你自己下去，认识不认识路啊？”这就意味着，洪建明心里&lt;span>;中&lt;/span>;意对方了，“我会对她说，以后还要来的，不见得每次我都要到地铁站接你吧？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;为了在自己中意的人出现时，表现自己的用心，洪建明字斟句酌地练习过很多遍“台词”&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;“怎么说话，又怎么接话，我都想好了，但没人能让我说出来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;独居时间长了，洪建明时常觉得自己被遗忘了。在这座拥有超过2418万人口的城市，喧嚣与璀璨都是年轻人的。时间将他推向暮年，伴着强烈的孤独，没有一点办法。面对日复一日的老面孔，成不了对象，索性当朋友唠嗑好了，在固定的日子里聚到一起，至少还有共同的话题，打发时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;也是因为人到老年，闲来无事，时不时有卖房产和墓地的销售员来到宜家餐厅，组织老年人们去观光，大巴车接送，包一顿免费午餐，一些老人踊跃报名。还有一个老人常年在餐厅发展业务，组织熟络的人抱团去外地旅游，生意不断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;隔三差五，这里会消失一张老面孔。相互问一问，就听见坏消息：有的不再来宜家餐厅的老人，已经离开人世了。 &lt;/p>;

Before the physical education class, a group of boys and girls in my son&#39;s class knelt down and prayed for rain, saying, &quot;God bless you, let it rain quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Kneel down and pray for rain&quot;, the first reaction in my mind is the plot in the TV series &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. A group of children knelt down to pray for rain in a serious manner. Of course I understood that there was an element of comedy in this, but I also realized an indisputable fact: some children do not like to attend physical education classes. On the one hand, the weather in Guangzhou is very hot. Running, skipping rope, and playing with hula hoops on the scorching playground for forty minutes is very painful or even torturous for most students; more importantly, some children There is a clear resistance to taking physical education classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but think of the time when I was in school more than thirty years ago. Physical education was, without a doubt, the most popular class, without “one”. During recess or physical education classes in elementary school, we would roll hoops, fold cards, play marbles, hopscotch, shuttlecock, and tug-of-war, and have a great time. Whether you come into the classroom with a red face after playing in the summer or warmed up after playing in the winter, it is always a very happy moment. In junior high school and high school, before the class ends in the morning or afternoon, or before the physical education class, many of our classmates carry table tennis rackets. As soon as the bell rings, the students sitting in the back row of the classroom sprint at the speed of 100 meters. Running to the table tennis table and sitting or lying down on the table tennis table means &quot;we have occupied this table&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PE classes at that time were synonymous with relaxation, happiness, and fun, which perfectly matched the playful nature of children. Times have changed, and today’s physical education classes are far less popular than before. Some students don’t like or even hate physical education classes. What is the root cause? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we all know, the original intention of physical education classes is to strengthen children&#39;s bodies. The &quot;physical fitness&quot; here is not only about physical health and fitness, but also about cultivating the children&#39;s perseverance and fearless qualities. It has both physical and psychological implications, both of which are indispensable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to overeating, anorexia, other improper, unscientific, and unreasonable diets, or lack of exercise, or no exercise habits, many children are seriously out of shape, obese or suspected of obesity or frailty. There are not a few children who are suspected of being weak. Out of shape will affect children&#39;s learning, social interaction and other aspects to a certain extent. As natural attributes, the body, body shape and body shape will construct and affect children&#39;s social attributes, often with negative effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to effectively solve or alleviate the above-mentioned difficulties and strengthen children&#39;s physical exercise, education authorities and schools have begun to pay attention to physical education. The importance of physical education in various subjects is increasing day by day. Not only weekly physical education The number of classes has increased significantly. In some provinces and regions, physical education classes have been officially included in the scope of entrance examinations, and physical education scores have been included in the high school entrance examination subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve higher overall results and not lose points along with the sports scores, the original sports items as a casual or optional fun function have been transformed into compulsory compulsory content for students. In other words, taking physical education classes is not to play, not to sweat, not to develop a lifelong habit of exercise, but to take the entrance exam and get a temporary score. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of including physical education as an examination item is to allow students to develop their moral, intellectual and physical development in an all-round way. The problem is that under such incentives, most students hope to get close to full marks or high scores in physical education. Many students In addition to physical education classroom training, students also spend a lot of time, energy and money on training for physical education examinations. Various expensive training courses, improvement courses and crash courses have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. There is no difference between these extracurricular training programs for major subjects such as Chinese, Mathematics, and English. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the school perspective, some areas have implemented a policy that links student physical examinations to the performance of principals, and therefore to the performance of teachers. Therefore, physical education classes and physical tests are not just a matter for the physical education teacher, but also a matter for all teachers in the school, involving the welfare and treatment of all teachers in the school. Under such circumstances, strengthening physical education classes, allowing students to strengthen physical exercise even when they return home, and doing everything possible to improve students&#39; physical test scores has naturally become a common choice for many schools. &quot;Using the whole school&#39;s efforts to develop and revitalize sports&quot; has become a goal of many schools. slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let students strengthen physical exercise. The specific exercise content is very specific and clear, including the physical test items required above. Students have to insist on punching in every day, and ignore other items at all, such as kicking shuttlecock, Projects that are interesting to students or more popular among students, such as hoop rolling and hopscotch, are basically excluded. In other words, the sports that students play in class may not necessarily be what they like. They have no right to choose. They can only passively accept several types of sports designated by the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, some schools in some areas have also popularized activities designed to allow students to exercise for one hour a day - &quot;big break&quot;, which specifically includes free exercise, relaxation exercise, running exercise and other sections. The problem is that the evaluation criteria for this kind of &quot;big break&quot; are mainly beautiful formations, which require uniformity in an absolute sense. The row spacing, shoulder distance, arm raising range, left alignment, right alignment, and uniformity throughout the formation are not important. There are strict rules about not allowed to laugh and not allowed to make any sound. Students are forced to spend most of their &quot;recess&quot; time on superficial tasks such as formation rehearsals and pattern displays. Actual sports and exercise time are very limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to win the &quot;big break&quot; competition, to come out on top in the gymnastics competitions of other schools, to gain greater honors, and to get richer bonuses, some physical education teachers in some schools go to great lengths. Use your brains and find ways to &quot;create&quot;. How to &quot;create&quot; is nothing more than working on the formation and making the movements more difficult. For example, inventing a &quot;flexibility exercise&quot; requires students to be proficient in difficult movements such as splits and lower backs. How? Only repeated training once and for all, this kind of high-intensity training brings huge harm to the students&#39; bodies, and some of the damage is irreversible. From a psychological point of view, most students will feel that practicing these innovative exercises is more boring, boring, and uninteresting, and it is extremely painful for them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned various innovative exercises wearing a fitness &quot;hat&quot; are more difficult and less interesting, and there are fewer practical exercises for students. As a result, if the school radio station broadcasts &quot;Due to ****** reasons, today&#39;s recess is temporarily canceled&quot;, bursts of cheers will be heard from every classroom on the entire campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is obviously contrary to common sense, because not every student has the physical condition and talent to practice gymnastics, and not every student is suitable for doing difficult movements. This kind of training is only for professional gymnasts. It is really unreasonable to transplant standard machinery to ordinary students. The motivation behind this move - to win awards for the school and to increase the income of the school and some teachers, feels despicable and dirty, which is not an exaggeration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standardizing and homogenizing sports, converting physical measurements into results and scores, and linking sports to the performance of school leaders and the pocketbooks of teachers have greatly reduced or obliterated the diversity of sports. The essential stipulations such as sex, diversity, and interest are used to alienate the children into tools for some people to pursue their political achievements. Such behavior is naturally not welcomed by the students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, we cannot oversimplify our understanding of students’ “kneeling down to pray for rain”. We cannot simply attribute it to the fact that today’s children are generally afraid of sweating, suffering, weak willpower, and weak ability to withstand stress. If you don’t like or even hate physical education classes, relevant parties should think about it in all aspects: Is the current function of physical education classes to strengthen your body, please your body and mind, or is it something else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 23:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[研究女性劳动力市场的女性，问鼎2023诺贝尔经济学奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258365]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/X0B4ScncQcKaw0hR2fkONFJQebCS37mC6nfK2fZl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/X0B4ScncQcKaw0hR2fkONFJQebCS3 7mC6nfK2fZl. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253618&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Claudia Goldin. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, 2023, Beijing time, Claudia Gore, professor of economics at Harvard University Claudia Goldin will win the 2023 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for &quot;advancing our understanding of women&#39;s labor market outcomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I studied Golding’s economic thought during my Ph.D., and in 2011 published “Review of Claudia Golding’s Economic Thought—Potential Female Nobel Economics” in Economic Trends &quot;A Review of the Academic Contributions of Academic Award Winners&quot;. Now I am very happy to see that she has actually won the award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are traces of Goldin winning the Nobel Prize in Economics. She has served as president of the American Economic Association and the American Economic History Association, and has also been elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. These important indicators of a scholar&#39;s academic status have long meant that Goldin has the potential to aspire to the top. The strength of the Bell Prize in Economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Uniqueness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2023 Nobel Prize in Economics not only continues the common rules of previous years, but also has its own unique features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the winner Golding is still from an American university. More than half of the scholars who won the Nobel Prize in Economics from 1969 to 2023 were from the United States, far ahead of the number of winners from other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin was born in New York City in 1946. He received his bachelor&#39;s and doctoral degrees in economics from Cornell University and the University of Chicago. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin, Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. Now a professor of economics at Harvard University, she is the first female tenured professor in the history of Harvard University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Goldin is the third female economist to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. When the Nobel Prize was first established, it did not include economics awards. Since the Nobel Prize in Economics was first awarded in 1969, male economists have always won this honor. Until 2009, Eleanor Ostrow Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in Economics for &quot;innovative research in economic governance, especially in the governance of public resources.&quot; This is the first time a woman has won the prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years later, in 2019, Esther Duflo became the second female scholar to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. The reason for the award was for her outstanding contributions in the field of global poverty research. contribute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third place is this year&#39;s Goldin. She revealed the main driving factors of gender differences in the labor market, which has far-reaching significance for understanding the female labor market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, both Ostrom and Duflo shared the Nobel Prize in Economics with other scholars. For example, Duflo won the Nobel Prize in Economics at the same time with her husband, Abhijit Banerjee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University. Goldin’s husband, Lawrence F. Katz, is also an economics professor at Harvard University. The two have collaborated on many classic articles on labor economics and are a couple in the academic world. But it is a pity that Goldin and Katz were not able to share the Nobel Prize at the same time this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the research fields of the Nobel Prize in Economics are becoming more and more &quot;down-to-earth&quot;. In the past, the Nobel Prize in Economics focused more on theoretical contributions. In recent years, the Nobel Prize in Economics has gradually begun to focus on the applied value of research. For example, Duflo, the second female economist to win the prize in 2019, studied poverty. Golding&#39;s systematic research on female employment and gender discrimination, the history of educational development and changes in wage structures also has important practical significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Goldin’s research characteristics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Goldin’s research not only focuses on the construction of a theoretical analysis framework, but also focuses on combining a large amount of economic history data to analyze Conduct research on real-life problems. Its research characteristics are to use a large amount of historical data combined with econometrics and other methods to conduct empirical research, and to analyze current problems through the perspective of the past in order to draw more practical conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, we quote two cases from Goldin, one is a study on women’s working time legislation in the United States. In the 1940s, 40 states in the United States passed legislation on women&#39;s working hours, setting mandatory maximum working hours for each day of the week. Many scholars believe that these laws not only fail to effectively protect these groups, but even harm their own interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Golding used manufacturing data to conduct research and found that the maximum working hour legislation not only reduced the working hours of women, but also reduced the working hours of men, and the proportion of women in the manufacturing sector was also reduced. It has not been reduced due to restrictions in working hours laws. She also pointed out that the proportion of women in other industries such as sales has increased as working hours legislation has become more restrictive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example shows the skill of Golding&#39;s approach to researching problems. Most studies generally use some traditional &quot;discrimination coefficient&quot; and other methods to measure female employment discrimination. However, Goldin cleverly directly measured female employment discrimination by comparing the recruitment methods of American symphony orchestras before and after the reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the reform of recruitment methods, symphony orchestras mainly selected musicians through direct interviews among the many outstanding candidates selected by the music director. This method favored male applicants and favored female applicants. discrimination against persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the 1970s to the 1980s, the recruitment method was reformed in the form of &quot;blind performance&quot;, that is, listening to the performance level through a curtain screen. In this way, the judges will not know the gender of the musician applicant and can only recruit based on the applicant&#39;s technical level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the implementation of this reform, Golding found that the &quot;blind performance&quot; format can increase the likelihood of women advancing from the preliminary round by 50%, and the likelihood of entering the final stage has also increased several times. , the possibility of becoming an orchestra musician also greatly increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employment discrimination problems may occasionally be encountered in real life, so some of Goldin&#39;s research may help solve these problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Main Economic Thoughts&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Goldin has made important contributions to the study of gender discrimination, the history of educational development and the evolution of wage structure gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Female employment and gender discrimination are important research topics in the field of labor economics, which have attracted the attention of many economists. Goldin&#39;s research mainly focuses on occupational segmentation caused by gender differences, factors affecting female employment, and the measurement of gender discrimination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematic research on the theory of discrimination in the labor market began with G. Becker (1957). Later economists gave various explanations on the causes of discrimination and the influencing factors of discrimination. Such as the crowding hypothesis (Bergmann, 1971) and statistical discrimination (Phelps, 1972). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from these theoretical explanations, Golding focuses on analyzing the influencing factors of gender discrimination in female employment from an empirical perspective. She believes that the gender discrimination faced by women in the job search process is the result of a combination of factors, and analyzes it from the perspectives of World War II, the availability of contraceptive pills, and legislation on maximum working hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars such as Golding believe that birth control pills reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and thus increase the age at which women get married for the first time. The widespread use of contraceptive pills among unmarried women has also reduced the cost of women&#39;s long-term career investment and increased the proportion of educated women. More female college graduates have entered the labor market, promoting women&#39;s employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Workers can improve their labor productivity and thus their income by receiving education, but what is the relationship between years of education and income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article &quot;The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women&#39;s Employment, Education and the Family&quot; (2006), Golding divided women&#39;s employment from the late 19th century to that time into four stages based on changes in women&#39;s educational attainment: In the first stage, from the late 19th century to the 1920s, women in the labor market were usually young, unmarried women. At this time, the income elasticity of labor supply was very high, while the substitution elasticity was very small. Most female workers were not well educated. . The second stage lasted from the 1930s to around 1950. In this stage, restrictions on married women&#39;s work were relaxed. The income elasticity of labor supply dropped significantly in absolute terms. Secondary school enrollment and graduation rates increased, and part-time work increased. The rise of the economy and the popularization of office facilities have greatly increased women&#39;s labor market participation rate. The third stage, from the 1950s to the 1970s, was the origin stage of the &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot;. In the two age groups of 45-54 and 35-44, the labor force participation rate of women increased significantly, from 25% in 1950 rose to 46% in 1970. The fourth stage is from the late 1970s to the time when the paper was published, that is, the &quot;quiet revolutionary stage.&quot; The Quiet Revolution is mainly manifested through three indicators: horizon, identity, and decision making. Horizon mainly refers to a woman’s ability to predict her future career more accurately; identity refers to a woman’s name after marriage. retaining their surname; decision-making allows her to be better prepared to enter the labor market. The conclusion is that changing trends in women&#39;s education have promoted women&#39;s employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Economic inequality is closely related to the level of educational development. Goldin also gave a detailed explanation of the relationship between the two in his book &quot;The Race between Education and Technology&quot; (with L.F. Katz, 2008). She pointed out that the United States began to implement mass education at the beginning of the 20th century, making the 20th century known as the &quot;human capital century&quot; and the &quot;American century.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About education, technology and economic inequality, it can be summarized as follows: 1. A more educated labor force can produce higher labor productivity, which in turn produces rapid economic growth. However, it is important to note that economic growth does not depend solely on investment in education, but also on the type of government, the degree of protection of property rights, and many other prerequisites. 2. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of education can also drive technological progress. In turn, the continuous progress of technology also requires more and better-educated labor force. Relative to the labor force with less education, the wages of labor force with more education are higher, and the insufficient supply of labor force with more education will inevitably lead to the labor force with more education and more education. The wage gap between the less educated workforce continues to grow. If the relative proportions of different levels of education remain unchanged, technological progress will inevitably bring about economic inequality; in other words, if the quantity and quality of education increase, technological progress will promote the decline of economic inequality. 3. Throughout the 20th century, the economic growth of the United States showed a continuous rise, but economic inequality showed discontinuity. In the first 70 years of the 20th century, economic growth brought about a decline in inequality, but in the last 20 years of the 20th century, economic inequality gradually increased. 4. Judging from the above statements, the main reason why inequality in the United States first declined and then increased in the 20th century was due to the out-of-synchrony between the speed of educational development and the demand for talents in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is a close connection between female employment and gender discrimination, educational development history and economic inequality. The development of education is an important factor influencing the increase in female employment and changes in economic inequality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin has a wide range of research interests. In addition to the above-mentioned fields, it also involves many issues such as slavery and immigrant migration. She is a female economist with extensive research fields and rich academic achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor and doctoral supervisor at the Department of Economics, School of Economics, Liaoning University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“国家需要就是我的专业”丨钱伟长110周年诞辰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258367]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/9CXRlLqfFveyoWxWucuEqpM9sLsWKAY9XzF2d1VJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;731&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/9CXRlLqfFveyoWxWucuEqpM9sLs WKAY9XzF2d1VJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253614&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qian Weichang (1913-2010), born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, majored in physics and mechanics , applied mathematician, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and president of Shanghai University during his lifetime. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 9, 2023, is the 110th anniversary of Chinese scientist and educator Qian Weichang Birthday anniversary. At Shanghai University, which is called the &quot;Eternal President&quot;, activities such as &quot;Qian Weichang and Heritage Protection&quot; and &quot;Commemorating the 110th Anniversary of Qian Weichang&#39;s Birthday and the Development Forum of &#39;Long-lasting Great Deeds&#39;&quot; were held one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he has been dead for more than ten years, the legendary stories about Qian Weichang still attract public attention from time to time. For example, his thesis that &quot;this article does not need to refer to any literature&quot;; he entered Tsinghua University with &quot;only a 5-point score in physics&quot;, but due to his strength he became a famous physicist as famous as Qian Xuesen and Qian Sanqiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned paper, called the &quot;hardest core&quot; by netizens, was published in the fifth issue of 2002 of the magazine &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot; (&quot;Nonlinear Calculation Problems of Large Deflection of Ningbo Yongjiang Bridge&quot;). In fact, he has a profound and unique understanding and use of research and documentation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1993, he said in his speech &quot;How to Be a Graduate Student&quot; that &quot;documentation is one aspect of investigation, and literature is an important aspect in learning, and it is also used to doing this internationally. .&quot; He also gave detailed guidance on how to write academic papers at the graduate work meeting, &quot;Before writing a paper, you must first go to the front line to find out where the person&#39;s &#39;shoulder&#39; is.&quot; &quot;What is touching the shoulder? It means looking up information and going Investigation and research.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2004, CCTV&#39;s &quot;Everyone&quot; column interviewed 92-year-old Qian Weichang. He recalled that he scored 225 points in his entrance exam, with full marks in Chinese and history subjects. &quot;I scored a total of 25 points in mathematics, physics, chemistry and English... I only scored 5 points in physics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to research, the facts may be doubtful. A document titled &quot;Admission Standards for Undergraduate Students Recruited by National Tsinghua University Over the Years&quot; shows that in 1931, Tsinghua University required an overall average score of 54 or above in the entrance examination, and the average score requirement for the three subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics was at least 54 points. 49 points or more. According to the requirement of taking five compulsory exams and two elective exams at that time, according to this calculation, the total score of the seven subjects should reach 378 points. If only the five compulsory subjects are counted, it will be at least 270 points, both of which are higher than 225 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after enrolling, Qian Weichang successfully passed the &quot;High School Algebra Analytical Geometry&quot; screening test organized by Tsinghua University. In 1932, in April of his second year of enrollment, Qian Weichang was able to independently translate mathematician Fox&#39;s English paper on algebraic equations. &quot;According to our historical data research, he received very strict (academic) training at Suzhou Middle School, and their textbooks were almost all English textbooks.&quot; Wang Yuandi, secretary of the Party Committee of Shanghai University Library (Archives Museum), told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang spent his later years at the Yanchang Campus of Shanghai University. People often see Qian Weichang walking on the quiet campus. He enjoys greeting students and watching them walking hurriedly through the campus. He was particularly fond of a wide red jacket and always wore it when talking to students or communicating with leaders. Li Yin used to be the chairman of the Shanghai University Graduate Student Union and is now an academic teacher at Shanghai University. She and Qian Weichang met three times. She remembered that Qian Weichang, who was over 90 years old, was always full of energy and smiled with the innocence of a baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang maintained the curiosity of a scientist throughout his life. He once wrote an article sorting out &quot;The Origin of &quot;China&quot;&quot; and also discussed &quot;the structural characteristics and non-uniqueness of the Chinese Rubik&#39;s Cube&quot;; he was concerned about the problem of sandstorms in the north and once wrote to Premier Zhu Rongji in 2001: The problem of sandstorms in the north may be It is related to the number of goats raised in Inner Mongolia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He did not use political business cards during his lifetime. When introducing himself, he often used three titles: president of Shanghai University, editor-in-chief of &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot;, and director of the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics. These are the three identities he cherishes and are also important achievements in the later life of Qian Weichang as an educator. Dai Shiqiang, a tenured professor of Shanghai University who has worked with him for many years at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, recalled that the magazine &quot;Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot; edited by Qian Weichang had only two academicians including him at the beginning, but later the editorial board had a total of There have been 15 academicians, 16 presidents and vice-presidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Shiqiang said that Qian Weichang had three major interests in his life: football, Go and speaking. When he entered Tsinghua University, due to his poor family, Qian Weichang was only 1.49 meters tall, which was 1 centimeter shorter than the starting point of the height measurement benchmark. Like the ambitious young people of that era, he armed his body with patriotism. Less than two years after entering school, he participated in the Tsinghua cross-country team and won the championship at the sports meeting. He was later selected to the Tsinghua football team and represented the Chinese football team in the Far East Games held in the Philippines in 1937. When he graduated, Qian Weichang&#39;s height reached 1.65 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang likes to talk. Dai Shiqiang noticed that during speeches, Qian Weichang liked to tear off a corner of the newspaper on the table and chew it in his mouth. As president of Shanghai University (1994-2010), he gave speeches to students at the opening and graduation ceremonies every year, which was his unshakable practice in his later years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang&#39;s last public appearance in the media was in 2007, in Phoenix TV&#39;s feature film &quot;The Light of Life&quot;. At that time, he occasionally couldn&#39;t recognize people. Qian Wei always loved playing Go. Later, when he had no one to play with, he started playing backgammon, holding black in one hand and white in the other. Dai Shiqiang remembered that the last time he went to see him, Qian Weichang had sunspots in both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time he spoke in front of students was at the graduation ceremony of Shanghai University in 2005. Qian Weichang gave a motto: &quot;Be worried about the world&#39;s worries first, and be happy after the world&#39;s happiness.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;He said to the students in the audience: Children, can you keep it in mind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/HczUuZyE2ottYvWPOH3AOiVT6hMg5eEJsltukdNj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/HczUuZyE2ottYvWPOH3AOiVT6hMg5eEJsltukdNj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253616&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qian Weichang was in the study before his death. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Science is needed to save the country&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In 1913, Qian Weichang was born in a rural intellectual family in Wuxi. His fourth uncle was Qian Mu, a master of Chinese studies. There is an anecdote that is still talked about today: During the Tsinghua University Entrance Examination, Chen Yinke asked a question in the history test paper, requiring him to write down the name, volume, author and annotator of the Twenty-Four Histories. This question was difficult to answer. Many people were interviewed, but Qian Weichang answered them all and finally got full marks for this subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With a solid foundation in literature and history, it was a natural progression to enroll in the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University. But in 1931, on the third day after Qian Weichang entered school, the &quot;September 18th&quot; incident broke out. Qian Weichang&#39;s famous saying is widely known, &quot;I have no major, the country&#39;s needs are my majors.&quot; He felt that &quot;science is needed to save the country.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to enroll in the Department of Physics, Qian Weichang spent a week with Wu Youxun, the dean of the Department of Physics. Classes were held at eight o&#39;clock every day, and Qian Weichang went to the office to wait at a quarter past six. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Youxun couldn&#39;t test him, so he agreed to let him try it out. At that time, the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University had requirements for probationary students. The three courses of general chemistry, general physics and advanced mathematics needed to reach the intermediate level (70 points) or above. If they did not meet the standards, they would be returned to the original department. During the first seven weeks of the trial, Qian Wei studied physics according to the memorization method of studying Chinese studies, and his test results were &quot;a complete mess&quot;. It was only after Professor Wu Youxun&#39;s guidance that things changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He goes to the Science Museum at five o&#39;clock every morning to recite. Usually when he gets there, Hua Luogeng has already finished reciting. After finding the key to learning, Qian Weichang successfully stayed in the Department of Physics. After graduating from his undergraduate degree, he was admitted as a graduate student in the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University with first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like many progressive students at that time, Qian Weichang actively participated in the national salvation movement. In 1935, Qian Weichang participated in the &quot;December 9th&quot; student demonstrations. At the end of that year, he and several male classmates formed a bicycle team to go south and rode all the way to Nanjing to promote anti-Japanese and national salvation to the masses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arriving at the Southwest Associated University in Kunming in 1939, he, Lin Jiaqiao and Guo Yonghuai were admitted to study abroad at the Chinese and British Boxer Indemnity Fund. The majors that the three people took the examination were all &quot;mechanics&quot;, and their scores were the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a boat trip from Shanghai to study in Canada, they were surprised to find a Japanese visa in their passports. The person in charge explained the reason: The cruise will be suspended in Yokohama, Japan, and the Japanese endorsement can facilitate their shore excursions. &quot;While the Japanese aggressor army occupied most of the motherland, they could not accept visas from the enemy&#39;s government,&quot; Qian Weichang wrote. They disembarked with their luggage. Seven months later, we set off again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After studying abroad at the University of Toronto for about fifty days, Qian Weichang co-authored &quot;The Intrinsic Theory of Elastic Plate Shells&quot; with his tutor Xin Ji. His research on the theory of elastic plate and shell bending unity began as early as Kunming. When I arrived in Canada, I found that I could combine the macro and micro ideas of my mentor. During World War II, due to the lack of guidance from a unified plate and shell strength theory, aircraft crashes and high-speed aircraft test failures were common. &quot;Intrinsic Theory of Elastic Plate Shells&quot; is also one of the first papers in this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is included in the 60th birthday collection of American scientist von Karman. The authors of the collection also include physicists such as Einstein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To study plates and shells, Qian Weichang creatively used Riemannian geometry and tensor analysis to study the unified theory of plates and shells. Einstein studied general relativity and also used Riemannian geometry as a tool. So Qian Wei After the director reported the relevant results, it is not surprising that Einstein wanted to discuss and ask for advice from him.&quot; Dai Shiqiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving his Ph.D., Qian Weichang went to the von Kármán Jet Propulsion Institute at California Institute of Technology as a postdoc. He collaborated with von Karman on &quot;Torsion of Variable Torque Rate&quot;, which von Karman called the most classic elastic mechanics paper in his life. Both Synge and von Karman belonged to the &quot;Göttingen School&quot;, a mathematical school that emphasized application. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Xin Ji&#39;s most significant influence on Qian Weichang is not to drown in the sea of ​​applied mathematics, but to climb up after solving the problem. After you get a knife, you have to sharpen it again. It&#39;s fast and good, and it can chop melons and vegetables, but you can&#39;t always appreciate how good and sharp my knife is,&quot; Dai Shiqiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Weichang attaches great importance to practicality. When encountering practical problems that interest him, he does not limit himself to the subject areas in which he specializes. Some people call Qian Weichang a &quot;universal scientist&quot;. In 1970, domestic tank development faced difficulties: the four lead-acid batteries used in the tanks could only be started 15 times, and sometimes they could no longer walk after traveling dozens of kilometers. Qian Weichang is not a battery expert, but according to his creed, &quot;the needs of the country are my expertise&quot;, he organized a research team to study tank batteries while translating foreign documents and monographs. The next year, a high-energy battery was actually made that was the same size and weight as an ordinary battery but had eight times more energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in his later years, Qian Weichang will study new majors for the &quot;national needs&quot;. In 1980, Qian Weichang led a delegation to Hong Kong to participate in the International Chinese Computer Academic Conference. At the meeting, the Chinese computer technology of overseas companies such as IBM was relatively mature. Some people said disdainfully: It is too difficult for you to do this. China only needs to buy the products. Qian Weichang, who was over 60 years old at the time, began to learn computers and designed a macro glyph code for Chinese characters, referred to as &quot;Qian Code&quot;. At the first national Chinese character input program evaluation meeting, the single-person input speed of &quot;Qian Code&quot; ranked first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1946, Qian Weichang returned to China on the pretext of visiting relatives. In order not to attract attention, he only brought simple luggage and books. After returning to China, he worked as a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University. From 1946 to 1949, domestic prices soared, and professors lived in poverty. Qian Weichang&#39;s salary of 140,000 French currency was not enough to buy two thermos bottles. In order to supplement his family income, he went to Yenching University School of Engineering and Peking University School of Engineering to teach part-time, &quot;contracting&quot; applied mechanics and materials mechanics courses at the three schools, as well as some senior courses, teaching more than 15 hours a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following year, the Jet Propulsion Institute of California Institute of Technology invited him to return to the United States to work, promising generous remuneration that could solve his financial difficulties at the time.钱伟长在美领馆填写申请表，最后一行的问题是：若中美交战，你是否忠于美国？ &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;1957年，《人民日报》发表了《高等工业学校的培养目标问题》一文。这篇文章是钱伟长教育思想一次相对完整的呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在文中，他写道：“教学改革以前，高等工业学校教学工作是漫无目标的通才教学。在学习苏联经验进行教学改革以后，我们学到了环绕一个明确目标进行有计划的教学工作的一整套的制度和方法。这是很大的进步……教学质量在某些方面看是提高了，但是学生学习负担过重，独立工作能力较差，专业分得过细过专，以致在分配就业时发生了困难。这都不符合我们国家的要求，值得我们研究改进。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也因此，钱伟长在1957年以后被剥夺了上讲台的权利，仅保留“教授”的头衔，级别从一级教授降到了三级。后来邓小平主持教育工作时提出，“钱伟长不要待在实验室里，要让他上课。”后来又说，“有很多课开不出来，让钱伟长上嘛；有好多问题，你们不懂，他懂，让他开嘛！”于是从1961年到1965年，钱伟长先后去了清华九个系，写了九份讲义，别人再拿他的讲义去上课。晚年，他接受央视《大家》栏目专访，说：“我还是坚持我的一切。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儿子钱元凯当年也因身份问题，未能继续高等教育。在央视的镜头前，他回忆父亲的教诲：“上学学的东西，在人的一生里是一小块……人们可以剥夺你上学的机会，但是任何人剥夺不了你学习的机会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科学家的主业是发现问题，解决问题。有群众和科技工作者上门咨询或来函，他都尽力帮忙：他给工厂无偿翻译过机器说明书；为人民大会堂眺台边缘的“工”字梁稳定提供相应增强方案；在不利于施展科研能力的时代，他就靠一架手摇计算器，埋首计算“傅立叶三角级数之和”的大表，做一点实用的贡献，写定的稿子厚达30厘米。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他有一段话我就很欣赏：我每天都在考虑一些问题，考虑这些过去人家没有解决的问题，后来有人解决了我很高兴，后来这个问题还没有人解决，我就纳闷它为什么。凡是弄通一个问题我就很开心，比当个什么官都开心。”戴世强对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“文革”结束后，钱伟长开始四个现代化的全国演讲工作。 “钱先生何等聪明，他很会领会上面的精神，我们国家怎么建设（四个现代化）头头是道，谁都爱听……他一直讲到新疆伊犁，伊犁人家少数民族骑着马骑着骆驼都过来听他的讲课。”戴世强回忆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《钱伟长科学论文选集》的序言里，钱伟长袒露当时心境：“重新获得了科学工作的权利，欣逢1978年党中央召开全国科学大会，春风拂人，奋起之情油然而生。虽已年近七旬，还能为&#39;四化&#39;效力，感到无限幸福，我力图夺回久已逝去的良好岁月，夜以继日地工作着。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;超前的教育改革&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1983年，钱伟长离开清华，赴上海工业大学（后来合并为现上海大学）任校长。邓小平亲签的调令上写着：“此人任命不受年龄限制。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海大学校长的身份延续到钱伟长人生的最后一刻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于钱伟长赴任上海工业大学，曾流传着一种说法：钱伟长来到上海时，原以为是担任上海交通大学校长，得知是上海工业大学这所“四类学校”后，一度有些失望。戴世强告诉南方周末记者，事实情况并未如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说，1979年，年纪渐长的钱伟长动了离开清华的心思。华中工学院（现华中科技大学）、上海交通大学和上海工业大学三校皆有意请他做校长。当时华中工学院的院长朱九思是钱伟长挚交。 1980年，钱伟长创办国内第一本《应用数学和力学》杂志时，朱九思出钱出力帮忙办英文版。得知钱伟长要离开清华，愿意让贤。不过钱伟长基于多种考虑拒绝了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在上海交大与上海工业大学之间，有人劝他：“交大是名校，名校不要你的名教授来增加它的光芒，而上海工业大学是非名校，他们又是求才若渴，马上你可以真刀真枪大干特干。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚到上海工业大学，钱伟长很快展开改革。他提出要“拆掉四堵墙”。一是要拆掉学校和社会的墙，为了适应社会的变化和需求，精简、压缩了一些专业，增设应用数学与力学、精细化工等专业；二是要拆掉校内各科系、各专业的墙，大学前两年不细分专业，无论文理，都建议学习计算机；三是拆掉教育与科研之间的墙。最后一项则是拆掉旧的“教与学”观念的墙。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长反对照本宣科的老师，他曾说：“凡是照本宣科的老师，学生可以缺课，可以不上他的课，因为学生自己念得比他念得快。”这种对教师的要求，最初是受他的老师叶企孙影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1939年元旦，钱伟长历经曲折抵达西南联大时，老师叶企孙被调任至重庆研究院。钱伟长负责为叶企孙代讲一学期热力学课程。拿到叶的课程讲稿后，钱伟长发现，虽然要教授的基本原理如故，但例题已换成国际科技杂志上提出的最新问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每年虽然讲同一门课，但应该年年改变其基本理论的应用范围，使一门基础课一定要跟上科学发展的时代步伐，年年阅读大量有关科技国际期刊，消化吸收进教材中去，才算尽了教授的讲课责任。”钱伟长受此启发。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长同时提出对学校进行三项制度改革：学分制、选课制、短学期制。学分制和选课制最大程度上给了学生自主权，选课制让学生可以“跳槽”听课、跨年级选课，“学得特别好的学生可以多学些”。这样的教育改革，在当时远远领先于其他高校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王远弟是1980年代的大学生，他回忆，当时很多学校沿用苏联体制。 “工学院就是工学院，农学院就是农学院，专业之间区分得比较严。比如你是学钢铁的，出去之后马上就要进高炉厂，当技术人员。比如采矿系的学生，你要全面弄清楚怎么找矿、怎么采，出去马上就能用了，就是这样一种非常专的教育。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长并不认为学科之间，尤其是文理之间应该泾渭分明。 1998年，他发表于《光明日报》的文章表达得很清楚：“我认为自然科学、技术科学、社会科学和人文科学传统的学科分割界限即将会消除，它们将会结合成一个完整的科学知识体系。不同的学科之间不再是&#39;隔行如隔山&#39;，而是&#39;取长补短&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，钱伟长的科学研究，一定程度上也受益于他的国学功底。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戴世强举例说，钱伟长研究板壳的内禀理论，用的就是研究国学的思路，“念国学的人很会条分缕析、分门别类”。钱伟长根据板壳的特性，将其分成12个板、35种壳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今的上海大学校园，很多地方都遗留着这位终身校长的改革痕迹。在设计校园时，钱伟长曾特别提出，女厕所应建得比男生大一些。上海大学里有南方学校常见的连廊，方便选课的同学在不同教室走动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李银现在负责留学生的学工工作，开学第一课，她常带着学生熟悉校园环境。她对南方周末记者说，到达伟长楼时，她总会和学生们讲起这栋楼的由来：“那个时候，他觉得每个大学里，一定要有一个很隆重的（地方），把学生从家长手里接过来，等他毕业的时候，再很隆重地把他送向社会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;钱伟长非常注重培养学生的问题意识和创新精神。 “社会需要能带着满脑子的问题从大学走出来的人，要有创造性而非模仿性。”他认为，大学老师应该向学生说清楚，不要以为毕业后自以为学到很多东西，似乎什么都懂了，其实懂得还很少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从一个没有问题的人变成一个有问题的人，这就是大学教育的成功。”钱伟长说，如果学生觉得应该去解决这些问题，就会不断地进行创造和革新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;（注：主要参考文献：《钱伟长文选》第四、五、六卷）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[心理咨询中的性争议：“咨询师没有任何理由和来访者发生性关系”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258353]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/iyq1ToLamR5wWT8RlEbvi1gVIZVrifMYdJP2MdA1.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;中国心理学会的相关伦理守则明确规定，心理师不得与当前寻求专业服务者或其家庭成员发生任何形式的性或亲密关系。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月16日，网友“冬妮”发帖称，自己于2014到2018年间，接受咨询师李松蔚心理咨询服务，四年期间多次遭到性侵、精神虐待及心理控制等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月25日，心理咨询师李松蔚做出公开回应，称网帖指控纯属诽谤，否认自己实施过上述行为，并表示愿意接受心理咨询伦理的监管，接受相关调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2007年，中国心理学会制定公布了《临床与咨询心理学工作伦理守则（第一版）》（下称《伦理守则》），被视为心理咨询行业的一份可靠规约；2018年，中国心理学会对第一版进行了修订。两版守则皆对咨访关系中的性或亲密关系做出了严格规定：心理师不得与当前寻求专业服务者或其家庭成员发生任何形式的性或亲密关系；心理师不得为有过性或亲密关系的来访者提供专业服务；咨访关系结束三年内，不得与寻求专业服务者或其家庭成员发生任何形式的性或亲密关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来访者与咨询师因不当亲密与性关系而陷入争议，在中国心理学界，并非首次出现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年，心理咨询师王星波因与来访者发生不当性关系，被投诉至“中国心理学会临床与咨询心理学专业机构与专业人员注册系统伦理分委员会”，王星波当时是该注册系统的注册督导师。经过近半年的内外调查和当事人质证，该伦理分委会最终确认：王星波明确违背中国心理协会《伦理守则》，并被该注册系统除名。这是国内第一起被该注册系统公示的违反伦理案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，湖南心理咨询师罗登国，被长沙中级人民法院二审判定强制猥亵罪。该案终审判决文件显示，2017年5月起，被害人褚某因患抑郁症和双相情感障碍，在罗登国处寻求心理咨询服务5次。咨询过程中，罗登国主动和来访者谈起性相关的话题，并采用被褚某误认为心理治疗的方法，多次对被害人实施猥亵行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京大学临床心理学博士、大儒心理创始人徐凯文是中国心理学会心理工作咨询师委员会委员、伦理工作组组长，2014年时任该委员会秘书长和伦理委员，曾作为王星波事件伦理工作小组成员参与调查。他也曾作为组员参与了《伦理守则》第二版的修订。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据多次伦理事件的处理经验，徐凯文总结了心理工作中性与亲密争议可能的五种情形，并分别提出处理方向：一、咨询师确实实施性侵行为，属刑事问题，应走司法途径；二、咨询中存在不当性关系，属伦理问题，中国心理学会等专业协会需处理；三、咨询中产生了性移情，即来访者和咨询师之间产生情感反应，属临床议题，咨询师可与督导讨论；四、来访者有钟情妄想，可能有精神疾病，需要精神医疗帮助；五、诬告，属于法律问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于李松蔚事件，徐凯文对南方周末记者说，在事实尚未明确前，他不对该事件做出评价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月底，围绕咨询中可能存在的伦理不当和性侵害情形，徐凯文接受了南方周末的专访。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“我们没有办法完全判定他是不是完全自愿”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2014年的王星波事件是国内第一起被“注册系统”公示的咨询师与来访者不当性关系伦理投诉案，你当时作为伦理工作小组的成员，具体做了哪些工作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;来访者提出投诉，我们根据来访者提供的大量相关证据，经过先后历时近一年的调查取证，确认事实以后，我们伦理工作小组经过多轮讨论，按照《伦理守则》，提出处分意见。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在证明来访者遭遇性侵或性骚扰时，哪些可以成为证据？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得这个是很困难的，因为要证明两个人在单独相处的时候有过性关系，是不容易的。但是如果来访者能够提供比如暧昧的短信、微信，有咨询关系以外的联系，这样可以间接证明他们确实有过性关系的信息，在这种情况下，应该还是可以间接证明确实发生过不当的性关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2019到2021年，你担任过一位来访者的专家辅证人，当时的情况是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;就是咨询师和来访者发生了不当的性和亲密关系，来访者感到被伤害，所以来访者就状告了咨询师。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;专家辅证人在类似的性争议事件里起到什么作用？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;告诉法官为什么一个口腔科医生和他的病人谈恋爱不违反他的职业道德，但是一个心理咨询师和他的来访者发生性和亲密关系就是违反职业道德。因为心理咨询建立在信任的基础上，来访者向我们坦诚展示他内心的一切，首先根本上不是因为信任我们这个人，而是信任我们的职业。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打个比方，我做过一个阑尾炎的手术，全麻，全麻意味着我在大概在三四个小时中，完全失去对身体的控制，开个玩笑说是“任人宰割”。但是我为什么躺在手术台上“任人宰割”？我要解决我的阑尾炎。首先是因为我信任我的医生，不会因为我失去意识，做任何伤害我的事情，反而是帮助我。但是我跟这个医生可能根本就不认识，我为什么会信任一个不认识的人？是因为我信任的是职业，不是信任这个人。而且这里面也是有法律保障的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么心理咨询的过程跟做手术的过程相似的地方在于，只有来访者全然地信任我们，可以在我面前坦陈他经历过的一切痛苦、悲伤、羞耻、伤害，我们才有可能更好地帮助到他。那么我们要赢得这种信任，就不能辜负这种信任，而来访者来寻求帮助的时候，必定是脆弱的，他是容易受伤害的，他很痛苦，需要帮助，所以他是处在一个心理脆弱的状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来访者对我们的信任是心理咨询能够有效进行的前提和基础，所以绝对不能够破坏这种信任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更不能够利用这种信任去获取不当的利益。比如，如果我做一个咨询，我收他100块钱，但是来访者觉得很有帮助，要多给我100块钱，这也是不可以的。或者他要送我一个昂贵的礼物表示感谢，也是不可以的。这里面都涉及额外获益。因为我掌握了你内心的秘密，所以我理论上有可能会利用我对你内心秘密的掌握，去要挟你答应我的一些不恰当的要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像为什么高校里的老师不能跟学生发生性和亲密关系，因为他会决定你能不能拿到学分，能不能毕业，能不能拿到学位，这种权力上的不平等就有可能被滥用，产生不当利益的情形。为了避免这种情况，我们这个行业的职业伦理道德就要求任何这样不当的、额外的获益都不可以获得。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果有违反《伦理守则》的行为，哪怕来访者是自愿的，也会被认为是涉嫌违反心理咨询伦理。因为我们没有办法完全判定他是不是完全自愿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你去年督导过一个公益心理咨询项目，当时有一个高校的咨询师遭遇性相关指控，能否展开讲讲？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;涉及来访者和咨询师的隐私，我不能说太多细节。简单地讲，是来访者认为咨询师对她有这种性意味的行为。学校进行了非常认真的调查。当然，谁指控谁举证。你认为对方是怎么性骚扰你的，要提供相关证据，比如老师给学生发过非常暧昧的、有性意味的短信、微信，都被认为违反师德规范，至少要有这样间接的材料。这位投诉的学生没有提出这样的证据，谈的都是她的主观感受，也没有发生实质性的行为，那当然这个指控就不成立。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/H9QNNJcZX730QWNkD7Mee1KvCKTYL5BiYzSzB16a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/H9QNNJcZX730QWNkD7Mee1KvCKTYL5BiYzSzB16a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253593&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2008年的美剧《扪心问诊》中，展示了一位女性来访者对心理咨询师产生移情的案例。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;注册系统除名是最重的处罚&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《中国心理学会临床与咨询心理学工作伦理守则(第二版)》涉及性关系的规则有两条，这两条的制定是出于怎样的考虑？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这个规则的制定实际上是心理咨询行业的共识。类似这样的规定在国外早就有了，从这个意义上来说，是向国外心理学界学习的结果。这样一种不当性关系会对来访者造成比较严重的身心的损害，所以是一个明令禁止的行为。心理咨询伦理当中最重要的原则就是善行原则，以来访者利益最大化为利益第一，是我们工作的宗旨。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那这些年，《伦理守则》里和性有关的规定有发生变化吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;基本没有。如果说有什么变化的话，那么包括以电子方式发生性和亲密关系的行为，也是被禁止的，是违反伦理的。网络性爱这种没有发生实际身体接触的也被算在里边。在咨询关系里，所有跟来访者有任何形式的性和亲密关系，都被认为是对来访者的剥削、伤害和利用。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;网络性爱怎么界定？没有身体接触的情况下，网络上的表白、调情、暧昧等是否算在内？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这方面暂时还没有实践的案例。据我所知，我国对于网络性爱、虚拟性爱目前也还没有相关法律规定。但经过三年疫情后，网络电话等远程咨询越来越发展，因此发生这样问题的可能性越来越大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从心理学的角度上来说，如果咨询师对于来访者实施了不当的性行为，会在心理上对来访者造成怎样的伤害？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我想对他可能造成的创伤最主要是在信任层面。因为来访者相信我们会以他的利益为重，相信我们会保守他的秘密，我们不会利用来访者对咨询师的信任去做伤害他的事情，但是这一切就发生了，那么他进而可能会对所有人难以建立信任。因为他可能受到过他人的伤害，这种伤害如果在咨询关系中再次发生的话，伤害可能会显得更严重。应该被信任的咨询师都不可信任，可能所有人都不可信，或者大多数人都不能信任。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;相比一般情况下的性骚扰或性侵，当它在咨询师和来访者之间发生，会带来附加的伤害吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;无论什么职业，性侵或者性骚扰的行为首先都是违反法律的。如果来访者是非自愿的，那就是性侵和性骚扰，是法律问题。但如果来访者是自愿的，在其他行业可能不是问题，但是对我们这个行业来说，它就是伦理问题。因为你可能利用了来访者对心理咨询职业的信任。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当一个女性来访者，在心理咨询过程当中感受到了这方面的不适，现在心理咨询行业里，有没有可以投诉的渠道？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;可以向中国心理学会临床心理学注册工作委员会的伦理工作组投诉，但是投诉的渠道不一定能够非常适用，因为这是一个学术组织的伦理投诉机制，它并不是一个国家政府性质的机构，如果被投诉的咨询师不是中国心理学会临床心理学注册工作委员会的成员，就很难去做后面的投诉处理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;也就是说，在国内，如果一个人想成为心理咨询师，并没有准入门槛？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对。目前来说没有严格意义上的准入门槛。原来是有人社部的心理咨询师考试，但是这个考试2017年停止了。现在除了当时已经获得人社部心理咨询师资质的（心理咨询师），以及精神科医生和心理治疗师外，其他从业者并没有明确的证照。我们国家这方面的证照制度还没有建立起来。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;是否可以理解为，在“注册系统”里注册的这些咨询师可以被视为正规从业者？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得可以，但不能说只有“注册系统”的人员才是正规的。也有大量受过很好训练的，包括获得硕士甚至博士学位的，包括留学回来的（人员），以及有丰富临床经验和良好职业操守的咨询师并没有参加注册，因为这不是一个强制性的国家标准。所以这不能是唯一的标准，但是它是一个靠谱的标准。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《伦理守则》看上去只是一种行业约束，遇到具体的性争议事件时，中国心理学会能起到什么作用？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;就像你刚刚提到的王某某（注：王星波）的情况，这应该就是最典型的华人世界第一起不当性关系伦理投诉案。但是我们做的事情也就是对他进行永久除名，也就是说他不再能够被接受成为“注册系统”的注册人员——注册心理师或注册督导师。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这是现在能做出的最严格的反应吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;哪怕被系统除名，被投诉的咨询师仍可以继续进行心理咨询工作？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，理论上来讲是这样的。实际上解决的方式就应该建立证照制度，就像医师有证照，如果被吊销执照，他就不能行医，否则就是非法行医，甚至要追究刑事责任。但是我们现在还没有建立证照制度，所以在这一点上比较困难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;对道德自律性要求比较高的行业&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有文献认为，性伦理失范在来访者侧显示为“情欲性移情”（erotic&amp;nbsp;tranference）和“情欲化移情”（eroticized transference），这是否是你所说的“性移情”？在咨询关系里，为什么会有性移情的产生？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有各种各样的原因，可能很难用一句话概括。比如来访者有过被性侵的经历，然后她可能会产生一种心理，觉得自己所有的价值就是在于她的身体，那么她要用她的身体去获得有权力、有权威的人的认可，这是一种可能性，这是非常个体化的。所以很难讲哪一条是绝对的，要看具体的情况。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，心理咨询关系也是一种人际关系，一种专业的、职业的人际关系。在心理咨询和心理治疗过程中，咨询师会以来访者为中心，去深入地共情、理解、感受来访者并给与回应，这是一种全然的关心和无条件的支持，既是专业的也存在某种非现实性，因为这样的几乎单向的、全然以来访者为中心的人际关系，在现实生活中是一种理想化的存在。因为即便是最亲密的家人、朋友间的人际关系，也是双向的，既会给予和付出，也会得到同样类似的支持和回报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾经和一位爱上自己的咨询师来投诉的来访者访谈过，她在咨询中会感受到咨询师是世界上最能理解和支持自己的人，也是最体贴和温暖的人，因此爱上了咨询师。但一旦进入了恋人甚至婚姻状态，来访者很快就感到越来越失望，因为她发现那个全然以她为中心的人一旦变成了恋人和夫妻，也会对自己有情感诉求以及并不能全然以自己为中心了。继而这种失望导致婚姻关系的破裂，甚至导致对对方当时和自己相恋的动机的怀疑，最后还对簿公堂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种从天堂到地狱的感受转变就是跨越了专业咨询关系的界限，发生性和亲密关系必然的结果。但并不是说，咨询关系为来访者提供这样的安全、信任、温暖、支持的关系是不真实或不科学的，来访者在其现实生活中遭遇了困难和挫折，产生了心理的痛苦和困扰，因此来寻求帮助，咨询师为其提供心理疗愈的环境，就好像一个人生病后，需要住到非常洁净的医院病房里，有专业的医生、护士提供专业科学的医疗设备、环境、营养、药物来帮助其提高免疫力，恢复健康，甚至在其免疫力低下时还要住进无菌室，负压病房，病人在医生、护士的精心照料下，增强抵抗力，恢复免疫力，健康后就能出院正常生活了——在心理咨询中，来访者就能具备自己解决好自己的人际关系、亲密关系问题的能力，这个时候就能结束咨询了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来访者感到自己爱上咨询师并不是错，但可能是错觉。咨询师需要清晰地认识到这一点，并将其作为咨询中重要的临床议题进行专业的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;来访者是否需要避免这种性移情？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得性移情的发生是有某种必然性的。它不是一个可怕的事情，它是个很正常的心理现象。所以如果发生这样情况，应该在咨询中加以讨论和解决，这本身是咨询重要的议题。这是一个专业问题。咨询师遇到这样问题，如果没有经验，可以去跟他的督导或者他的上级的咨询师讨论，怎么样更好地帮助来访者处理好这一切。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果咨询师对来访者产生了反移情，这种情况下怎么办？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;咨询师也有可能会出现这种情况，咨询师也是人，也有七情六欲，也有他自己没有解决好的个人议题。他确实可能会错把来访者的性移情当作是爱情，或者甚至于爱上来访者。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是咨询师的训练和职业道德要求，无论什么情况下，我们都不可以跟来访者有这样的性和亲密关系。这就好像是这个行业中，每个人都不折不扣去执行的法律。为何要执行这一条，是因为此前国外心理行业出现了很多这样的情况，对来访者造成了很大的伤害，对行业的声誉也造成很大伤害，所以是明令禁止的。如果他能够处理好这样的临床议题，当然最好；他处理不好，应该找督导；找了督导还是处理不好，他应该停止咨询，然后把咨询工作转介给更合适的咨询师，而不是继续做下去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这样的话，对于咨询师的道德自律性要求很高？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对。我们这个行业是对道德自律性要求比较高的行业。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果咨询师发出了不当的性或亲密接触邀请，来访者可以怎么保护自己？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;首先，建议来访者要有清晰的认识，在咨询中发生的性和亲密关系是在特定咨询环境中发生的，并非完全自然真实的情感，无论是来访者感到爱上了咨询师，还是咨询师向来访者表达爱意。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，建议告知咨询师，根据《伦理守则》，如果咨询师发出了性和亲密关系的邀请，咨询师已经违反了相关规定，可以要求其停止相关行为并建议其接受督导。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再次，如果咨询师继续有相关言语、行为，建议向咨询师所在机构进行投诉。如果咨询师本人就是机构负责人，或者这是私人机构，例如咨询师的个人工作室，建议考虑终止咨询关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;心理咨询行业应该建立证照制度&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你提到，心理咨询过程关于性与亲密的争议，还会涉及钟情妄想和诬告的情形，能否介绍一下这两种情况？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;钟情妄想是一个严重的精神疾病，比如经常有明星被疯狂的粉丝爱上，粉丝认为明星是爱他的，实际上明星见都没有见过他，明确否认对他有任何爱意。这是钟情妄想的例子。妄想就是跟现实不符，并且不能够被现实所纠正。妄想是基于生物遗传因素，不需要有任何现实基础和心理社会原因。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;诬告的情形通常是出于怎样的动机？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;诬告的情况，可能是对咨询师不满，为了毁掉咨询师的名誉，并没有依据事实或者捏造了一些事实，然后指控咨询师。所以我说，“事实是智慧”。先把事实搞清楚，究竟有没有过发生性和亲密关系？如果有，那么咨询师至少是违反了伦理，甚至违反法律。如果这个行为没有发生过，那么违法和违反伦理就无从谈起了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;诬告者需要付出怎样的代价？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;诬告主要是涉及名誉权的问题，侮辱、诽谤他人、损害他人名誉权的，有权要求停止侵害、恢复名誉，消除影响、赔礼道歉，并可以要求赔偿损失。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果核心证据缺失的情况下，伦理工作小组或整个心理学界、行业对性争议事件的处理方法是怎样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这方面还是很困难的。确实要认定这个是很困难的，这个显然不是心理学家擅长的工作。所以谁主张，谁举证，需要有足够的直接或间接证据能证明该行为发生过。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;面对这类来访者和咨询师间的不当性关系，我们还能做什么来规避或减少类似情形的发生？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;让更多的来访者知道这一点，是会有帮助的。可能很多来访者不知道咨询师和来访者发生性关系这点违反咨询师的伦理道德，这个很值得去和公众宣传。当然来访者知道他能够拒绝，发生类似情况也知道怎么保护自己的话，这个显然是有效的方式。咨询师真的性侵来访者的情况不是没有，但是我想还是很少，犯罪行为毕竟是少数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当人们需要心理咨询服务，如何找到靠谱的咨询师？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;来访者要审慎地选择咨询师和咨询机构，就好像看病的时候也要小心，应该去正规医院是同样的道理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当寻求医疗诊治时，我知道什么是公立三甲医院，什么是私立医院。心理咨询行业有这样的分级吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐凯文：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;现在行业还没有成熟到这个程度，但是我想会有这么一天的，就好像二十多年前我刚开始当医生的时候，医疗行业也还没有成熟到现在这个程度，所以会有一个过程。我们也希望媒体能够帮助我们行业一起呼吁国家加强这方面的立法。现在有《中华人民共和国精神卫生法》相关的法律条文，但对于这个行业管理来说还是不够的，特别希望引起政府和法律界人士的重视，能够修订相关的法律。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《精神卫生法》是11年前颁布、10年前开始实施的，不够系统和全面，还不能够适应现代。现在的中国心理咨询行业不可同日而语，心理健康需求大大增加了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最简单直接的解决方式，就是建立执照制度。拿到执照才能够做心理咨询师，然后接受国家和行业协会的监管。如果有违反伦理、职业道德和法律的行为，他就会被吊销执照，如果在没有执照的情况下从事这样的工作，就是非法行医，可以追究刑事责任。 &lt;/p>;
