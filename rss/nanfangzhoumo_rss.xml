The hospital informed me that a specialist from Kaifeng would perform the surgery and that a cash payment of 3,000 yuan would be required. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surgery was performed by experts from outside hospitals, the surgical fee was higher than the market price, and the cash payment was all reminders that Mr. Ma&#39;s father had undergone a &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery. &quot;Flying Knife&quot;, as the name suggests, &quot;hits the flying knife to open the knife&quot;. Doctors leave their hospitals to visit other places in their spare time, mostly performing surgical operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s interesting is that the patient’s condition was not good, and Mr. Ma wanted to repay the 3,000 yuan surgical fee charged by the surgeon. This was based on the “Interim Regulations on the Management of Physicians’ Out-of-Home Consultation” issued by the former Ministry of Health in 2005. Regulations regarding consultation fees should be paid uniformly to the consulting medical institution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident was reported by Henan Metropolis Channel, it immediately attracted attention in the industry: Should &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery exist? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some doctors believe that &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery currently lacks institutional protection, brings risks to both patients and doctors, and should be banned. Some doctors also hold objections, believing that &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery helps experts earn income, patients receive convenient treatment, grassroots hospitals gain technical experience, and local medical insurance funds can stay local, so it should be supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, &quot;throwing knife&quot; surgery remains in a legal gray area. Policies that can make &quot;flying knives&quot; comply have encountered many obstacles in the hospital&#39;s internal management and institutional processes. Under the huge market demand at the grassroots level, private &quot;flying knives&quot; have always existed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Income issue&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For doctors, the core reason for the long-lasting success of &quot;Flying Knife&quot; is &quot;increased income.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, consultation and multi-site practice are the two main ways to formalize &quot;flying knife&quot;, but the remuneration standards for both must be consistent with the salary system within the major practice institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2005 &quot;Interim Provisions on the Management of Physicians&#39; Out-of-Home Consultation&quot; mentioned that the consultation fees involved in the consultation shall be subject to the regulations of the location of the inviting medical institution, and additional fees may be charged as appropriate on the basis of local regulations. The increase will be determined by the provincial price department in conjunction with the health administrative department at the same level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The range of &quot;discretionary&quot; is destined not to be too high. Cheng Sheng, the department director of a secondary hospital in Beijing, told Southern Weekend reporters that the cost of inter-hospital consultations in Beijing is about 300 to 300 yuan. 500 yuan, &quot;Which expert is willing to waste time and energy by making such a trip?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the salary of multi-site practice, the former National Health and Family Planning Commission issued the &quot;Regulations on Promoting and Standardizing the Multi-site Practice of Physicians&quot; in 2014. &quot;Notice of Several Opinions&quot; stipulates that the salary of multi-site practicing physicians is determined by consultation between the medical institution and the physician at the place of practice based on factors such as actual working hours, workload, and work performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the income that doctors who perform daily surgeries in our hospital can earn, a respiratory doctor in Shanghai once revealed to a Southern Weekend reporter that his remuneration for each operation is about 300 yuan. A hard-working doctor Two or three operations are performed every day, and the monthly performance bonus income is about 30,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Corresponding to this is the income from &quot;flying knives&quot;. Wang Gui, who works as a &quot;flying knife&quot; agency, revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the cost of a &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery for a patient ranges from 3,000 yuan to 9,000 yuan, with the agency taking a 10% commission and the rest going to the doctor. The main factors that determine the cost are the doctor&#39;s level, the difficulty of the operation, and the distance of practice. An operation priced at 10,000 yuan may require the support of multiple doctors across provinces, and the operation lasts 7 to 8 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Agents tend to stratify experts. Top experts are generally subject leaders, master&#39;s and doctoral tutors, and department directors of top hospitals in their cities. These doctors are the first choice for foreign aid in large hospitals in provincial capital cities. The seniority and popularity of ordinary experts are low, and the general location of &quot;flying knife&quot; is county-level hospitals. “There are quite a lot of surgeons in general surgery, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, hepatobiliary surgery, thoracic surgery, and orthopedics,” Wang Gui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without an intermediary like Wang Gui, &quot;throwing knives&quot; mostly occur between doctors who have personal relationships. Most of the inviting doctors come from district and county hospitals, or have studied in the expert&#39;s department, or have studied under the same discipline. &quot;Both parties must know the basics.&quot; said Cheng Lei, director of thoracic surgery at a tertiary hospital in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, regardless of the form, compared with the above-mentioned &quot;Regulations&quot; and &quot;Notice&quot;, &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery is expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Formalization efforts have never stopped&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of some doctors, in addition to economic benefits, &quot;Flying Knife&quot; can also showcase their skills and improve &quot; Jianghu status&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Lei told Southern Weekend reporters that he once went to overseas hospitals to demonstrate technology under the organization of a surgical instrument manufacturer, helping a tumor ablation surgery to be implemented nationwide. “It’s more like a flying knife than a flying knife. It’s about teaching.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even as the chief physician of thoracic surgery, Cheng Lei has to ask for help from colleagues who can handle difficult surgeries. Cheng Lei&#39;s father was diagnosed with aortic dissection in a hospital in Jiangsu and suspected aortic aneurysm. The local hospital did not have the conditions for surgery, and it was hundreds of kilometers away from Shanghai for treatment. Once the tumor ruptured on the way, it would be life-threatening. Finally, Doctor &quot;Flying Knife&quot; solved the urgent problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, given the reality of uneven distribution of medical resources, governments at all levels have never stopped trying to bring &quot;flying knives&quot; onto the formal track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2005 &quot;Interim Regulations on the Management of Physicians&#39; Out-of-Home Consultation&quot; proposed an inter-hospital consultation system, and the 2009 &quot;Notice of the Ministry of Health on Issues Concerning the Multi-site Practice of Physicians&quot; responded to the concerns from all walks of life about allowing multiple sites. The call to practice. Since 2020, the construction of medical consortia has accelerated, and the consultation, training, and referral systems of hospitals within the same medical consortium have become increasingly mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It can be understood that if an expert wants to perform surgery in the same hospital for a long time, he will usually apply for a multi-site practice registration. If it is a one-time operation, a consultation method will be used.” Senior Jingheng Law Firm Partner Zhang Li, who has been a doctor for six years, explained this to a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the multi-site practice system, there was a restrictive rule that &quot;a doctor is not allowed to practice in more than three medical institutions.&quot; However, the &quot;Physician Practice Registration Management Measures&quot; promulgated in 2017 allowed doctors to Practice in multiple locations across provinces. It also stipulates that doctors who practice in multiple locations within the same provincial administrative region of their main practice institution only need to register with these practice institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change from a registration system to a filing system means that doctors can practice at multiple locations without permission from the main practice institution and the local health department. With the support of such policies, a set of data released by the National Health Commission in October 2020 showed that the number of multi-site practicing doctors in the country has reached 260,000, four times that of 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Hospitals don’t want to see their doctors flying around”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are still many obstacles to the promotion of multi-site practice, which also provides “ Throwing knives&quot; creates the soil of reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewees mentioned soft discipline in hospitals. The Southern Weekend reporter obtained the &quot;Multi-site Practice Management Standards for Physicians&quot; implemented by a well-known hospital in Southwest China, which requires doctors to complete the multi-site practice registration, but also to register with the local health bureau and submit it to the hospital. Photo, physician qualification certificate, practicing physician license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cumbersome in-hospital approval process is not an isolated case. According to public reports from the self-media &quot;Seeing Medical Circle&quot;, in 2020, the &quot;Measures for the Management of Multi-site Practice of Physicians (Trial)&quot; issued by Changsha First Hospital stipulates that doctors who practice multi-site must have intermediate professional titles or above, and their departments must be above. The department&#39;s year-end KPI assessment results for the first year rank above the average level, etc. The document also states that non-commandatory activities in medical institutions outside the hospital must be approved by the department director, reported to the medical department and the leader of the hospital in charge, and can only be registered after approval by the hospital office meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Multiple Practice Management Standards for Physicians&quot; of the above-mentioned Southwest Regional Hospital requires that multi-site practicing physicians should sign a labor agreement with the multi-site practice institution on the practice category, scope of practice, employment period, work tasks, Medical responsibilities, time arrangements, assessment methods, salary, insurance benefits, etc. are clarified, and the agreement is filed with the Medical Department of our hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pang Liang, a surgeon at a private hospital in Beijing, told Southern Weekend reporters that some hospitals have banned doctors from practicing outside their homes. One of the reasons is that they are worried that patients will be diverted to other hospitals, which will affect their income. Xie Rushi, honorary president of the Shenzhen Non-Public Medical Institutions Association, analyzed from a purely managerial psychological perspective, &quot;Hospitals don&#39;t want to see their doctors flying around. This is normal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Flying knives&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Controversies continue, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The people will not hold the officials accountable&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Flying knife&quot; surgeries performed without permission may be classified as illegal medical practice and subject to severe punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the technical appraisal of medical malpractice determines that it constitutes a medical malpractice and bears the main responsibility, at the administrative level, the &quot;flying knife&quot; doctor may be suspended from practicing or even have his physician&#39;s practicing certificate revoked; if he violates criminal law, the doctor may also Prosecuted on suspicion of medical malpractice. If the medical malpractice is of equal liability and below, the &quot;flying knife&quot; doctor may be held administratively liable. As for the civil compensation part, the law stipulates that the subject of compensation is medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a large extent, disputes related to &quot;throwing knives&quot; still belong to the category of &quot;people do not complain and officials do not investigate&quot;, and the patient&#39;s will has a great influence on the development of the case. In one case that Zhang Li represented, when a &quot;flying knife&quot; expert performed a chest nodule operation, the patient suffered from massive bleeding and &quot;could not get off the operating table.&quot; Afterwards, the doctor came to apologize. The family also believed that it is not easy for the country to train a doctor and chose to give up administrative complaints and criminal reports. Therefore, the &quot;flying knife&quot; doctor did not involve administrative or criminal penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in another case, the doctor performed a breast plastic surgery, and the patient also suffered from massive bleeding during the operation. After recovering, he reported it to the health authority of the hospital where the expert worked. In the end, the expert was administratively dismissed, transferred from his job, and fined to suspend his practice for three months. This is the &quot;throwing knife&quot; case with the most serious punishment that Zhang Li has ever come across. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if no medical accident occurs, doctors may be &quot;troubled&quot; by patients. A well-known example is that in 2019, a Shanxi patient asked doctors from Beijing Tiantan Hospital to perform neurosurgical stent implantation. According to China Youth Daily, the patient&#39;s family secretly videotaped and reported the incident while paying 10,000 yuan in cash for &quot;throwing a knife&quot;. As a result, the doctor involved and the doctor who helped collect and transfer the money to the hospital were suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another concern is that &quot;flying knife&quot; doctors will leave after performing the surgery, leaving post-operative care to grassroots hospitals, but the latter may lack relevant knowledge, posing hidden dangers to patients&#39; well-being. Pang Liang mentioned a medical accident in 2019: a male patient underwent gastric volume reduction surgery in a hospital, which was performed by a foreign doctor who participated in academic exchanges. Five days after the operation, the patient died suddenly. The autopsy report showed that the patient suffered from secondary gastric leakage, acute purulent peritonitis, and peritoneal pus and blood effusion after surgery, leading to infection, toxic shock, and death from multiple organ failure. This may be the result of a lack of appropriate post-operative care in local hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The patient feels that the effect is not as expected, and wants a refund. If you don&#39;t refund the money, I will sue you. I will sue you for sure.&quot; Cheng Lei said that the gray attribute of &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery is the natural instinct of doctors. The weak point is that high fees are not on the table. When encountering disputes, most grassroots hospitals that issue &quot;flying knife&quot; invitations will not go to the trouble of experts, but will quietly pay to &quot;settle the matter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Legal and compliance problems need to be solved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The seemingly beautiful &quot;flying knife&quot; has not yet come out of its non-compliant nature, which means that The ability of patients and doctors to resist risks is extremely fragile. For example, some hospitals will insure doctors with medical malpractice liability insurance to help reduce economic losses after an accident, but unregistered &quot;flying knife&quot; surgeries are obviously not covered by claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors have also gradually figured out a &quot;semi-compliant&quot; out-of-hospital consultation operation path. Before visiting a doctor, ask the primary hospital to issue an invitation letter and complete the registration in your own hospital. After the consultation is completed, an additional amount of money will be charged on top of the normal income. The latter is not included in the financial process, nor is it paid directly by the patient to the specialist, but changes hands through the inviting hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is what is done in daily life. There needs to be a certain amount of supplementary income so that people are willing to go for consultation.” Xie Rushi told Southern Weekend reporters that in this way, the behavior of “throwing knives” itself is legal. If it has been reported, it is a legal medical behavior, but part of the income is a red envelope, which is still shady and may face investigation and punishment by the disciplinary inspection department within the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For self-protection, doctors will also screen &quot;flying knife&quot; cases to avoid participating in &quot;flying knife&quot; surgeries that are too risky. Wang Gui said that after a patient requests an expert from outside the hospital to perform the surgery, the doctor in charge of the hospital will evaluate whether the patient&#39;s family members are &quot;relatively sensitive&quot;, prone to finding faults, and whether the financial conditions are sufficient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Pang Liang&#39;s vision, in order to let the &quot;flying knife&quot; income come into the light, large hospitals should establish a public expert database and clearly mark the price of each expert according to department and level for patients and Primary hospital selection. This price can put a gap between the salary of daily practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is more important is to let &quot;Flying Knife&quot; truly gain status. Wang Gui&#39;s institution has complete diagnostic and treatment business qualifications and controls private hospitals. Experts are registered in this hospital to practice in multiple locations, and are then dispatched by the hospital to provide consulting services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Li&#39;s view, this way doctors can bypass the public medical institutions in their main practice areas and legally conduct out-of-town consultations. In an article teaching doctors how to legally &quot;throw a knife&quot;, he called this practice &quot;long-range missiles&quot;, while &quot;intercontinental missiles&quot; are founding or joining a doctor group or clinic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The doctor group mainly connects the supply and demand sides of consultation and dispatches group doctors to primary hospitals to provide services. However, the doctor group does not belong to a medical institution. The doctor is still affiliated with a main medical practice institution-either the doctor&#39;s old employer or a private hospital within the doctor group. In essence, doctor groups are just intermediary platforms, and doctors still follow the path of multi-site practice or consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Rushi, who has participated in the establishment of several doctor groups, said that the doctor group can sign a notification agreement with the patient or the hospital where the patient is dispatched to determine the price of &quot;flying knife&quot; surgery, and charge in the name of the doctor group. This operation makes the &quot;flying knife&quot; fee in the gray area compliant. However, the problem faced by the doctor group is that it is very difficult to reach a cooperative relationship with the dispatched hospital through bidding, and it is impossible to form a business model by negotiating cooperation with patients one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even with complete qualifications, Wang Gui’s organization is still very cautious. Their declared business model is to provide doctors’ consulting services, including preoperative evaluation, postoperative rehabilitation plan formulation, etc., but does not include surgical performance. &quot;In fact, we can hold a knife, but we can&#39;t say so because there is no document allowing us to do so.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Interviewee Requirements, Cheng Lei, Wang Gui, and Pang Liang are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新冠疫苗：每年秋天来一针？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256998]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/Tsc8wnKvCrJ8AxgwNj3kCNxQHmvTU6pdVq7qDbnD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/Tsc8wnKvCrJ8AxgwNj3kCNxQHmvTU6 pdVq7qDbnD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251239&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some countries, the new coronavirus vaccine may be recommended every year like influenza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a recommendation that everyone over six months old should get a shot of the new coronavirus vaccine this fall and winter. A few days ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two new versions of the vaccine from Moderna and Pfizer. The new version of the vaccine targets a variant of the Omicron virus called XBB.1.5. , this strain is widespread in most countries around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccination remains the best way to prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Vaccines can also reduce long-term COVID-19 effects. According to recommendations issued by the CDC, anyone who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past two months can receive this new version of the vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have more tools to prevent the serious consequences of the new coronavirus.” said Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the US CDC. The reason for issuing this recommendation is that the new coronavirus is still mutating, new subtypes are emerging one after another, and the protective effect of the vaccine has declined sharply over time. Vaccination with the new version of the vaccine can better protect public health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CDC&#39;s independent advisory committee voted 13:1 to recommend universal vaccination of this vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the supporters, Dr. Sandra Fryhoffer, associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine in the United States, believes that severe COVID-19 may occur in people of all ages, including people without underlying diseases. , coupled with the fact that many people have not received booster shots before, this means that the overall immunity to the new coronavirus is declining, so vaccination should be recommended for all people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Should ordinary people take the vaccine or not?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It has been more than three years since vaccination was encouraged, but the vaccine strategy is quietly changing. Most countries have not done so like the United States. Likewise, booster shots are recommended for everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the British government announced that the new version of the booster shot would be provided free of charge to seniors over 65 years old, frontline medical staff and vulnerable groups. France does not recommend booster shots for non-vulnerable groups. Germany has no plan for a booster shot in the autumn, although it has previously recommended that high-risk groups should receive a dose of the new crown vaccine every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers generally believe that because the main role of the new coronavirus vaccine is to prevent severe illness rather than infection, high-risk groups will benefit the most from vaccination. There is still controversy in the scientific community as to whether low-risk groups and minors should be vaccinated again. “It makes a lot of sense to get booster shots for the elderly, people with underlying diseases and immune deficiencies,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In the past three years since the spread of the new coronavirus, many people have gradually become numb to the virus infection, and the number of people choosing to be vaccinated has also gradually declined. But in fact, whether in the United States or China, there are many people who are repeatedly infected with the new coronavirus. CDC scientists report that hospitalizations for COVID-19 have been increasing since mid-July, and while most of them are young children and older adults, half of children under five hospitalized do not have underlying health conditions, a reminder that Even otherwise healthy people may be at risk of severe illness from COVID-19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the upcoming autumn and winter virus epidemic seasons, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and new coronaviruses are likely to be cross-infected, which will cause serious consequences for vulnerable groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Prepare before winter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In our country, the overall epidemic situation is in a state of sporadic sporadic spread, but the new coronavirus has not disappeared. The phenomenon of transmission still exists, and there are many people around us who experienced &quot;two positives&quot; a few months ago and are now experiencing &quot;three positives&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Based on the fact that COVID-19 is extremely contagious, antibodies naturally attenuate after being infected with COVID-19, and there is no absolutely protective COVID-19 vaccine, most people will be infected 1-3 times a year.” The Third People of Shenzhen City Professor Lu Hongzhou, director of the hospital, explained, “It will not have a particularly big impact on people with normal immune function.” However, for people with low immune function such as the elderly, diabetes, and underlying cancer diseases, Lu Hongzhou recommends regular vaccination with the new crown vaccine every year. Vaccination strategies can include combined immunization with nasal spray vaccine and subcutaneous injection vaccine, and multivalent COVID-19 combination vaccine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 25, 2023, the &quot;Recent New Coronavirus Vaccination Work Plan for Key Populations&quot; issued by the Comprehensive Group of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council proposed that targeted new coronavirus vaccination be implemented for key populations such as the elderly. It is clear that during the epidemic period of the XBB variant strain of the new coronavirus, focusing on the autumn and winter of this year, vaccination containing the antigen components of the XBB variant strain is recommended as a priority. Experts call on people who have been infected and have not completed basic immunity to receive one dose of vaccine 3 months after infection. This will help provide better protection for people at high risk of severe illness and death in possible subsequent epidemics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some experts predict that the number of new coronavirus infections will increase after the start of school in September. According to the immunity cycle, the next wave of the new crown epidemic may appear around November this autumn. At this time, it is also the flu season. The superimposition of COVID-19 and influenza may lead to an increase in severe respiratory infections. Therefore, it is recommended to receive both influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. This is also recommended by the WHO - superposition of the two vaccines can maximize the prevention of severe illness. and mitigate the risk of viral cross-infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The increase in hospitalizations and deaths shows that coronavirus disease is here to stay and the world still needs tools to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, in September 2023 Emphasized at the media briefing on the 6th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天降烟头烫伤女婴，DNA比对锁定嫌疑人：胜于住户连坐多矣！丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256968]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Some time ago, a baby girl in Zhengzhou was burned by a cigarette butt falling from the sky in a community. The police collected blood from all the residents upstairs and compared the DNA on the cigarette butts, and successfully identified the suspect who threw the cigarette butts. This is another case of using high-tech means to identify the suspect of throwing objects from high altitude. It also reminds you again that throwing objects from high altitude is extremely harmful and the probability of police intervention to solve the case is greatly increased. Don’t take chances and try the law yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to The Paper, at the end of August, Ms. Huang was taking her 4-month-old baby for a walk downstairs when an unextinguished cigarette butt fell from the sky and burned the child&#39;s shoulders and neck. Although the surveillance cameras in the community only cover one floor and there is no high-altitude surveillance, it is impossible to find out who threw the cigarette butts through the video. However, the police successfully found the suspect who threw the object at high altitude by collecting blood from all the residents upstairs to test DNA. Not only will this person be liable for civil torts, but he is also likely to be subject to criminal penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tall buildings provide us with more living and working space and have become a symbol of modernization. However, they also bring the risk of throwing and falling objects from high altitudes. Carrying high-speed kinetic energy converted from high-altitude potential energy, even an egg weighing tens of grams may cause serious injury, not to mention other dangerous items. In recent years, there have been constant news about vehicles being damaged by objects thrown and falling from heights, killing and injuring people. In 2016, an iron fitness ball fell from the sky in Suining, Sichuan, killing a baby girl under one year old; in 2020, another 14-month-old baby in Shaoxing, Zhejiang was hit in the head by a brick thrown from upstairs. Causing brain death...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is unlikely that an unextinguished cigarette butt will injure someone, the risk of causing a fire or scalding someone is not small. In addition to the recent case in Zhengzhou, a similar case occurred in a community in Luzhou, Sichuan in 2021. A cigarette butt dropped from a high altitude burned through the roof of a baby car and almost burned the baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, casualties or property losses caused by falling objects from high altitudes were usually dealt with as civil infringements, and the victims had to collect evidence on their own to prosecute. Unless the impact was extremely serious, the police generally would not intervene in the investigation. The individual&#39;s ability to collect evidence is naturally very weak, and in most cases the perpetrator cannot be found. What to do? The previous law stipulates that in this case, all &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; will be compensated. That is to say, once an incident involving a high-altitude object injuring someone occurs and the perpetrator cannot be found, all residents upstairs (except those who have evidence to prove their Those who are not the perpetrators (for example, if the building is vacant and no one lives in it, etc.) will be &quot;sitting together.&quot; Although this provision allows the victim to receive compensation, it is very unfair to those who did not throw things downstairs. It may even condone the perpetrators, because the consequences of the evil are shared by many people. This legal provision and related court decisions have caused great controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to solving the problem is to find the perpetrators and punish them severely. This aspect relies on technological progress, such as high-altitude video surveillance, DNA comparison and other technologies, which can help identify the perpetrators. On the other hand, there are changes in legal provisions. If you still let the victim collect evidence on his own, it will basically be impossible. Because individuals do not have the right to collect DNA from others for identification, there are no legal provisions, and properties have no incentive to install high-altitude surveillance systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Civil Code and Criminal Law Amendment (11), which will be implemented in 2021, has changed this rule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the civil side, although the &quot;simultaneous sitting&quot; provisions still exist, the Civil Code requires the police to investigate in a timely manner in accordance with the law and identify the person responsible. The &quot;continuous sitting&quot; rule applies only when the police are unable to find out. As a result, it has become the legal duty of the police to identify the person responsible for falling objects from heights. The police have greater power and ability to conduct investigations. For example, they can narrow the scope of investigation based on the mobile phone signal at the location of the incident, and can force &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; to provide biological samples for DNA comparison. Through these technical means, the police can basically make the perpetrators invisible. Especially the DNA comparison is extremely shocking. In the case of a cigarette butt falling from the sky in Luzhou, Sichuan, which almost scalded a baby, the perpetrator voluntarily surrendered after the police completed the DNA analysis on the cigarette butt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Civil Code also stipulates that property management companies and other building managers should take necessary safety measures to prevent infringement incidents of falling objects from high altitudes; otherwise, they will bear tort liability for failing to perform safety guarantee obligations. In this way, the property management company will have the motivation to do a good job in prevention, monitoring and other tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of criminal liability, the judicial interpretation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court in 2019 stipulates that intentional throwing of objects from high altitude and negligent falling of objects from high altitude can be classified as &quot;crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means&quot; and &quot;negligence causing casualties.&quot; Convicted and punished for crimes such as &quot;serious accident crime&quot; and &quot;major liability accident crime&quot;. The Criminal Law Amendment (11), which took effect on March 1, 2021, has added the crime of &quot;throwing objects from high altitudes&quot;. Although the penalty for this crime is lighter than the penalty for &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot;, the police must open a case to investigate the crime regardless of the severity. This also means that under the new criminal law, the threshold for criminal offenses for throwing objects from high altitudes has been lowered, and the police have greater legal responsibilities to conduct criminal investigations. In this way, the probability of the perpetrator being discovered will be greatly increased, the possibility and intensity of punishment will also be greatly increased, and the deterrence of high-altitude missiles will also be greatly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use technology to let the law grow teeth and form sufficient deterrence. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will be caught and severely punished. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will have nowhere to hide. With fewer people daring to test the law, the sky above our heads will be safer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[坚守大山十年，月薪不到三千：支教老师“中年危机”何解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国铁集团：不可能给第三方平台“优先购票权”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 18:31:42&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Today, the railway department began to sell train tickets for October 3, with sufficient tickets left in all directions.

Based on passenger flow demand, tickets for the more than 100 additional passenger trains that the railway department will open during the holidays have been on sale since September 18, which can increase the passenger capacity by more than 70,000 seats per day. From September 13 to 18, the railway department sold a total of 111 million train tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on passenger travel demand, the railway department has arranged to open more than 100 additional passenger trains during the National Day holiday.

Sensory data such as safety monitoring, personnel positioning, and video surveillance can monitor more than 600,000 sensors, more than 800,000 well workers, and 39,000 household operating video surveillance data across the country in real time, and develop a variety of risk analysis and early warning functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Mine Safety Production Work&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Opinions&quot;). Deputy Director of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau Zhang Xin said that the opinions &quot;strive to fundamentally eliminate hidden dangers of accidents and fundamentally solve problems&quot; and further promote the transformation of the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; is the first programmatic document in the field of mine safety production issued with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It proposes a series of measures around &quot;preventive transformation&quot;, which is the first time at the national level. It is clearly required that the headquarters of mining-related central enterprises and large and medium-sized mining-related enterprises be equipped with safety directors, and it is required to standardize the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; require standardizing the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. The contracting unit dispatches project leaders, technical personnel and special operations personnel to the project department, and proposes to strive to establish the unit&#39;s own mining operations in production mines by the end of 2025. (Peel) the construction team or entrust an enterprise with corresponding conditions for overall management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo, director of the Safety Basics Department of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau, introduced that after the issuance of &quot;Several Provisions on Strengthening the Safety Management of Metal and Non-Metal Underground Mine Outsourcing Projects&quot; in 2021, a total of 1,360 inspection teams were organized across the country. More than 6,800 people were dispatched, which lasted 7 months, to inspect 3,895 outsourced engineering mines, resource integration coal mines and managed coal mines, and 134 major hidden dangers were discovered, during which 461 outsourcing teams were dismissed or transferred to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo pointed out that through special rectification, the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines has been further standardized and the management level has been greatly improved. “However, there are still inconsistent management of personnel teams, illegal contracting and subcontracting, and suspended safety responsibilities. , issues such as insufficient investment in safety.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; further requires the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines, clarifies the safety responsibilities of non-coal mines, and regulates the number of contracting units for metal and non-metal underground mines, the staffing and academic qualifications of contracting units, and blasting operations. As well as establishing its own mining team, clear requirements have been put forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Without control of disasters, there will be no peace for mines. The management of major disasters is always the top priority in promoting advance prevention.&quot; Zhang Xin said that the next step will be to carry out regular and institutionalized surveys and management of hidden disaster factors in mines. To achieve the transformation from passive prevention to active management, from single treatment to comprehensive treatment, and from underground partial treatment to surface area treatment, &quot;anything that has not been identified, explored, and not treated in place shall be allowed to carry out mining operations, and we must not cooperate with it.&quot; Disasters &#39;fight with bayonets.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng, director of the Non-Coal Mine Safety Supervision Department, said that in the future, not only will the investigation and rectification of major hidden dangers not be in place, the companies and responsible persons responsible for the accident will be held accountable, and the investigation and rectification will not be in place. Enterprises that cause major hidden dangers to still exist must also be held accountable, &quot;reflecting the concept of transforming the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小城千人围捕鳄鱼：已追回69条，仍有两条或在逃]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256981]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 17:31:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/598242ea15.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/598242ea15. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Crocodile capture scene.

A pickup truck drove up from the night and stopped in the middle of the nearby road. In the truck was a freshly caught crocodile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui, a 43-year-old crocodile catcher, pulled the crocodile by its tail and dragged it out of the pickup truck with his team members. They were about to transfer the crocodile to the van, where three crocodiles were already tied up. The crocodile was dragged to the back of the truck, its limbs were tied to its sides, and its long mouth was tied with tape so that it could not open or close. Qiu Gui and three other team members wearing headlamps stood on both sides of the crocodile, holding its limbs and pushing upward together: &quot;One, two!&quot; The people standing in the carriage pulled the hemp rope around the crocodile&#39;s head and also Together they exerted upward force, and the crocodile successfully entered the &quot;cage&quot;.

On September 11, floods destroyed the fence of a crocodile farm in Luocun, the northern boundary, causing some crocodiles to escape. According to Nanfang+ news, there are a total of 71 crocodiles in the farm. As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, and there have been no incidents of crocodile injuries.

This is a crocodile species commonly found in breeding farms in Hainan, Guangdong and other places. According to relevant literature, there are no wild Siamese crocodiles in China, only breeding populations, which can be traded and operated with a license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by the crocodile farm where the incident occurred is the Guangdong Yufeng Crocodile Breeding Professional Cooperative, which was established in March 2019. Its legal representative is Xu Jinwang. With tens of thousands of crocodiles being farmed and more than 20 years of breeding experience, Mao celebrity Xu Jinwang is known as the &quot;Crocodile King&quot;. Xu Jinwang&#39;s wife, Ke Yiming, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they were under great pressure and suffered a huge loss, amounting to two to three million yuan. &quot;The crocodile is very valuable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Liming, an 81-year-old villager in Luo Village, Beijie, the fish pond used by Xu Jinwang to breed crocodiles was rented to him four or five years ago, totaling more than 30 acres, with an annual rent of 2,000 yuan. /acre, rented for 18 years. Wu Liming told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped and the flood level had not receded, he called Xu Jinwang every day out of fear: &quot;Let him take care of it, (the crocodile) is very dangerous.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Ke Yiming explained that the flooding of the breeding farm was a natural disaster. &quot;We (the breeding farm) have done everything very safely. The floods there are so severe that we will not dare to raise them there in the future.&quot; On September 15, a Southern Weekend reporter saw at the scene , each crocodile pool is separated by a plastic baffle about 1.3 meters high. Regarding whether the use of plastic baffles can effectively ensure that the crocodiles do not escape, Qiu Gui, a professional crocodile catcher with more than 20 years of experience, explained to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;This The baffle is OK. As long as the crocodile can&#39;t see outside, it will stay in the crocodile pond.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The news of the crocodile&#39;s escape frightened 75-year-old villager Wu Yanxin: &quot;I&#39;m scared. Why aren&#39;t you afraid?&quot; Wu Yanxin lives in Dapo Village, Zhensheng Town, about 400 meters away from the crocodile farm. Although he was scared, Wu Yanxin had a way to comfort himself: as long as he didn&#39;t go into the water or go to the shore, &quot;crocodiles don&#39;t walk that fast on the ground.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin often cycled and ran along the road around Pengcun Lake, taking 70 minutes to run an 8-kilometer lap. This is the largest body of water around the crocodile pond. Standing on the road around the lake, Wu Yanxin can see the crocodiles living in the pond. After the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin could no longer ride around the lake. The road was surrounded by a 1.5-meter-high wire fence to prevent the crocodile from hurting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/333bc75667.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/333bc75667.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huanhu Road is surrounded by barbed wire.

On September 17, Zhou Hui told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they began to install protective nets along Huanhu Road. It took about three or four days to complete the installation, and then spent several days reinforcing it. One morning around 1 a.m., he and his colleagues were installing a protective net on the road to the crocodile pond. About 20 meters away, a crocodile surfaced and opened its mouth, then sank into the water; another weighed three to four hundred pounds. The crocodiles were lying on the shore 50 meters away. Zhou Hui took a light and found two yellow eyes staring at them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yahong, the person in charge of supervision of the Crocodile Farm Residents Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, the village committee actively participated in catching the crocodile and arranged on-duty duty to ask the villagers not to go out and pay attention to safety. Wu Yahong said that when there were heavy rains in the past, he would remind the staff in the crocodile farm to pay attention to safety: &quot;The water has almost reached your crocodile pond, and the crocodiles have escaped. But this time the water is too big, and the crocodile pond has been soaked.&quot; ), the crocodile ran out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the adjacent Dapo Village Committee told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, in order to ensure that there were no casualties, &quot;we launched There are more than 30 party members and volunteers, guarding various checkpoints 24 hours a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to capture the crocodile as soon as possible and ensure the safety of nearby residents, the 5-kilometer radius around the incident site is a key investigation area. A total of 51 outposts, 33 patrol teams, and nearly 1,000 staff were set up in the area to carry out arrests. On September 15, a militiaman on duty told Southern Weekend reporters that the day the crocodiles first escaped, the water level was still very high, and the farm was full of people. Everyone was busy pumping water and holding sandbags to block the water. &quot;If you are not afraid of the crocodiles appearing, then There are so many people, what are you afraid of, all the SWAT police are armed with guns.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;626&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to find crocodiles, the farm conducts water surveys.

The nearest gunshot to him was on the night of September 14, when a crocodile weighing two to three hundred pounds was found in a small drainage ditch near his family&#39;s paddy field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shooting a crocodile in the water is not easy. &quot;When you shoot it, it goes into the water. It&#39;s not like those on the ground, where it stays in place.&quot; A special police officer holding a sniper rifle said. A colleague on the side gave him an idea, &quot;Someone has to fill in the gun.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;SWAT searches for an escaped alligator. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with shooting crocodiles in the water, Qiu Gui believes that finding crocodiles is the most important and most time-consuming link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to find the escaped crocodiles, the local area used sonar detection, drone inspections, and even tied ducks to the shore to lure the crocodiles to prey. A staff member of the sonar team told a reporter from Southern Weekend that the difficulty in detecting crocodiles with sonar is that it is difficult to detect crocodiles when they are swimming. The sound produced by drones usually scares timid crocodiles. The duck trapping effect is even weaker. The water area within which the crocodile escapes is large and there are many fish and shrimps. The crocodile has no shortage of food at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui has his own methods after dealing with crocodiles for more than 20 years. In this arrest operation, including at the breeding farm, their team of six arrested a total of 56 animals, with the most on September 14, when 14 were captured. The remaining 13 were killed by special police and captured by crocodile catching teams from Zhanjiang, Yangjiang, Guangzhou and Foshan. Most of the crocodiles caught weighed more than 200 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui and his party usually go out at night, because crocodiles are more alert during the day and will quickly hide in the water after noticing any movement around them. At night, crocodiles often stay in one place and are relatively slow. You can catch them by moving slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike humans, crocodile eyes do not close from birth to death. Therefore, as long as you shine a flashlight at night, the yellow-glow eyes will reveal the location of the crocodile. At 2 a.m. on September 18, while searching for the last two crocodiles, Qiu Gui boarded the kayak again and searched for traces of crocodiles in Pengcun Lake. The night before, they found and captured three crocodiles here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui pointed the flashlight at the water and grass on the shore. He explained that the crocodile likes to come ashore at nine or ten o&#39;clock in the morning when the sun is getting warmer. Basking in the sun will make it easier for it to digest food in its stomach. A 200-pound crocodile can eat 10 pounds a day. After it is full, it will come ashore. If it is not frightened, it will stay until it has finished digesting and then go into the water to hunt. &quot;There is not much knowledge to find crocodiles, and there is no shortcut, just use a lamp to shine.&quot; Qiu Gui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Crocodiles at night are easier to find and catch. After Qiu Gui and his party discovered the crocodile, they would carefully move the boat closer and stun the crocodile within one meter of the crocodile. &quot;After the stun, the crocodile&#39;s body seemed to be stiff.&quot; Taking advantage of the 10-15 minutes when the crocodile was unconscious, the capture team The crocodile man drags the crocodile onto the boat and binds its mouth and limbs as soon as possible. &quot;As long as you tie its mouth and don&#39;t let it open, the crocodile will be 100% controlled.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the most important thing is teamwork, and nothing can be done without tacit understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A tied up crocodile is equally dangerous. After the crocodile wakes up, its head and tail can still attack. If it hits the leg, &quot;it will break the leg directly, no joke.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the crocodile has an attack range. &quot;We usually stand in the middle of it, which is equivalent to its blind spot. But we should also stay 1.5 meters away from it, which will be safer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text -align: center;&quot;>;A crocodile was captured near a fence.

One of the focuses of the search that day was several fish ponds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish pond is located in Helijing Village, only two to three hundred meters away from the crocodile farm. On September 15, the owner of a fish pond told Southern Weekend reporters that two crocodiles had been pulled into his fish pond. One was electrocuted and the other was shot. There may be crocodiles in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the fish pond is three to four meters deep and there are many fish, methods such as electric shock, duck trapping and even shooting are ineffective. A staff member of the Maoming Emergency Management Bureau told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The water is too deep to find the crocodiles. It would be best if they could be put into water about one meter deep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the village Negotiations between the committee and fish pond owners on the compensation plan after the water was released did not go smoothly. Cai Fang, the wife of the above-mentioned pond owner, told Southern Weekend reporters that tens of thousands of fry were put into her fish pond, as well as some fish feed. &quot;The total cost is tens of thousands of yuan. Now we propose to pump half of the water and compensate for 2,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Fang does not agree with the compensation plan. She believes that if half of the water is drained, the remaining fish will He died of lack of oxygen and was worried that the crocodile would not be found hiding in the mud at the bottom of the pond. &quot;What if someone is bitten later, will I, the pond owner, be responsible?&quot; Cai Fang hoped that a thorough search could be carried out and the pond water could be drained. , make sure there are no crocodiles in the pond, and also handle the fish in the pond casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several rounds of negotiations, on the evening of September 15, the two parties reached a compensation agreement at a price of 1,000 yuan per mu of water surface. Early the next morning, an excavator dug up the edge of the pond. After searching, no trace of the crocodile was found in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, but there are still two cases with no clues.

He was once placed under residential surveillance at a designated location for picking quarrels and provoking trouble. He died 13 days later at the age of 33. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance is a coercive measure stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. Residential surveillance at a designated residence is a special situation: when the criminal suspect or defendant has no fixed residence, or the case is suspected of crimes endangering national security or terrorist activities, it can be implemented in a designated residence. Commonly used locations in practice include hotels, guest houses, hospitals, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Bao Qinrui has a house in Yuhua District, Shijiazhuang, he was still placed under residential surveillance in Xinle City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Shijiazhuang). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Medical records show that the person who accompanied Bao Qinrui to the hospital was a staff member of the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, and the &quot;work unit or home address&quot; column was filled in with Xinle Hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the reply from the Xinle City Public Security Bureau to Bao Qinrui’s father, on July 19, 2022, the day of the incident, the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate intervened in the matter and investigated Bao Qinrui’s death. In the meantime, his body has been stored in the Xinle City Funeral Home and has not been cremated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The investigation into the cause of death has stalled&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin remembers that in the early morning of July 7, 2022, Bao Qinrui was taken away by the police at his home in Yuhua District Walk. Later, she received a notice mailed by the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, which stated that Bao Qinrui was placed under residential surveillance at a designated residence because he was &quot;suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin saw her husband again at the Xinle City Funeral Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rescue records of Xinle City Hospital record that at 21:38 on July 19, 2022, the hospital received an emergency call, and Bao Qinrui was subsequently sent to the hospital. After more than three hours of continuous resuscitation, Bao Qinrui was still unconscious, without spontaneous breathing and heartbeat, and the hospital declared him dead. Xinle City 110 police officers signed at 1:38 a.m. the next day and contacted the Xinle City Funeral Home. The hospital recommended an autopsy to further clarify the cause of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months after Bao Qinrui’s death, on the morning of March 30, 2023, the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate arranged for an autopsy on Bao Qinrui’s body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui’s father Bao Jiye recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that on June 19, 2023, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Procuratorate presented him with an autopsy report, which concluded that “mechanical injury was excluded as a cause of death.” &quot;, it excludes death caused by poisoning, and does not rule out sinus node disease causing cardiac electrical activity disorder and cardiac arrest leading to death.&quot; Bao Jiye did not sign the report and applied for a second autopsy to be performed by an agency commissioned by the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation into the cause of Bao Qinrui’s death has stalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye asked Cao Zhi, the prosecutor of the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate who participated in the investigation. Cao Zhi replied that a second autopsy needs to be applied to the Xinle City Public Security Bureau. Xinle City Public Security Bureau staff replied to Bao Jiye that this application should be communicated to the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate, &quot;The Public Security Bureau is also a party, and you don&#39;t believe it even if we do an autopsy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 18, 2023, Cao Zhi said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend that there is currently no investigation conclusion on Bao Qinrui’s death. As for whether a second autopsy can be performed, &quot;this is an internal investigation process and cannot be announced to the outside world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on Handling the Death of Persons in Detention Centers&quot; jointly issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs stipulate that when institutions commissioned by the public security organs and procuratorates conduct autopsies, the opinions of the deceased&#39;s close relatives should be solicited. Close relatives who request to entrust another institution to conduct an autopsy should be allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if a person dies during residential surveillance at a designated location, there are no clear regulations yet on whether family consent is required when an autopsy is commissioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Co-defendant&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Bailed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin still doesn’t know about Bao Qinrui What specific behavior is suspected of provoking quarrels and provoking trouble? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day as Bao Qinrui, there were eight other people who were placed under residential surveillance at a designated location - Bao Qinrui&#39;s father Bao Jiye, brother Bao Shaorui, uncles Bao Jizhong and Bao Jitao, and his cousin. Diba Zhuorui and three other villagers from the same village were all suspected of provoking quarrels and causing trouble, and the execution location was also Xinle Hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a month after Bao Qinrui passed away, on September 1, 2022, Bao Jiye and Bao Shaorui were released on bail pending trial. On September 28, the other six people, including Bao Jizhong and Bao Jitao, were released on bail pending trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All eight people said they were beaten and given electric shocks while under residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days after Bao Qinrui’s death, on the afternoon of July 22, 2022, Bao Jitao, who was still under residential surveillance, was sent to Xinle City Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital for treatment due to fever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Bao Jitao&#39;s hospitalization record, when he was admitted to the hospital, he had &quot;pain in both calves for 3-4 days, pain in the left chest and ribs for 1 day, skin damage and scabs on the left knee, and flakes on the right lower limb.&quot; Bruises and red rashes can be seen on both calves.” After experiencing chest pain, he was diagnosed with left rib fracture after examination. After being hospitalized for 7 days, Bao Jitao was discharged from the hospital on July 29. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 19, 2023, the Xinle City Public Security Bureau lifted the bail pending trial for eight people on the grounds that &quot;it was found that criminal liability should not be pursued.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The whistleblower expressed a &quot;reversal&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the notice of release on bail pending trial that Bao Jiye received, it was written that the case he was involved in was &quot;5• 25 project&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye and Bao Shaorui recalled that during the residential surveillance period, the police asked them whether they had beaten Sun Huiqiang and others who came to ask for wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui and other nine people involved in the case are all from Nantaying Village, Gaoyi County, Shijiazhuang City. Before the incident, Bao Qinrui worked in the Gaoyi County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. Bao Jiye runs a ceramic tile factory in Gaoyi, and Bao Shaorui, Bao Jitao, and Bao Zhuorui all work in the factory. Bao Jizhong is the party branch secretary of Nantaying Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Huiqiang is a contractor who participated in the construction of Bao Jiye’s ceramic tile factory in 2013 and 2014. He told Southern Weekend reporters that on May 22, 2022, at a worker’s home, police from the Yuhua District Public Security Bureau took notes on him and five other workers involved in the construction. At that time, he and the workers said that in the spring of 2014, they went to the ceramic tile factory to ask for wages and were beaten by Bao Jiye, Bao Jizhong and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on September 12, 2023, Sun Huiqiang said in an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter that he gave false testimony at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sun Huiqiang&#39;s account, he and Bao Jiye did have a financial dispute at the beginning of 2022. There was a discrepancy of 200,000 yuan between the two parties regarding the amount of project funds, and they were in the negotiation stage at that time. Bao Moumou (pseudonym), a villager from the same village as Bao Jiye, contacted him and said that he had conflicts with Bao Jizhong, who served as the party branch secretary in the village. Bao promised that as long as Sun Hui did what he said, not only would the project money be returned, but the amount would even be higher than what he asked for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning about Bao Qinrui’s incident, Sun Huiqiang and the workers made new records to the public security organs in September 2022 and June 2023, re-explaining the situation and showing that they had not been raped by Bao Jiye or Bao Jiye. Bao Ji Zhong and others beat him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2023, Bao Jiye noticed that reports against him for &quot;criminal involvement&quot; appeared on the short video platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of them is 66-year-old Zhang Shuke, who also had some disputes with Bao Jiye over the amount of project funds. On April 21, 2023, a user with the online name &quot;Dou E Yuan&quot; posted a video on the short video platform entitled &quot;Real people and true stories will never lie&quot;: Zhang Shuke held his ID card and told, &quot;Real-name reporting is very high. A triad gang in Yi County, headed by Bao Jiye and Bao Jizhong, maliciously owed me 600,000 yuan for a project through fraud. When I went to demand the account, I was beaten and insulted many times, and threatened to be beaten to death if I went back to the factory to demand the account. Buried alive”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye sued Zhang Shuke for infringement of reputation rights. On June 7, 2023, the Gaoyi County Court conducted mediation on the case. The two parties reached an agreement: Zhang Shuke deleted the above video and recorded a video to apologize to Bao Jiye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this video can still be searched on the short video platform. Zhang Shuke explained to Southern Weekend reporters that what was said in the video was not true and that he was not beaten by Bao Jiye. The video was recorded at Bao&#39;s suggestion. At that time, Bao Moumou told him, &quot;If you talk about the seriousness of the matter, someone will take care of you. If you tell the truth, no one will take care of you.&quot; After the court mediation, he contacted Bao Moumou to delete the video, but Bao Moumou could not delete it either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter contacted Bao. The statement he provided was different from that of Sun Huiqiang and Zhang Shuke. He said that after Bao Jiye, Bao Jizhong and others were released on bail pending trial, they used &quot;coercion and inducement&quot; to bribe the informants and get them to retract their confessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is “residence”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After his son passed away, Bao Jiye was confused as to why he was placed under residential surveillance at a designated residence by the Xinle City Public Security Bureau as he was from Gaoyi County, Shijiazhuang City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance is one of the five coercive measures stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. Chen Yongsheng, a professor at Peking University Law School, explained that the coercive intensity of the five types of coercive measures is a ladder structure. From weak to strong, they are summons, bail pending trial, residential surveillance, detention and arrest. As a transitional measure, residential surveillance means that criminal suspects or defendants do not need to be completely detained like detention or arrest, but they are required not to leave their residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For criminal suspects or defendants who meet the conditions for arrest, residential surveillance measures can be taken under three circumstances. One is due to their own factors, serious illness, pregnancy, etc.; the other is the special nature of the case or the handling of the case. necessary; third, the detention period has expired and the case has not been settled. In order to avoid extended detention, residential surveillance is implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance at a designated location is a special case of residential surveillance. The Criminal Procedure Law stipulates two types of circumstances under which residential surveillance can be carried out at a designated location: the criminal suspect or defendant has no fixed residence, or the case is suspected of crimes endangering national security or terrorist activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; compiled by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress explains &quot;residence&quot; as meaning that the criminal suspect or defendant lives in the city or county where the case-handling agency is located. Legal residence for work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The nine people involved in the case all have residences in Gaoyi County, and Bao Qinrui and Bao Shaorui also have properties in Yuhua District. Chen Yongsheng believes that as long as the parties concerned own real estate in Shijiazhuang City, according to legal provisions, they do not meet the requirements for designated residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 15, 2023, a deputy director of the Xinle City Public Security Bureau told Bao Jiye that the case was handled by the Yuhua Branch of the Shijiazhuang City Public Security Bureau, the Xinle City Public Security Bureau and the Gaoyi County Public Security Bureau. The three parties formed a task force to jointly handle the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But why did the Xinle City Public Security Bureau ultimately place Bao Qinrui and other nine people under residential surveillance in a designated location? On September 18, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter contacted Guo Jie, director of the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, via text message. As of press time, no reply had been received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D重现利比亚极端洪水，上万人身亡，大量高楼被夷为平地]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256966]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从奥本海默到“核武之王”，这70年经历了什么？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256964]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/r6FiloQ2QNq1q67PqYHr7zhROxZiFIGrf2SP6ELu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/r6FiloQ2QNq1q67PqYHr7zhROxZiFI Grf2SP6ELu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251162&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 15, 1957, local time, in Princeton, the United States, the creator of the atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer. A new film about Oppenheimer&#39;s life and his leadership in creating the world&#39;s first atomic bomb during World War II will be released in theaters on July 21, 2023, local time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the summer movies, &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; is one of the most eye-catching ones. The protagonist in the film is Julius Robert Oppenheimer, a genius Jewish scientist known as the &quot;Father of the Atomic Bomb&quot;. His &quot;work&quot; directly changed the face of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to escalate, at a critical moment when the Ukrainian army launches a large-scale counterattack, Russia demonstrated a powerful weapon-the &quot;Sarmat&quot; land-based intercontinental ballistic missile. This giant intercontinental missile has been put on combat readiness to prepare for possible crises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Oppenheimer to &quot;Sarmat&quot;, what has happened in the past 70 years? Let&#39;s review the history of nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Oppenheimer&#39;s &quot;Legacy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer, a name closely associated with the atomic bomb and the &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; This Jewish genius scientist has shown extraordinary talents since he was a child. In his childhood, he was influenced by his mother and dabbled in various fields such as art, literature, philosophy, history, science and language. The youngest member of the Mineral Club, at the age of 18, he graduated with first place from Fieldston School of Arts and Sciences in New York (many political, business and cultural celebrities in the United States came from this school) and was admitted to the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from college, Oppenheimer first entered the famous Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge in England. After that, Oppenheimer was taught by the founder of quantum mechanics and the winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics. Born’s recommendation led him to the famous University of Göttingen. In 1927, Oppenheimer received his PhD for his research in quantum mechanics and decided to return to the United States not long after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of his life was presiding over the United States&#39; nuclear weapons project, the &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; As the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;, which cost US$2.5 billion and involved more than 500,000 people at its peak, Oppenheimer fully demonstrated his scientific literacy and management skills. In the movie, Oppenheimer called the project a &quot;gamble&quot; - he won the bet, and the United States also won the bet: at 5:30 in the morning on July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb in human history was dropped on Los Angeles A successful explosion in the Alamos Desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the rest of his life, Oppenheimer suffered from humiliation and trouble because of this project that brought him great fame. The movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; vividly reproduces how he was persecuted by politicians represented by McCarthyism and General Strauss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 18, 1967, Oppenheimer died of throat cancer at the age of 63. What legacy did he leave to the world in the half century that followed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of early 2020, data from the Stockholm Peace Research Institute shows that the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and other countries possess approximately 13,400 nuclear weapons, of which 3,720 have been deployed with combat troops, and approximately 1,800 of them are on high alert. . These nuclear weapons are specifically carried by a variety of delivery systems, including land- and sea-based long-range ballistic missiles, heavy bombers, fighter-bombers, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles, air defense and missile defense interceptor missiles, torpedoes, and depth charges . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hans Christensen, director of the &quot;Nuclear Information Project&quot; of the Federation of American Scientists, believes that both the United States and Russia possess very large nuclear arsenals, backed by short-range tactical nuclear forces, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, Sea-launched ballistic missiles and aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons constitute the &quot;trinity&quot; of long-range strategic nuclear forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some other countries have &quot;two-in-one&quot; medium-range nuclear forces and/or long-range nuclear forces (that is, they have any two of the three elements of the &quot;trinity&quot;). Some are transitioning to the &quot;Trinity&quot;, and there are rumors that Israel may already have the &quot;Trinity&quot; nuclear power. In addition, Pakistan and India possess short-range nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that after 70 years of development, nuclear weapons have not only changed the form of military struggle, but also had a profound impact on the development of human society and the international strategic pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The birth of the &quot;King of Nuclear Weapons&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Sarmat&quot; intercontinental ballistic missile was born in a time of crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia, which inherited its legacy, is not comparable to the Soviet Union in terms of armed force building. Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is a resource-based country and therefore far inferior to its rival NATO in terms of conventional weapons. Nuclear power has therefore increasingly become the core of Russia&#39;s military power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Land-based nuclear forces are the foundation and pillar of Russia’s “trinity” nuclear forces. Russia&#39;s nuclear power was inherited from the Soviet Union. The three old intercontinental ballistic missile systems of SS-18 &quot;Satan&quot;, SS-19 &quot;Dagger&quot; and SS-25 &quot;Topol&quot; installed by the Strategic Rocket Force account for half of Russia&#39;s land-based nuclear weapons delivery vehicles. As mentioned above, these three old missile systems will reach the end of their service life. Once decommissioned, it will have a huge impact on the stability of Russia&#39;s strategic nuclear forces. Therefore, Russia decided to develop a new intercontinental ballistic missile to replace the SS-18 that is about to be retired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, the &quot;Sarmat&quot; intercontinental ballistic missile was developed by the Makeev Design Bureau. It conducted ejection tests in December 2017 and March 2018 and achieved success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of performance, this &quot;national weapon&quot; that Russia has high hopes for is really amazing. &quot;Sarmat&quot; is about 35 meters long, about 3 meters in diameter, has a take-off weight of about 200 tons, a payload of up to 10 tons, and a range of up to 17,000 kilometers. The hit accuracy is about 200 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; adopts a cold launch scheme. During launch, a gunpowder accumulator is used to eject the missile to a height of 20-30 meters above the launch silo, and then the missile ignites itself and takes off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; can carry up to 10 heavy or 15 light independently targeted separately guided nuclear warheads, or 24 &quot;Vanguard&quot; hypersonic boost glide bombs, which can target different targets Deliver devastating strikes and identify attacks from multiple targets. When carrying 10 submissive warheads, the yield of each warhead reaches 750,000 tons of TNT. The missile warhead adopts a variety of advanced penetration technologies, such as stealth technology and materials, separately guided multiple warheads and decoy bombs, hypersonic boost-glide warheads, and maneuverable and flexible orbit-changing capabilities. Its strike power is equivalent to 1,600 times that of the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”有三大绝技。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是打得远。该型导弹的射程达17000公里。超远的射程让这款导弹从俄罗斯境内的任一地域发射，都可以有效打击全球预定目标。据推测，“萨尔马特”可以飞越南极上空，完全绕过美国当前所有的导弹防御系统，对美国实施打击。还有人推测，其具备部分轨道轰炸能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是打得巧。这个巧就体现在超强的突防能力上。在现代战争中，地对地导弹的突防能力日益成为衡量导弹综合技术水平的重要指标。该型导弹外形设计和涂料上采用了隐身技术及材料，导弹助推段较短，增大了敌方雷达和卫星发现、跟踪并实施拦截的难度。强大的动力使其具备超远的射程，能够飞越两极实施攻击，甚至可能具备部分轨道轰炸能力，可最大限度避开反导系统。导弹可携带十余枚分导式弹头，同时配合使用多个诱饵弹头，大幅提高反导系统的辨识难度和自身的突防概率。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，“萨尔马特”还可携载“先锋”高超声速滑翔弹头，这种弹头具备极快的速度和超强的变轨能力，敌方防空和反导系统几乎无法拦截。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三是打得准。 “萨尔马特”采用惯性制导、星光制导和格罗纳斯卫星制导的复合制导方式。三种方式相互结合、优势互补，将导弹命中精度缩小至约150米，而采用惯性制导方式的SS-18导弹命中精度为350米。打击精度的提高就是打击威力的提高，在这方面，“萨尔马特”做得非常出色，处于世界先进水平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“萨尔马特”是一款液体燃料导弹。对于弹道导弹而言，使用固体燃料和液体燃料的差别在于比推力、毒性、安全性、易控制性方面。液体燃料比固体燃料比推力大，因此，使用液体燃料的弹道导弹段数比固体燃料少一级。而燃料的加注需要较长时间，因此不太适合作为核反击的手段使用——更适合进行“先发制人”的核打击，这无形中又增加了对北约的威慑力度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;核武器的未来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;作为地球上最具毁灭性的力量，核武器的发展在未来将呈现出几个趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，投掷核弹头的手段将向高超声速导弹发展。随着现代导弹防御系统的不断成熟演进，如何提高核导弹的突防能力已经成为一个重要问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在当前的装备中，高超声速导弹这种新概念武器开始脱颖而出。高超声速技术是指飞行速度超过5倍声速的飞行器技术，是21世纪航空航天技术的制高点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高超声速导弹的突出优势主要体现在3个方面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是它基本在大气高层飞行，飞行高度仅有30-80公里，末段高度可能只有20多公里，极大地影响了传统弹道导弹防御系统的早期预警雷达的探测能力。以美“铺路爪”为代表的早期预警雷达对远程和洲际导弹的探测距离高达数千公里，但对数十公里高度飞行的高超声速武器的探测距离只有数百公里。因此，弹道导弹防御系统对这类飞行器的防御效果大打折扣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二是由于它在大气层内受控飞行，相比传统弹道导弹呆板的弹道，其具备不错的机动能力。加上高超声速的速度，导致对其拦截的难度大幅度上升，进一步削弱了传统弹道导弹防御系统的拦截能力。或者说，高超声速滑翔飞行器显著提高了突防能力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高超声速滑翔飞行器还可结合传统弹道导弹使用，这样的结合虽然提高了飞行中段被拦截的危险，但大幅度提高了导弹的实际射程。这种技术趋势在“萨尔马特”导弹身上已经表现得非常明显。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来，深海将有可能会成为核武器投射的重要空间。深海由于其特殊的物理特性，雷达波无法穿透，因此开展军事行动非常隐蔽。俄罗斯开发的“波塞冬”核鱼雷就是基于这种逻辑进行研发的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据称，“波塞冬”最大时速将超过200千米（约110节），最大下潜深度超过1000米。在水下具备如此高的航速，无法对其实施有效拦截，目前服役的最快的核潜艇的最大时速为35节，西方国家装备最先进的鱼雷最大速度为55节，这样使得现有的鱼雷武器无法拦截“波塞冬”。该鱼雷能搭载200万吨TNT当量的核弹头或常规弹头。在敌方海岸附近爆炸时，可引发巨大的海啸，对港口、城市等造成毁灭性打击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经推算，其能够形成跨幅达550千米，最大浪高500米的巨大海啸冲击，任何停泊在港口中的船舶都无法幸存。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界上第一颗原子弹在试验场成功爆炸后，奥本海默曾引用印度教经文《薄伽梵歌》中的一句话：现在我变成了死亡，世界的毁灭者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着70年的发展，导弹技术的进步将倒逼反导技术进一步提升。高能激光、电磁炮等新概念武器将有可能运用到导弹防御体系中去。人类战争将因此拉开又一轮攻防博弈的序幕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而片中奥本海默与爱因斯坦的对话，显示出对个人命运和未来的迷茫，依然没有答案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为上海政法学院东北亚研究中心副主任）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人买金，老年人卖金？广州市民卖1公斤套现44万多元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:30:48&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I received an order last month, 1 kilogram, and gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot; One person Said an industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the price of gold in the domestic retail market has continued to rise, once exceeding 600 yuan per gram. Topics such as gold prices have been hotly searched. So far, consumers’ enthusiasm has not diminished. Amid the gold buying craze, gold The recycling market is also experiencing a gold selling boom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the working day of September 18, Nandu reporters visited the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou and the supermarket in Tianhe District, Guangzhou. They saw that many people still went to consult or buy gold. The gold price that day It has dropped from last week, and the gold recycling prices online and offline, and for different brands, are different, with big differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, most young people have been buying gold recently, and they are particularly fond of gold beans, which cost around 500 yuan each and weigh 1 gram, as a way to save, which has aroused heated discussion. It is worth noting that after visits, we also found that many middle-aged and elderly people are selling gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“People in their 40s and 50s come to sell”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At around 1:00 noon on September 18, Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou, Signs such as &quot;Recycle Gold and Silver Jewelry&quot; and &quot;Recycle Gold at High Prices&quot; are hung up. At the street intersection, there are many young people hurriedly entering the gold shop, as well as middle-aged and elderly people holding small bags in the store and looking around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen Shuibei is known as the &quot;barometer&quot; of the gold and jewelry market. Hengtai Jewelry, located in the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, is the Guangzhou branch of Shenzhen Shuibei. The reporter found that within half an hour, , the number of consumers in the store has always remained above 20, and most of them sit around the display cabinet to inquire about and buy gold jewelry. One row sells gold jewelry with smaller grams such as Jin Doudou, and the other row sells gold bracelets with larger grams. Waiting, &quot;We are getting married, so we came to buy during the lunch break. Today (September 18) the price is a little lower than before.&quot; A pair of young people are buying gold bracelets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1383&quot; height=&quot;1086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251166&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold recycling area in the corner of the store, there is an electronic screen showing the continuously fluctuating price: gold repurchase is 468.98 yuan, and the highest price of the day is 471.72 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The price of recycling at the end of last year reached more than 400 yuan.&quot; According to the staff of the store, the price of gold in the whole store that day was 471 yuan, the price of recycled gold bars or gold sheets was 468 yuan, and the price of recycled gold was 468 yuan. Accessories cost 5 yuan less, calculated as 463 yuan, which is 2 yuan lower than at the weekend. At present, most of the gold sheets on the market are mainly one kilogram, and such as gold beans and bracelets are gold jewelry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half an hour, two citizens over the age of 50 came to inquire about the gold recycling market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Recently, gold sellers have to line up outside, and the whole street is filled with gold sellers.” An industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years also opened a store in the gold wholesale business district. He opened a jewelry store specializing in gold recycling. On that day, he also recycled gold for 463 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many grams of recycling, and the recycling price can still be negotiated.” This industry insider said that the recycling price has risen to more than 460 yuan in the past half month, and the recycling price reached the highest level of 479 yuan per gram last week, maintaining the same level. In half a day, &quot;I received an order last month with a unit price of more than 440 yuan per kilogram, and I gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half a month, the recycling price increased from more than 440 yuan per gram. to more than 460 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, prices in the domestic gold retail market have continued to rise, driving the growth of the recycling business. According to an industry insider, he recycled one order that day and has made more than 20 orders in the past ten days. “They are all in the 40s or 50s. There are no young people to sell to people who are 20 years old.&quot; said the above-mentioned industry insider. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The price difference between the recycling of branded gold jewelry is more than 100 yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Unlike the wholesale market, the recycling market in supermarkets in Tianhe District, Guangzhou is relatively cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 3 pm, almost every gold brand store in Tianhe City in Tianhe District had people shopping. The listed prices of gold in different brand stores are different, all above 600 yuan per gram, and some are as high as 600 yuan per gram. The gold price is 610 yuan per gram, but there are basically price discounts ranging from 20 to 40 yuan. According to many staff on site, the price of gold has dropped by a few yuan from the peak last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for recycling services, only a few brands provide them and the recycling prices are low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Tianhe City China Gold Store, the gold price after discount is 568 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 405 yuan per gram. There are relatively few people coming to sell, &quot;Today (September 18) ) No one recycles it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The selling price of Jinzhizun gold is 609 yuan per gram, and only the investment gold bars are recycled, which is recycled at 430 yuan that day. Lao Fengxiang and Chow Tai Fook do not have on-site recycling services. Among them, Chow Tai Fook’s gold price is 608 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 451 yuan. According to a staff member of Chow Tai Fook, this store cannot recycle, and you have to go to the store on Beijing Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251167&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangzhou Tianhe City Chow Tai Fook Store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to offline platforms, many e-commerce platforms also provide gold recycling services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter randomly searched for &quot;Guangzhou gold recycling&quot; on Taobao, Tmall and other platforms, selected 4 stores with sales of 1,000+ payments, and inquired from customer service. They all said that the recycling price was 465 yuan per gram, and the price was 465 yuan per gram in the same city. You can come to your door for recycling and pay on the spot; but if the store is in other cities, it needs to be evaluated online. The consumer takes a photo of the store link and mails it to the merchant. After the merchant signs and checks the gram number, the merchant pays the consumer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the recycling prices of gold jewelry of different brands are different online and offline, and there is a big difference. For the wholesale market, it is generally 8-10 yuan less than the gold price sold; for brand stores in supermarkets , the difference is more than 100 yuan; while the online recycling price is 2 yuan more than that in the offline wholesale market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some supermarkets need to pay nearly a thousand yuan for redemption&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I just received a customer to redeem.” The reporter said Visiting supermarket brands also found that although many brand stores do not recycle gold and can only exchange old items for new ones, and the method is complicated, many consumers come to consult or exchange for the styles they like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trade-in means that the gold products in the hands of consumers are discounted according to the current gold price and then purchased in-store at the current selling price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251168&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hengtai Jewelry Store on Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Lao Fengxiang, if you want to exchange for gold that is not of this brand, based on the gold listing price of the brand that day is 608 yuan per gram, the discount per gram you want to exchange is 30 yuan, and the number of grams must also be calculated. 10% off, 30% more grams purchased. In other words, if you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, which is originally 6,080 yuan, you need to calculate the price based on 9 grams of 578 yuan, which is 5,202 yuan, and an additional 3 grams of gold, which is 1,824 yuan, for the total exchange price That’s 7026 yuan. In other words, you need to make a minimum payment of 946 yuan to redeem it, and the crafting fee is additional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, China Gold, Chow Tai Fook and other stores have different discounts for redemption. Among them, China Gold staff said that if you want to exchange for gold that is not of the same brand, you will have to pay a price difference of 40 yuan per gram, and there is no labor fee. You can choose the type and quantity of the exchange. According to the staff of Chow Tai Fook, there are two options. If you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, first, you need to exchange for a product heavier than 10 grams, and the discount is calculated as 85 yuan per gram; second, use the selling price of the day, exchange for a product with twice the gram, that is, 20 grams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, reporters also found that many consumers exchanged for gold products. At noon on September 18, two Guangzhou citizens in their 50s brought 10.06 grams of gold chains to change styles and walked into a gold store. A sign hanging outside the gold store read &quot;Old gold for new, one gram for one gram.&quot; According to reports, the gold chain is charged based on the recycling price of 463 yuan plus 15% handicraft fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
