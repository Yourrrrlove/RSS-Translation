She stood out from thousands of auditions and performed a large-scale role in her first screen role. The cunning and alienation on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s face, her inadvertent dodge, and a hint of cowardice constitute her rich facial aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her new work &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, she once again demonstrates this highly recognizable performance style. This is her second collaboration with emerging director Li Chongxian. The first time the two worked together was in the 2020 crime suspense film &quot;The Call&quot;, which caused heated discussions among movie fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/94cb079e77d0483c939911d74b3cbf15.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ballet In &quot;Revenge Song&quot;, although Jeon Jong-seo is not as crazy as in &quot;Telephone&quot;, the girl she plays, Ok-joo, is also a mistress who is not easy to mess with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Zhu once worked as a bodyguard in a security company, specializing in protecting high-level important personnel. Her superb skills and sharp mind were fully demonstrated in the opening supermarket robbery scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f3a9ec1f3da4106b7a1d835c84f48513.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps for a long time Maintaining a high degree of vigilance, Yuzhu had no interest in life and was full of frustration all day long until she met her old classmate Minxi. The latter&#39;s natural affinity frees Yuzhu from the boring quagmire of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to show the contrast in atmosphere, the film specially uses colorful soft light to capture the relaxed and graceful friendship between the two girls when showing Minxi taking Yuzhu to celebrate her birthday, taking headshots and relaxing on the beach. . This is in contrast to the large number of night scenes and indoor scenes throughout the film, which basically use high contrast and low-key lighting to create dangerous and uneasy situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/eeaf31229575a54a62fa9148e156c55f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point of the story , appeared when Minxi suddenly committed suicide, leaving a last word hoping that Yuzhu would help her take revenge. After Yuzhu followed the clues and found a man named &quot;Chef Cui&quot;, she discovered that Minxi&#39;s suicide had a lot to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The many &quot;SM&quot; props in Chef Cui&#39;s home, as well as the large number of classified USB flash drives in the cabinet, all show that in the process of &quot;hunting for beauty&quot;, he often uses perverted methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;444&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0d1f535dabea0dc186b64630653fd1d4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Minxi , after being targeted by Chef Cui, he was drugged and raped while being filmed on video. Chef Cui did this not only to satisfy his abnormal desires, but also to threaten girls like Minxi through videos and force them to &quot;accept customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This crime chain is not the work of Chef Cui alone. He also has a pharmacist who regularly cooperates with him, so he can succeed every time with drugs such as &quot;obedient water&quot;; his subordinates also run a peach store. Hotels specialize in soliciting prostitutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6d74c7ae51907124c4f2612d454f78b0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/6d74c7ae51907124c4f2612d454f78b0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255247&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the most disappointing thing What people are afraid of is the power behind Chef Cui. Furthermore, Chef Cui, who looks vicious on the surface, is just a small leader of a gang organization, and behind this is a huge black industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;585&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3b9fa39ae346614fe6e4adea29bae5a6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255249&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9588ac4b4e3c43c214228f05c4f44c86.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; comes from The &quot;Room N&quot; case caused a lot of controversy in South Korea in the past few years. The prisoner in the case, Zhao Zhubin, established a paid &quot;room&quot; on an online platform and used the threatened girls as bargaining chips to profit from it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s just that this film introduces gangster forces and makes sexual crimes bottomless, in order to amplify this despair and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some time ago, &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;, which was adapted from real events, brought to the table the rarely mentioned child abduction and sex trafficking. Although the quality of the film is not good, its discussion of this topic is worthy of recognition. It allows us to see a criminal phenomenon that is deep underground and widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back in &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, as Yuzhu deepens her investigation into Chef Cui and the organization behind him, she also only avenges her best friend at the beginning, but gradually transforms into avenging the victimized woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/268593f73416414dfafc55f5eebe2d6a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, The killing scenes and action scenes have become the second highlight of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jeon Jong-seo cannot rely on physical confrontation and impact to create visual stimulation like Stallone and Jason Statham, nor can he use real kung fu techniques like Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Show off a pleasing figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The action design of &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; absorbs the style of the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, that is, it gives full play to the advantages of &quot;gun-shaped&quot; action movies, allowing hot weapons and fists and kicks to be used alternately. Ammunition can create explosive scenes, and the head-on confrontation of fists, feet, knives and axes can highlight the thrilling effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;447&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49c05f887c4da2835039b1202d553252.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is at the climax In the scene, Yuzhu used two pistols to fight against the entire gang, which was most obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this alone cannot make up for Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s complement in action scenes, so lens language and editing techniques have become necessary auxiliary means. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quick swinging technique, the movement of the camera synchronized with the direction of the punch, and the extensive use of close-up and close-up shots, coupled with the fast and sharp editing style, make the entire movie have a clear rhythm every time it enters the action section. Accelerate and the atmosphere becomes wanton and arrogant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/f93216844dc743bab519ed1dbdda4762.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director Li Chongxian is familiar with action films such as Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;The Fuse&quot;, Indonesia&#39;s &quot;The Raid&quot; and South Korea&#39;s &quot;Crime City&quot;, so he can create these action scenes with ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the tilted and unbalanced camera images and the neon aesthetics with great color contrast make &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; closer to the style of Hollywood crime films in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/78b1fd2e8b7e5919d612333b29603ec0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general In other words, the crime theme of exploiting women&#39;s bodies, good fighting scenes, and Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s character arc that is sometimes conservative and restrained, sometimes sensitive and angry, make this film have a sense of entertainment that is above the pass mark. However, when we finish watching &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot;, we can still detect its frivolity and frivolity based on big data algorithms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the character Ok-joo&#39;s emotions continue to deepen in the process of revenge, this delicate inner change relies more on Jeon Jong-seo&#39;s outstanding performance. Why did she become a bodyguard? Why are you so depressed in life? The film never explains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/49aca55250b8bad1121f2886af777652.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255255&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for her being Min Xi is infected and her heart gradually melts, but it is like going through the motions, and the filming is stereotyped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most puzzling thing is the pretentiousness of the underworld gang, which is strong on the outside but capable on the inside. The boss, who is full of gangster traditions, did not see anything done after he lectured Chef Cui. He neither saw through Chef Cui’s lies nor demonstrated his strategizing of the organization. Only in the contrasting section of &quot;die from talking too much&quot; does it play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/290aa6cfac3b8cb644611e61892284ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255257&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, &quot;Ballet Revenge&quot; provides a framework for female revenge, especially in terms of revenge for best friends. It is exactly the same as the summer hit &quot;The Vanishing She&quot;. But when it comes to the specific levels of criminal psychology, social ecology, etc., it seems to be discouraged. It is not like Luo Hongzhen&#39;s &quot;Yellow Sea&quot;, which separates the dirty, angry and restless characters&#39; psychology and shows you in detail. Instead, it provides a visual pleasure for immediate consumption and caters to the public&#39;s emotional fast food. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable result of Netflix and other streaming media entering the Korean market. It has brought big data arithmetic and more routine formulas, and this may also become a trend in the next few years. , a signal of an overall decline in the quality of Korean films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深圳欢乐谷过山车追尾，有游客称前一天已遇故障]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259498]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 10:19:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project promotion picture.

The picture comes from the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 18:27 on October 27, 2023, a vehicle collision occurred in the roller coaster &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; in Happy Valley, a well-known theme park in Shenzhen, injuring 8 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was sitting on the second roller coaster at the time.

Her test result was mild. Concussion, bruises and skin injuries on hands and feet. She recalled to the Southern Weekend reporter that she didn’t know exactly what happened at the time of the incident. “I just felt that my car was sliding backwards, and finally I realized that it had hit the previous car that was discharging passengers.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;At 23:25, Shenzhen Happy Valley officially issued a situation report stating that the injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment and are in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. &quot;The cause of the incident is under investigation.

We didn&#39;t know what happened at first What happened? I found out later that it was a car crash.&quot; Zhao Xin, a student who was queuing at the scene, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Xin said that several students from Shenzhen Huitong School were on the roller coaster where the accident occurred. “Several of them went up to play together. One of them had some stomach injuries because he didn’t have time to get off, and the other one It’s more serious and I passed out.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 23:00 on the 27th, a Southern Weekend reporter called the customer service of the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital. A staff member on the line said he was unclear about the situation, but said that the current queue time in the emergency department would be It&#39;s very long. &quot;There are more people waiting in the emergency department now.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Shenzhen Happy Valley, &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; has a five-star thrill level. It is a catapult roller coaster built with a huge investment of 200 million and is the tallest and longest catapult roller coaster in Asia, with a total length of 550 meters. &quot;Speed ​​up in 2 seconds, galloping at 135 kilometers per hour, falling vertically from 60 meters, heart-poundingly crazy for 90 seconds, 4G maximum acceleration, the experience of going to the sky, going to the ground, and going into the sea is thrilling to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is It is a relatively popular event, and there were a lot of people queuing up today.&quot; Zhao Xin recalled that she had been queuing for nearly two hours. If nothing had happened, it would have been her turn to get on the next bus. Finally, she left around 19:00 At the scene, &quot;When my friend went over to play, he found that the project had been closed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, the day before the incident, Chen Yuangang played &quot;Snow Land&quot; with his friends. Eagle&quot; project. She told Southern Weekend reporters that there was a problem with the system at that time: &quot;The Snow Eagle made a loud sound when it ejected, but I didn&#39;t hear it at the time, and then I found that the car had returned to the starting position. After a while, , the roller coaster ejected again, and returned to the starting position after a normal run.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yuan recalled that the vehicle system activated the emergency protection device at that time, and tourists on the roller coaster were unable to get off. &quot;The staff used the microphone to inform the remaining people in line that there was a problem with the system and needed to be repaired, so they could not continue playing. They also issued speed passes to the remaining people in line.&quot; Chen Yuan said that everyone stayed on the stalled roller coaster again. After about ten minutes, the staff adjusted and the emergency braking mode was released and we were able to get out of the car. &quot;About two hours after the emergency repairs, Happy Valley notified Snow Eagle to resume operations.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Maintenance is done every day&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Shenzhen Happy Valley has been open since 1998 and is a new generation of large-scale theme park of OCT Group.

There were about 20 passengers on the two trains, causing 2 People get hurt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the China Bidding and Bidding Public Service Platform, on March 21, 2023, Shenzhen OCT Happy Valley Tourism Company issued a bidding announcement for the overhaul service project of the Shenzhen Happy Valley Snowy Eagle Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bidding announcement shows that the overhaul service project of Shenzhen Happy Valley&#39;s &quot;Snowy Eagle&quot; project includes professional evaluation of the overall operation situation, carrying out Snowy Eagle&#39;s service status evaluation, safety and reliability evaluation, large-scale Repairs, condition monitoring systems and other work will be carried out, and it will pass statutory inspections, regulatory filings, etc. The planned construction period is from April 20, 2023 to June 30, 2023.

The notice specifically mentioned that Chen Guifen &quot;violated regulations in accepting gifts and arrangements for beauty activities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, expressions such as &quot;accepting beauty activities&quot; and &quot;addicted to beauty&quot; have appeared many times in official review reports on dismissed female officials. Chen Guifen&#39;s defeat this time has further brought the new term &quot;beauty corruption&quot; to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot; refers to cases of corruption and bribery that occur due to accepting beauty activities. Among the typical cases reported in recent years, the high amount of money involved and the bizarre corruption projects of &quot;beauty corruption&quot; have been breathtaking. The former director of the Anshan Municipal Taxation Bureau Liu Guangming’s “500,000 butt plastic surgery fee”, the latter the former mayor of Manzhouli City Xu Ailian’s “150,000 yuan for a beauty needle”, and the former vice president of North China University of Technology Shen Zhili’s “single consumption of 690,000 yuan” &quot;An astonishing number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to infer from the term &quot;cosmetic corruption&quot; that certain types of corruption are indeed related to gender. Due to the different preferences of men and women, it is not difficult to understand that bribers will cater to them in a targeted manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;willfulness&quot; of power will find an outlet, just like life, to satisfy the individual desires of those who abuse power. Cash and real estate, gold and silver jewelry, luxury cars and watches, antique calligraphy and paintings, there is always something suitable for fallen officials, which is also a common feature of corruption among male and female officials. However, the difference in preferences between male and female officials in the form of corruption is also a visible phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, the ostentatious culture of men showing off their success also had an impact on the officialdom. There were many incidents where people were arrested for corruption based on photos. In view of this, in recent years, the corruption of male officials has mostly been &quot;low-key&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;, which is the &quot;lesson&quot; learned from certain &quot;cousins&quot; and &quot;brothers&quot; who were dismissed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, in terms of forms of corruption, the &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot; characteristics of male officials are becoming more and more obvious, such as &quot;setting up offshore accounts&quot;, &quot;accepting bribes after retirement&quot;, &quot;shadow companies&quot;, &quot;option corruption&quot;, etc. There are endless means. The ancient &quot;elegant bribery&quot; has not completely gone into history. The high-end bribery and acceptance of bribes with the help of antique calligraphy and painting are still common in the corruption details of fallen male officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, male officials are also trying to hide their wealth and keep a low profile. They are no longer easily caught because of their public image as usual. Regarding the details of corruption, male officials also try their best to cover up and leave no traceable information, such as the &quot;$300,000 gift box&quot; codenamed &quot;Little Seafood&quot; received by Sun Lijun, and Zhang Qi, former member of the Standing Committee of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and former Secretary of the Haikou Municipal Party Committee. The secret method of &quot;filling the home with 13.5 tons of gold bars&quot;. Male officials can often use their special interests and hobbies to satisfy their greed while hiding the fact of corruption: Yang Hongwei, former deputy secretary of the party group and deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, is known as the &quot;ball secretary&quot; and is keen on playing basketball during working hours. , using playing ball to cover up his corrupt behavior of giving and receiving privately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that playing ball and other hobbies are more common among men. Judging from some female officials who have been dismissed in recent years, corruption that combines power and the love of beauty is not uncommon. From accessories, clothing and bags to luxury goods consumption, to the so-called &quot;beauty corruption&quot;. Just like the corruption record of Bai Hong, the former chairman of the labor union of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, &quot;the praise and jealousy of the people around him made Bai Hong immersed in the pleasure of a successful woman.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For bribers to pay for beauty treatments on their behalf, or to give high-priced beauty salon membership cards, this can constitute bribery of female officials, and even the development of novel money laundering methods. In real life, it is not uncommon for &quot;ordinary people to pay exorbitant prices for beauty treatments.&quot; However, once a female official&#39;s love for beauty is empowered by her desire for power, the resulting corruption will become even more like a torrential flood. &quot;Power keeps people young forever&quot; is not only a symbolic statement for female officials, but also a realistic statement that can be realized with the help of beauty consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not just officials who are corrupt. People in key positions can still be corrupt, and corruption tends to be younger. Young people tend to be bolder and more reckless in their corruption. Zhang Yujie, a &quot;post-1995&quot; clerk at the Chuzhou Real Estate Registration Center, embezzled nearly 70 million yuan in public funds, tens of thousands of which were spent on game cards. After the incident, this card was auctioned for more than 80 million yuan. His hobby is playing games. In the 2016 &quot;Accounting Corruption Case of Four Young Women in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province&quot;, Bai Ling, the former cash accountant of the Gaoyou Municipal Agricultural Committee, misappropriated 10.51 million yuan in public funds, of which more than 8 million yuan was used for beauty consumption. At the time of the case, she was only 29 Years old, it is really shocking to embezzle such a huge amount of money just for beauty consumption. Their preference is to love beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 34 of the &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on Administrative Punishment for Public Officials&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who accept or provide arrangements for banquets, travel, fitness, entertainment and other activities that may affect the fair exercise of public power will be given a warning, A demerit or a major demerit will be recorded, and if the circumstances are serious, the person will be demoted or dismissed.&quot; Beauty corruption, in terms of form, is a relatively hidden &quot;entertainment and other activities&quot;, and the amount involved is often in compliance with the &quot;Applicable Laws on Handling Criminal Cases of Corruption and Bribery&quot; of the two high authorities. The &quot;extremely huge amount&quot; standard in &quot;Explanation of Certain Issues&quot; can be called hidden corruption in the gray area. Therefore, to combat beauty corruption, we need to start from the source of corruption and curb the room for arbitrary power. This point is gender-neutral. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国家数据局揭牌，年内落马中管干部达39人丨时政周报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259490]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW02DgWUpAEzt6F.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;617&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/26cYbymIzOStR24cc3LlYF4O4UW0 2DgWUpAEzt6F. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 25, 2023, the National Data Administration was officially launched. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than seven months of preparation, on the morning of October 25, 2023, a group of members of the preparatory team Witnessed by representatives from other ministries and commissions, the National Data Agency was officially unveiled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the two newly established departments in the ninth institutional reform of the State Council have been completed.

Earlier, at the end of 2022, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Building a Data Infrastructure System to Better Play the Role of Data Elements.&quot; Both documents include content to accelerate the development of the digital economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiandong, deputy director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, was more direct.

The &quot;Digital China Development Report (2022)&quot; released by the Cyberspace Administration of China shows that the scale of China&#39;s data digital economy will reach 50.2 trillion yuan in 2022, ranking second in the world, accounting for 41.5% of GDP, and will continue to remain the same. With a high growth rate of 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to Zhang Xianghong, a professor at the International Research Center for Information Management Theory and Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University, the current level of development of China&#39;s public data, corporate data and personal data is still low, and the level of utilization is not high. Problems of insufficient motivation and insufficient utilization of vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, unified data resource management and activation of data efficiency have become high hopes for the National Data Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a previous interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, Yuan Lizhi, a partner at Jingtian &amp; Gongcheng Law Firm and an expert in data law, mentioned that in January 2023, after a seminar on the circulation of data elements, the state Staff from the National Development and Reform Commission once worked with him to communicate on practical issues regarding the circulation of data elements. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two leaders made their early appearance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;They have clear development goals, which is also reflected in the personnel arrangements of the National Data Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, 2023, Liu Liehong, the first director of the National Data Administration, made his first public appearance at the high-level forum on digital economy of the third &quot;Belt and Road&quot; International Cooperation Summit Forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resume shows that Liu Liehong was born in 1968 and has worked in industrial electronic information institutions for a long time.

title=&quot;硬核军训是怎么炼成的&quot;>;硬核军训是怎么炼成的&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;采访桂林电子科技大学（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;下称“桂电”&lt;/span>;）和桂林航天工业学院（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;下称“桂航”&lt;/span>;）军训负责人员时，我想了解组织硬核军训的难处，却总是未能如愿。这两所学校借到模拟武器、战车，并不很费力。摸爬滚打的战术训练，似乎也是水到渠成。当地警备区、军训教育基地，不吝于向校方开放大门，能把拟真的装备、足够数量的现役或退役军人输送到参训新生身边。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在这些客观因素之外，我感受到，有一股强烈的心灵力量，让广西这两所高校的硬核军训得以顺畅推行。在参加特战训练的学生心中，军训不是一项强迫完成的义务，而是被渴慕的生命体验。一种人，从军训第一天起就期盼着一切结束那天的解脱感；另一种人，则希望追求军训的内在价值，即使军训结束，也渴望将其延续。我自认为，学生时代参加军训时，我属于前者；但桂林高校的参训学生，有很多属于后者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沈鸿受访时，有些腼腆。爱国国防教育协会主席黄翊龙常说，沈鸿是红军排雷炮手的优秀代表。听到这类赞扬，沈鸿或埋头看地，或遥望路灯，刻意向我藏起笑意。与偶尔飘忽的神情不同，即便人已经出列，二十多分钟内，沈鸿的模拟枪从头至尾都被他以标准的持枪姿势定在胸口，不曾移动分毫。两周新生军训、两周协会的日常训练，似乎让他把坚如磐石的动作刻成了习惯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提到特战训练的艰辛，沈鸿总是轻描淡写：“手肘、膝盖、腿、脚都有擦伤，但敷点药就过去了。”“跃进时突然听到左右遇敌的指令，身体反应不过来，这个动作就一直练，加强练。开始会做错，练三四天我能做标准。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起这些，“军人”的身份对沈鸿更有感召力。他出生于广西环江毛南族自治县，今年刚大一，已经追了十多年战争片、谍战剧。回忆起和父亲一起看电视的时光，沈鸿的语调提高了几度，“中国军人很帅气。”他第一次知道身为农民的父亲还当过兵，是因为看到了他的行军水壶，“那是军队里特有的水壶。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沈鸿确信，如果自身条件符合征兵标准，他毕业后定会入伍。对他而言，这次军训，不只是按教学大纲上的必修课程，更是正式从军前严肃的预备演练。吸引他加入战术连队的，不只有形式丰富的枪械训练，还有随压力而来的“军人的自豪感。”在沈鸿眼中，队友也是“家国意识强烈，说话直接又豪爽的人”。“我喜欢和这样能够推心置腹的人做朋友。”他渴望未来的军营生活也是如此：在草地训练时被蚂蚁咬，有战友会乐呵呵地递上一剂药膏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月28日，桂航军训汇演结束时天色已暗，没有机会在汇演中乘坐装甲车的特战队员以八九人为一批，挨个爬上装甲车。他们在车顶勾肩搭背坐成小半圈，一边唱着歌，一边随战车向前挺进。每个人的脸上都挂着疲惫的迷彩妆，歌声却依然嘹亮，他们就像久经沙场的战士们，凯旋而归。行进到操场中央，装甲车猛然停下，队员们一个趔趄，仿佛也是梦醒于此。但当他们从车上爬下来，又看到远处其他队员盘腿坐在路灯下，吵吵嚷嚷，热热闹闹，便奔了过去，战友的微信、照片、言语，长存于迷彩色的梦境之后。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;母亲告诉我，杨奶奶今年81岁，是村里年龄最大的人。杨奶奶的老伴过世多年，她的两个儿子都在省城武汉发展，她独居。我见地里种有白萝卜、胡萝卜、红菜苔、卷心菜，便问杨奶奶为何要种这么多，她说，“四个月后，孩子们都回家了，一起有9张嘴。”我一下子意识到，四个月后就是春节。她还补充了一句，“不仅他们过年回来吃，我还得备一些给他们走的时候带走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看到早些时候种下的萝卜长势不是很好，我问她何故，她告诉两点原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，很多农民进城打工了，很多田地荒芜了，灌木丛到处都是，野猪、獾子等动物较之从前多了许多，像人多势众一样，它们已经不是夜里偷偷摸摸地吃包括蔬菜在内的农作物，大白天它们也可以大大方方地入侵菜地、谷地、红薯地，白天，老人还能时不时杵着一根棍子过来菜地看守，驱赶一下野物，夜里，她就完全没有办法了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，因为长期使用农药及化肥，农地的土壤结构发生了变异，土壤板结严重，肥力下降得厉害，包括蔬菜在内的各类农作物的产量锐减。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;事实上，我们回不去了&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;叮嘱杨奶奶小心一些后，我和母亲继续散步。眼前是大片的稻田，母亲问我知道哪块是我家的，我猜了两次，母亲皆摇摇头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我顿觉惭愧，我连自家的田地都不知在哪里。应该是2008年工作以来，每次我回家，父母都不怎么下地干农活，专门陪着我，我当然也鲜有机会下地。时间久了，我也就忘了家里田地的准确位置。见稻谷呈金黄色，我提议第二天收割，我也帮忙割，不料母亲对我的割稻技艺很不放心。 “还是等你回广州了，我和你爸慢慢来吧，你多年不下田，万一割到手，就不好了。”我竟然无言以对，因为事实就是我虽然经常回家，但很少下地干活，早已不像我念小学和初中那会儿，是家里重要的劳力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在广州某高校任职，我有为期不短的暑假及寒假，我每年回家的天数远多于村里其他年轻人。譬如我弟，他17岁高二辍学后就开始了他的打工生涯，基本上一年到头都在外打工，除了春节回家半月左右。我弟今年44岁，迄今打工了27年。如今，他已在武汉购房，弟媳及两个侄子也都在武汉常住，大侄子念大学，弟媳照顾上小学的小侄子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，我的小家一家四口在广州，我弟的小家一家四口在武汉，我们都主动或被动地卷入了城镇化的浪潮，我们很难再回到家乡发展或定居了。事实上，我们也回不去了，因为我们早已不是“农业人口”了，我们一直在从事“非农产业”，与我弟的户籍至今在老家无关。不管我们是不是享受到了地道广州或武汉市民的各类福利或待遇，我们都已经是名副其实的（新）广州人或（新）武汉人，广州或武汉是我们的常住地，是我们及孩子们吃喝拉撒、衣食住行的地儿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和我弟是70后，村里比我们年幼的80后、90后干嘛呢？现在何处？少部分人依靠读书离开了家乡，绝大部分像我弟一样常年在外打工，他们的共同点是常年不在家，不回家，有且只有过年才回家待上十天半月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比我们年长的60后又在干嘛呢？我所在的村有8位60后，其中4位随子女进城务工，要么照顾上学的孙子，要么给做建筑工的儿子打打下手，有两位开了装修公司，分别在武汉和西宁做起了老板，最后两个都在教育行业，一位在武汉某大学做老师，另外一位在家乡的村小学做校长。不难看出，8位60后也基本上都脱离了农村及农业，也都是逢过年才回家的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;60后、70后、80后、90后现在都进城了，目前都在城里打拼，他们未来有回村的计划或迹象吗？我感觉微乎其微。他们在城里多年，饮食、文化、习惯等早已高度城市化了，80后及90后，他们经历了城市化的漂洗，商场、KTV、影院，快餐、游戏厅，他们已经离不开这些东西了，就连1962出生的夏叔也说，“我虽然在老家种了20多年的地，但现在我已经不习惯回家了，因为老家的生活太不方便了，城市太方便了。”在东北打工的文哥也曾提过，“家里的冬天太冷了，我很不适应，我在哈尔滨待了32年，那里虽然室外温度低，但室内都有暖气，很舒服。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人Vs农民&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不言而喻，至今都在老家务农的人只剩下杨奶奶这种40后，及像我父母一样的50后。随着孩子纷纷进城上学，很多妇女也加入了打工族，以及上世纪80年代改革开放初期就外出谋生的60后对城市生活的极大适应，往昔作为农村人口主要构成主体的“386199”部队，如今只剩下了孤独的“99”，对应的具体群体当是40后及50后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想表达，这群人是名副其实的“最后一代务农人”。特别指出，笔者并未使用“农民”这一概念。在我看来，“农民”“工人”等概念具有鲜明的政治与身份属性，“农民”一词使用语境里，经常存在若干对照群体，比如“农民对应哪个群体”“农民在农村，工人在城里”，其实不然，本质上，他们只是行业或职业分工的差异而已，不存在政治、身份等方面的分野或对立。同样，“工人”一词也存在类似情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时过境迁，我们更愿意使用“打工人”“打工仔”“打工妹”“务农人”“农民工”等普通百姓耳熟能详与更容易接受的概念。不管是“务农人”，还是“打工人”，他们都是名副其实的产业工人（industrial workers/laborers）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人的技艺&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;既是“务农人”，这群高龄老人自然深谙务农或农村与农业的各项技术与技艺，他们打小对农业时令了如指掌，知道啥时候春耕，啥时候育苗，啥时候播种，啥时候施肥，啥时候除草，啥时候收割，用什么储藏农作物。他们知道拿灶膛或柴火堆里的灰烬作为肥料，也知道用人及鸡、猪等粪便作为农作物养料的重要补充，而不只是全部倚靠农药或化肥来提高土壤的肥力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们会利用房前屋后的边角地种一点菜，或开垦山间布满石块或荒芜已久的闲置或废弃地种东西。建房子或选坟地前，他们会请风水先生看看；他们发明了夏天纳凉用的竹床、冬天取暖用的烘笼，夜里如厕用的夜壶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们中的很多人打小就是标准的农村匠人，如铁匠、漆匠、油匠、木匠、篾匠、裁缝、接生婆、赤脚医生、算命先生、巫医。村里改造时，他们提醒年轻人不要轻易移除村口的古木，强烈建议保留村中央的老祠堂。家人肚子疼、腹泻或有其他三病两痛时，他们会去田里寻来鱼腥草、艾叶，用来泡脚、泡澡，或烟熏，或煎水服用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毫不夸张地说，他们熟悉或掌握的技艺，不胜枚举。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，他们中的绝大部分人文化程度很低，文盲或半文盲的比例甚高，但无碍于他们对农业技术、乡村记忆与农业文明的深谙与熟稔。对于教科书或宣传标语里的循环经济、生态农业、集约与节约用地、非物质文化遗产等，他们或许不曾说过，也不懂怎么表达，但他们却一辈子在践行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这道出了一个理儿，文化、文明经常或通常与文化程度关系不大，或不太大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如实说，“最后一代务农人”对农业技术的传承、农业文明的赓续、家庭与家族的和谐、国家的城镇化与现代化作出了重大贡献。正是他们接续其先人与祖先，通过一代又一代人的传承，才令到农业文明得以发扬与传承；正是他们镇守老家与后方，才让其子女及其晚辈可以从容与放心地进城打拼，创造属于新一代人的新生活；正是他们及其子女的善良与拼搏，才缔造了中国低成本的工业化、城镇化与现代化奇迹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;务农人的生活方式与价值观&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;于生活方式而言，“最后一代务农人”普遍具有勤俭节约的品格，比如吃东西尽量不浪费，做多少吃多少，人吃剩了的给猪狗鸡等家畜家禽吃，对子女出于孝顺与孝敬心的各种快递，他们虽倍感欣慰，但也偶有抱怨，会觉得子女花钱如流水，大手大脚。勤俭节约品格的习得与养成，固然与他们历经的那些至艰至难岁月有关，但在那个物质极度贫乏的年代，不节约、不节俭，就没有办法实现物质与财富积累，及资本积累。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里的“资本积累”，不妨理解为“没有钱，交不起学费，孩子即便考上大学了也上不了大学，作为农村人最大的宏愿——&#39;跳出农门&#39;，以及日后的门庭显赫、光宗耀祖，自然也都无法兑现”。上述说法的假设是：子女是家里最重要的投资领域，对子女的培养支出就是投资成本，子女日后的发展及回报就是投资收益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;价值观念方面，“最后一代务农人”非常“忘我”，“忘我”到极致。他们生命的全部意义在于贡献与奉献，很多人大半辈子或一辈子都在为别人活、为家人活。他们历经千辛万苦，一辈子被固着在土地上，没有或鲜有离开家乡，干了一辈子农活，所谓“面朝黄土背朝天”的精准所指就是他们这一代人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们中的很多人打小就是家里的主要劳力，勤俭节省一辈子，盖房子，娶妻生子，然后节衣缩食抚养孩子成人，供孩子读书，待到孩子大了，还想着给孩子补贴一下，多少分担一下孩子在城里购房或结婚成家的压力。少部分人甚至忍受文化适应的煎熬，在耄耋之年依然选择进城给孩子做饭、接送孙子上学及放学，待到孙辈大了，他们才得以回家，回到他们习惯了一辈子的家。回家了，他们终于可以不用忙碌了，却发现早已落下一身病，有的人选择不告诉子女，怕用子女的钱，有的人干脆不去医院体检，担心一旦查出问题，给子女添堵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;既然是“最后一代务农人”，那就是“末代”了，就如同很多已经和正在经历衰败与凋敝过程的村庄一样，时代的洪流不会因为他们辛苦或艰难就可怜他们，或留住他们。旧人退场，新人登场，从来就是历史发展与演迁之必然规律，没有人可以阻止。我们可以心生凄凉，但终究还需释怀。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Chuan (Hao Tiehua), the father of Hu Shi. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1895, the Qing government ceded Taiwan. Hu Shi&#39;s father, Hu Chuan, was the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture at the time. Hu Shi recalled that his father was &quot;unable to &quot;Willing to release&quot; delayed medical treatment and died, and most academic circles gave a conclusion of &quot;death from illness&quot;. The author discovered from the diary of Yuan Chang, a disciple of Zhang Zhidong, that Hu Chuan was imprisoned and blackmailed by Liu Yongfu, which worsened his condition and died on the ship back to Xiamen. Liu Yongfu finally let him go because Yuan Chang asked Zhang Zhidong to intervene. Yuan Chang was killed in 1900 for speaking out. He was a loyal and upright person, and his record deserves attention. The content of Yuan Chang&#39;s record is consistent with Hu Shi&#39;s recollection, but the wording is slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi&#39;s father&#39;s official name was Hu Chuan, also known as Shousan and Shoushan, also known as Tiehua and Blunt Man. He experienced twists and turns in his life. He went north to Ninggu Pagoda, south to Hainan Li District, and finally arrived in Taiwan. The governor of Dongzhili Prefecture. For a long time, people have been under the impression that Hu Chuan died of illness. Luo Ergang, a disciple of Hu Shi and the famous scholar who compiled &quot;Hu Tiehua&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, also agrees with this theory. There are many people who hold this view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author also believes that Hu Chuan died of illness, but he died of an aggravation of his illness due to delays in treatment in captivity, and did not die of a normal illness. Hu Shi recalled: &quot;My father was in Taitung in charge of the defense of Houshan. Telegraphs were blocked and his salary source was cut off. At that time, he had suffered from beriberi and could no longer move his left foot. He stayed there until the third day of the fifth lunar month before leaving. Back Mountain, when they arrived in Anping, Liu Yongfu insisted on keeping him for help and refused to let him go. By June 25, he could no longer move his feet, so Liu Yongfu let him go. On June 28, he arrived in Xiamen. He could no longer move, and he died in Xiamen on July 3rd.&quot; (Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;) Hu Shi later added: &quot;But in my &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot;, I stated that my father&#39;s death was due to beriberi. It can be cured. My father originally wanted to rush to Shanghai to seek medical treatment, but because Liu Yongfu refused to let him go, it was delayed for nearly two months. It was not until he was critically ill that he was let go. He arrived in Xiamen on June 28th and arrived in Xiamen in early July. He died at the age of three. My original intention (and the opinion of my late brother and late mother) is that my late father’s death was due to Liu Yongfu’s refusal to let him go.” (Hu Songping’s “First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi”, Volume 1 Page 27) The person accompanying Hu Chuan that day was Hu Shi&#39;s second brother Shaozhi, who was also responsible for carrying the coffin back home. The situation described by Hu Shi should come from his second brother. Hu Shi&#39;s addition is extremely important and is consistent with Yuan Chang&#39;s diary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/8eG93hRZLCT8OzKR3OWQNDJHsCTfvSs2GHoZ85hf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Yongfu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading Hu Chuan&#39;s &quot;Taiwan Diary&quot;, he wrote to Tang Jingsong on the 6th of May, requesting &quot;to open a vacancy and return to his hometown for medical treatment&quot; and &quot;recover as soon as he obtains Yuan Shuangqiu&#39;s observation book from South Anhui Province.&quot; This diary entry proves that Hu Chuo&#39;s intention was to return to the mainland for medical treatment, and that he had frequent correspondence with Yuan Chang. Yuan Chang&#39;s official position at this time was Guangtai Road, Ningchi, Anhui Province, referred to as &quot;Wannan Road&quot;. Because he was stationed in Wuhu, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Wuhu Road&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;, Hu Chuan was &quot;imprisoned and deprived of food&quot; by Liu Yongfu, which caused his condition to worsen. He died on the ship, and only a corpse arrived in Xiamen. Yuan Chang was a student admitted by Zhang Zhidong when he was the deputy chief examiner of Zhejiang Province in his early years. Yuan Chang&#39;s &quot;Diary of a Sanren in Bixietai Mountain&quot; collected in &quot;Diaries of the Past Dynasties&quot; has the same content as Sun Zhimei&#39;s punctuated version of &quot;Yuan Chang&#39;s Diary&quot;. It is an abridged copy of reading notes and a small number of notes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the diary, in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), he met Chen Wenluo (Chen Zhongying) and recalled what happened the previous year. Yuan Chang wrote in 1896: &quot;Chen Zhongying once guarded Tainan. He talked about how his deceased friend Hu Shousan (biography) was an official in Taitung Prefecture. He asked Liu Yongfu for a bribe of 20,000 yuan for the commander-in-chief Liu Yongfu, but he couldn&#39;t get it. He was imprisoned and had no food or drink. Yongfu originally surrendered to the thieves. It is a true act of thieves. I went to Xia to beg the governor Zhang Gong to interrogate Liu, and released Huzhou as a pastor. Before crossing the Taiwan Strait to Xiamen, he drank wine on a ship. He was so angry that he could not pursue his ambition and became ill.&quot; (Compiled by Sun Zhimei, &quot;Yuan Chang&quot; (Diary, Volume 2, page 1224) Chen Wenluo was appointed as the prefect of Taipei in 1892. He had never been stationed in Tainan, but he obeyed the order to cross over in May. Chen Wenluo is a colleague of Hu Chuan. His official experience makes his testimony irreplaceable and authoritative, and he is closest to the historical scene. Jiawu and Yiweizhangzhidong were in charge of the governor of Liangjiang, and Wuhu Road was under the governor of Liangjiang. According to the diary, it was Yuan Chang who asked Zhang Zhidong to call Liu Yongfu to release Hu Chuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the governors of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong paid the most attention to Yiwei Taiwan. Tang Jingsong, the governor of Taiwan, and Liu Yongfu, the assistant general of Nan&#39;ao Town, Taiwan Defense, were all supported and commanded by Zhang Zhidong during the Sino-French War. , Hu Chuanze inspected the Li District of Hainan in 1887 on the order of Zhang Zhidong. These three people all have deep connections with Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in Taiwan during the Yiwei period was very complicated. Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, ostensibly complied with the imperial court&#39;s decision to cede Taiwan. He also secretly supported Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu in resisting Japan and protecting Taiwan, and provided money and weapons. However, after receiving a telegram from the imperial court to challenge him, he stopped and left Tang and Liu to their own devices. Decide on orientation. Tang and Liu were originally famous generals who fought against the French, but were misled by their fame. They initially decided to stay in Taiwan to fight against the Japanese. However, their military strength could not last long. Tang Jingsong soon sneaked back to the mainland, while Liu Yongfu was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by others. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been tricked by Zhang Zhidong. When most of the local officials had been transferred inland, it was impossible to detain Hu Chuan, the magistrate of Taitung Prefecture, to demand payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Liu Yongfu cut off support from the mainland, it was a relatively simple way to obtain military pay from local officials. After careful reading of what Chen Wenluo said about &quot;asking for bribes,&quot; I feel that it is more reasonable to interpret it as &quot;asking for salary.&quot; Liu Yongfu detained Hu Chuan and &quot;deprived him of food and drink in captivity.&quot; However, Hu Chuan had no cash in his hands, and it was very difficult to raise wages as the Japanese troops advanced deeper and deeper. Yuan Chang from Wuhu Road asked Zhang Zhidong for help and called Liu Yongfu to release him. Hu Chuan died on the ship returning to Xiamen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Chuan died because he was imprisoned by Liu Yongfu and fasted, which delayed his treatment and his condition worsened. This was not a normal death. During the Sino-French War, Tang Jingsong took the initiative to sneak into Vietnam and fight alongside Liu Yongfu. He had a relatively deep understanding of Liu Yongfu. In 1884, he reported to the court through Cen Yuying, the governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, saying that Liu Yongfu &quot;valued wealth too much, treated his subordinates unkindly, and showed no mercy.&quot; No discipline.&quot; (Page 91 of Volume 1 of &quot;The Telegram of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Unpublished)&quot;) Linking this phrase with the way he treated Hu Chuan in 1895, another side of Liu Yongfu&#39;s character becomes apparent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在何种情况下，以色列会使用核武器？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKKvSjE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lPGP575q0cEcOl9oyhbIVi2CCvaUQuFNCyKK vSjE. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The northern Gaza Strip was attacked in Sderot, Israel, on October 23, 2023. Thick smoke rising after Israeli air strikes &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Israeli Knesset member &quot;Tali&quot; Gotliff (Revital &quot;Tally&quot; Gotliv) actually told the media that Israel should use nuclear weapons to retaliate against Hamas&#39;s attacks on Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gotliff also wrote on her social media: &quot;Jericho missile! Jericho missile! Strategic alert. Before considering troops entering. Doomsday weapon (used)! This is mine Viewpoint. May God bless us with all our strength.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She later publicly declared that &quot;only an explosion that shook the Middle East can restore this country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;means Israel&lt;/span>;) dignity, strength and security! It’s time to kiss the end of the world. Launch powerful missiles without limit. Don’t level a neighborhood, smash and level the entire Gaza…nothing Show no mercy! Show no mercy!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, this is an outright nuclear threat. Gottliff is a lawyer and an opponent of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Her remarks have always been known for being extreme and crazy, so her extreme remarks this time were not regarded by anyone as a serious nuclear threat. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we have to admit the fact that Israel is indeed the only country in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons, and it almost decided to use nuclear weapons to save the defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there is now a lot of public opinion that if anti-Israel allies such as Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah join the war, Hamas&#39;s goal of completely destroying Israel is expected to be achieved. But even if we do not take into account the fact that the combined conventional military strength of these opponents is still far behind that of Israel, as well as the fact that two US aircraft carriers are within easy reach, and only consider the existence of Israel&#39;s nuclear power, if Israel is completely defeated, this war will be The possibility of escalation to a nuclear war cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is Israel ready to use nuclear weapons in reality? To answer this question, we first need to understand what kind of nuclear power Israel has and what is the positioning of its nuclear strategy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Israel does not accept the supervision of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Israeli government has always implemented a vague nuclear strategy, neither admitting nor denying the possession of nuclear weapons, and has not announced the deployment of its nuclear weapons to the outside world, the outside world is very concerned. It is difficult to know exactly how many nuclear weapons Israel possesses and whether the nuclear weapons are in a state of war readiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international arms control research community now generally believes that Israel possesses at least 90 nuclear weapons and also retains key nuclear materials that can produce 200-300 nuclear weapons. Although Israel&#39;s nuclear weapons are very small, it is one of the very few countries with a triad of nuclear strike capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel has the Jericho medium-range ballistic missile with a range that can cover the entire Middle East and parts of Africa and Asia. This system is considered the core of Israel’s land-based nuclear strike force, among which the latest Jericho The Type 3 missile has a range of up to 4,800 kilometers, enough to cover Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, and even Moscow, the capital of Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the Israeli Air Force’s F-16 and F-15 fighter jets are capable of carrying nuclear bombs. The outside world even generally believes that Israel’s customized F-35 fighter jets will have the ability to drop nuclear bombs. It is expected that the Israeli Air Force’s There are at least 30 aerial nuclear bombs similar to the American B-61 type in the arsenal. This is the core of Israel&#39;s first-hand nuclear strike force. It maintains a very high level of combat readiness and can launch nuclear attacks from the air at any time, posing a threat to surrounding hostile countries. Very big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel is also one of the very few countries with underwater nuclear forces. Although it is not equipped with nuclear-powered submarines, the Dolphin-class conventionally powered submarines in service in its navy are equipped with nuclear cruise missiles. The Israeli Army and Air Force Even if they no longer exist, the submarine force can still carry out doomsday strike missions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This triad of nuclear strike capabilities enables Israel, despite its small land area, to possess nuclear combat capabilities that surpass those of Britain and France. It is one of the few countries that can carry out preemptive nuclear strikes against major deterrence targets. If Israel really faces the risk of national annihilation, it is very likely to use nuclear weapons at the last moment in a desperate move. In fact, Israel&#39;s nuclear deterrent took shape after the Fourth Middle East War. This was also one of the strategic considerations for secular Arab countries such as Egypt to normalize relations with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Congressman Gotliff’s statement that nuclear weapons should be used in Gaza is obviously just a personal statement. No matter how crazy Israel is, the radiation fallout after the nuclear explosion is an unacceptable and catastrophic consequence for Israel, which is very close. However, if the war expands and Iran directly participates in the war, then Israel&#39;s use of nuclear weapons is not an impossible option. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Israel conducted a joint exercise with the United States to attack Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities, and Israel&#39;s combat plan is likely to include the option of launching a nuclear strike against Iran in extreme circumstances. This Hamas attack is generally considered to be the worst situation Israel has encountered after the Yom Kippur War. If Israel had prepared for a nuclear strike in 1973, it is not ruled out that there will be relevant plans this time. What&#39;s worse is that the number and means of use of the Israeli military&#39;s nuclear weapons have now far exceeded those of the past. Therefore, the international community should be alert to the possibility and harm of Israel preparing to use nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一碗海鲜面和便民热线]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259434]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;During the holidays, my husband and I joined in the fun and went to an island with the outdoor club. When we arrived at the island, it was already lunch time, so let’s look for seafood noodles. Who let seafood noodles be my obsession? I turned into a restaurant and found that it was a fast food restaurant. I asked casually, &quot;Are there any seafood noodles?&quot;, and the answer was, &quot;Yes, you can prepare seafood by yourself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I happily served myself chilled shrimp, clams and dragonhead fish. The store owner asked me if I wanted razor clams. I told me that I didn’t want to eat razor clams because they would cause abdominal pain. The store owner took my selected seafood to the kitchen. I also remembered the club leader’s reminder to ask how much it would cost to eat seafood noodles. Last time she went there to eat, she was overcharged a lot without asking, so she specifically asked the price. The boss paused and said it was 48 yuan. I was a little surprised and thought to myself, this seafood noodle has never cost more than 30 yuan this year, but now it has increased by more than 50%? After thinking about it again, 48 yuan is not a big amount, so I acquiesced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After waiting for a while, the seafood noodles arrived. Because I was hungry, I picked up my chopsticks and ate it. I barely tasted it, but I found a lot of things wrong with it: Why was there razor clams in it? I chose three dragonhead fish that are more than ten centimeters long. Why are there only three small sections? Why is the shell of the shrimp so crispy and the meat of the shrimp so dry? It doesn’t look like it’s fresh, but it looks like it’s been dried in the sun? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My husband ate fast food. He ate before me and paid for it after he finished eating. After eating, I felt dissatisfied and argued with the boss, questioning whether the ingredients were out of the bag. This is great, three or four people in the store surrounded us, talking all over the place, and arrogantly denying my doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Who is in charge of your store?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Me,&quot; the boss said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Okay, everyone else shut up. We will negotiate with you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boss asked: &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said: &quot; Refund my money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked: &quot;Full refund?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought about it and said, &quot;That&#39;s not true. I also ate the noodles, so I will refund 20 yuan. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boss&#39;s eyes widened and he raised his voice: &quot;What? Impossible! Just go and complain!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really didn&#39;t think of complaining before, but when he said this, I It got so popular that I directly dialed the 12345 hotline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About an hour later, I received a call, saying that it was from the Market Supervision Bureau. They had arrived at the scene and asked me if I had complained about the store adding extra razor clams to the seafood noodles. When I heard this, I was very surprised that the packaging of ingredients was so fresh and refined. I quickly said, I will review the matter for you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After repeating it briefly and concisely, the other party said that he would wait for him to verify it before making any decision. After a while, a call came, saying that no dried shrimps were found in the kitchen, and the razor clams were put in by mistake. I had no corresponding evidence, so I would not handle it. I said, I don’t accept this result. The boss had no fear from the beginning and asked me to “just complain.” Did he know that your arms would be bent inwards? I will continue to complain to the higher-level department. The previous complaints were: 1. The price deviated from the market and was suspected of robbing customers; 2. Ingredients were swapped; 3. The attitude was bad. If you insist on this attitude, then add another one: local protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;50 minutes later, I got a call. First, the boss was willing to apologize to me for his attitude and the wrong ingredients, and second, he was willing to refund 20 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should we be happy that things have come to this? No, no, no, I&#39;m not happy at all. Not only does it taste bad to eat a bowl of seafood noodles, but you actually have to call 12345, and the market supervisor will make you a mess. Although the matter was finally dealt with, I always felt that without my &quot;threat&quot;, the matter would have been settled. It would be frustrating if the resolution of the matter depends on such &quot;threats&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always trusted 12345 because of her awareness of serving the people, because of her efficient work efficiency, and because of her responsive and well-organized style of doing everything. In my complaint, the corresponding functional department personnel rushed to the scene in more than an hour, and the work efficiency was not high. But if we talk about the matter, I think there are still flaws in the handling of this matter. If I had a fair heart and was not partial to local businesses and not perfunctory to foreign tourists, then I wouldn’t feel so sorry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That evening, we came to an internet celebrity village on this island. We saw someone eating seafood noodles, so we asked the price and were told 30 yuan. The seafood noodles were made by an old couple who were over seventy years old. I asked them what kind of seafood was put in the seafood noodles. The old woman replied that there were live shrimps, razor clams, clams, and a poached egg. We happily ordered two bowls of seafood noodles, and my husband ate all the razor clams in them. It felt good to enjoy the sea breeze, listen to the waves, and watch the moon rise little by little. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While we were eating noodles, I saw this old couple selling more than a dozen bowls of noodles. I did a rough calculation and found that a bowl of noodles costs about 10 yuan, so their income for a day is quite considerable. A bowl of seafood noodles costs 30 yuan. The store makes a profit and tourists can accept it. What a harmonious ecology! I can’t understand why some businesses still want to rip off customers. Are they not afraid of losing their own business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为退休教师）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末App“hi，南周”栏目期待您的来稿。投稿邮箱：nfzmreaders@163.com）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
