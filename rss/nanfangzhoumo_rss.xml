Liang Gewen, the former Secretary of the Qingyuan Municipal Party Committee, mentioned it again. The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; evolved from the 5 yuan reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was an attempt by Qingyuan to expand enterprise autonomy and mobilize workers&#39; enthusiasm at the beginning of reform and opening up, and pioneered the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong. Over the past 45 years, the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; advocating &quot;dare to be the first&quot; has continued to play different roles in various historical periods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Liang Gewen, the event also invited Deng Sai from the Party Building Office of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangdong Province and Lu Guowei, member of the Party Branch of Lianzhang Village, Lianjiangkou Town, Yingde City. The three of them witnessed different stages of reform and opening up. . Deng Sai was one of the first batch of civil servants recruited openly when the Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission was established in 2004. He has deep feelings about the reform of state-owned enterprises in the past two decades. Lu Guowei shared the great changes in Lianzhang Village in the past five years from the perspective of a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the event, the 80-year-old Liang Gewen always emphasized that today we still need to emancipate our minds and boldly innovate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More work, more rewards, turn losses into profits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, on the eve of reform and opening up, Qingyuan began to implement the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission bonus&quot; reform . Liang Gewen, then the press secretary of the Qingyuan County Party Committee, was 35 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Gewen has a deep understanding of Qingyuan’s traffic. Qingyuan is located in the mountainous area of ​​northern Guangdong and has inconvenient transportation. At that time, there was no road from Qingyuan to Guangzhou, so one had to cross the river by boat and then take a bumpy car. Liang Gewen went to Guangzhou to deliver articles to newspapers. Riding a motorcycle was faster than a car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geographical location led to Qingyuan&#39;s economic backwardness to a certain extent. Its economic aggregate and fiscal revenue basically ranked at the bottom of the province at that time. In 1977, Qingyuan failed to complete the profit plan issued by the state and suffered a loss of more than 300,000 yuan. Some companies even needed to borrow money from the local government to pay workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because workers eat from a big pot, it doesn’t make much difference whether they work more or less. Qingyuan’s largest state-owned nitrogen fertilizer factory at the time faced the problem of workers being passive and slow in working. The nitrogen fertilizer plant, which was put into operation in 1970, was the largest factory with the most workers in Qingyuan at that time. However, the annual output of a medium-sized fertilizer factory with more than 400 people was only more than 5,000 tons at its peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Output cannot increase, and the factory has been losing money year after year. According to factory employees, when farmers queued up to buy fertilizer, some people started fighting over it. &quot;If fertilizers cannot keep up, food production will be reduced, and farmers will have to look for fertilizers everywhere.&quot; Liang Gewen said. During the busy farming season of July and August every year, the county party committee secretary would come to the factory to supervise production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point occurred in October 1978. A policy called &quot;Super Planned Profit Commission Award&quot; was first piloted at Qingyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this reform, there was an accident in the factory. A worker accidentally closed the wrong valve of a gas tank, causing the gas tank to become severely deformed. According to past experience, it takes three months to repair. In order to meet the construction deadline, the factory leaders summoned technical personnel from all over Qingyuan and promised that whoever could repair the equipment and resume production in advance would be rewarded 5 yuan. In the end, it only took 10 days to complete the task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the concept of 5 yuan? At that time, workers&#39; monthly salary was 33 yuan. In order to support their families, many workers go to the mountains to cut firewood, go down to the rivers to catch fish, and fish for snails in the fields after get off work to increase their income. &quot;Five yuan can buy eight pounds of pork. At that time, the target was half a pound of pork per person per month.&quot; Liang Gewen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident made the factory leaders realize that incentives can be used to mobilize motivation. In the atmosphere of great discussion on the issue of truth standards, the nitrogen fertilizer plant also held a discussion meeting. An agreement was reached at the meeting to improve everyone&#39;s enthusiasm through reforming the reward system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since October 1978, the county party committee began to pilot the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award&quot; in four plants including the nitrogen fertilizer plant. &quot;For example, if we plan to hand over 1 million yuan in profits, if the annual profit is 1.5 million yuan, we will take part of the 500,000 yuan and distribute it to the workers.&quot; Liang Gewen explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the mechanism of more reward for more work, the efficiency of the factory has been significantly improved. After 18 days of trial operation, a profit of 35,000 yuan was achieved in the month. This was also the first month to achieve profit in nine years of production. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Opposition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Reform is not without opposition. Some departments in the county consider this to be a &quot;private division of state property.&quot; Fortunately, with the support of county leaders, it was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant has even attracted the attention of the Guangdong Provincial Government. But the opinions in the province are not unified. In May 1979, the finance and labor departments of Guangdong Province jointly issued a document requiring Qingyuan County to stop implementing the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award.&quot; The reason is that there is a lack of documentary evidence and the commission ratio is too large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, at the group discussion of the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Transportation Production Increase and Conservation Conference, the debate on the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was settled. The meeting decided to promote Qingyuan’s “Exceeding Plan Profit Commission Award” to county-owned industrial enterprises across Guangdong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that since turning losses into profits in 1979, the nitrogen fertilizer plant has achieved profits every year. By 1989, it had achieved a total profit of nearly 10 million yuan for 11 consecutive years. In the years that followed, Liang Gewen was often asked about the impact of the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; on Guangdong. His answer was simple - the most important thing was that the cadres and masses of the nitrogen fertilizer plant dared to be the first and boldly innovated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The courage to be the first and bold innovation in the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; have also taken root in the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong Province. According to Deng Sai, since the three-year action of state-owned enterprise reform was launched in 2020, &quot;Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economic layout structure has also undergone major changes, and state-owned capital has become more concentrated in important industries and key areas related to the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that as of the end of 2022, the total assets of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in Guangdong Province reached 16.27 trillion yuan, ranking third among local supervision enterprises in the country. In 2022, the operating income and profits of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in the province The total amount ranked third and second in the country respectively. Among the province&#39;s local state-owned assets supervision enterprises, 6 have entered the Fortune Global 500. &quot;This means that Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economy continues to grow in scale and strength, and is promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy.&quot; Deng Sai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianzhang Village, located in the northeast of Qingyuan City, is experiencing the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; in the new era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born in 1993, Lu Guowei is a native of Lianzhang Village. He often hears people mention the story of the reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant. In 2017, Lu Guowei returned to his hometown and became a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Guowei remembers that when he was a child, Lianzhang Village was one of the poorest villages in Lianjiangkou Town. The village was surrounded by mountains and only connected to the outside world by a rugged road. The village&#39;s pillar industry was Sugar orange. &quot;Except for a small amount of rice, peanuts, and corn, every household grows sugar oranges,&quot; Lu Guowei said. In 2011, affected by Huanglongbing, almost all the sugar orange trees in the village were wiped out. In the end, except for a small number of people planting bamboo shoots, most young adults chose to go out to work, while the elderly and children stayed behind in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, Lianzhang Village has gradually explored new paths for rural development. On the basis of vigorously developing specialty industries such as bamboo shoots and black tea, it also simultaneously promotes the intensive processing of specialty agricultural products. Lu Guowei said that currently there are more than 20 small and large enterprises stationed in the village, realizing everyone&#39;s wish to work at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether it is for Lianzhang Village or Qingyuan, we still have to dare to think and act.&quot; Liang Gewen said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在诺奖得主古尔纳的故乡，大海不再只有伤痛 | 月是故乡明②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257356]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 11/07/b840996666c29ba0936ba0ac8e934fd8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/ b840996666c29ba0936ba0ac8e934fd8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169416&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Zanzibar, a woman picks up seaweed at low tide. /ICphoto&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the occasion of the New Year in 2016, I came to Zanzibar for the first time - &quot;Unguja Island&quot; from the southern big island&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(also known as &quot;Zanzibar Island&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the northern island &quot;Pemba Island&quot; and other small islands, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zanzibar Island&quot;—— The capital of Stone Town&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;StoneTown&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, on a hazy morning at sunrise, I walked to the edge of the Indian Ocean with jagged reefs. Fishermen returning from the sea came ashore. They were shirtless, laughing and yelling in Swahili with tired faces. They pulled the not-full nets ashore, picked out lobsters, large octopus and tuna, and threw aside the remaining inferior goods. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A few hours later, these high-quality and fresh seafood will be delivered to a number of high-end Western, Indian, Arabic or Swahili restaurants. Then it is placed on the plates of tourists from all over the world. Those of poor quality will be transported to the local fish market and sold to countless people wearing bamboo baskets on their heads and wearing colorful kanga at a price of less than one-twentieth.&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color : #888888;&quot;>;(Traditional costumes of Swahili women)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, local women chattering enthusiastically. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I think that if I read the novels of Abdul Razak Gourna, at that moment, I might not be able to help but think of those in his different stories. A long paragraph about Mulberry Island, and empathize with it, such as: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8 -length=&quot;113&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;...the water plants were washed endlessly by the waves, lying on the beach It’s like a sunburned dream. There’s also the smell of sea salt, floating in every corner, in the nostrils and in the cochlea, just like the monsoon wind blowing from the sea and the port.&quot; (&quot;Farewell&quot; &quot;Memory of Departure&quot;, 1987)&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Unfortunately, although I have lived in Tanzania for six years and visited San Island three times, on October 7, 2021 Before the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Gurna, I knew nothing about this author who grew up on Sand Island until he was 18 years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1955, Stone Town&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the East African Islands, the dominant position has always been the sea, and the ocean further offshore. Every November, the southwest monsoon and ocean currents blow through southern India, southern Arabia and the coast of Somalia, to San Island, and then further south to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Before tourism became the main industry of Sand Island, the vast majority of people in Stone Town relied on the sea for their livelihood, including fishermen, sailors and merchants who came and went with the wind. At one time, there were dangerous merchants who sold ivory, spices and slaves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In today&#39;s Stone City, various houses of different sizes are dotted along the entire coastline. Many are Islamic-style buildings, and a few are decorated with complicated European patterns. It has been converted into post offices, office buildings, cafes, restaurants and private residences, among which there are many simple shabby iron shacks owned by local fishermen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the beginning of 2019, I came to Stone City for the third time. Taking advantage of the New Year holiday, I wandered around for nearly a week, looking at the remains of the ancient shell city wall seven or eight centuries ago. See the dungeons and chains at the former site of the slave trading market, and the monument to the 1964 Zan Island Uprising&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Zanzibar uprising to overthrow the Sudanese rule, 4 years later, Gurna left Sang to go to England)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;See how the lovely blue water licks the rocks of history little by little. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/0f29c1a85781d77f84cf6340ecd8f7ba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/0f29c1a85781d77f84cf6340ecd8f7ba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169419&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Writer Abdul-Razzak Gurnatou/Visual China&lt;/span >;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;One evening, I was walking in the old city and came to a square old house. It was hidden, but it was empty inside. It is not clear whether the house is for private or public use. Walking around the alley next to the house to the backyard, you can see a group of little boys wearing robes and square hats. They are squatting and playing with marbles and soda bottle caps. On the other side of the yard, there were several men leaning against the wall. They crossed their arms and talked about the rainy season, the wind direction and the lowest price for buying lilacs. Behind them were several women who set up small stalls selling fruits and vegetables. They seemed to be selling scattered dried fish, cherry tomatoes and onions. In fact, they were more interested in chatting. It didn&#39;t matter whether the things could be sold or not. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sun was setting at that time, and the light shone just right in the yard and on the roof, and finally briefly settled on the sweaty brows and cheeks of men, women, old and young. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After walking out of the yard, I went to a cafe across the street, ordered a cup of Americano with clove flavor, and pulled out an old book from the bookshelf. The book is called &quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;, F.D. Omani)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, published in 1955. When I opened it, I didn&#39;t have any expectations, it was just to kill time. Sand Island is called the &quot;Lilac Island&quot;, so judging from this title, it is not much different from most travel books about Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I flipped through the pages of the book until I saw an old black and white photo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Isn’t that square house and yard in the photo the same place I just passed by? More than fifty years have passed, and nothing seems to have changed. It seems that even people&#39;s status and clothing have been frozen at that moment. The adults sit or stand bored, and the children run or jump carefree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The caption of the photo reads: Arab residential area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This description can be used to summarize almost any neighborhood I passed through today, but to put it more accurately, most of the neighborhoods can be called &quot;Indian Arab Swahili&quot; Xili Mixed Residential Area&quot;. Because in today&#39;s Stone City, the vast majority of locals are accustomed to interracial trade, mixing, and intermarriage. It is difficult to accurately identify whether a person is of Arab, Indian, Southeast Asian, or Sri Lankan descent just by looking at his skin color and dress. With Vasili ancestry or a mixture of two or even three of them, almost everyone became a &quot;Zanzibar&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169420&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Overlooking Stone City/Visual China&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;In 2015, Gurner mentioned this residential area in a lecture at the University of Kent where he teaches. He was born and grew up in Stone Town, an area generally known as the &quot;Arab residential area.&quot; He projected a related black-and-white photo in class. The photo showed a small square house with a simple two-story building standing on the left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;98&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;p>;&quot;I was born in the small building on the left. When I was a child, we always stood on the terrace on the second floor and watched the sailing ships leaving the port or returning from the sea, one after another, loaded with various goods. If you go downstairs and pass through the courtyard downstairs, you will see a workplace, a warehouse, and a vegetable market behind it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url= &quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;244&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p>;But what you can’t see from the photo is what kind of person he is. Live in this place. If you could see them, you might feel helpless like me. Why? Because when the outside world talks about us and this place, they will always savagely describe it as The complexity and richness are summed up in these seven colorless words (referring to the &quot;Arab residential area&quot;)... But in fact, in the house at the back, there lived an Indian family; next to them, lived The president of the Lilac Planting Association is an Englishman; the house on the far side is the local police station, and the chief is a San Island native of Somali descent; behind the police station is a cafe run by a Yemeni businessman... But According to convention, this is only an Arab residential area.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gulna described all this calmly to the thoughtful college students in the audience, except for the slightly wrinkled Meifeng, no emotion can be seen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I think of that photo taken in 1955. Gurna was only about 7 years old that year. Maybe he was among the group of children playing in the background of the photo. From that time until he left home at the age of 18, it was a decade of great change in the history of Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169421&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A man draws characteristic tingatinga paintings and sells them to tourists/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1964, Mulberry Island Revolution&lt;/h3>; &lt; p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Lilac Eyes&quot;, I also turned to another dated black and white photo. Its caption read: European residential area - although the large Arab-style flat-roofed building in the photo looks There is nothing &quot;European&quot; about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next day, I found out the specific location of the building. After arriving, I discovered that the building complex was built one after another by Arab merchants two to three centuries ago. In the 19th century, the British became more and more active on Sand Island. Until the end of the 19th century, Sand Island became a British protectorate and this area was officially occupied by the British. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1872, Richard Belden published two issues of his travel diary about Zan Island, &quot;Zanzibar: City, Island and Seaside&quot;, and many subsequent comments They all thought that he might want to use this to hint that European readers had begun to explore the source of the Nile in 1856, much earlier than Livingston. But surprisingly, the influence of this diary is more evident in his inadvertent description of the slave trading system on Sand Island, which reminds people that the slave trade in East Africa is no less rampant than in West Africa. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a meeting place for Arabs, Indians, Europeans and Africans, San Island is like a corridor connecting various rooms and halls, and at the same time provides sweet dates from the Arab region. Plantations, the tea fields of India, and the sugar industry of Southeast Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(even the Americas)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; provided labor. The most miserable ones were the male slaves who were selected as eunuchs by the Ottoman Empire. Because of the unhygienic conditions of castration, usually only one in ten could survive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Belden mentioned: Investigations show that before 1897, when the British used both carrot and stick to ask the Sultan who was in power at that time to abolish slavery, two-thirds of the people on Sand Island were of the population belonged to the slave class. Still, Belden wrote, it was difficult for him to differentiate between black and brown people and what their ancestry was. &quot;Swahili, Persian&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(later developed into the &quot;Shiraz ethnic group&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, Arabia and India...all mixed together , I feel that the people here&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(referring to Sang Island)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; are simply like a brand new race.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1890, the British officially took over Sand Island, but did not provide any effective and constructive mechanism for sustainable development. Land, wealth and power are still highly concentrated in Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Including Arabia)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the hands of the merchant class. At the same time, as was the practice in many other colonial powers, the rulers adopted a rigid management method in Sand Island by classifying all civilians according to their ethnicity and forcing them into a certain ethnic identity group. This made the tension inherent in the complex and subtle multi-racial mixture of Mulberry Island suddenly become tense. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Until the 1950s, a political storm against colonial rule swept across Africa. In 1963, Sand Island declared independence from the United Kingdom, the new Sudan succeeded to the throne, and British forces hurriedly withdrew from Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Two days after leaving the &quot;European residential area&quot;, I came to the outskirts of Stone City and stayed at a B&amp;B recommended by a friend. &quot;Chat with the boss, you I&#39;ll be interested.&quot; My friend told me with a wink. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson, the owner of the B&amp;B, is a Tanzanian, British-Indian, 70-year-old man. He was born and raised on Sand Island until he was 6 years old, and then moved to Sang Island with his parents. Dar es Salaam&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Tanzania&#39;s largest city)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;until the age of 20, then went to Edinburgh to attend university for four years. anthropology. After graduation, he changed three or four teaching jobs. &quot;I felt like I couldn&#39;t find a sense of belonging no matter how much I stayed in Europe,&quot; so he returned to East Africa. At first he wanted to take root on San Island again, but before he could settle down, he encountered the 1964 revolution. He had to take his Indian wife and three children and flee to Nairobi and Mombasa on the coast of Kenya, where he lived for more than ten years. Then we moved to the evergreen town of Mosh at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It was not until 2005 that he returned to Sang Island and has settled there ever since. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I found Wilson and sat with him among the coconut trees in the evening breeze, drinking ice-cold ginger ale. His eyes were as low as his voice, and like most people on Mulberry Island, it was difficult to tell where he came from just by looking at his appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Although I am not a real Sandao person, when I talked about the revolution with many Sandao people, I found that their memories of it and their The definition of it - whether it is good or bad, good or bad, depends largely on who they consider their best friend, who they often share a pot of coffee with, or who they often invite into their home. Relatives and friends for dinner, in general, are extremely personal. For example, if your best friend is an Indian or a Shiraz, your evaluation of the revolution may be completely different. , because the Indians may be robbed and killed, but Shiraz can escape unscathed...&quot; Wilson said slowly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“But in fact, the revolution had already begun to take shape before 1964,” Wilson continued, “because it had only been more than half a century since slavery was abolished. , the old skeleton of society was basically shattered, and a reasonable new skeleton had not yet taken shape. It was full of loopholes. In addition, the British implemented many policies and regulations on clear class divisions. The Arabs still occupied a large number of people in San Island at that time. Absolutely outstanding status. So when the British withdrew, the undercurrent of conflict between the majority of landless African laborers and the minority of Arab landowners immediately transformed into a revolution.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Wilson still remembers that in 1963, in Stone Town after independence, the iron gates of the police station were opened one after another, and all the imprisoned and beaten Africans poured into the streets and alleys, with eyes full of resentment and rage, as if they were gathering strength. , volcanic lava ready to erupt at any time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 3 a.m. on January 12, 1964, the &quot;African-Shirazi Party&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (ASP, Afro-Shirazi Party&quot; member and Ugandan John Okello led 600-800 &quot;revolutionaries&quot; with extremely simple equipment to launch a surprise attack on the police headquarters and radio station. They had no guns and ammunition, only spears, machetes, iron rods and daggers. However, because of their surprise and desperate determination, they won comprehensively in just a few hours. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this regard, the leader of the revolution, Oklo, always insisted that the actions of himself and other insurrectionists were &quot;pilgrimage acts&quot; in order to do justice for heaven and liberate the people who were persecuted.

At the seaside, I remembered that I and my friend Bosie once sat on the pier like this, &quot;watching the sea foaming with hands and feet and gnashing teeth.&quot; I remembered that on the same day, they paddled out to sea in a small boat and enjoyed that moment &quot;like &quot;Freedom without borders&quot;, watch how the Stone City gradually becomes smaller and smaller behind you, until &quot;it seems to have turned into a beautiful mirage&quot;. At that moment, they fantasized about escaping from the narrow and twisted streets of this small town and going to the distance to find opportunities as colorful as soap bubbles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Picture of a boy diving near Stone City Pier/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Suddenly, the wind direction and ocean current seemed to be disturbed, and the boat started to stumble. Dauda became wary, but Bossi told him with a smile that this was just a sign that the northeast monsoon &quot;musim&quot; was blowing from the coast of India and Arabia to East Africa, while rowing the boat steadily steadily. When the sea seemed to have calmed down, Bosie explained why he could not leave his mother and daughter and go to England with Dauda, ​​and then come back to take care of them after he had established a foothold:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style &quot;One day, these people who we have regarded and used as slaves for centuries will unite and cut the throats of those who enslaved them.

Who will care about us? They just They will tell us that this is Africa, their Africa, even though we have lived on this land for more years than they have.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bosi then handed the boat over to Dao As a challenge, he was asked to row the boat back to the shore and jump into the sea to swim back by himself. But the sea suddenly changed its face, and fierce hurricanes filled the entire ocean. &quot;I was struggling and beating the wooden paddle randomly,&quot; Daoda recalled, &quot;but when the storm finally calmed down, I looked around, but No more Bosie.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;132&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&quot;I can&#39;t find him...

How did I finally get back to the shore after I tried everything possible... But Bosie, you missed the worst part. The moment I landed, I was beaten with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Gurner set the two endpoints of the timeline in &quot;a certain November when the northeast monsoon is about to begin as usual and merchants are about to visit East Africa again, and the slave trade is about to begin. It will be between November, when the trade of Sang Island once again reached a climax, and January 12, when the revolution of Sang Island broke out in 1964. Drag the scale back and forth between these two points, discrete and aggregate, and start over and over again. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later, Wilson took me to a beach 40 kilometers away from the B&amp;B, where he and his family had sat and waited for hundreds of hours under the scorching sun. Beaches expecting British rescue signals and ships from Kenya. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 10 a.m., this unnamed beach not close to Stone City and unknown to tourists is empty and quiet, with no one and no wind, and only the bright sunshine shines warmly Staring at the milky white sand made me feel dizzy after just looking at it for a little while. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;About the beach, in &quot;Farewell Memories&quot;, Gurner wrote: In the past, those slaves who refused to be slaves would come to the beach next to Stone City. , and died there. Their corpses will float on the sea together with dead branches, leaves, debris and garbage, showing the fatigue after the struggle, just like their wrinkled black skin and the broken hearts under the skin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, I wonder if the beach where Daoda frantically searched for Bosi and was beaten crazily was similar to this one? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2005, Gurna published &quot;Escape&quot;. Like almost all his novels, it is also about &quot;wanting to escape from a foreign land that cannot be escaped, and wanting to return to a foreign land that cannot be escaped.&quot; The story of immigrants who cannot return to their hometown. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same year, after years of struggling with his inner alter ego, Wilson finally plucked up the courage to return to Mulberry Island alone. Not long after he settled down, he met his current wife, Khadija, a girl who was almost 30 years younger than him and born and raised in Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The afternoon after returning from the beach with Wilson, Khadija and I sat on a wicker chair by the sea, picking fresh wild spinach and preparing dinner together. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Hadija was born in the 1970s and grew up in a fisherman&#39;s home. She only had general concepts about the slave trade, colonization and revolution, and did not have many specific feelings. Wilson almost never mentioned to her those bitter memories that had been sealed for a long time and seemed to have happened yesterday. &quot;I fell in love with her simplicity, carefreeness, and no need to be entangled in the past... In short, I fell in love with her.&quot; , experiencing too much is not a good thing. Fortunately, the current generation of Sang Island has revived because of tourism. After many years, the sea is no longer just a symbol for most people. With the pain and shadow, it once again became their hope.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson&#39;s emotion is still in my mind yesterday, reminding me of a passage in Gurner&#39;s book Words: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;129&quot; data-source-title= &quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&quot;Going back to the beach feels like returning home. How can I put it? It&#39;s like I can realize that this place once belonged to me... No matter where you go here, you will be treated like one of your own family... I can still feel the generosity in her bones from this place.

I sent a message to my older cousin in the countryside early in the morning to ask how my relatives in my hometown were doing. My cousin said everything was fine. He has asked his family not to wander around outside unless they have nothing to do; and for his uncle who likes to hunt wild animals in the mountains, he has been strictly forbidden to go hunting in the mountains again. &quot;My uncle is quite honest,&quot; my cousin said. This makes me a little bit unbelievable. My uncle has always been fiery, but now he is willing to listen to his cousin. It seems that his dignity as the head of the family has already been established. My cousin is very busy. He leaves early and comes home late every day. He is the barefoot doctor in the village. He has to go to the monitoring point at the entrance of the village to measure the body temperature of outsiders every day. He has a heavy responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a special period, there are still outsiders coming, for no other reason than that my hometown is one of the best producing areas of Pu&#39;er tea in Yunnan, and March and April are the time to start picking spring tea. In previous years, before the spring tea was picked, many foreign merchants would come to the village early to reserve tea trees and tea farmers, so that the first crop of spring tea could be purchased, packaged, and transported as soon as it was roasted. Although there are not so many people coming this year, for some people, the temptation of spring tea is still greater than the virus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/GKBNpqDRxP4vc2LgiCeJsYZbFjwjbkfejw1kFD3f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/GKBNpqDRxP4vc2LgiCeJsYZbFjwjbkfejw1kFD3f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Spring in Pu&#39;er Tea Mountain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Information/Pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu&#39;erbanna area belongs to the middle and low mountains and hilly areas, with interspersed large and small mountain basins and The valley flats pushed out by the Lancang River and its tributary water systems in the area are the main human settlements. Because it is located inland, surrounded by mountains, and has a high quiet wind rate, the cold lake effect is prone to occur in winter. This is especially noticeable when driving on a winding mountain road. It will become hot and cold as the terrain changes, and you will also see the cold lake effect in the winter. There is thick fog at the bottom of the basin and white clouds lingering in the mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xishuangbanna-Menghai-Huimin line is one of the main producing areas of Pu&#39;er tea. Mangzhi, Manzhuan, Mansa and Youle produce Pu&#39;er tea with excellent quality, and Yiwu tea is produced in Mansa. Menghai Huimin belongs to the six new tea mountains outside the Yangtze River (on the west bank of the Lancang River) - Nannuo, Hekai, Mengsong, Jingmai, Brown and Bada.

The good Pu&#39;er tea is in Lancang, and the Jingmai-Mangjing-Manghong area in Huimin Township is one of the important producing areas of Lancang good tea. The largest ancient tea garden of 10,000 acres among the twelve major tea mountains is here here. The ancient tea garden was planted in 696 AD and has a history of more than 1,300 years. There are also many semi-wild ancient tea trees in the area. The age of the trees is unknown, but according to locals, the oldest tea tree is 1,600 years old. These ancient tea trees still produce a certain amount of output every year and are a cash cow for local villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;My hometown is in a village of the Blang ethnic group&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In the spring of about three years ago, I went back to my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown is in Manghong, a village inhabited by the Bulang people. According to the tea mountain classification, it belongs to Jingmai Mountain. The Bulang people living here are good at planting, picking and making tea. Since ancient times, Tea is not only their daily necessities, but also an important commodity in exchange for supplies. Bags of Pu&#39;er tea carried on horseback are transported from Jingmai Mountain to Pu&#39;er Prefecture, Myanmar, and Thailand. Ma Gudao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I rarely go back to my hometown. When I was a child, transportation was inconvenient—my hometown was hidden in the mountains, and the roads used to be difficult. To get from the village to the county seat, one had to walk over mountains and ridges for most of a day, catch a shuttle bus in the countryside, and then take a four- to five-hour ride. When I grew up, I had little time to go home because I studied and worked outside, let alone my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Spring Festival holiday that year, when they heard that I was coming back, my brother-in-law and cousin sent me a message asking me to go back and have a look. The Blang people celebrate the Water Splashing Festival in the Dai calendar year and don’t pay much attention to the Spring Festival, so I didn’t go back during the Spring Festival. Instead, I went back to my hometown with my brother and sister-in-law after Powu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I entered Mangjing from Huimin Township, I found that the road conditions were much better than a few years ago. This was all because of the Pu&#39;er tea. Anyone who sells tea knows that Pu&#39;er tea in this area is good. During the tea-picking season, merchants from all over the country come to collect tea. In order to facilitate the transportation of trucks, the government funded the construction of a road, which greatly improved the efficiency of logistics and transportation. The Blang people who grew tea became rich as a result, and the place became a well-known wealthy town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a checkpoint at the bridge that must be passed when entering Tea Mountain. Cars going out are basically ignored, but cars entering are checked very strictly. It is said to be to prevent someone from smuggling in Pu&#39;er tea of ​​average quality from other places and passing it off as local Pu&#39;er tea before selling it. Although they are in a remote area, people here have already had brand awareness and cherish their tea and brand very much, and do not allow anyone to ruin the reputation of their tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/VMXuGJSIQJZcZ6Q0kYQ3VdEXyn7U0RzVk326YbW7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/VMXuGJSIQJZcZ6Q0kYQ3VdEXyn7U0RzVk326YbW7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58414&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pu&#39;er scenery. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the road conditions are completely different from those in the past, it still took four hours to reach Mang. It was already past 11 noon when we arrived at Hong Laozhai. The uncle came out from the stilted building and waved us into the house. The old house is a traditional Blang wooden house with a history of several decades. Last time I came back, my grandpa and grandma were still alive. They have passed away for a few years now, but the old house still maintains the layout and layout of the past: there is still a fire pit in the kitchen. Although the village has long started to use electricity and biogas, The fire pit still dances with flames day and night. The old people use the fire in this fire pit to bake their favorite cup of roasted tea. On winter nights, they sit around the fire pit to warm themselves up, drink tea, smoke hookahs and chat. The firepit is the soul of the home and cannot be thrown away at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is almost noon, only my uncle is at home. My cousin goes to school and has lunch at school and doesn&#39;t come back until the afternoon; my aunt goes to the mountains to pick tea and doesn&#39;t come home until the afternoon. Although the ancient tree tea has not yet reached the best time to pick, the first batch of platform tea has already begun to be picked. From this time until the end of April, it is the busiest time for the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Platform tea refers to Pu&#39;er tea cultivated in recent decades. Although the taste is not as mellow as accumulated through a long history, it is still a fine quality tea. No artificial fertilizer is applied, and the tea is made by the soil itself. It is nourished by the fallen leaves of ground forest trees, sunlight, rain and dew, and is also called ecological tea. A Taiwanese friend of mine once told me that Taiwan has very strict requirements for tea imports, and only completely ecological tea is allowed to be imported. The tea from my hometown is very popular among Taiwanese businessmen. A considerable part of the tea is bought by Taiwanese businessmen every year, which shows the superior quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Use Red Bull to relieve tea drunkenness&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although the layout of the old house has not changed, I still found two more things. One is a huge tea table - made by my uncle himself. Judging by its size, the tree must be quite old. With the entry of tea merchants from other places, a different way of life has been brought to the village, such as drinking tea. In the past, when drinking tea, you would take a copper kettle sitting on the fire pond to boil water, grab a handful of tea in a small earthenware pot, and roast it by the pond fire. When the water boiled, the tea would also be roasted and fragrant. When you pour some water into the jar, you will have a jar of fragrant tea, with a strong and wild fragrance. This cup of tea is very fragrant, but it is also very bitter. After the bitterness, it becomes sweet again. The power of tea is also very overbearing. First-time drinkers will become drunk if they are not careful, causing shortness of breath and palpitation, which is very similar to the symptoms of hypoglycemia. The local method is to grab handfuls of uncooked rice and chew it, which is said to be very effective. Canned roasted tea is easy to get drunk when you first drink it, but it can become addictive if you drink it for a long time. In the past, people in the village rarely went outside the mountains. Traffic was one reason, and they also thought the tea outside was weak. If you have to go out, you must bring your own pre-roasted tea leaves. After drinking the tea, no matter how things go, you must go back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the old people also pay attention to the tea ceremony when drinking tea, including tea sea, tea wash, teapot, tea rules, aroma cup, host cup, tea tasting cup, etc., and there are many of them, paying attention to water temperature and water quality. , pay attention to making soup. One move after another, the ancient village is also absorbing new knowledge and changing with the changes of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another change in the old house is the addition of a disinfection cabinet one person high. The Blang people themselves are a nation that loves cleanliness. As for my old house, although it is old, it is kept very neat and clean. The open-air palm (the local name for the terrace of the stilted building) is spotless, which makes people feel simple and friendly. Nowadays, the villagers are paying more and more attention to hygiene when making raw Pu&#39;er tea. Not only the houses, but also the roads in the village are still very clean, although they are still dirt roads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After welcoming us into the old house, my uncle was not busy with anything else. He first invited us to drink tea - during the tea-picking season, almost everyone was busy in the tea mountains all day, and there was no concept of lunch at all. The tea is spring tea that has just been picked and roasted. Although it is not ancient tree tea, it is still top quality. The uncle poured boiling water into the teapot, closed the lid and let it simmer for five or six seconds, then poured the tea into the sea of ​​tea and distributed it to us. In order to see the color of tea, my uncle specially bought a small transparent glass cup. After pouring the tea, I saw that the tea soup is clear and fresh green in color. There is a fresh bitterness in the mouth. After two cups, the sweetness comes back, and the sweetness overflows in an instant. It fills the space between the lips and teeth, and expands in waves in the mouth, like a young girl who is shy and timid when she first met, but is enthusiastic and lively after getting to know her better - I think she must be a girl from the Brown ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that drinking Shenpu shaving oil is very powerful. I arrived home at noon, and the breakfast in my stomach was almost digested, and my uncle was giving me a cup of tea on the left and right. Soon I had symptoms of hypoglycemia, and I slumped on the sofa and shouted for food. The uncle then suddenly realized it and patted his head and said, &quot;You are drunk with tea!&quot; Then slowly arrange the cooking. He first cooked the rice in the rice cooker, then set up a large pot on the fire pit, poured water in, pulled off a piece of bacon, chopped it into several pieces and threw it into the pot. While waiting for the water to boil, he went out like a gust of wind. After a while, my uncle came back like a gust of wind, brought back a pile of Red Bull and put it in front of me and said, drink some first, and you will not be drunk after drinking tea. I opened a can and drank it, and I felt better - it seems that Zuicha no longer chews uncooked rice, but drinks Red Bull instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My uncle thrust Red Bull into my hand and ran out to get lunch. He grabbed a chicken from the chicken coop and killed it, then chopped it into pieces. When the water in the pot boiled, he poured them all into the pot, added seasoning salt, stirred a few times, covered the pot and continued to simmer. ; He also took out a large bowl of water pickled vegetables from the pickled vegetable jar, mixed some with soy sauce and chili for cold dressing, and chopped some into pieces and stir-fried with the turtle dove meat. At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, we finally had a belated lunch - free-range chicken cooked with bacon, mixed with pickled vegetables, and stir-fried turtle doves with pickled vegetables. The food cooked over a firewood was particularly fragrant. I ate it with gusto and kept enough to eat. Two bowls of rice. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Our ancient tree tea&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;After dinner, my eldest cousin happened to come back from get off work at the village clinic. He said hello to his uncle and said to me, Sister, do you want to see our tea garden? I said yes. The cousin and his uncle went downstairs to start the motorcycle. Manghong Village is built in the mountains. The roads in the village are not wide and the slopes are very undulating. It is not possible to ride bicycles. The daily means of transportation is motorcycles. Every household has at least one or two motorcycles. My cousin drove me along a thin yellow winding dirt road toward the mountains, followed by my brother-in-law and my brother. When we reached a slightly flat spot halfway up the mountain, my cousin stopped the motorcycle and led me to the roadside. He pointed to me not far down the mountain and said, &quot;Sister, look, that&#39;s our village!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is early spring at 4:30 in the afternoon. The sun has turned slightly yellow, the sky is clear and the light is soft. Under the blue sky, stilted buildings with sloping roofs on all sides are scattered in an orderly manner, among the smoky bamboo canopies and banana trees. Under the cover, it undulates intermittently and extends to the mountains on the opposite side, showing a quiet rural style. My cousin said that this is his favorite place. He usually stops to take a look when he passes by the tea farm. When nothing happens, he will also come here to stand for a while. &quot;This is the village where I grew up. Our ancestors were born and buried here. There is no better place than here,&quot; the cousin said. We looked at it for a while, then my cousin waved me into the car and continued driving up. After turning a few more turns, my cousin stopped the car again and said, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/ 02/04/H3lU50w9mcJSHm6oFrojMJPnRP6mf3ZfyfGJVc6B.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/H3lU50w9mcJSHm6oFrojMJPnRP6 mf3ZfyfGJVc6B. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mountain village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a hillside that looks like an undisturbed mountain forest, with thick and thin trees growing intricately. Trees, shrubs and some vines of varying heights. Between the tall trees and low shrubs, there are tea trees about 2 meters high. Among the dark green adult leaves, new green pointed leaves are piercing out like swords. They will be picked in a few days; Qiu The curved branches are covered with mottled layers of moss, as if they are the sedimented remains of time; the moss grows and withers season after season, and a thin layer of moss soil accumulates on the tea branches, becoming a place for parasitic plants to settle down. Here, as long as the Pu&#39;er tea trees grow to a certain age, there will be a parasitic plant called &quot;crab legs&quot;. The scientific name of crab legs is liquidambar mistletoe, which is very effective in treating rheumatic joint pain, lumbar muscle strain and acute cystitis. When tea leaves sprout, it is also the flowering and fruiting stage of crab legs. They grow in clusters among the tea branches, often causing the tea buds to fail to grow. Yunnan ancient tree Pu&#39;er tea is a large-leaf tree tea with tall plants. It is not easy to remove crab legs. Therefore, in the past, it was an annoying parasitic plant for tea farmers. Nowadays, crab legs are widely sought after, and the price is more expensive than ordinary Pu&#39;er tea, which can easily cost one thousand yuan per catty. Tea farmers often regard crab legs as a by-product of tea, which is another considerable income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My cousin proudly pointed to these tea trees and said: &quot;Sister, these are our treasures, ancient tea trees! Look at these tea trees with particularly strong branches. This one is more than 300 years old. , that one is 500 years old, and that one over there is the &quot;Tea Soul Tree&quot; of this tea field. The old people in the village said it is at least 800 years old. They said they were planted when the tea field first opened... These tea trees I They are all numbered, picked separately every year, and fried separately, which can be sold at a very good price.&quot; The so-called &quot;tea soul tree&quot; is the first tea tree planted in each tea field. How old is the tea garden? No matter how old it is, the tea garden has disappeared, but maybe the tree is still there... The tea soul tree is the soul of the tea garden. It transforms into a god and protects the tea garden. Therefore, a tea festival, called &quot;Tea Soul&quot;, is held every April. , not only does each family have to sacrifice their own tea soul tree, but the village also invites the Big Buddha and respected old people to preside over a grand ceremony to sacrifice the tea soul and call the tea god. In addition to these ancient tea trees, which are hailed as &quot;treasures&quot; by my cousin, the &quot;main force&quot; of this tea land is composed of tea trees that are about 200 years old. The scattered small tea trees are made from cuttings of the branches of ancient trees. They inherit It has the characteristics of the mother tea tree and has a consistent flavor. All it lacks is the experience of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sister, do you know the name of this mountain?&quot; I shook my head. &quot;This is Aileng Mountain, named after Pa Aileng!&quot; said my cousin proudly. Pa Aileng was an outstanding leader of the Blang tribe more than 1,800 years ago. Legend has it that in order to find an ideal place to live, he led the Blang tribe across mountains and rivers. After going through untold hardships, they finally found a place full of wild tea trees. , the soil here is fertile, the streams are gurgling, the vegetation is lush and lush, birds and animals roam here, and it is surrounded by mountains. It is an ideal place to build a village. So Pa Aileng led the tribe to settle here, and guided the tribe to domesticate tea trees and open tea gardens. This is the origin of Brown Village and tea gardens in Mangjing Manghong area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The water and soil in Lengshan are the best, and the tea in Lengshan is also the best tea!” My cousin said to me with an unquestionable and firm attitude. The Blang people believe that their leader Pa Aileng has found the best home and the most fertile land for them. They also believe in the principle of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Therefore, except for necessary care, the Blang people never use artificial fertilization when growing tea. Needless to say the use of chemicals. The tea trees in the mountains suck the mist and dew, extract nutrients from the soil and dead leaves of weeds, and convert them into tea substances little by little, forming the characteristics of Jingmai Mountain tea, which is bitter and astringent, sweet and refreshing, and orange-yellow in color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, my cousin suddenly turned around and faced me, and said seriously: &quot;Sister, I always think that my ancestors left me such a precious tea land, I must protect it, no matter what The quality of tea trees and tea leaves must not be destroyed in my hands.&quot; I understood what my cousin meant. His main job is as a rural doctor, but he spends almost all his spare time on tea. The Brown people are originally a very clean people. When my cousin came here, he also brought in the professional habits of doctors. When his family picks and roasts tea, he insists on &quot;three things not falling to the ground&quot;, that is, picking the tea does not fall to the ground, withering the tea does not fall to the ground, and frying the tea does not fall to the ground. As for the final pressing of the tea cakes, he does it himself without any help. &quot;I will definitely continue to make tea well, and Pa Aileng will bless us.&quot; The cousin cast his eyes to the sky in the distance. There, the sun that was about to set was covered by a cloud, and the light came out from behind the cloud, giving the clouds a bright golden edge, like some kind of hint and approval from nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt; a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx. best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[名字最有梗的小城，凭什么又翻红了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257896]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[墨西哥公布“外星人”遗骸，网友：长得太符合刻板印象]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257926]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 12, local time, the Mexican Congress held its first public hearing related to &quot;unknown anomalies.&quot; At the meeting, shortly after two scientists played several videos showing &quot;UFOs and unknown anomalies&quot;, they displayed the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot;, and related topics quickly became a &quot;hot search&quot;. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/30ce9c40e8e1e64679e83b2f04cf4218.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/30ce9c40e8e1e64679e83b2f04cf4218.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252807&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 13, 2023 local time, in Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, the remains of suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot; were displayed at a hearing.

Liu Yong believes that &quot;searching for extraterrestrial civilization&quot; has gone beyond a simple scientific issue and has become a philosophical issue. Exploring the mysteries of the universe and the origin of life may also be exploring people themselves and their meaning in the world and in the universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, human beings are constantly accelerating their exploration of the universe. From the two &quot;Voyager&quot; detectors launched in 1977 to the &quot;China Sky Eye&quot; built in Guizhou, various detection methods have become more complete. Taking the &quot;China Sky Eye&quot; as an example, its experimental goals include receiving signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, pulsars, rapid electrical storms and other signals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in Liu Yong’s view, humans are still a long way from finding extraterrestrial civilizations. “Perhaps it will only be possible on a time scale of thousands or ten thousand years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[音乐家李海鹰：月光流淌在珠江上]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257914]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021849850177&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;People Weekly Li Haiying&#39;s manuscript video.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/G8hfqzJQv3VepINkT0VCcndx1kDzyd2fW3QrQgrz .jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/e6988e555576678021849850177/HVmbvbHXk6EA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/e6988e555576678021849850177/HVmbvbHXk6EA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, in the Pearl River On Shazhou Ersha Island, Li Haiying is rehearsing the symphony &quot;China 1921&quot; composed by him.

Thirty years ago, he wrote &quot;Curved Moon&quot; and asked Liu Huan, who had a &quot;very floating voice&quot;, to sing it. He felt that the song had &quot;the feeling of being drenched by rain&quot;, even though the &quot;root-seeking craze&quot; was leading the culture at that time. world, &quot;Xintianyou&quot;, &quot;Nothing&quot;, etc. are blowing the northwest wind and sand throughout the mainland music scene. He also composed the music for &quot;Song of Seven Sons&quot;. In the song about Macau, he used the melody to simulate the crashing of the waves on the rocky shore. This song followed China&#39;s first lunar exploration satellite &quot;Chang&#39;e 1&quot; to space. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although I live in Beijing, many of my creative commissions are from Guangzhou.&quot; 69-year-old Li Haiying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/eomOXOcVnf0VzkC2W51Rkyk8QpJWDriwbjOltSud.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/eomOXOcVnf0VzkC2W51Rkyk8QpJWDriwbjOltSud.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252762&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Haiying&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Li Lewei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1970, 16-year-old Li Haiying Entered the Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Troupe and became a violinist and composer. Five years later, he became a violinist and creator of the Art Troupe of the Political Department of the Chinese Navy&#39;s South China Sea Fleet. From the end of 1982 to March 1997, he worked as a composer in the Guangdong Music and Art Troupe and wrote works such as &quot;The Crooked Moon&quot;, &quot;Song of the Seven Sons&quot; and &quot;I Don&#39;t Want to Say&quot;. He is good at integrating folk song elements into the melodies of popular music, so his works have a vivid sense of place, such as &quot;The Crooked Moon&quot; with Cantonese tune, &quot;Crossing the River&quot; with Northeastern duo style, and &quot;Crossing the River&quot; with Shandong music characteristics. Traveling everywhere”. He has also written a lot of pop music, such as Eason Chan&#39;s &quot;Where to Start&quot; and Sun Li&#39;s &quot;Love is Like Air&quot;, and has also scored for film and television works such as &quot;Bright Sword&quot; and &quot;The Devil Is Coming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The symphony has always been his dream. At the age of 49, Li Haiying began to study conducting under conductor and music educator Professor Xu Xin. At the age of 54, he re-learned composition lessons in the classroom of the Central Conservatory of Music. In his fifties, he re-learned and practiced conducting and composing music, and he sat in the classroom with undergraduate students. &quot;Actually, they are all very basic courses, just undergraduate courses.&quot; He is happy to learn and to be a newcomer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Li Haiying became a newcomer to the symphony orchestra. He wrote and conducted the large-scale symphony work &quot;Our Sun Yat-sen&quot;, plus later &quot;Ode to the Sixth Ancestor&quot;, &quot;Symphony No. 1 (Pearl River)&quot; and &quot; China 1921&quot;, he composed a total of four symphonic works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;恢弘的历史题材，在李海鹰的音乐里呈现得很具体，他用不同的音乐风格去对应不同的城市，用京剧去描摹北京，用龙船调刻画武昌，长沙则用花鼓戏……他的音乐始终保持着在地性，这或许来自他对民歌的熟悉、在创作中对相关内容的调研。在儿童音乐剧《猫神在故宫》中，李海鹰为了充分把握北京的气息做了大量调研，希望用音乐去描画一个城市的历史与现代的鲜活气息。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/yGLXcpFrWdn0r6AKhKQ47kltM4JIkXqYfqNHV6Va.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年5月，李海鹰与广州交响乐团演奏《中国1921》&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（李乐为/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是李海鹰的口述：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;交响乐与流行：鲜活的地方感&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在这场演出之前，我其实有过一两天焦虑。 《中国1921》是2021年首演，光是今年都已经演到第七次了，是不是我还能做些什么，我能不能让乐团这次表演再好一点？如果我要做一个没有新意的操作，那我干脆不做，所以这次排练时我还在改曲子、删小节，当然这些是我在家里想好的，不是现场灵机一动。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;排练的时候，我有两个角色，一个是作曲家，另一个是指挥家，等于演奏者。跟乐团一起演奏时，我会从另外一个角度来考虑音乐、重新演绎作品。而且做交响乐还得有一个能力，记忆力要强，就跟下盲棋一样，整个棋盘要全记得住，这也是做音乐不断锻炼出的一种能力。曲子基本上要背下来，而且还要想怎么演奏，是活泼一点，还是柔软一点？我做指挥的时候，我就修改一些表达的方式，而且还得听演奏，一边演一边改，还调整了不少。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2019年广州交响乐团委约我这个作品的时候，原本没想到我写这么大篇幅的作品，当时余隆总监和我说，首先要写出动听的旋律，其次是内容集中在1921年。我根据这个思路搜集资料，发现从1920年8月到1921年春,上海、北京、武汉、长沙、广州、济南6个城市成立了中国共产党的早期组织。与此同时,在旅日、旅法的华人中,也成立了由留学生中的先进分子组成的中国共产党早期组织。所以，我最早的设计是9个乐章，用9种音乐风格，描述十月革命，以及1920年至1921年间中国共产党成立前夕发生在中国北京、武汉、长沙、济南、广州、上海和日本、法国的历史片段。根据音乐的结构缩成了5个，但依旧是9个段落构成。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;第一乐章是热烈的快板，描述十月革命的爆发，名为《石破天惊》。第二乐章开始是安静的行板，包括两个乐段：《北平飞絮》和《武昌秋水》。第三乐章是圆舞曲，《东瀛密巷》和《巴黎晨光》。第四乐章是中国舞曲，主要讲长沙、济南和广州。最后的乐章就来到了“一大”的召开。到了北京我就使用京剧，武汉我就改编龙船调，长沙用花鼓戏，济南部分我就创作了一个山东的调子，广州的部分也能听出很多广东音乐的元素。到了最后，我用了交响乐经常用的方法——赋格，把不同的主题全部叠在一起，这象征着滚滚洪流汇在一起，形成一种巨大的力量，冲向结束。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这是我的第四部大型音乐作品，目前我和中国儿童艺术剧院合作一部音乐剧叫《猫神在故宫》，故宫过去的主人已经不在了，现在故宫里的猫咪“多尔衮（猫的名字）”在网上很受欢迎。我对这个题材充满期待，也在全力创作中。故宫是中华文化的一个聚集地，我们想要推广中华文化，所以就创造一个故宫的“猫神”出来。我希望写得新潮一点，有很多现代元素，但又内含北京的文化，比如有北京童谣、北京琴书、评剧等等。我觉得这个很重要。什么样的作品能够得到公众的认可？首先，它必须得有根，同时要学习全球的优秀文化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;创作还是需要不断学习，我觉得自己现在正在冲刺期里，但也有惰性。我跟那些学生讲，人人都沿着惰性往下走，你知道这是人性弱点，不如尝试一下反过来走走。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;只有不断地创作，才能让社会接受我。起码对我音乐上的合作者来说，所有人的期望都是我在不断进步，如果哪天发现李海鹰已经停了，合作基本上也就到头了。只有不停地让别人惊讶，我才可以继续做我想做的音乐。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;其实我从小的理想就是想做交响乐。上世纪80 年代，我到流行音乐行业里去了。滚了几圈出来，又做了影视配乐，《亮剑》《外来妹》《幸福像花儿一样》等等，《鬼子来了》也参加了。最后觉得还是要回到我的童年梦想，去实现它。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;小时候，有次我家里放了圣桑的《引子与回旋随想曲》，那是我第一次被交响乐打动。我爸爸以前是广州黄埔造船厂的副厂长，厂里很多工程师都是留学苏联的，很多人都喜欢音乐。所以我家在1950年代就有电唱机，它播《蓝色的多瑙河》，也播很多广东音乐和粤剧。我的音乐启蒙就是这部唱机和另一台波罗的海收音机。大概14 岁时，我逼着我妈给我买了一把秦琴，琴一拿回家，我就立刻把我听过的所有广东音乐都弹了一遍。后来收音机在播红色娘子军的音乐，我就拿着小提琴跟着拉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;16岁的时候，广州粤剧团来我们学校招生，我被选进去了，因为我是学校里唯一会五线谱和会拉一点小提琴的学生，后来我又进到广州星海音乐学院作曲进修班学了一年半。到1980年代，有一些唱片公司来找我做配曲，相当于约稿，我也从那时开始成了自由音乐人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我第一次写歌词是《弯弯的月亮》，先有了几个音符，接着曲子和词交叠着写，半小时很快写完了。当时乐坛流行的是高亢、硬气的“西北风”，《弯弯的月亮》是典型的广东调，我说它是“整个被雨水淋出来的感觉”。好些年后我才意识到这首歌记下了珠江上以船为生的疍家人的生活，不仅仅是词本身的描述，就连曲的节奏也是疍家人摇橹的节奏。这个灵感来源于我小时候就住在珠江边，坐疍家人划的船过江，疍家人还背着一个襁褓划船，船只能坐四个人。我坐在船上听见他们在喊阿娇，阿娇是最常见的疍家人女孩的名字。只是现在在珠江上已经见不到疍家人了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;写这首歌时，没有音乐公司的委约，我也没有很确定想哪个歌手来唱。我第一个找到的是陈汝佳，陈汝佳来录之后，我一听就觉得不合适，于是就给刘欢打电话，问他在不在北京，让他明天录歌。刘欢也没听歌，电话里就答应了。我第二天就去北京，他下午就来录了。那时还没形成明星制的商业市场，所以和歌手之间的互动就是这么简单。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1980-90年代的广东，某种程度上说也是黄金年代，因为样样都是新的，而且日新月异。也许所有人都在怀旧，觉得过去的年代才是黄金年代。实际上那时整个经济基础并没有很高水平，但是浪潮中的人所展现的冲力和激情还是挺难得的。这个浪潮起了很大的推动作用，当时的广州不仅仅在音乐，包括媒体，比如电视台、电台、报业、广告，还包括影视剧，都走在前面。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;因为姜文的电影《鬼子来了》，我从广州去北京做配乐，电影当时已经拍完开始剪辑，配乐有我和崔健、刘星三个人。那次到北京后我就没走了，开始把比较多的精力投入到影视配乐。从《背叛》《黑冰》到《亮剑》，有人说，怎么你把所有剧的配乐都给写了，我没有，只是正好那几部剧火了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;写完《七子之歌》之后，也有几年，我一直写来写去都写不好。有朋友跟我说李海鹰你已经好久没出过歌了，他这句话让我意识到这是个问题了，几年没有传唱度很高的歌，人家就觉得你的歌出不来了。一直到《爱如空气》这首歌，我光旋律就写了一个半月，后面效果不错，成了电视剧《幸福像花儿一样》的主题曲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我还是一直想做交响乐，因为一些工作的契机，2003年我开始跟指挥家徐新老师学指挥。等到2007年，我又重新系统学习作曲。 2008年我和一群本科学生到中央音乐学院上课。有次中央音乐学院的作曲系主任叫住我说，李海鹰你跑到这里干嘛？我说上课。他说，你跟谁上课？你别学坏了，学坏了就完了。我还是老老实实上课。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;从粤剧，广东音乐，流行乐，到影视配乐，再到交响乐，我对音乐永远有新鲜感，永远当新人。时代大浪淘沙，我往往是没等这个浪潮退去我就去干别的了。比如说我做影视配乐，后来去做古典音乐，没有等到浪潮结束把我搞得走投无路，我早走了。我做古典乐算新人，到2016年才开始写大型作品。就保持这样的学习和谦逊、投入的状态，包括现在写音乐剧、歌剧，我也希望有创新。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;音乐是直接为人写的，是一种对话。还有一点，我并不主张自己的想法。我就写你的想法、你的感受。大家觉得艺术家总强调自己，但为什么要把“我”和“你”分开？我认为我不重要，我早就知道自己是有限的。这种观念也许会让我在表面上显得很没个性，但越往后我越觉得，我的音乐不是写我的，我的音乐想表达的是这个时代，表达的是你们和他们。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

At the top of the mountain, there is a flat area. On the flat side, I saw that long-known plant. It is not eye-catching, slightly similar to the common broom grass in Sichuan, but shorter; it is also a bit like orchid grass, but with thinner leaves.未到花期，没有图片上灿若云霞的紫红。 If you look closely, it does look like a toothbrush. No wonder it is called toothbrush grass among the people. In fact, its scientific name is Haizhou Xiangnuo, and its other name is more widely known: Copper Grass Flower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine how excited the ancestors who were looking for it were when they saw the coppergrass flowers all over the mountains and plains on this gentle hillside three thousand years ago. They were even ecstatic with excitement. Because the copper grass flower is a symbol of an important metal - wherever it grows, deep in the earth, there must be copper mines...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/5ofLItqyHH0Tl7WRalCsMJW6VkUfNdzcaSj4GY5C.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/10/28/5ofLItqyHH0Tl7WRalCsMJW6VkUfNdzcaSj4GY5C.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213168&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonglushan ancient copper mine site is located in Three kilometers west of Daye City, Hubei Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Gifts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The banquet was over, and King Chu Cheng gave it to those who came to see him Zheng Wengong gave a generous gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This generous gift is estimated to be worth about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan based on today&#39;s market price. However, in the distant Spring and Autumn Period, its value could not be measured in terms of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is copper. When Zheng Wengong returned to Zheng State with a thousand kilograms of copper, King Chu Cheng regretted it more and more. He sent an envoy to catch up with Zheng Wengong - he must have wanted to take back the copper, but doing so would not only offend Zheng State, but also make people in the world joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Chu Cheng’s regret had very clear practical considerations. In the pre-Qin period, the ancients classified the major affairs of the country into two things, namely &quot;the major affairs of the country are sacrifice and military affairs&quot; as stated in &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. Although the original meaning of &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; refers to sacrificial rituals and military rituals, later generations further extended it and believed that the most important things in the country were sacrifices and wars. Both sacrifices and wars are inseparable from copper - sacrifices require a large number of bronze vessels to be cast; as for wars, copper is a necessity for making weapons. Compared with the stone, bone and wooden weapons of the Stone Age, copper weapons are invincible and have unparalleled superiority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bronze originated in the Longshan Culture period. The Xia Dynasty began to enter the Bronze Age, while the Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty reached the peak of bronze civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called bronze is an alloy of copper and tin or lead. It was called gold and lucky gold in ancient China. Among the chemical elements that make up bronze, the most important is copper, which accounts for more than 80%. Without copper, there would be no bronze; without bronze, there would be no bronze civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For King Chu Cheng, his regret was not about the thousand catties of copper. Copper, he had plenty of it. He was worried that Zheng Guo would take the copper back to make weapons. Therefore, he asked Zheng Wengong to promise that the copper donated by the Chu State could only be used for ritual vessels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the origins of Chu State, it was once so humble that it could be ignored. In terms of level, among male princes, Bozi belongs to the fourth level: Zi. Regarding the initial land enfeoffment, it was only fifty miles away. There is a story that illustrates the weakness of the Chu people when they founded the country: After Xiong Yi was named the son of Chu, he built a temple. After the temple was completed and the first sacrifice was about to be held, it was discovered that they were so poor that they didn&#39;t even have a sacrificial cow. This &quot;country&quot; is so big, but it can&#39;t even produce a single cow, which shows how small and shabby this &quot;country&quot; is. Out of poverty, Xiong Yi took people to the neighboring country of Bo to steal a calf. After the calf was stolen back, Xiong Yi was afraid that the owner would come to visit him, so he had to kill the calf overnight to sacrifice it - and the rules at that time were that sacrifices were held during the day. Since then, the Chu people have formed a unique custom: all sacrifices are held at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like a trickle of water can gather into a mighty river, as long as enough time is given, a miracle may be born. For the Chu State, if it was like an unobtrusive flame in the wind when it was founded, then, after hundreds of years of continuous development, by the time of Xiong Tong, the son of Chu in the early Spring and Autumn Period, the Chu State had risen. Become an important presence among the princes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 704 BC, which was the thirty-seventh year of Xiong Tong&#39;s reign, he sent his followers to ask the Emperor of Zhou to promote him to a noble title. However, Emperor Zhou flatly refused. Xiong Tong was furious and proclaimed himself king, calling him King Wu of Chu. Although the Emperor of Zhou has lost his former authority since King Ping of Zhou moved eastward, the princes who dared to brag against the disapproval of the world and claim the title of king began with Xiong Tong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiong Tong dared to fight against the Emperor Zhou. On the one hand, due to the hard work of more than ten generations, the Chu State was no longer the small country with a lot of obstacles; on the other hand, after many years of hard work, the Chu people gradually controlled One of the most important strategic materials has the material basis to challenge Emperor Zhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is copper, copper from the Coppergreen Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/HnrOGxJiZOSdrgXR10zG7Zpr8MN4jXcLRwGTIToa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/HnrOGxJiZOSdrgXR10zG7Zpr8MN4jXcLRwGTIToa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Azurite mine in Tonglu Mountain&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the northeast To the southwest, after crossing the Yangtze River via the Qijia Expressway, it enters Huangshi City, Hubei Province. To the north of the highway, there is a lake of tens of square kilometers, which is Daye Lake connected to the Yangtze River. The westernmost end of Daye Lake is Daye under the jurisdiction of Huangshi. Heading west out of Daye, the road twists and turns, passing through undulating low mountainous areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tonglu Mountain is hidden deep in this low mountainous area. The &quot;Daye County Chronicle&quot; published by Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty explained the origin of the name Tonglu Mountain: &quot;The top of the mountain is high and flat, with huge rocks facing each other. Every time it rains, there are bronze greens like snowflakes and adzuki beans dotted on the earth and rocks. Hence the name. It stretches for several years. Zhang, the soil color is purple and red, and they are all Guanshan. It may be the place where copper was produced in ancient times.&quot; This green snowflake adzuki bean is actually malachite, which is a copper-containing carbonate mineral that is often associated with copper. The large amount of malachite washed out of the surface after a shower shows that the copper mine in Tonglushan is shallowly buried and of high grade, making it a rare rich mine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as China is concerned, copper resources are widely distributed and relatively concentrated. In general, the main copper mines are in the south. There is a rich copper ore belt in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River - from Tonglu Mountain to Ruichang, more than 100 kilometers away, and to Tongling, more than 300 kilometers away, there are dots of large copper mines, with reserves accounting for one-third of the country. Two or more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of Chu State was also invincible due to the blessing of Tonglu Mountain. As the first metal mastered by human beings, a steady stream of high-grade copper ore is put into burning furnaces to smelt out massive amounts of copper, which is then combined with tin or lead to be upgraded to bronze - ritual vessels cast in bronze, lingering in the smoke. The temples made of bronze became a bridge between the Chu people and their ancestors and gods; the agricultural tools made of bronze allowed the vast land in the south to be reclaimed, and more food was enough to feed a larger population; the weapons made of bronze accompanied the Chu people who were brave and good at fighting. Charge into battle, expand territory...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conquest&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from Tonglu Mountain, a three-hour drive, nearly 300 kilometers away to the northwest is Suizhou City, Hubei Province. In Suizhou, the sensational tomb of Zeng Houyi was discovered. The most important cultural relic unearthed from the tomb of Zeng Houyi is now stored in the Hubei Provincial Museum, which is the bronze chime that can still play beautiful music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Hou is the king of Zeng State; and Zeng State is another name for Sui State, which was enfeoffed by Zhou Dynasty. Thousands of cultural relics were unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, among which the total weight of bronze products exceeds ten tons - the bronze chime alone weighs four tons. So much copper, where does it come from? In the past few years, professionals used chemical and spectral analysis on Zeng Houyi&#39;s chime bell, and compared it with the copper mine data unearthed from the Tonglushan archeology, and concluded that the copper material of Zenghou Yi&#39;s chime bell came from Tonglushan. ——Using the same method, it was also proved that the raw materials of the bronzes unearthed from Fuhao&#39;s tomb in Yinxu, Anyang, also came from Tonglu Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/BUDkuuqJntNhn6I4gZ4OhMcUTYdeKFDanhoC1Wnb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/BUDkuuqJntNhn6I4gZ4OhMcUTYdeKFDanhoC1Wnb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zeng Houyi Bronze Chime Bell&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These conclusions are actually Within reason. Not only did the large amount of copper material in the tomb of Zeng Hou Yi come from the Tonglu Mountain, but even when the Emperor of Zhou was enfeoffed to follow the country, a very important reason was for copper. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, there was a busy and important copper-tin road in the hinterland of China. That is what the bronze inscriptions call &quot;the path of gold and tin&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the National Museum of China, there is a bronze vessel named Zeng Boyun. The 簠 is a utensil used to serve rice during sacrifices or banquets. It is also called the 簋, the square one is called 簠 and the round one is called 簋. Zeng Boyun was used by the king of Zeng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sui&lt;/span>;). The inscription on it contains the following sentences: &quot;...Kedi Huaiyi, suppress the Xiefan Tang, move the golden road and tin, and use all the tools to prepare the way.&quot; It means: (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeng Bo&lt;/span>;) punish the Huaiyi , the transportation hub Fantang and the copper and tin channels have been stabilized and have returned to normal. This is the origin of Jindaoxixing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shang Dynasty moved its capital many times, but generally speaking, they were all in today&#39;s Central Plains region; the Western Zhou Dynasty made its capital Haojing, now Xi&#39;an; the Eastern Zhou Dynasty moved its capital to Luoyi, now Luoyang. During the heyday of the Bronze Age, the demand for copper and supporting tin for thousands of years during the Shang and Zhou dynasties was undoubtedly astronomical. In the vast north or the Yellow River Basin, only Zhongtiao Mountain and other places had copper mines, but the output was small. . The copper and tin needed by the Shang and Zhou Dynasties could only be transported thousands of miles from the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general route of the Jindao Tin Line, which mainly transports copper and tin, is as follows: Hunan&#39;s tin and Tonglu Mountains and northern Jiangxi&#39;s copper, after being collected in the present-day Wuhan area, arrive in Suizhou via Xiaogan, along the Suizao Corridor. It entered the Nanyang Basin, then passed through present-day Fangcheng and Ye County to Luoyang, or continued westward to Guanzhong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an extremely difficult transportation line. Two or three thousand years ago, when roads and railways were scarce and there were only rugged trails, the ancients could only rely on animals and manpower in addition to ships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long transportation lines mean more risks and more uncertainties. Especially when the transported items are copper that determines the fate of the country, the risks increase sharply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ensure the smooth transportation of copper and tin from Tonglu Mountain and other places to the capital, Emperor Zhou enfeoffed more than a dozen small countries in important areas north of the Han River and south of the upper reaches of the Huai River. Most of these small countries have the surname Ji, or are related to the surname Ji, so they are called the Ji of Hanyang. The concubines of Hanyang had two tasks. One was to guard against Huaiyi in the south; the other was to ensure the smooth flow of the copper and tin road. After the decline of Huaiyi and the rise of Chu, the first task of Zhu Ji changed from guarding against Huaiyi to guarding against Chu. However, things are unpredictable. Not only did the concubines of Hanyang fail to curb Chu&#39;s northward and eastward advance, but even the copper-tin road they guaranteed and even the Tonglu Mountain that produced copper mines fell into the hands of the Chu people. In the end, &quot;Hanyang&quot; All concubines, the state of Chu is complete.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The countries established by the concubines of Hanyang are dotted in the intersection of north and south China, including Tang, Cai, Ying, Xi, Shen, Sui, etc. Among the concubines, Sui Guo is the most powerful and is the leader of them all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanyang Basin and Jianghan Plain are separated by a series of low and gentle mountains. Among them, there is a long and narrow plain between Dahong Mountain and Tongbai Mountain, both running northwest to southeast, which becomes the link between Nanyang Basin and Jianghan Plain. traffic channels between. This tunnel is bounded by Suizhou in the south and Zaoyang in the north, so it is called the Suizao Corridor. As the eldest among the concubines in Hanyang, Sui Guo follows the gateway of the Zao Corridor and connects to the Yangtze River through the Jianshui River. Copper from Tonglu Mountain and more distant places such as Ruichang and Tongling can be traced up the river, passing through the Sui Zao Corridor and then north. Transport to the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/27/0db5OdAetgUKAOX0yDkVnWKje30RWBDgAHTMIkrd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1331&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/27/0db5OdAetgUKAOX0yDkVnWKje30RWBDgAHTMIkrd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The war between the Chu State and the Chu State for the Tonglu Mountain was The era of King Wu kicked off; the main target of the war was Sui Guo - before this, King Wu of Chu annexed Quan State and established counties on Quan State&#39;s territory, which was the beginning of China&#39;s county system. At this time, the power of the Chu State penetrated deep into the Jianghan Plain, and the fertile Jianghan Plain was being eroded bit by bit by the Chu people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the set goal, King Chu Wu showed great patience - he has been waiting, looking for opportunities while waiting - King Chu Wu waited from his middle age until his twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 706 BC, Sui suffered from a drought, resulting in a massive reduction in grain production and a lack of food for the soldiers and civilians. King Wu of Chu took the opportunity to attack Sui. The Chu army came to the city, and the princes knew that they were no match, so they had to send people to King Wu of Chu to ask for peace. King Wu of Chu accepted the peace talks, and one of the conditions was that he would ask the Emperor of Zhou to be promoted to the title of Chu Kingdom. The first expedition against Sui and the establishment of an alliance under the city with the country meant that the Chu people had already gotten involved in the road of copper and tin, and from then on they could obtain a steady stream of high-quality copper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, Sui, who had an alliance with Chu, refused to attend the alliance led by Chu. King Chu Wu used this as an excuse to attack Sui for the second time. This time, the Chu army was defeated and the Sui army fled. Even the chariot was captured by the Chu army. Also in this year, Suihou informed King Wu of Chu that the Emperor of Zhou refused to promote him to the title. Therefore, King Wu of Chu became angry and proclaimed himself king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the next three years, Chu defeated a series of countries including Yun, Jiu, Zhou, Deng and Liao. These countries either became vassals of Chu or had to fight with Chu. Make an alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 699 BC, when attacking Luo State, Chu State general Qu Xia was conceited and underestimated the enemy. He was defeated by the coalition forces of Luo State and Lu State. Qu Xia committed suicide. ——Since then, the Chu State has formed an unwritten rule: any commander who leads troops to fight must commit suicide to apologize once he is defeated. This determination, soaked in the bones and blood of Chu people, was passed down to the last commander-in-chief, Xiang Yu, the overlord of Western Chu who would rather commit suicide than return to Jiangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;King Wu of Chu had to slow down the pace of his campaign. For the next eight years, King Wu of Chu did not raise any more troops to attack his followers. He concentrated his efforts and swept away Luo, Lu, Yan, Zhou and Liao, and firmly controlled the Jianghan Plain. It should be during this period that the Tonglu Mountain also belonged to the Chu State. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When everything came to pass, King Wu of Chu attacked him for the third time. Because Suiguo is not only an important stronghold on the copper-tin road, but also a springboard for Chu to fight for hegemony northward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the eve of the expedition, he felt heart discomfort during the sacrifice and knew that his days were numbered. Sure enough, when the Chu army crossed the Han River and King Wu of Chu was sitting under a sycamore tree by the roadside to rest, he could never stand up again - this king who advocated force and was determined to expand his territory died like this. On the journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of King Chu Wu, the Chu army continued to advance towards the capital of Sui without announcing the funeral. When Suihou saw the army approaching the border, he was frightened and sent people to sue for peace. From then on, Suiguo, who was originally loyal to the Emperor of Zhou and monitored the south for the Emperor of Zhou and guarded the copper and tin road, became a vassal of Chu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of King Chu Wu, King Chu Wen came to the throne. The first thing King Wen of Chu did when he came to power was to move the capital from the remote Danyang to Ying. The Chu State had moved its capital many times. After the first move to Ying, the subsequent capitals were all called Ying or Yingdu. The place where King Wen of Chu moved to Ying is said to be Jingzhou or Yicheng. No matter who is right, the indisputable fact is that the power of Chu State has crossed the Han River from west to east. During the reign of King Chu Wen, he successively destroyed the State of Shen, Xi and Deng, repeatedly defeated the State of Cai, and made a northern expedition to the State of Zheng - this was also the beginning of the Chu State&#39;s quest to dominate the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After King Chu Wen, King Chu Cheng went to a higher level and successively annexed more than ten small countries such as Er, Gu, Huang, Ying, Jiang, and Fang. The State of Zheng, which borders the State of Chu, was on the fence between Jin and Chu. This is how Zheng Wengong went to see King Chu Cheng, and King Chu Cheng gave him a thousand catties of copper. However, King Chu Cheng was born at the wrong time - he met Duke Huan of Qi, the most powerful of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. In order to teach the Chu State a lesson, Qi Huangong led the coalition forces deep into the Chu territory. Although the two sides did not decide the winner, the Chu State had to admit its mistake to the coalition forces and recognize Qi State&#39;s dominance. By the time of King Chuzhuang, the grandson of King Chu Cheng, this soaring and blockbuster King of Chu defeated the northern superpower Jin, thus becoming one of the five hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The history of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period is a history of princes fighting against each other. In the merger of big fish eating small fish and small fish eating shrimps, small countries continued to disappear and big countries grew bigger like a snowball. Among the princes, the Chu State destroyed the most, with more than fifty people. At its peak, Chu State ranked first in territory, equivalent to the sum of other princes. It can be said that if it were not for the incompetence of several generations of Chu kings in the late Warring States Period, it would have been more likely to be the Chu State that wiped out the heroes, rather than the Qin State located in the northwest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the Chu people’s illustrious military exploits, Tonglu Mountain was the silent and lasting first driving force, creating the miracles of the Bronze Age. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ruins&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Tonglushan Ancient Copper Mine Ruins Museum is located on the hill where coppergrass flowers sway. There are few tourists, and the copper grass flowers are looking at themselves in the wind. On the other side of the hill, I saw a huge pit like a funnel embedded between the peaks. The pit sank hundreds of meters below the surface and was hundreds of meters in diameter. A road winding like a snake passed by a factory with thick smoke. Reaching into the pit, trucks crawled like beetles. This is the open-pit copper mine that is still being mined today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/9uJBUw2mJkQOkjCfGS5hm1oryhTPWo0UgpL6g2iZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1441&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/9uJBUw2mJkQOkjCfGS5hm1oryhTPWo0UgpL6g2iZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;213166&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tonglushan Open-pit Copper Mine&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1973, the It was while working in this open-pit mine that the miners of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Company dug out thirteen rusty copper axes from the ground. Later, using thirteen copper axes that had been dormant for thousands of years as clues, archaeologists followed the clues and unearthed seven open-pit mines, 18 underground mining areas, more than 50 ancient smelting sites and More than ten smelting shaft furnaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reappearance of ancient copper mines under the earth not only reveals the secret of the rise of Chu State, but also proves that Chinese bronze culture is not foreign, but originated from the mainland. Archaeological evidence shows that the mining of Tonglushan copper mines began in the late Shang Dynasty, and continued through the Western Zhou Dynasty, the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period to the Han Dynasty, which lasted for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the museum, large and small copper slags are displayed in glass cabinets - things that look either slightly yellow or slightly green. Archaeologists estimate that there are as many as 400,000 tons of copper slag in the entire Tonglushan site. Based on rough calculations based on copper slag, Tonglushan produces about 120,000 tons of copper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The figure of 120,000 tons is a bit empty. If you convert it, you will know how huge it is: the Shang Dynasty Stepmother Wu Ding unearthed in Anyang (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Simuwu Dafang Ding&lt;/span>;) is the heaviest bronze in China so far, weighing more than 800 kilograms. 120,000 tons can be used to cast 140,000 statues. Some people have made another calculation: the main equipment of soldiers in the Spring and Autumn Period was copper ge, each weighing about half a kilogram and 120,000 tons, enough to make 240 million pieces. Of course, not all of the 120,000 tons of copper from Tonglu Mountain is exclusively owned by the Chu State. However, in the mining history of more than a thousand years from the late Shang Dynasty to the Western Han Dynasty, Chu State accounted for about half of the mining time. This was the golden age of Tonglu Mountain. The Chu people obtained at least tens of thousands of tons of high-quality copper from the depths of Tonglu Mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When King Zhuang of Chu aspired to conquer the Central Plains, he proudly said to Wang Sunman, a minister of Emperor Zhou, &quot;The beak of Chu&#39;s broken hook is enough to make nine tripods.&quot; This means that as long as the sharp edges of Chu&#39;s weapons are taken off, it will be enough to be melted into Jiuding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The massive amount of copper in Tonglu Mountain proves that King Chuzhuang was not exaggerating at all. His Chu country, whether it is the civil governance of the alliance princes or the martial arts of conquering cities and territories; whether it is the stubborn and domineering character of the Chu people or the Chu music of Hong Zhongda Lu; whether it is the gloomy Chu Feng that respects ghosts or the soul-stirring Chu Ci—— They are all based on copper, with copper as their bones, and with copper as their foundation...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10 /28/TngRunAON2E2ufuol8qlegxPuW9w8r9SziHNBJWV.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/28/TngRunAON2E2ufuol8qlegxPuW9w8r9SziHNBJWV. jpeg &quot; data-key=&quot;213164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Viewers look at the early Spring and Autumn shaft furnace model unearthed from Tonglu Mountain in the National Museum of China. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC Photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tonglu Mountain, those long-standing mines go deep underground and extend in all directions like a maze. Some of the wood that was laid down two to three thousand years ago to support the tunnels has not yet rotted. Walking cautiously in the restored mine, the tunnel is narrow and damp. I can&#39;t help but think of the Chu miners who worked all day long with a torch in the belly of the earth in Tonglu Mountain more than two thousand years ago. Whether they are swinging a heavy copper ax to hit the hard rock formation, or dragging a bamboo basket full of copper ore along the tunnel, the labor day after day and year after year makes them like worker bees dying. The power and glory of the Chu State, the hegemony of King Wu and King Wen, and the grand plans of King Cheng and Zhuang, they have contributed a lot, but history will not leave their names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Main reference books: &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Chu History&quot;, &quot;A Brief History of Chu State&quot;, &quot;Spring and Autumn History&quot; China&#39;s Pre-Qin Copper Mines&quot; &quot;Metallurgical Archeology&quot; &quot;Chinese Bronze&quot; &quot;Loess and Bronze&quot; &quot;Daye County Chronicles&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访陈冲：我没有强大的自信，只有强大的欲望]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257475]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 09/22/wZhQcinkVpws8y7jI3ZKp7XYc6l6VWrqUGmQWVtU.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1439&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/22/wZhQcinkVpws8y7jI3ZKp7XYc 6l6VWrqUGmQWVtU. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;209385&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1981, Chen Chong studied film production in the United States and directed his first film in 1998 &quot;Heavenly Bath&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an actor, Chen Chong is well known, and as a director, Chen Chong is well known. few. Chen Chong is one of the three directors of the movie &quot;Her in the World&quot; to be released on September 9, 2022, the other two are Sylvia Chang and Li Shaohong. The film tells an emotional story under difficult circumstances, involving mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, couples and lovers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, Chen Chong received a call from producer Dong Wenjie, hoping to invite several well-known female directors to jointly shoot a movie. She finally decided to tell the story of a pair of lovers separated in two places, &quot;to explore the closest expression of the oldest theme of love.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like all previous works she directed, Chen Chong wrote the script herself. She repeatedly looked at the real photos taken by her colleagues. There was a supermarket scene in the movie, so she found many supermarket CCTVs and watched them, wanting to know details such as the denseness of the crowds. The script was originally written to rain, and the rendering of rain was used to increase the atmosphere, but later she learned that there was no rain in reality on the day set in the movie, so she removed this setting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Without the rain, wouldn&#39;t the story have happened?

This melody of love, loss, and exile resonated with me—I too am unable to travel home to visit my elderly parents due to the pandemic. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For lovers who are blocked in two cities, the mobile phone screen is something that arouses their infinite desire and is warmer than real life. In fact, this is also the relationship between most people and their mobile phones.

The contradictions and conflicts in human nature also come from people&#39;s different interpretations of online messages. We all seem to be living on isolated islands in our mobile phones.

In fact, film is an apprenticeship, and film school comes later. When the movie first started, everyone was learning on the spot, apprentice-style. The kind of learning from a master should be more useful. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You directed the first film &quot;Tianba&quot; When you were young, you cut it yourself. By then, did you already have strong confidence to complete it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no strong self-confidence, only strong desire. I&#39;m not a particularly confident person, and self-doubt is a big part of my thinking. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But outsiders see that you have many successes, which proves that you Qualified to do it yourself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will always think that it is a coincidence, that it is a misunderstanding, that it is confusing people. I think so, In fact, this may be the case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you ever gone to the cinema to watch your own movie? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Very few. I&#39;ve seen it, but it&#39;s quite unbearable. I actually have a very sensitive radar. I can see the clues of my own dishonesty. Maybe others can’t see it, but I can definitely see it. So watching your own movies is not an easy task. Movies are not an actor&#39;s tool, but a director&#39;s tool, so you are a pawn in it. If you see your own problems, it does not affect your feeling that the movie is pretty good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The films you directed are all because of yourself Do you have the desire to create, or do you have to find funds or outside sources? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Chong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Both. If funds come to me and I don’t have the desire, I will definitely not go. Because being a director is quite hard for me and not an easy thing.我不是一个天才导演，我也不是一个技术型导演，才华有限、技术有限，如果我还没有一个强烈的叙事欲望，那这件事情根本没法做了。所以肯定是要有强烈的叙事欲望才会去做的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你导演的电影都是你自己来编剧？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈冲：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我必须，因为这对我来说不难。我当然希望得到志同道合主创的意见和提示，还有很多大家共同做的资料，因为我觉得资料是给我写剧本最好的东西。但是剧本其实就是我闭上眼睛脑子里看到的那部电影，我先把它写下来，主创全部进入以后，它肯定会有改变。但是起先写下来的就是你脑子里看到的那部电影，所以没有那么难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;
