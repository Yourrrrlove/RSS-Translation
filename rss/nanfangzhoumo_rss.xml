Lei Jun personally donated 1.3 billion yuan to his alma mater. . The official account of Wuhan University stated that this set a new record for the largest single donation since the founding of Wuhan University, and was also the largest individual cash donation from an alumni received by universities across the country. Nandu reporters learned that when he was studying at Wuhan University more than 30 years ago, Lei Jun received a &quot;huge sum&quot; of 2,000 yuan and was determined to pay it back ten thousand times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7fb2543f6dfa9e1e8eee615866c61337.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;535&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7fb2543f6dfa9e1e8eee615866c61337.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259949&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Donation site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned from Wuhan University that Lei Jun is a 1987 computer science alumnus of Wuhan University and the founder, chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Group. This donation mainly focuses on three directions: supporting research in the six basic disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature, history and philosophy, supporting scientific and technological innovation in the computer field, and supporting the training of college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lei Jun recalled that more than 30 years ago, as an outstanding student representative, he was awarded the highest scholarship at Wuhan University at that time, which was a full two thousand yuan, sponsored by a company. He said that for a student from an ordinary county family, this is really a huge sum of money. To this day, he still clearly remembers the excitement and pride he felt at that time. At that time, Lei Jun secretly swore in his heart, &quot;No matter how much scholarship I receive today, I will pay it back ten times, a hundred times, or ten thousand times in the future.&quot; In 1997, six years after graduation, Lei Jun started donating to his alma mater. At that time, his salary Only 4,000 yuan. He began his journey to fulfill his vow and donated money to establish the &quot;Lei Jun Scholarship&quot; (then called the &quot;Tengfei Scholarship&quot;) at the School of Computer Science. He has continued to donate for 26 years now. Lei Jun lamented that today he has finally fulfilled his wish to repay 10,000 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 29th, Lei Jun posted on Weibo to congratulate his alma mater on his birthday: Today is the 130th anniversary of Wuhan University. Happy birthday to my alma mater! He said, &quot;Every time I return to my alma mater, I feel very excited.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打造中国版甲骨文：易鲸捷与贵阳银行的双向冒险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261534]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Guiyang Bank Head Office Building.

Zhao Jilin/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the seventh floor of the head office building of Bank of Guiyang (601997.SH), there is a place where outsiders are prohibited from entering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The computer room covering an area of ​​more than 80 square meters is filled with large electronic display screens and computer terminals. All business operations and accounting processing related to deposits and loans need to be completed here. Supporting the operation of the entire set of equipment is the new core business transaction system that was just launched on November 6, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of banking core business transaction systems, foreign companies such as Oracle and IBM were once absolute monopolies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2020, an unknown startup company suddenly broke in. Guizhou Yijingjie Information Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yijingjie), founded in 2015, won the bid for the domestic database application project of Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system with a price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie plays two roles, one is the supplier of database products, and the other is the general contractor of the entire project. Its purpose is to create a full-stack core transaction system for domestic banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After its official launch, this high-profile trading system did not win praise. Instead, it pushed Yijingjie to the forefront. For a time, the Internet was flooded with comments such as &quot;fake domestically produced products&quot; and &quot;shelling Oracle&quot;, and Bank of Guiyang and Yi Jingjie became the target of public criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It may be very difficult for us to build a (database) nuclear weapon for daily use for the country, but we must take this risk.&quot; Li Jing, chairman of Yi Jingjie, spoke quickly He told a reporter from Southern Weekend, his voice was trembling. She looks very capable, with short hair, tattooed eyebrows, and a red coat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the moment, the &quot;nuclear weapons&quot; Li Jing talks about have not yet been put into production. He Xin, general manager of the Information Technology Department of the Bank of Guiyang, revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the current main database of the Bank of Guiyang is Oracle, and Yi Jingjie is used as a follow-up database, which is exactly the opposite of the original plan. &quot;I invested them all at once. To be honest, the risk will be relatively high.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of Guiyang Big Data Bureau, further explained to Southern Weekend reporters that due to the influence of negative public opinion on the Internet, superior supervision Out of the principle of prudent supervision, the department does not agree to the online launch of Yijingjie database for the time being. &quot;As long as the regulatory authorities relent, it can be launched in any minute.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Delayed launch&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The biggest doubt from the outside world is whether Yi Wingjie, which started with distributed databases, can build a more technically difficult bank core transaction system database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The databases currently used in the financial industry are still mainly centralized, but distributed is the general trend and has computing advantages under massive data and high concurrency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The branch president of a state-owned commercial bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the difficulty in developing the bank&#39;s core transaction system database lies in the large amount of data that needs to be stored for many years and ensure that the system does not go down. In addition, each bank needs to do some customized development according to the needs of customers. For example, it has to open separate interfaces with the credit reporting system and tax system of the People&#39;s Bank of China, which &quot;has strict requirements for security.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years since Guiyang Bank purchased the Yijingjie database, it has not been able to go online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Wingjie was originally relatively optimistic about the launch time. According to the company&#39;s internal documents, the construction goals are divided into three stages:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of June 2020, achieve an average success rate of 99.999%, and successfully implement the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; plan for Guiyang Bank&#39;s core business system in 2021. The main database uses the domestic Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the end of September 2021, the Yijingjie database for typical applications such as banking financial core, graphical front-end, process banking, and credit systems will be transformed and put online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third phase will comprehensively plan and transform the information system of Guiyang Bank, and realize the localization transformation of the full-scenario application system by the end of July 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information can also be seen that the launch time of Yijingjie database has been delayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, the evaluation report of Yijingjie’s shareholder China Software (600536.SH) showed that the core transaction main database purchased by Guiyang Bank is planned to be officially launched in the first half of 2022. Apparently it didn&#39;t happen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already two years later, in May 2023, that there was any further news. When accepting a survey from investors, the Bank of Guiyang stated that the Yijingjie domestic database application project has entered the testing phase and is advancing various testing tasks in an orderly manner. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 2, another investor asked about the progress of Yijingjie’s domestic database at the Bank of Guiyang’s third quarter performance briefing. Chairman Zhang Zhenghai replied, “The development of the new core business system of Bank of Guiyang has been completed. Testing work, the system has entered the online preparation stage, and the system is expected to be online from 17:00 on November 3, 2023 to 8:00 on November 6.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until November 6, Guiyang Bank issued an announcement stating that &quot;the new system has been successfully launched&quot;, but did not declare what database it adopted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the current situation of Yijingjie as a backup follower library, He Xin explained that for relatively mature bank core trading systems, it usually takes 18-24 months from research and development to launch. However, the Guiyang Bank project has many innovations, such as the full-stack core business system and the first application of eCas4.0 in the banking industry, so it takes a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also added that as early as the beginning of 2021, Guiyang Bank signed a contract with Oracle to allow Oracle and Yijingjie to run parallel databases to back up each other, creating a relatively safe structure. The performance of Yijingjie database is acceptable, but the database does not only rely on performance. &quot;If it is actually put online, we would like to test it more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie is located on the 24th floor of Tower C, No. 1 Gaoke. Zhao Jilin/Photo&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/7d85715829.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/7d85715829. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259955&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yijingjie is located on the 24th floor of Tower C, No. 1, Gaoke. Zhao Jilin/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“No city dares to do this”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the top of Building C, No. 1 Gaoke, Changling South Road, High-tech Zone, Guiyang City, the big words “Big Data National Engineering Laboratory” are very Eye-catching, Yi Wingjie is located on the 24th floor of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Yijingjie, Internet companies such as NetEase Haowu and Qilin Software have settled here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of big data in Guizhou Province started in 2012. The development of the big data industry is considered by Guizhou as an excellent opportunity to change lanes and overtake. In 2015, the country established the country&#39;s first comprehensive big data pilot zone in Guizhou. One of its important tasks is to solve the security and independent controllability issues of China&#39;s big data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yi Jingjie, he has never had access to the core transaction system database of a bank before, so he faces great technical challenges. Similarly, for the Guiyang Municipal Government and Guiyang Bank, betting on Yijingjie is also a risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A representative of Guiyang State-owned Assets who once participated in the investment in Yijingjie revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that at the end of 2015, Guiyang State-owned Assets learned about Yijingjie and visited Yijingjie’s technical team, launching a long-term Half a year of due diligence, interviews included Tencent Music (NYSE: TME), the three major telecom operators, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before investing in Yijingjie, Yijingjie signed an agreement with Guiyang State-owned Assets, stipulating that Guizhou Yijingjie would be the headquarters, and Shanghai Yijingjie and American Yijingjie would be the subsidiaries of Guizhou Yijingjie. &quot;When we invested, we promised to invest 20 million yuan first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Guiyang government revealed to a Southern Weekend reporter that although Yi Jingjie is not well-known, it does distributed databases , the leaders at the time also saw it, the technology was relatively new. &quot;The problem with it is that no one uses it, and there is no actual application scenario verification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xuerong said frankly that Guiyang&#39;s big data started slowly, but it can attract a database company and regard it as a treasure, or even treat it as a treasure. Unicorns to breed. &quot;No city in the country dares to do this. We take real application scenarios and let them verify the database.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016-2019, Guiyang Industrial and Information Industry Development Guidance Fund Co., Ltd. , Guiyang Service Outsourcing and Call Industry Venture Capital Fund Co., Ltd., Guizhou Provincial Venture Investment Promotion Center, Guiyang Comprehensive Bonded Zone Development Investment (Group) Co., Ltd., Gui&#39;an New Area Emerging Industry Development Fund (Co., Ltd.) and other state-owned industrial funds , successively became shareholders of Yijingjie by increasing capital, with a cumulative investment of 128 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people from the Guiyang Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the initial investment and introduction of Yijingjie was based on its overseas technology. According to the official website of Yijingjie, the company is &quot;one of the few domestic database manufacturers with independent core technology.&quot; The R&amp;D team originates from Tianteng Company, with 30 years of technology accumulation and a complete team structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yijingjie was initially chaired by Chinese-American Li Weichong, and Li Jing, as his Chinese wife, served as the legal representative. Li Weichong has a glorious resume. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and received dual doctorates in finance and computer chemistry. Before founding Yijingjie, Li Weichong served as a senior executive in Lucent, Accenture, HP, China Unicom and other companies. Among them, asking Yao Ming to endorse China Unicom New World has become a classic case of publicity and promotion model, which once caused a sensation in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to Li Weichong and his wife described to Southern Weekend reporters that Li Weichong is personable, has extraordinary conversation, and has a gentle personality. Li Jing is on the strong side and has been in the clothing business in her early years. After the establishment of Yijingjie, Li Jing also participated in the daily management of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The original architecture is basically that of a small multinational company.” A former employee of Yijingjie told Southern Weekend reporters that in the early days, Yijingjie was relatively leading in the field of integrated distributed databases, and many people in the team were Colleagues or students of Turing Award winner Jim Gray have a relatively luxurious technical lineup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American Yijingjie was born first in Guizhou Yijingjie, one was established at the beginning of 2015 and the other at the end of the year. In Li Jing&#39;s own words, he is a &quot;father who has his son first and then looks for him.&quot; &quot;My biggest request for the American team is to pass on the technology of database development to the domestic R&amp;D team. This matter is not a secret among the American team.&quot; Li Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yijingjie&#39;s headquarters is located in Guiyang High-tech Zone. Zhao Jilin/Photo&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 29/056f76c471.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/056f76c471.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259957&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yijingjie&#39;s headquarters is located in Guiyang High-tech Zone. Zhao Jilin/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small companies take on big projects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to verify the technical reliability of Yijingjie, the Guiyang government selected Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Behavior as pilot projects, starting with the sandbox project rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called sandbox refers to a virtual database environment used for development, testing and experimental purposes, which is completely isolated from the production environment database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin said that the original core business system of Guiyang Bank was built and launched in 2005, using IBM&#39;s Informix database. Because the system is aging, performance has dropped significantly, and operation and maintenance are worrying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An internal document obtained by Southern Weekend reporters also confirms this. The document mentioned, “In March 2020, the core system mistakenly placed the key synchronization program in the day change process, causing the day to be continuously and incorrectly switched at the end of the day, resulting in a large amount of production data disorder that day. More than a dozen engineers repaired it overnight. It took hours to resolve; a production accident occurred in May 2020, and UnionPay and core logic errors resulted in duplicate entries, resulting in a short payment in the bank.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin further explained that as the customer scale of Guiyang Bank increases, both the database and the application system have obvious deficiencies in business carrying capacity. In addition, in response to the country&#39;s requirements for the development of the credit innovation industry and the self-reliance of the bank&#39;s financial technology system, Guiyang Bank is also making local substitutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jingjie was keenly aware of this opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a work report to Li Zaiyong, the former vice governor of Guizhou Province, on January 14, 2019, Yi Jingjie said that promoting its database has great strategic significance: &quot;Solving the country&#39;s problems in finance and government affairs , communications and other core fields of information security issues; breakthroughs in the core basic technology of the database will drive the efficiency of the entire industry; replace the international database led by Oracle, which accounts for about 90% of the domestic market, and can be exported to the Belt and Road Initiative and even the European and American markets, from These two perspectives can effectively reduce China&#39;s service trade deficit.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiyong instructed that from the perspective of institutional support, efforts should be made to build Yijingjie into an innovative platform for the development of Guizhou&#39;s big data industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate on November 21, 2023, Li Zaiyong&#39;s suspected bribery and abuse of power case was concluded by the National Supervisory Commission and transferred to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution. However, the news did not disclose whether Li Zaiyong&#39;s fall was related to Yi Jingjie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee of Yi Jingjie who has worked with Li Weichong and his wife for many years told Southern Weekend reporters that unlike Li Weichong, Li Jing has particularly outstanding planning skills and can grasp the core needs of customers. &quot;She clearly understands what the Bank of Guiyang, Guiyang Municipal Government and participating manufacturers want, and has strong ability to make decisions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 2, 2019, the core business of Guiyang Bank&#39;s domestic database construction The sandbox testing system project was sold, with Yijingjie becoming the sole supplier, and the winning bid price was 43.98 million yuan. According to the announcement, this procurement adopts a single-source procurement method because &quot;according to project construction requirements, procurement can only be from a single supplier.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why use single-source bidding? He Xin said that Guiyang Bank&#39;s procurement is based on the &quot;Interim Provisions on the Management of Centralized Procurement of State-owned Financial Enterprises&quot; implemented by the Ministry of Finance on February 5, 2018. &quot;If we violate the law, I think we can be held accountable according to law. If we comply with the law, I think it will be No problem, no further explanation is needed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the project plan, Guiyang Bank uses the Yijingjie database to build a core business sandbox test application system, using the system as a sandbox for the existing core business system, and using the transactions of the core business system on the sandbox Data, carry out the testing and verification work of Yijingjie database. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 8 of the same year, Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank purchased another project of Yijingjie - a domestic database application pilot, with a transaction amount of 123 million yuan. This project adopts the &quot;dual database parallel&quot; solution with mutual backup and free switching, and has been officially accepted in May 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A project leader of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank told Southern Weekend reporters that the dual-bank parallel plan has three stages. In the first stage, Oracle is used as the main database, in the second stage, Yi Jingjie is used as the main library, and in the third stage, Oracle is completely excluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge admitted that Yi Jingjie has not yet become the main warehouse. “We must first admit the gap, then push our own things up, and let others stand guard for us for a while. , this is a more cautious approach.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An employee structure of Yijingjie obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that Yijingjie was still a start-up company with a small scale when it received the bank order. From 2017 to 2019, the number of employees was 69, 100, and 144 respectively. Among them, there are 46, 74 and 105 technical personnel respectively. There are less than 20 people with master&#39;s degrees in the company, and only one with a doctorate. In addition, Yi Jingjie has a team of more than 30 people in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, according to the China Software Shareholders’ Equity Assessment Report, from 2017 to June 2021, Yijingjie’s R&amp;D expenses totaled 62.8922 million yuan, of which the R&amp;D expenses in 2017 were 0, and in 2018 they were only 1.03 million. , it was 19.6471 million yuan in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Most of the revenue is outsourced&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the surface, Yijingjie won large orders from Guiyang Bank and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank in the early stage. But in fact, Yi Wingjie did not gain much benefit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An insider told Southern Weekend reporters that of the 123 million yuan order signed by Yi Jingjie and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, the self-owned product part was only 25.9709 million yuan, accounting for 21.11%; with Guiyang Bank Among the contract value of 43.98 million yuan signed, the self-owned product part was only 10.9251 million yuan, accounting for 24.84%. Most of its revenue is achieved through outsourcing, and even some of its external procurement revenue costs are inverted, causing the company to suffer heavy losses year after year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the asset appraisal report issued by Zhongrui Shilian Asset Appraisal Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Zhongrui Shilian) in January 2021, from 2017 to 2019, Yijingjie’s operating income (parent company caliber ) were 2.2858 million yuan, 15.0113 million yuan and 91.5668 million yuan respectively; net profits (parent company caliber) were -1.8598 million yuan, 4.0166 million yuan and -49.3269 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it doesn’t make money in the early stage, why does Yijingjie need to develop a more difficult core banking transaction business system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Yijingjie shareholder told Southern Weekend reporters that although Li Jing claimed to have a strong sense of mission for information security, the actual situation was that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to seek transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From October to November 2019, Yi Jingjie’s capital chain was in crisis. The company had no money in its accounts and could not even pay wages for a time. Li Jing and shareholder Peng Yimin also repeatedly offered 6% of their annual income. Lending funds to Yi Jingjie at interest rates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned shareholders revealed that during the early years of Yi Jingjie&#39;s business, although it had customers such as China Unicom and China Mobile, the amount of a single order was not large, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of yuan. Li Jing once said at more than one internal meeting, &quot;When will this end?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side of the Pacific, in the United States, the company&#39;s annual sales revenue is only two to three hundred thousand US dollars, but the team&#39;s annual expenses exceed US$5 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the husband and wife have different positions on the development of the bank&#39;s core transaction system and database. Li Weichong objected many times, and company CEO Ding Hong also firmly opposed it. &quot;But Li Jing saw the market and insisted on doing it.&quot; said the above-mentioned shareholder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to Li Weichong told Southern Weekend reporters that Li Weichong has a very cautious character, and the company&#39;s losses have continued to increase, and he is unwilling to bet on the bank&#39;s core trading system. His differences with Li Jing have become increasingly serious. big. On October 7, 2019, Li Weichong and Li Jing agreed to divorce. Li Weichong stepped down as chairman and handed over all of Yi Jingjie, which he founded, to Li Jing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to Yi Jingjie’s many questions, Southern Weekend reporters contacted Li Weichong many times, but he declined the interview on the grounds of “inconvenience.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2019, Li Jing held a meeting in the underground conference room of her home in Beijing. A total of more than 20 company backbones and representatives of Guiyang state-owned assets attended, but Li Weichong and Ding Hong, who represented the American team, were excluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A shareholder who attended the meeting told Southern Weekend reporters that at this meeting, Li Jing requested a comprehensive transformation of the company, based on the core banking business, and decided to leave the US team. Li Jing also said at the meeting, &quot;This is the direction of the company and where it makes money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The more you understand technology, the more you know its boundaries. The less you understand technology, the more you dare to rush.” The above-mentioned former employee commented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who has participated in Yijingjie’s financing told Southern Weekend reporters that the divestment of the US team has a lot to do with Encore (safety and reliability). &quot;Later we learned that if you want to build a core business system, you must first pass Encore. If you can&#39;t pass this level, don&#39;t be a bank core.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Yi Jingjie raised $1.92 million for Price achieved full ownership of American Easy Whale Jet. Then, the U.S. team disbanded, clearing the last obstacle to the localization of Yi Jingjie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, 2020, Guizhou Sunshine Equity Exchange announced that the Guiyang Bank’s core business system Yijingjie domestic database application project was completed for a total price of 426 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xin revealed that the project involves the entire business chain, from front-end and back-end to core, disaster recovery system, network, monitoring and management platform, security and other related projects, involving more than 20 suppliers. Among them, the amount of the Yijingjie database project is only more than 40 million yuan, accounting for more than 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Become a &quot;national team&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For a software startup company, sufficient ammunition is needed to maintain this &quot;money-burning&quot; game. Yi Jingjie&#39;s approach is to marry with Chinese software and become a &quot;national team&quot; in the database field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Software is a large-scale high-tech central enterprise controlled by China Electronics Information Industry Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as China Electronics). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, when Li Jing took over Yi Jingjie, she began to discuss investment matters with China Electronics. In May 2020, China Electronics and Yijingjie reached an exclusive investment intention, and will complete the investment in Yijingjie in two steps: first, acquire part of the original shares of Yijingjie held by Li Jing through China Software, and then complete a further capital increase. Expansion of shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, China Software officially invested in Yijingjie and held 7.6438% of Yijingjie’s equity at a consideration of 56,789,702 yuan. One year later, China Software decided to increase its capital, and planned to adopt the method of direct investment + investment by the newly established holding subsidiary &quot;ChinaSoft Financial Investment&quot;. At the price of 22.91 yuan/1 yuan of registered capital, the total investment will not exceed 389 million yuan (based on equity Calculated, the actual investment does not exceed 181.9213 million yuan), and the subscription for Yijingjie will increase the maximum registered capital by 16.9723 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the evaluation report of Zhongrui Shilian, China Software’s capital increase in Yijingjie is nearly 18 times higher than the book value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 21, 2023, the China Software Board of Directors issued an announcement stating that the company had moderately controlled the actual investment payment progress out of considerations of prudence and investment risk control. As of November 10, 2022, the company paid an additional capital of 17.91 million yuan to Yijingjie, and ChinaSoft Financial Investment paid an additional capital of 47.24 million yuan, and the total shareholding ratio increased to 11.09%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This investment amount is far from the original plan of &quot;the total investment shall not exceed 389 million yuan, and the total holding shall not exceed 25% of the equity of Yijingjie&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 17, the Beijing Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a warning letter to Zhongrui Shilian, stating that Yi Jingjie’s “operating income forecast data is insufficiently based”. In the first assessment project, the feasibility of the profit forecast data provided by the company was not fully analyzed and reviewed, and in the second assessment project, the reasons for the delay of Yijingjie&#39;s large orders and the impact on future earnings were not fully paid attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the warning letter mentioned that &quot;expressions such as &#39;first&#39; were clearly used in the two evaluation reports, but there was insufficient evidence in the manuscript to support the relevant expressions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, Yijingjie has had no major financing trends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person who has worked for Yijingjie for many years told Southern Weekend reporters that Yijingjie&#39;s early converged distributed databases were relatively advanced, but with the rapid rise of other companies, Yijingjie&#39;s technical advantages have gradually declined. No longer, there are also some problems with the company&#39;s strategy. &quot;In the final analysis, it must be launched quickly, and then attract resources and expand the R&amp;D team. How can a world-class technology rely on a small company of one or two hundred people to gain a leading position?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The competition for domestic databases is intensifying. , now Renmin University Jincang, Dameng, Nanda General Motors and Shenzhou General Motors are known as the &quot;Four Golden Flowers&quot; of domestic databases. New entrants include not only IT giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, but also small entrepreneurial manufacturers targeting market segments, such as Xinghuan and Pingcap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another former employee who was responsible for Yijingjie’s financing pointed out that even if the company wanted to go public, it would be difficult to meet the standards. One is that the income is not up to standard, and the other key problem is a single customer. Apart from the Bank of Guiyang and Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, Yijingjie basically has no big customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former employee of Yijingjie revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that since October, Yijingjie has begun to lay off employees one after another, citing &quot;financing issues and normal personnel optimization.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[怀念奶奶丨到此的路程]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261493]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Art history scholar Xu Xiaohu.

Come and stand with the bride during the ceremony. This is because grandma was shocked when she saw the 20-year-old German girl chosen by her doting third son: brown loose hair, thin and long face, eyes that fell into her head, and was squashed The raised nose is so ugly and perverted! How could this happen? Grandma was frantic, trying desperately to find some uglier ladies to reconcile the horrific situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 1933, Xu Daolin and Barbara Schuchard held a wedding in Nanjing, and Jiang Fucong was the witness.

Mr. Jiang later became the director of the National Central Library. There are many advanced and effective management measures, and it is advocated that all books should be digitized and permanently preserved for the public. Later, Uncle Chiang became the first director of the National Palace Museum in Taipei, where he implemented many new initiatives. Out of consideration for the benefit of employees, he provided dormitories and welfare facilities for everyone near the museum, which was still a suburb at the time. and other facilities. In 1933, he served as a witness at his parents&#39; wedding ceremony in Nanjing. He later told me that he &quot;ate the little tiger&#39;s red egg.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My mother took a boat from Germany, which fell to Nazism, to China to marry Xu Daolin. She found that this ancient country had many traditions that were very difficult for her. At first she refused to kneel and kowtow in front of her grandma like her father did. Growing up in Berlin, Barbara Schuchard had never kowtowed to anyone or any god in her life. In front of many curious viewers, her spine became an unbendable iron bar. At first, the poor father could only run back and forth between mother and wife to explain, and became a master of &quot;diplomacy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The next spring, a huge typhoon hit Nanjing. The young bride went to the Central Hospital to give birth to their first child, and found that the windows of the hospital ward were also covered with debris. Broken by the typhoon. She thought excitedly, ah! This must be a &quot;presidential-level&quot; boy! The father is also waiting for his son, and they have prepared many names - all for boys. When they saw a red and wrinkled little girl, they were completely stunned, indescribable surprise and disappointment. They looked at each other, not knowing what to do. One day passed, two days passed, and I couldn&#39;t think of any girl&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On the third day, grandma spoke. She explained to the new parents the ins and outs of the baby. Feng Conghu and Yun Conglong, this descendant is obviously my father&#39;s favorite big cat named Xiaohu when he was a child. The cat was suddenly run over by a car one day. The &quot;three bald boys&quot; of the Xu family (my grandfather shaved the heads of all his sons and refused to wear Manchu pigtails) were so sad that they didn&#39;t eat or sleep. They just felt sad. . Grandma comforted Dad and said, don&#39;t cry, Santuer, your little tiger will fly back to you as soon as possible and stay with you for the rest of his life. Dad felt relieved and slowly returned to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Grandma hugged the new little girl and said: Look, isn&#39;t this the little tiger you have been waiting for so many years to come back to accompany you? Who did you say? This is the little tiger who came back. My parents had nothing to say, so my grandma looked at my mother’s face and gave her daughter-in-law a title for the first time——&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;You say Isn&#39;t it, Hu Zi Niang? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In the summer of 1934, Xu Xiaohu and his parents were in Guling, Lushan.

From 1938 to 1941, my father served as the Charge d’Affaires of the Republic of China in Italy for four years. When World War II broke out and China and Italy broke off diplomatic relations, my parents took my sister Xiaoyu and me back to China. Grandma also came to Geleshan from her aunt&#39;s house in Chengdu to welcome her third son after four years of separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Our plane landed in Chongqing, and the welcome crowd gathered next to our parents, speaking adult Chinese. I walked down the gangway and stepped onto the land of China. I was extremely moved. This is my motherland! My eight-year-old heart nearly burst. My elementary school classmates in Rome once asked me, Uncle, call me! (This is the pronunciation of Xu Xiaohu by foreigners)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Uncle Stop shouting! Why is your face so flat? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;I thought about it and answered: This is because I come from a very far away and very ancient country. The Chinese Embassy you saw on Viale Pola has strong guards in front of it wearing beautiful uniforms and tall feathered helmets. That is my ancient and luxurious motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Now I kneel on the land of my motherland, bend down and lower my head, passionately kiss the place I have dreamed of for four years, I am happy and moved, and shed tears. Tell the motherland softly, great land, the tiger cub is back, your child is back. I will learn Chinese as soon as possible and become a Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The land at that time was so dirty, not as bright and clean as Rome. I saw dirty children with tattered clothes and scabs on their heads, standing there with bare feet and a runny nose, staring at us. Like adults, they spit out phlegm from their mouths and spit it on the ground. Xiaohu was very sad when he returned to China, but he insisted on thinking that this is my favorite motherland, that far, far away, very ancient motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After several hours of climbing up the hillside in a sedan chair, we finally arrived at the small, dark mud house at No. 15, Bakuaitian, Geleshan. Someone was carrying the luggage in, and my mother and sister went into the house and rummaged through the luggage for something. I stayed on the balcony and watched my father kneel down next to my grandmother who had her head and feet bound. Mother and son hugged each other, and grandma burst into tears, her thin and high-pitched voice reaching to the sky. Dad cried silently, and they held him and cried like this for a long time. I felt sad after reading it. I didn’t understand a word, but I fully understood the emotion in their hearts. I left quietly, walked into the door, climbed a chair next to the big round table, and saw a pot of tea on the table and a few cups of no man controlled. I don&#39;t know what the drink is, but it must be the drink of my motherland. I poured myself a drink for myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; bitter and astringent. Adult. taste of China. I love it, I want to love it. Drink another glass to taste it. Another cup. This taste has not been tasted for a lifetime. It has no taste in Italy. I am Chinese, I will drink Chinese taste. One cup after receiving this ancient taste and sucking into my soul. Xu Xiaohu and her motherland gradually became one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; The sky began to be dark. The crying and complaints outside had not stopped, but the room was not clear. Someone put a lamp on a large table. It is a green long -handle oil lamp made of ceramics. A white light core floated on the bowl of oil. Is this the only lighting in our big room (restaurant)? The new Chinese who returned home found that she could not see anything. She was not like the light of the Roman electrical chandeliers, and she immediately felt ashamed. This is the ancient lighting of my motherland. No matter how bright, I will love it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; I don&#39;t remember how I fell asleep on the first night in Gelshan, I just remember that I insisted on going to school right away, and learned my mother tongue again. Chinese elementary school students. I did not expect that I expected to go to elementary school to continue to study in the fourth grade but was sent to the first grade to learn Chinese. I went to school happily, and I still remember that the first lesson said, &quot;Come, come to school, everyone come to school.&quot; All Chinese characters have no phonetic symbols -we go directly to know the ancient Chinese characters. On the way home, the classmates chased the stones behind, and shouted loudly &quot;Madam!&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; My hair was not black and straight, Tea red curved. After I went home, I desperately brushed with water and brush, trying to brush it directly. No matter how wet and how to brush it, it rolls up again. I had to face these students myself, fight with them, and hit them one by one. After all, I am eight years old, a little higher than the first -year classmates. When I got along with Italian classmates, there was no negative behavior, and I began to release an inherent energy, and I felt very proud. It turns out that the children of the motherland in the war persuaded each other with physical strength. Well, start learning Chinese words, and start to become a Chinese hero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; . &amp; nbsp; &lt;/span>; Grandma said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; I will not come down from the tree.

Why must I go to my grandma? I like to live in this tree. Here I can count the enemy aircraft! &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; At that time, my Chinese had already spoken well, on the pine tree near the small mud house in Geleshan, I remembered Before the Grand Garden, the official residence of the elegant embassy in Rome, the freedom of free flowerless trees that were not observed and found. I have a high ceiling in the bedroom in Rome. The ceiling to the wall covers the colorful murals with classical mythical characters ... There is a two or three -story doll houses in the bedroom, which can play with the furniture, doll bed and cabinet, chairs and tables. And several puppet dolls who can stand and stand. These are not interesting to me. After lunch, I will slip into the garden outside, find the highest flower fig tree to climb up, hiding in the leaves that are rich and overflowing with milky liquid. No one can see me, and no one will go there to find me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; In the months of autumn, I can pick juicy fruits on this huge tree. Even if there is no fruit, I can sit on its big branches to enjoy the breeze, height and happiness. For a child with a family nanny, this is difficult to get lucky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; My cute little sister Xiaoyu is three and a half years younger than me, and has always been in the embrace of the French Switzerland nanny of Mademoiselle, from the embrace of the French nanny of Mademoiselle. Roman years at the age of 4 to 8, they are very free, and they are more committed to exploring unknown loneliness, not chatting with servants or dolls. In the changing trees that pass through the cool breeze, I will talk from the people from the higher favorable position to talk about the sound of people on the ground, and I can feel the movements of adults. That perspective made me from a wonderful distance and adults from an adult. The world is separated from a buffer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; On those generous big branches, everything has lost the persuasion of &quot;adults&quot;. From the perspective of tree living, everything on the ground has become less urgent and threatening. Observe them from a higher perspective than adults, and find that adults often destroy the scope of secular wisdom or common sense. Surprisingly, they are often like this and spend a lot of time to participate in unnecessary words and deeds; do a lot of unnecessary action, unreal behavior, and raise a hypocritical mentality. Adults will spend a few days and nights that are not important or even ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; For example, they created very difficult clothes, my mother&#39;s clothes out of the house, there is a large row of buttons-but they are all behind! Walking behind her, I can see that one of the buttons is not right, tilting her head aside, causing all the other buttons to be wrong, forming a scene that looks very funny. The adults would pretend not to see it, but they giggled behind her all day. No one pointed her to this, and no one helped her to deduct the whole row of buttons again. I can only walk behind and watch them, thinking about how stupid and unnecessary this time is spent, but our children are not allowed to point out this, giggle or laughing; Leave it to yourself and attribute this to the adult&#39;s love for spending time, and the children can only endure silently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;-&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, simkai, stkaiti;&quot;>; Give me the tree.

Through the valley on the way home from school, under the winding corner of the winding mountain trail, under the big stone mansion of General Chen Cheng, I will reach the habitat after a few steps, sit there and stare at the distant Shapingba Valley Plain. , The Jialing River in the sun meanders into the distance. There is a Central University, and my father teaches there, and also works in the Chongqing Central Government. In that habitat, I will listen to the voice of people living in the plain. They sell the goods, the parents yell at the children, and the children shouted each other. I would think of my father and work with my head alone to do all my heads. People serve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Every Sunday, he will take the &quot;two-person human car&quot; to leave our black mud house, go down the mountain along thousands of steps, reach Shapingba below Shapingba below Entering his Chongqing and his lonely rooms, I have always been thinking like my dad.

However, Chongqing has been in haze, and Wuyun is densely set, and the Japanese aircraft is difficult to bombard the target. Every few days, we will hear the alarm sounds over the head of our heads. Everyone will even rush out of the people who live in Gele Mountain and squeeze into those humid and dark air -proof caves. water vapor. Every time I slip out alone, sit on the rocks under my favorite tall pine, counting enemy planes, try to identify different brands of the aircraft based on black and white photos -those photos are me and my classmates from the police station.

The reason for our birth is to be born! Become a child who is married to our parents. Now we are finally born, the purpose of growing up is successful, and we don&#39;t need to get married and have children anymore! The life explained by my grandmother is completely unacceptable to my broad -minded way of thinking. Is this really the life everyone said? So in this way, obviously adults are really ignorant! The real purpose of life is not just for the existence of human beings. I saw it clearly at the time that humans obviously had not asked this question, the meaning of survival -why do we live -this is the question! Why do we come to this fun place? Of course, come to appreciate this life and play it thoroughly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Play in pain to the end-this is the purpose of us-no? The most basic and important test of this is from my heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Grandma told me a lot of stories. There is a large round metal barrel on the elevated in her room. Grandma shook around and moved her little feet, and she could walk to the elevated elevated and took off the particularly bright barrel, mixed it, and opened it to take out her own maltose. There is nothing in the world than the maltose that rolls with grandma. Round and flat, with white powder on the outside, so that they are not sticky into a group. Therefore, of course, eating maltose can also count on one of the main goals of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>; Listening to grandma telling stories is also one of the wonderful goals, too charming! Grandma&#39;s story will include the heroes of our family. For example, the grandma&#39;s surname is Xia, and the Xia family comes from Yue Fei&#39;s hometown. Grandma&#39;s voice as sweet as honey and high as a bird, slowly using her Xuzhou cavity story, all have a taste. Xiaohu sat next to her grandma&#39;s knees and listened, and she forgot everything else. The entire countryside loves Yue Fei. He helped the emperor from returning from Jin Guo to restore the throne of the emperor, but Gao Zong was unwilling to return the throne he had already sat to his father and father -this unsuccessful son called Yue Fei and Yue Fei&#39;s eldest son Concerned as an enemy and chopped his head. Xiaohu cried loudly when he heard it, and his tears flew around.

Initially, he almost traveled to various counties in western Sichuan and southern Sichuan to introduce himself to the local land and resources departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Chengdu pulled him. Huang Yan remembered that when the company had just settled in the Chengdu High -tech Zone, the government provided the policy support for the decrease of office rents. At the end of 2017, the company sold the first prototype to a county in western Sichuan. After half a year, the machine successfully warned the landslide twice, and gradually opened the market in the southwest. However, government aid has not stopped. For three years, the company also received funding subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Huang Yan said that at present, the company has applied equipment and platforms to water conservancy dams, mining safety, foundation pit support, transportation, etc., and has already already been, and has already already been Go to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Huang Yan&#39;s cause is developing, and Chengdu&#39;s talent policy is also iterating. In 2020, Chengdu focused on the construction of the Western Science City, focused on scientific and technological innovation, and introduced the 2.0 version of Talent&#39;s New Deal. It launched policies and measures such as the implementation of the global high -end talent attraction plan of the Tianfu Laboratory, the establishment of the capital characteristic group, and the opening of high -energy platforms to open the society. 2022 The Chengdu Innovation Index ranked 29th in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Three years later, in Chengdu Science City in Tianfu New District, Sichuan, scientific research institutions are lined.

After all, like Beidiao and Shanghai Drifting, there is still the word &quot;drift&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, Chengdu has been a typical immigrant city since ancient times, which has an open, tolerant, generous and friendly cultural characteristics. According to the talent workers in Chengdu, the genetic inheritance and cultural core of &quot;Rongfiao&quot; have long been rooted in the urban development trajectory, and the merger has become the endless power of Chengdu, which has changed the original meaning of &quot;drift&quot; and enriched the &quot;drift &quot;Connotation. Chengdu respects the dreams of each individual, cherishes every upward power, and uses the greatest sincerity to help &quot;Rong Diao&quot; achieve personal value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Chengdu has fully opened the way to practice the strategy of brand-oriented strategy, creating the &quot;Rong Diao&quot; brand that is deeply popular. It is also the first country in the country to apply for trademark registration The city talent work brand has created a series of fist products and series of derivatives, such as the &quot;Rong Drift Plan&quot; of the talent, the &quot;Rongfu Talent&quot;, the &quot;Rong Diao Cup&quot; The School of Talent Development &quot;, the&quot; Rongfu Talent Day &quot;, the&quot; Rongcheng Talent Green Card &quot;of Rongcai, and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Chengdu has been exploring practical difficulties for young college students who have entered the society. &quot;From the perspective of talent, a college student who has just graduated, go to a city to find a job, what is lacking?

Later, they changed their practices to uniformly promote the theme, uniformly promote the process, uniformly label the slogan, and maximize the effect of the citation through the construction of &quot;government guidance, employer -led, and extensive social participation in society.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Taking this year&#39;s &quot;Rongfu Talent&quot; Tsinghua and Peking University college as an example, Chengdu mobilized 26 public institutions in the city and 16 cities with state-owned enterprises in the city to take out For high -quality positions, the college scientific research institutes and Fortune 500 enterprises are invited to participate in the recruitment. According to statistics, 782 recruitment positions released this event, attracting more than 1,800 young college students to participate.

In order to stay, Chengdu also smashed real gold and silver. From the city&#39;s level to the district (city) county, there is a series of talent project declarations and talent assessment. Liu Hongyan recalled that when she had some scientific research results, she was rated as a senior talent C category Class C in the Sichuan Tianfu New District &quot;Tianfu Yingcai Plan&quot; in 2022.

Also renting a house near the city center, the rent is about a quarter of Shanghai. A &quot;Rongmiao&quot; youth admitted to reporters from the south weekend that he came to work in Chengdu three years ago. One of the important reason is that the house prices in Chengdu have a high cost performance in the provincial capital cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Play&quot; is a business card in Chengdu.

Usually, seven or eight tourists, the team set off, and along the way, more and more audiences behind the red volunteers will be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位51岁的成都人原本是外企管理人员，奔波于西南，工作繁忙疲累。 After a serious illness, the doctor warned &quot;not too tired afterwards&quot;, and the museum at the door of the house became a new choice. The company has heard of the group several times, and they are surprised by the colleagues who talk about the ancient Shu civilization in front of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像她这样有双重身份的，在成都还有超过360万人。 Zhang Zimeng, a student of Sichuan Conservatory of Music, is a volunteer of the &quot;Song is the sweetest medicine&quot; project. She will go to the hospital every week to give 50 or 60 &quot;antenna babies&quot; as a vocal teacher; 37 -year -old express delivery员唐建是“小牛哥·先锋车手”志愿服务队队长，他的队伍是走街串巷的“流动探头”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些是每天发生在成都各个角落的志愿服务故事。成都市委宣传部志愿服务处相关负责人魏娜告诉南方周末记者，他们搭建了志愿服务工作平台“文明兴蓉”，用信息化手段实现志愿者服务信息的全记录。整个平台运转至今，全市注册的志愿者队伍将近四万支。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成都正在成为“志愿之城”的典范城市。魏娜觉得，这是一种“微光成聚的过程”：“分开看都是小小的、很微观的，但是合在一起就是在致力于城市的治理和城市的幸福。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“当个志愿者这么麻烦”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;这是戢英在金沙遗址博物馆做志愿者的第六年，“没有强烈的信念，是没有办法坚持下去的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该馆共有志愿者六十余位，戢英所在的讲解组的录用考核是公认的严格。这位“历史知识小白”一路磕磕绊绊，过了集体面试，完成第一轮的遗迹馆讲解考试，卡线过了笔试，又通过了整馆的讲解面试，成为见习志愿者。整个考核过程持续了将近七个月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;志愿者培训的第一堂课是参观博物馆，第二堂课是学习团队规章制度。每年服务时长要达120小时，原则上每周必须要来一次。服务组的志愿者马农刚来时不适应：“没想到当个志愿者这么麻烦，可严格了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73774&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70565&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;身着红色制服的志愿者，正在金沙遗址博物馆里为游客讲解。南方周末记者高伊琛摄&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;管理这支志愿者团队的，是该馆公众服务与社会教育部的工作人员卢璐。 “我们经常叫她卢大王或小皮鞭。”马农调侃，“卢大王”特别严格，如果没带工作证，就不让进门，不算服务时长。后来时间长了，她发现这种严守规则，相当于屏蔽了“那些不坚定的人”，留下来的都是真正想当志愿者的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卢璐告诉南方周末记者，自己将规章制度“说在前头”，是希望与志愿者进行双选。 “没有管理就没有凝聚力，你如果能够接受，我们就愉快地共事下去。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;团队的凝聚力不仅体现在制度上。卢璐会尽量记得每个志愿者的生日，在群中带领大家送上祝福，也会在年底表彰会上，联系志愿者曾经协作过的部门，请求其出具荣誉证书，向志愿者表达尊重与感谢。 “志愿者伙伴们并不是冲着物质来的，所以我希望能在其他方面满足他们被尊重、被需要的状态。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于人手有限的博物馆来说，志愿者是重要的补充力量。卢璐提到，博物馆有三十多个讲解员，在寒暑假、热门假期时远远供不应求，志愿者就能补位。他们公布了志愿者的定点讲解时间，每天上下午各三场，“就可以很大程度上缓解需求”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;翻译组里的英文翻译志愿者，工作是“排得满满的”。馆方曾试过翻译公司，但涉及考古术语，难度较高，反而是馆内的翻译组志愿者更能胜任——都过了英语专业八级，学历基本在硕士以上。 “我们有很多专业培训，包括馆长也会给我们讲解文物的出土、历史来源，我们都了解得很清楚。”翻译组负责人雷蕾说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;从市到区的整体调度&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在前述“文明兴蓉”平台上，像这样的各类活动日均在500场以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是全国首个全面支撑新时代文明实践和志愿服务活动开展的智慧化平台。据了解，这一智慧化平台能够实现志愿者服务信息的全记录，同时，也是评奖评优的重要参照。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;负责管理该平台的成都志愿者网副主编刘奕说，在该平台可以看到成都所有区县的志愿服务活动，“它最大的功能就是便于市民查找活动，报名参与&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近，平台上的生态环保类活动尤多。刘奕告诉南方周末记者，国庆假期，成都市文明办在环城绿道上联动了14个志愿服务驿站，开展骑行打卡活动。成都的环城绿道是骑行爱好者的圣地，全长有100公里。 “市民的需求促使我们将文明实践和志愿服务延伸到绿道场景中。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;14个驿站互相配合，也各有自选动作。温江区委宣传部创建与志愿服务科科长张颖向南方周末记者回忆，当时，她最担心吸引不到市民驻足。主办方将驿站的文明盲盒拼成一幅中国地图，骑行的人路过，总是停下来询问，吸睛效果很好，“每天我们这儿打卡点都是堆着人的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与金沙遗址博物馆内的项目不同，这是一张由成都各级政府部门织下的志愿活动之网。一场为期数天的活动，需要多个部门配合完成。在绿道驿站活动中，各级文明单位起到主力军作用，引导协同社会组织参与助力，省、市、区三级文明单位结对绿道共建。仅在环城绿道温江段，参与的部门就包括温江区卫健局、区文体旅局、区教育局等至少12家单位和企业共计百余人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每天绿道驿站的具体活动也由责任单位派人执行。张颖举例，中医义诊活动是由区卫健局负责，向市民提供健康咨询服务，教授急救知识，处置骑行摔伤、徒步扭伤等突发意外，温江区中医院还派出了医疗团队志愿者. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对张颖来说，对接各部门参与志愿活动并不困难。整场活动由新时代文明实践中心统一调度，区委书记任中心主任，具体落实工作。大型活动开始前，文明实践中心会召开调度会议，需要配合活动的部门均需参会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据她介绍，温江区是全省首批、全国第二批新时代文明实践中心试点。一个区级中心、九个镇街道、95个村社区共同建成文明实践中心所在的三级阵地，旗下还有8支专业志愿服务常备队伍，以及多支特色志愿服务队伍，“当我们需要它的时候，我们就可以统筹”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们成都这种志愿服务模式，从上到下统筹得很好。每个区县的文明实践中心有规范的制度、活动和组织架构，能很好地推进这种文明实践和志愿服务活动的常态开展。”张颖总结。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73771&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70562&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年国庆期间，温江区在绿道驿站开展活动。受访者供图&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;志愿服务“淘宝商城”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;建立积分回馈激励机制，是打造志愿者之城的重要环节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;志愿时长兑换积分与服务、关联评选表彰，是各个项目的共选项，更是自上而下的设计。成都市2019年推出的《成都市志愿服务激励办法（试行）》，是全国首个系统性的志愿服务激励制度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最初，制定者想将教育、就业、落户等与志愿服务挂钩。魏娜坦言，在实际操作层面存在难处，譬如就业面试或考公加分，由于缺少上位制度支撑，很难明确将志愿服务经历与加分程度做具体对应，依据也难以量化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但有部分领域确可定量加分。譬如，在居住证积分统计中，志愿服务有10分分值。 “以前的政策是加到100分就可以入户，参与志愿服务可以加到10分，分值还是很可观的。”她补充道，市文明办有专人负责志愿服务的积分认定，已转为常态化操作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，志愿服务与成都市中小学生的综合素质评价紧密相关。参与“文明兴蓉”志愿项目，平台会自动生成官方证明，作为学校评优评先的参考。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“文明兴蓉”平台上，志愿者们可以通过积分兑换相应权益。刘奕将其戏称为志愿服务方向的“淘宝”，线上的积分商城可以兑换物品、培训和服务。有些社区也会上传激励物品，如一包洗衣粉、一袋米或是家门口的理发卡，“我们实际上是用众筹的概念在做志愿服务的礼遇和帮助”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诞生出“小牛哥·先锋车手”志愿服务队的牛市口街道，打造了自己的积分激励制度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;牛市口街道党群办工作人员刘杰介绍，一积分等于一元钱，可以在积分商城中兑换手机支架、雨披、充电宝等物品，也可选择爱心企业捐赠的优惠券.最受欢迎的兑换物是红旗连锁超市现金券，能够直接用以消费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于金沙遗址博物馆的志愿者们来说，最大的回馈激励是无形的。他们提出的建议，总能得到馆方的支持：邀请环卫工人走进博物馆，陪同近百位视障朋友参观，带着“太阳神鸟”的故事走进社区……这些实践中萌芽的想法，已经成为该博物馆志愿活动的代表项目，令志愿者们颇感骄傲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戢英主导的音频节目“小志话天府”，也是在这样的自主权下诞生的。在节目中，“金沙孃嬢”们会用成都话，讲解第31届世界大学生运动会里的古蜀文明和天府文化，“我们希望通过这档节目，让更多人更深层次地了解成都”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2008年埋下的种子&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;魏娜发现，土壤已然培厚，做志愿活动逐渐成为成都人的一种生活方式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年国庆假期，一名志愿服务处的工作人员带着儿子去环城绿道骑行。在到达武侯区交子百业路段时，他们看到，志愿者们正忙得不亦乐乎。 16岁的儿子停了下来，就地报名，在驿站做了两个小时的志愿者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她的父母也已自发加入社区的老年志愿者协会。协会群中经常发布各项志愿服务，父亲会参与合唱节目，为居民们庆祝节日；母亲则会在每周参与巡河，跟同个单元的朋友一起散步，查看是否有禁渔期垂钓问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，两位老人为了帮忙带孩子，来到这座陌生的城市。通过参与社区的志愿服务活动，他们认识了周边老年人，有了自己的社交圈。目前已卖掉老家的房子，选择定居在成都。她莞尔道，“因为他们非常热爱这个城市，定居以后对社区活动也很积极，真的是超级骨干。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在魏娜看来，成都人骨子里带有很强的公益情怀：“发生地震的2008年，实际上也可以称为成都志愿服务的元年。当年我们是大灾发生的地方，有来自全球的NGO，还有很多志愿者来帮助我们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对公益人徐珍来说，那颗做志愿者的种子就是在2008年埋下的。当时，全世界很多救援队、志愿者涌入四川，那些援助之手给她留下了深刻印象。四五年后，她读大学时，就一心想要加入学校的志愿者协会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，作为云公益“歌是最甜的药”项目负责人，她带着志愿者服务“天线宝宝”已有近七年时间。第一次见到这些重度脊柱畸形患者时，他们头部和腰部分别套着一个钢环，由4根高过头顶的支撑杆连接固定，这样的身体状况给了徐珍一种非常强烈的直观impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平时，志愿者会带着病人做发声练习，吐气打节奏，嘴上发出“嘶嘶”声，以此锻炼气息。这是医治过程中的一环，由医院骨科主任下单定制。从入院到出院，“天线宝宝”平均会长高20厘米，迎来新生。看到群中有人备注改为“出院”的时候，徐珍尤感欣慰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更多的志愿种子，在成都志愿者网开展的“每周一小时”项目中被不断埋下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每周一小时”项目组组长谢红介绍，他们倡导市民每周至少参加1小时志愿服务。项目开展4年间，线上线下活动超170余场，参与志愿者逾8万，服务人次超过500万。在成都大运会时，鼓励市民上传文明观赛的瞬间，大运会结束后，又面向小朋友发起微故事征集。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对她来说，“每周一小时”是带有习惯养成任务的，因而尽量降低志愿服务的参与门槛，增加参与人数及覆盖范围。正在大力推进的“随手拍”活动，在全市任何地点均可参与。只要拍下文明行为，上传五次就能获得电子证书、志愿服务时长与积分。 “最终的目的都是激发我们市民对志愿服务的认同，对城市友善氛围的认同，并且愿意为这座城市的文明与友善去出一份力。”刘奕说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“双向奔赴”的微观治理&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在这座志愿者之城，志愿者服务他人，也被服务着。这种“双向奔赴”已是一种微观上的城市公共治理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;锦江区宏济新路上，一处显眼的院落挂着牌子“小牛哥·刹一脚”。这里是24小时不打烊的爱心驿站，是快递、外卖、网约车司机等新就业群体的休息地。 “小牛哥”项目负责人高林雅说，像这样的站点全锦江区已有35个。从补水、充电，到心理咨询、劳动安全保护、就业指导服务、职业技能培训、举行联谊义诊等，都是驿站的可选项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在前期的需求调研中，“小牛哥”团队发现，快递员、外卖员最需要的是充电服务，因而专门协调了一家公司，在驿站对面的小区门口设置了六组充电柜。 “&#39;小牛哥&#39;从一开始就不仅仅是服务好这些群体，也是要引导他们参与社会服务，形成一个双向服务的闭环逻辑。”高林雅说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73773&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;“小牛哥·刹一脚”驿站。南方周末记者高伊琛摄&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样在激发市民参与城市治理主动性的，还有成都市城乡社区发展治理促进会秘书长张海波。他联合高校和社区，由大学生自主推出精细化志愿服务，社区列出需求，相应专业的同学提供专业的服务。 “让学生们在志愿服务开展过程中，去看到自己学科的价值，便于后续的人生规划。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，激发范围逐渐扩大。张海波搭建了青年志愿服务创新实验室，以问题为导向去组织服务项目。张海波印象很深的是，2023年暑假开展的留守儿童防手机沉迷“破困行动”，大学生志愿者们还邀请成都AG电竞战队的选手，与小朋友组队打游戏，“我们当时的想法是，打服了再说。”他笑道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的微观治理发生在城市的各个角落。 Takeaway riders walk through the streets and lanes, and they are actively uploading social governance clues during the delivery.高林雅介绍，治理线索分为事故应急、公共设施损坏等八类，街道有专人负责对线索进行审核和处置，将问题反馈到基层对应的科室，无法解决会继续上报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于一些力所能及的事情，志愿者们被鼓励“自己发现自己解决”，主动参与基层治理服务。 It is equivalent to getting the points of the shared bicycles to make the problem, which is equivalent to obtaining two clues.项目运营两年多的时间，后台注册总人数为500余人，收集到的社会治理线索3000余条。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们这一帮人，有些可能觉得不好意思去做（志愿）。有了鼓励和推动，做完之后还有额外奖励，积极性就起来了。最终是要全民参与到里面来的。”快递员唐建感叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[社区营造师：“我们在链接中产生价值”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261509]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 10:57:51&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73775&quot;

&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是第四届“城视·成画”成华区社区规划设计节的系列项目之一。杨迎琦向参赛的社区党委书记解释，渐进参与式规划是通过不断地尝试和纠错，让一个社区逐步走向更好的方向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为一名社区营造师，这是“95后”杨迎琦从业的第五个年头。在社区公共治理氛围活跃的成都，像她这样的“职业选手”不在少数，他们负责制定社区行动方案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在杨迎琦看来，社区营造师更像是社区的陪伴者与深耕者，“是为了一个地方的团结和发展去做最公平考虑的人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨迎琦陪伴参赛队伍完成整个过程。从前期的书记决策能力培养，到书记带着骨干进行圆桌讨论，再到骨干号召居民做参与式讨论与投票，选出社区议题。然后再进行双向盲选，匹配志愿设计师团队。 “所有都控制在小体量，10万块，但是我们要解决社区的一个问题或矛盾，或让社区有一个点可以发光。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对杨迎琦来说，落地执行方案和比赛结果并不是最重要的。更为重要的是，在参与过程中改变人们对社区的认知，激发社区居民的公共治理热情，“基层治理最应该去被看到”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;参赛选手之一、双林社区党委副书记朱湘灵印象尤深。在那一周的圆桌讨论阶段，几乎每天都有会，参加的约有100人，大部分是居民，还有社区营造师、规划师、网格员、社区和街道办工作人员。 “以前我们不知道怎么去撬动各种资源，好像大家觉得这是跨界的事情，它实际上不是。大家有一个共同的目标，就想让这个环境变好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;按照解决问题的可能性排序，“墙面争夺”就在此时走进参与者的视线。修车的蒋师傅长期占据社区一处公共空间。朱湘灵说，像蒋师傅这样的情况，整个社区还分布着许多，他们提供个性化服务，在公共矛盾中生存。不过，居民们否定了取缔这一方式。 “人家在这边二三十年，手艺又好，提供了很好的服务，为什么要取缔人家？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们开始思考，两者能不能共生？ “共享墙面”的提法因而生出，又逐渐丰满。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨迎琦很欣赏双林社区有温度和柔性的处理方式，为了解决一个社区矛盾，没有再形成新的矛盾。努力生活的修车师傅依旧能够保有生计，也能为社区居民提供服务，将梯子、榔头、钳子等工具共享，“通过一个装置，去点亮社区区域的高点”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;朱湘灵也对杨迎琦的团队印象深刻。在赛事之初的接触中，朱湘灵观察到，这支队伍跑遍整个成华区走访调研。她回忆，这个小姑娘还带着书记们，“特种兵式”走访了此前团队营造过的人宠友好社区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是杨迎琦带着团队扎根成都的重要项目，也是她“对于成都整个有信心的原因”。三年前，这个项目落地蓓蕾社区，她与社区负责人第一次见面聊到夜里11点，决定马上合作。杨迎琦觉得，这一社区的管理者包容、有感召力，也愿意不断引入青年力量。 “我觉得这是社区书记最需要的能量，我将它叫做内生力”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她喜欢蓓蕾社区，临街是商铺，上面住居民，商铺提供着整个社区的服务，物价便宜，生活惬意，没有超大的高架桥，也没有超宽的公路，有着更适合城市居民的支配尺度。她愿意回到这样的地方，将新活力注入到老城区中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在蓓蕾社区，针对比较集中的人狗矛盾，杨迎琦团队帮助制定了人宠友好公约，完成社区爱宠社群搭建。社群自发运转，已不再需要协调与引导。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两个月前，她在为一处村庄筹建篮球场，资金不够。奇妙的事情发生了：人宠友好社区的朋友们得知此事，带着小朋友在街头募捐。社区中的商家还特意贡献了自家商品，作为募捐的回馈礼物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她感叹：“如果在基层治理中，我们让人与人产生了价值认同，凝结成一些力量的时候，他们是可以帮助到其它地方的人，这个善会不断地扩大和发光。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时针再往前拨五年，这位自小便随家人迁来成都的新成都人，带着公益行业的无力感，选择了这一职业。她想在城市社区中重新找到人与人的链接。在她的理解中，“社区”并不是行政区划，也不是社群概念，它意味着共同体，“我们在链接中去产生价值，我们有共同的目标，一起达成这个目标，可以实现自我认同” . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以在每个项目初期，杨迎琦都在寻找这种链接，寻找这个地方的共同体，探索到社群的真正需求。在南方一地，曾有项目是用70万元进行村民庭院改造。在杨团队接手之前，已有五套院子被改造过，设计师直接入场，没有协商和尊重，效果适得其反，业主很不满意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨迎琦接手后，她告诉村民，不能够无偿获得装修基金，需要付出2000元，是支付给青年设计师的费用。她要求每一位户主参与到整个建设过程中，设计师与户主同吃同住15天。她还要求各家降低庭院围墙高度，尽量透明化。 “整个村庄没有高墙林立的闭塞，也不是小家小户的模样，它将整个社区形成了一个大家庭的概念。”这一共同缔造模式，在2021年得到联合国人居署亚太办事处颁布的“2021亚洲都市景观奖”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的营造理念一直贯穿至今。在这次的成华区渐进参与式规划行动中，核心主题是社区动力，它离不开“社区培力”与“社区生长力”。杨迎琦所说的“社区培力”，是将“自下而上”与“自上而下”相互搭配，当社区能力尚且不足时，适当纳入外力协助，当其具备一定的能力后，外力不过度介入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出于兴趣，朱湘灵也参加过社区营造师的培训课程。在她的理解中，“营造”的关键一步是挖掘出社区居民的主人翁意识：“我认为社区营造应该是多元主体参与，对某个公共问题达成共识，众筹更多资源去解决相应问题，解决后还要给它赋能，最终推动人和环境的双向改变，它不仅仅是硬件的改变，而是人人也有改变。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;杨闯世在共享菜园内。受访者供图&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在成都市双流区彭镇，这是一处很容易被错过的庄园。公路一侧，一段砂石路引向几根细瘦木桩搭起的大门，木桩下挂着牌子，“蜀阅耕读园”。园中，白色的小屋上盖着稻草，篱笆分割着小块的菜地，菜地一旁，还立着用木头搭成的简易棚子，写着书法的白色布匹从棚顶垂下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10月10日下午3点多，天气阴沉，耕读园的创始人杨闯世正蹲在田间，徒手给菜地捉虫子。他说，如今他园子里的菜不打农药，有时得人力捉虫，精准打击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年是杨闯世进军农业的第五年。这一年，他在双流区租来的土地上，开出一片三十亩的小庄园，将其命名为蜀阅耕读园。人们付费成为会员后，就能认领园中的小块土地，自种或委托园方种植蔬菜、稻米，收获农作物，参与庄园共建，也能共享园中农具、茶具、炊具等设备。 Yang Chuangshi called him a shared vegetable garden. In Chengdu, where the culture was prosperous, he was naturally a shared vegetable garden manager. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;与28岁的杨闯世相见的第一面，很难把他与农业联系在一起。他脸廓方正，戴着眼镜，衣着干净，显得斯文，并没有老农酱油色的皮肤与脸上深深的沟壑。不过，只要与他说上几句话，就很容易察觉出他对田地的热情。论起灭虫、除草，他都头头是道，有不少老农才懂的土方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他是见过世面的农门之后。在云南芒市老家，从他两岁开始，父母种了二十年的甘蔗。长大后，杨闯世走出边境小城，四处漂泊。 2014年，漂到上海一年的他自觉买房定居无望，忽然想起父亲曾在成都当过兵，又在网上搜索到“天府之国”“熊猫文化”的介绍，于是买下去成都的火车票。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;来到成都，杨闯世一面读自考本科，一面做生意。 2015年开始，他先后做了人力资源公司与APP开发。后来，APP被收购，他发了一笔财，也在成都安了家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;生活突然闲了下来。杨闯世花了大半年时间思索，接下来要做些什么。全国范围内考察了一番后，2018年5月，他下定决心——国家倡导乡村振兴，农业值得尝试。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不少朋友劝他，干农业风险大。杨闯世也深知，初入一行不能毫无准备地押上全部身家。借着过去做APP的团队，他先干起了给大型农庄、农业公司及农旅项目开发软件的活，三十多个项目跟下来，他把全流程摸了个透。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2020年，杨闯世决定做自己的农场。他把地点选在了成都市下辖的彭州市，租下几十亩地，主营蔬菜的“订单农业”。客户一年支付一万元成为会员后，每年都能收到400斤的有机蔬菜盲盒，品类随季节而定，葱、蒜、青菜，五花八门。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;靠自媒体做宣传推广，杨闯世很快招来第一批大约20名客户，这个带有实验性质的1.0版本庄园运转起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;有机农业的艰难超乎想象。 Vegetables such as corn and lotus white are easy to grow worms and need to grasp manpower; vegetables cannot be used, and they must be artificially plucking.活&lt;ins cite=&quot;mailto:Hu&quot; datetime=&quot;2023-11-28T07:18&quot;>;儿&lt;/ins>;一个人是干不完的，而雇工一人一天就要200元。他的开支里，几乎有一半都花在了人力上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;几十亩地所能供养的客户数量有限，一旦超额，就得另外开辟田地，额外雇人，如此成本过高。两年后，杨闯世在温江区另外租了130亩地。这一次，他做起了共享菜园——每人付费认领几十平方米的田地，或自种，或托管，主打田园体验，不保证产量。这样大大降低了人力成本，也吸引了更多真正喜爱田园生活的客户。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;客户数量慢慢涨起来，杨闯世又遇上了创业者常见的难题——与合伙人的合作出现障碍。他又一次转移阵地，但依然没离开成都。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这是因为蜀地不仅气候适宜，而且物流、交通便捷。他告诉南方周末记者，老家的土地租金要便宜得多，但交通不便，运输耗时长，而共享菜园强调把菜从田间直接送到碗里。在彭镇，即便是最高温的夏季，收获了的蔬菜加冰块放进泡沫箱里，几个小时就能送到成都市区，味道还和田里刚摘时差不多。庄园附近还有好几个大的物流中心，他买大件物品运输颇为方便。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年6月，耕读园正式开工。原址上曾经办过工厂，两三个月里，杨闯世与另外3个合伙人把土地修整得适宜耕种。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;开荒结束，陆陆续续有三百人认领了土地。杨闯世说，认领者大都是成都的中产，一年支付999元，便能换得最小的一块地——15平方米，种子、农具、水电由庄园提供，他们在上面自耕自种。人们认领的理由不一而足，杨闯世记得，曾有孕妇偏爱有机食品，吃鸡蛋都只吃土鸡蛋，而庄园不用农药、化肥，全靠落叶、杂草、鸡粪堆肥。认领者能种出自然熟成的番茄，略带酸味，也能收获农家肥养成、不催熟的莴笋，只有市面上的三分之一粗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;也有父母厌倦如今“五谷不分”的教育，也想逃离围着麻将、抱着手机平板玩的休息日。他们会选个周末或假期，带着孩子到庄园来干上几个小时的农活。春种茄子，清明后种南瓜，中秋种豌豆，十月种大蒜，四季轮替。平日里认领者们不在，杨闯世与雇工会帮忙除草捉虫，剩下的，就交给天。天公有时也不作美，2023年的秋季，天降大雨，把菜园泡了，水稻减产三分之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;更重要的，则是一种心境。杨闯世觉得，自己过去开发软件，整日话也不说，脸也不洗，压抑至极，还一度胆固醇高，血红蛋白低。后来，在庄园里喝茶种菜，他压抑的内心一下得到了释放，体检各项指标也都回归正常。他也记得，有一位客户过去常常失眠，认领菜地后，哪怕有蚊虫叮咬，他也常常下午到庄园里干会儿活，失眠很快离他而去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;客户越来越多，也让杨闯世有了一种回到年幼时农村的感觉。大家不但彼此帮忙干活，有时带些老家特产的香肠、腊肉分享，有时也邀约一道野炊，“非常和谐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在“耕”的基础上，庄园渐渐加上“读”的元素。杨闯世请来专做国学教育的书院，尝试将传统文化课程融入农业之中。有孩子来种水稻，便能在田边开课，讲述《诗经》中描绘水稻的诗句；他们也曾做过传统的扎染，把植物的叶子与花用布包起来，用榔头敲，慢慢地，颜色就留在了上面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今，杨闯世已经开始设想把自己的共享菜园模式复制到全国去。不过，在那之前，他还有一件小事要做。菜地不远处，还有一小片白篱笆围起来的地，里面稀疏地种着一小丛月季。杨闯世说，那是一片清不干净建渣的土地，只能用月季加以改造。这一季月季枯萎后，他计划种上豌豆。到明年，他确信，这片地上的蔬菜会长得很好。 &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[酒体设计师：与酒共舞的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 10:58:02&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73695&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;简何在做酒体Design work.受访者供图&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;入行第11年，简何在成都找到了自己人生的那一杯陈年佳酿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11年前，简何的职业还没有官方名称，行业内将之称为勾调师。 Simply put, he needs a glass of white wine one by one, and 40 glasses of wine is his lowest cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是简何把握白酒行业命门的秘诀之一，如此方能保持对白酒的感知敏锐度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月23日，四川省酿酒研究所成都办公室的一张木桌上，摆放着三排盛着白酒的玻璃瓶，它们如同化学试剂瓶一般，被贴上Label. “馥郁香型……陈香、窖香、曲香、蜜香、焙烤香、芳草香……绵甜细腻、醇厚丰满”，其中一瓶的标签如此写道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这都是简何还在做学徒时的教具。他必须把自己变成白酒资料库，脑中储存千百种白酒的香气与风格类型，并学会品评个中优劣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在大多数饮料都能用“科技与狠活”调制的今天，白酒背后还是个设备与数据分析无法完全穿透的复杂香气世界。仅按设备测定出的物质组分及含量调制的白酒，味道远不能令人满意。 The &quot;design&quot; of liquor, relying on the light of Jian He and his peers, tongue, tongue and incense memory in the brain, determine the ratio between the original wine and the seasoning wine, and &quot;flash rotation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年，人社部发布的第四批新职业目录赋予简何的职业以官方名称——酒体设计师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简何与这个职业缘分颇深。三十多年前，他的父亲就在四川一家酒厂担任技术负责人，他则在厂子的窖池旁长大。尽管他的第一份职业是在汽车行业，但他还是无法舍弃对白酒的热爱。 2012年，他抱着全方位学习白酒的念头，进入四川省酿酒研究所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究所在四川广汉有占地20亩的科研基地，简何的第一桩差事，是管基地的库房。技术研发中心调制好的白酒小样，会在库房放样生产几十上百吨，做灌装销售前最后的微调，这被称为“放大样”。连学徒都还算不上的简何，就在库房里品尝调好的样品，进而反推设计师们的配比方案与设计理念，“这个酒加多少斤，调味酒怎么加，我就自己尝。不懂了，我就会到技术研发中心去跟他们交流”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年，简何通过考核，进入研发中心。在这个师傅带徒弟传统明显的行当，一群刚进来的年轻人拜在主管技术的副所长门下，开始学习。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个在大脑中组装一座白酒资料库的过程。最初，老师傅们只会告诉学徒各类原酒的特点，调配一款样品，最后得靠学徒去试样、去体味。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简何说，如今设备分析已经能检测出白酒中几乎所有的风味成分。人们知道，是酿造过程中生成的醇类、酯类、酸类、醛类、酚类等物质的共舞奉献了白酒的复杂味道，但还不能将物质的种类、含量及比例关系与白酒的感官指标对应起来。多数时候，学徒们更需要调用的，是五感与大脑。一杯白酒，学徒闻过、品尝后，需要记住它的香气、口感和风格。最好的办法是在自己熟悉的味道中寻找近似的，并以此为其命名。味近香蕉，便记成香蕉香，似菠萝，便是菠萝香。先记单一香气，再慢慢记忆调制后白酒的复合香气，如同登阶，拾级而上，直到资料库渐趋成型。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过考核后，简何成为一名酒体设计师。此后7年，他的工作大多是为酒厂提供各类技术服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;需要做酒体设计的，多是中小厂家。简何说，接受酒体设计委托前，设计师们需要做调研。如果客户是不熟悉的酒厂，他会按价格从低到高的顺序购买一些客户的产品，在研究所内部进行品评。熟悉的酒厂，则可直接让对方邮寄酒样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;调研结束，一切就交给设计师的灵感。他们会调取脑中的白酒香气记忆，辅以理化分析手段，确定理想的香型、香气、口感、风格，一面品尝、勾兑样品，一面调整原酒、调味酒比例，逐渐逼近预想的味道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这有如在黑暗中泅渡，彼岸很近，也很远。简何记得，自己曾在2021年为一家大酒厂设计过一款五粮香型的酒。当时，他的思路是突出粮香、陈香与醇厚感。但在前8天，他始终达不到效果。各类白酒无论怎么勾调、组合，要么香气到了，口感上不行，要么反之。越调，心里还越没底，“觉得可能是不是太劳累了，鼻子、舌头灵敏度下降了”，继而人也变得烦躁。理想的香气已经模模糊糊地在脑子里了，就差一点点，却始终够不到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到第12天，简何与几个设计人员碰了一次头，有人说起自己过去调酒时调出的香气。他灵光一闪，把提到的香气加入，终告功成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;酒体设计师不能止步于酒体设计，还要懂得白酒生产的全产业链条。简何说，他们虽然不直接参与诸如原料筛选、酿造等工序，却会对它们产生深刻影响。设计师发觉酿造出来的酒有杂味，便要找出是原料出了问题，还是某个时段内温度、酸度、淀粉含量不对。在他们查看记录、确定原因后，厂家方能对选粮与酿造等工艺进行优化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据川观新闻，2021年，仅在四川就已经有10万酒体设计相关从业者。也是在那年，简何被调回阔别已久的成都。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成都显然是他的机遇之城。简何曾作为主研人员参与两项研究，一项是浓香型白酒丢糟黄水制曲工艺研发与应用，另一项则是浓香型白酒丢糟生产食用菌技术体系开发与应用。它们在成都结果，通过了省级科技转化成果评审。与此同时，疫情过去后，成都也举办了一系列高规格的酒体设计比赛。简何发觉，这样规格的比赛在行业内均属首次，他在一些比赛中也有所斩获。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为多年积累了贯穿全链条的技术经验，简何也被更多地要求开拓新市场。有客户希望他们推荐川内优质原酒，也曾有做钢材的人想带资进军白酒行业，找研究所寻求方案，简何与同事们得把所有事宜包圆。建厂最好选在四川白酒五大产区；定了产区，就得测定哪里的水源与微生物最好；如果做浓香型白酒，得盯着窖泥与微生物的培养；做酱香酒，布局就十分重要，高温堆积的工艺，需要足够大的场地用于堆放蒸好的粮食与曲料……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;做这样的活儿，成都无疑是最佳的地点。一方面，外省客户来川，成都是最便利的落脚点。此外，客户需要他兼顾五大产区，而成都与五大产区距离适中，有着最广的辐射。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他对成都也有一种别样的感情。这座城市几乎是与他一同成长起来的。 2007年刚来时，成都三环路周围还有很多田地，自己还是个学生。如今，成都有了高新区与天府新区，有了第二绕城高速，他也成了资深酒体设计师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还在广汉时，简何就把家安在成都，但与家人聚少离多。回到成都，他下班后步行10分钟就能接孩子回家。这些年，还有不少建筑、销售行业的朋友也回到成都创业。 “成都是我的福地。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黄仕忠丨人生真味几悲欢：忆蔡义江老师]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261477]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p>;此后数年，蔡老师采纳了多方建议和意见，又作了很大的增删修改，1979年10月由北京出版社正式出版，署回个人名字“蔡义江”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《红楼梦》在当代中国有着特别的地位。 In the Cultural Revolution, it is one of the few classic masterpieces that are still allowed to read. However, it is not easy to read this book. A large number of poetry and poetry are very embarrassed.那时有很多单位组织人马做注解，蔡老师以古典诗词的造诣来注解小说中的韵文，自是轻车熟路，这部书也从一众注本中脱颖而出，并由此确立他在红学研究界的status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1978年，他被借调北京，参与筹创《红楼梦学刊》和组建“红楼梦学会”。并连续几年在《杭大学报》上发表论文，仅1979年就连发了三篇，此外还有众多有影响的论文，散见于《社会科学战线》《文史哲》《文艺研究》等知名publication.当时“文革”刚结束，许多中青年学者尚未窥得学术门径，他已大踏步前行了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，木秀于林，风必摧之。 His nature is bold, informal, and identifying this, so he will never return, and even again, and then the three places are on the cusp of the wind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

data-key=&quot;259877&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;蔡竹屏先生（1904-1982）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其尊人蔡竹屏先生，22岁加入国民党，24岁任国民革命军总司令部准尉书记。后在26军第6师司令部任书记及政训处科长，参加过北伐。 1932年赴杭州，任中央航空学校秘书&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（名誉校长蒋介石）&lt;/span>;。 1936年赴南京，任中央航空委员会秘书&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（秘书长宋美龄）&lt;/span>;。 1938年转民政，先后任浙江温岭、黄岩、余姚等县县长，组织队伍抗日，与左派人士有所接触，与国民党则渐生嫌隙。 1945年5月，登报声明脱离国民党；6月被国民政府逮捕，羁押于丽水监狱。次年冬出狱，赴上海华生电器厂任职，兼任宁波《时事公报》名誉主笔，撰写时评，抨击国民党的腐败。 1949年初，创办《宁波晨报》，4月，时在奉化休养的蒋介石，阅其社论而震怒，亲自下令查封。新中国成立后，仍在上海工作。 1951年6月，在“镇反”运动中被捕，羁管于上海提篮桥监狱，后移余姚县看守所。尽管他早就与国民党分道扬镳，但之前与蒋政权关系密切，遂难脱嫌疑。 1952、1953年，两次内部宣布无罪释放，均因被人阻拦而未成。 1953年夏，病危，入院救治；冬，中共华东局调查人员认为应恢复其自由；年底，余姚法院的审判员说：“现在还未找到你的罪恶，先判五年；继续寻找罪恶。”之后，“因病保外执行”。 1956年，由派出所宣布服刑期满，但无判决书。 1957年夏赴杭疗养，通过次子蔡义江结识夏承焘，夏翁推荐其为浙江人民出版社编《陆放翁诗词选注》。此后颇致力于古典文学研究，但“文革”中存稿多被抄走。 1982年1月任宁波市第七届政协委员，2月去世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父辈的基因和履历，往往在冥冥之中影响着孩子未来的命运。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻气盛的蔡义江一直想不通：父亲在解放战争期间，冒着坐牢杀头的危险，办报刊、写文章，揭露国民党腐败黑暗，为何却在光明来临之际，反而身陷囹圄？因闻知父亲在看守所遇到一些不平之事，他居然写了一封告状信投寄《浙江日报》。 1954年夏天，蔡义江以年级第一的成绩留校任助教，兼任教师团支部宣教委员。不久，校方收到余姚县看守所的公函，认为“蔡义江完全丧失了一名青年团员应有的革命立场，建议给予严肃的教育处分”。于是，刚刚获得学校“优秀团员”称号的蔡义江受到了“严重警告”，其父也因“泄露看守所机密”，不许减刑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1958年，大学入学政审要求转严，蔡竹屏的情况影响到子女升学，书生意气的蔡义江再度告状，称其父“遭人报复而陷冤狱，多年不给判决”。党总支组织全系教师批判其“站在反动立场，为其父一再翻案”；团支部讨论开除其团籍。在支部处分决定的书面报告上，蔡义江不得不签了字，但他依然认为“既然未作判决，也就称不上翻案”。随后被下放萧山欢潭农村“劳动锻炼”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事让蔡义江在政治上受到歧视，他本人犹可接受，但“文革”结束，恢复高考时，却又对下一代的升学产生了“消极影响”。于是为父平反，再度成为蔡义江老师的心结。时在三中全会以后，平反“冤假错案”，“右派”大都已改正，但“镇反”时的案子，一般不作复查，除非是民主党派省委委员以上的重点统战对象，才能提出要求。为此他申请加入了“民革”，不久便增补为民革省委委员，然后与兄弟姐妹联名上书为父申冤。他也想好了：万一有什么责任要承担，就声明是自己个人的行为。幸好诸事顺遂，不久，余姚县法院对蔡竹屏&quot;镇反&quot;期间的错案作了平反。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/3243b56d2c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1376&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/3243b56d2c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259878&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;蔡义江先生在其父墓前。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蔡老师随即向组织汇报了情况，要求撤销对他的两次严重警告和开除团籍的处分。一周后，总支秘书说：“档案里找不到任何受处分的记录或材料。既然没有受过处分，现在怎么能撤销呢？”蔡老师只好笑笑说：“既然没有，那就算了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;令人啼笑皆非的是，就在蔡老师一门心思想着上书为父亲平反之时，有人同样用上书的方式给他上了一课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1981年下半年，他招收的首届研究生即将毕业，但分配过程拖得有些长。有学生为了留校，通过校领导与系领导作出“定向安排”，引起古代文学教研室的反感，遂集体决定“不留一人”。该生颇觉不平，匿名写信给报社，谤称蔡义江在1980年发表的某篇论文剽窃了某位研究生的成果，此事上了《光明日报》的“内参”。对于为人清高的蔡老师，犹如当头一棒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我完全不相信蔡老师会做这样的事情，但人言可畏。 Vaguely heard that the reporter claimed to be uneasy as his classmates, and sent &quot;internal reference&quot; through the alumni of the newspaper, the purpose was to make Teacher Cai embarrassed.那届研究生入学时的年龄大都超过了三十岁，刚经历过“文革”，对这类操作早已驾轻就熟。当时中文系也有意借此整肃风纪，所以一时很有些风声鹤唳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我后来读到郭在贻老师在1977年11月写给其兄郭连贻的信，说到《杭大学报》编辑部原拟连发他的两篇论文，他怕招致物议，要求把另一篇推迟到次年。他写道：“中文系乃是非之地，有些人从来不写文章，也写不出文章，却害怕人家写文章，此辈又有手段，不好对罪&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（原文如此，当系“得罪”之误）&lt;/span>;的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此看来，蔡老师一年内在《杭大学报》连发三文，别人未必没有看法。我还曾听得有人议论：《红楼梦诗词曲赋评注》一书，既然“组织专人讨论”，则别人也有功劳，如今却全部归于一人，遂使某人独得大名云云。虽然蔡老师在《后记》里将编写过程与他人的劳绩说得十分清楚，但有人偏要这么想，既是“传言”，便是要让你百口莫辩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在读研期间，我明显感到蔡老师有了不同，不再像以前给本科生上课那样放得开了。他给我们研究生上了三次课，都是规规矩矩讲完，内容翔实，却再没了以往的激情。也可能是我先入为主的印象，总觉得他有意避免与研究生接触，有“惹不起躲得起”的味道，这让我心里隐隐作痛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来才知蔡老师因遭谤，曾婉拒招生，系里让他与吴熊和老师合带，暂作安抚，所招两名研究生，最初未确定导师为谁，蔡老师似乎也有意疏离学生。我们这届之后，他未再招生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1985年7月，我毕业留校。冬日，一次系教师会议传达《光明日报》“内参”，为数年前诬告蔡义江窃取学生成果一事平了反。 “内参”说：蔡义江同志投寄的稿子，在文后原有“附识”，说明由学生某某代查了资料，但刊物在登载时觉得无须多此一举，也是限于版面，就将这“附识”删去了。 ——谁知道这一删，竟然酝成一桩“师德”事件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时，为了说明情况，曾请该届研究生李梦生书面记述事件经过。 30年后，李梦生的“情况说明”和给蔡老师的两封书信，流传到了孔夫子网上&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2012年6月19日）&lt;/span>;。李梦生写到，蔡老师曾去学生寝室，谈及对此论题的想法，叹息没时间查核资料，当时有几位同学在场，后来他指导的一位研究生承担了查阅资料一事。论文写成发表了，因“识语”被编辑部删去，蔡老师觉得有些抱歉，收到稿费时，再三说要分给学生一半，也曾请李梦生转达此意，但那位门生说，给老师查点资料，是学生的本分，坚辞不受。这般谦让再三，使该届研究生皆有知闻，导致被有心人利用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可是，纵然澄清了事实，获得了“平反”，但伤疤犹在，内心的郁闷无从排解。既是“内参”，传达对象也只限于本系教师，可以想见，他无法向所有曾听闻过传言的人一一去作解释。这一谤书事件直接影响到了他的学术研究，我观察此后他的发文情况：1982年至1984年虽有发表，但多是之前投稿，或是鉴赏性短文；1985、1986两年，则几乎没再发文章。蔡老师自言从父亲去世&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1982年2月）&lt;/span>;之后，除偶有应酬外再未作诗，事实上这与他遭谤的时间也是重合的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1986年前后，中共中央组织部从各地抽调有学术声望又正当盛年的学者到各民主党派中央机关任职，蔡义江教授也在选调之列。蔡老师加入民革，本属偶然，但他的能力与影响，让他成为选调对象。蔡老师因胸中垒块未消，也有意改换环境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我那时已经到中山大学读博。听闻蔡老师奉调赴京后，出任民革中央常委、宣传部部长，主持创办团结出版社和《团结》杂志社，任社长、总编辑，此后担任过多届全国人大代表、全国政协委员.在新的环境中，蔡老师重新恢复了活力，撰写了不少论文，出版了《辛弃疾年谱》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1987，与蔡国黄合作）&lt;/span>;、《论红楼梦佚稿》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1989）&lt;/span>;等著作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1993年秋，我在北大做访问研究，曾去东皇城根南街84号拜望。蔡老师热情介绍了他最近的红学研究，说是要重新校订《红楼梦》，做法是集众本而取其长，完成一个新的评注本。 ——这部评注本不久后即出版，反响甚好；最近商务印书馆又出了修订版，题《蔡义江新评红楼梦》，系毛边典藏本，颇受读者喜爱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/20fbed5431.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1128&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/20fbed5431.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259879&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;商务印书馆新版《蔡义江新评红楼梦》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我感受到他谈论学术时的兴奋，也察觉到他的一丝落寞。因为离开高校多年，这些只能算是“业余”工作。他的红学研究“独树一帜”，却也意味着连二三“素心人”也难以觅得。他对当时红学界的不良风气甚表气愤，认为“学术文章最恶&#39;三不&#39;作风”，即不顾常识、不择手段和不负责任。为纠正时弊，他连续撰文与人商榷，得罪了不少人。我倒以为大可不必，因为“学术”与“非学术”原本界线分明，但看着老师这般较真，我也不敢多言，只是想起了当时那句流行的话：毕竟是书生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后蔡老师作为红学家依然活跃，但那个才华横溢的古典诗词研究专家却从此消声了。作为一代词宗夏承焘的弟子，他在退休后也出版过《宋词三百首全解》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2007）&lt;/span>;、《宋词精选全解》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2013）&lt;/span>;、《唐宋词鉴赏课》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2020）&lt;/span>;等。另外他当年用力最多的古诗研究，只有一本《宋诗精华录译注》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（1999）&lt;/span>;，是李梦生提议并合作的；另有一本《黄仲则诗选》&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（2011）&lt;/span>;，是当年就与研究生沈开生、李梦生作了筹划，30年后才重新拣起完成的。这些都是普及读物，有些则是同一内容的修订与扩充。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回看蔡老师的学术经历，我发现他们这一代人，几乎不曾有安定时光来打下基础，深研学术。上世纪五十年代的两次告状，让他备受打击，被发配到农场多年。六十年代初，返校不久，便遇到“四清”运动，“社教”还没结束，“文革”已卷地风来。七十年代初，在古代文学作品大都不能阅读和研究的时候，他幸运地在沙漠中觅得一小片绿洲，致力于《红楼梦》中诗词曲赋的校注，发挥了专长，从而在新时期发轫之初走在同侪的前列。谁知晓正当他豪情满怀、欲振翅翱翔的时候，却被一支暗箭射折了翅膀，无奈之中，避地疗伤。虽然公务之余继续耕耘着红学的领地，却荒芜了古典诗词的家园。离开杭大后，他再未招收研究生，更未有机会带博士生，他的衣钵也就未得传人。何况岁月无情，忽忽已臻老境！诸多想法未曾实施，满腹才华也随时光无声流逝。这不仅是他个人独有的哀伤，也是一代人共同的遭际。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;予小子不敏，窃以为蔡老师是性情中人，意气风发，踏浪趁波,但在时代的湍流之中，却不时遇到暗礁，只能在碰撞中被推涌着踉跄前行，其实不曾有真正潇洒的时光。此其命矣乎哉！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行文至此，不禁想起蔡老师的恩师瞿禅老夫子的《鹧鸪天·病中示浙大诸从游》，词云：&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;夜夜匡床听杜鹃。年年归计负江船。当花未信风怀减，临镜先惊骨相寒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;同语笑，亦前缘。人生真味几悲欢。围灯诸友都堪画，好作儿时弟妹看。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夏老慧眼，早已看透世情。为师生，亦前缘。 “人生真味几悲欢”，诚然！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/3ff799782c.jpg&quot;
