Mi Feng, spokesperson of the National Health Commission, said that at present, the National Health Commission, together with the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the State Administration of Disease Control and Prevention, continue to carry out winter respiratory disease monitoring and research and judgment, and are doing a good job in allocating medical resources, optimizing the medical treatment process, and playing a central role. Medical functions and other work are deployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to monitoring, the currently prevalent acute respiratory diseases are all caused by known pathogens and have corresponding mature treatments. No new infectious diseases caused by new viruses or bacteria have been found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The superimposed and high incidence of multiple pathogens makes this wave of respiratory disease infections another major test for the medical system after the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition to continuing to implement and improve the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system and improving the general awareness of primary medical and health institutions, The old problem of long-term shortage of pediatric medical resources, including infection diagnosis and treatment capabilities and severe illness identification and referral efficiency, has once again attracted widespread attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, the General Office of the National Health Commission issued the &quot;Notice on Guiding Primary Medical and Health Institutions to Provide Health Services for Respiratory Diseases in Winter and Spring&quot;, which proposed requirements for pediatric diagnosis and treatment services in primary medical and health institutions. Multiple requirements: Primary medical and health institutions in various places must be fully open to children and must not refuse treatment; general hospitals should strengthen support for primary medical and health institutions; each primary medical and health institution should have at least one general practitioner to complete the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric diseases. For work training, at least two nurses must complete pediatric treatment training to speed up the improvement of grassroots capabilities in carrying out pediatric and respiratory disease diagnosis and treatment in winter and spring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/7vnmI7YsuZVNfWIQF54VZRvqXibOtPiBWFsieCgq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/7vnmI7YsuZVNfWIQF54VZRvqXibOtPiBWFsieCgq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 29, 2023, in Shanghai, many children patients were still queuing up for treatment in the emergency department at Children&#39;s Hospital at night&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Immune gap&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November, the pediatric clinics of various hospitals in Beijing have been full. The waiting time for outpatient and emergency services at Daxing Hospital and Friendship Hospital even reached more than 24 hours. The emergency infusion center of Beijing Children’s Hospital received nearly 2,000 calls. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Jia, a pediatrician at a comprehensive university hospital in Beijing, sees more than 120 patients every day. Even for night emergencies, the number of outpatient and emergency visits is two or three times that of 2019. Due to the large number of patients being treated, the department will rotate a doctor on duty in the ward to support the outpatient department every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond Beijing, the pediatric wards of hospitals in Tianjin, Liaoning, Shanghai, Guangdong and other places are also operating at full capacity. The average daily emergency department attendance at the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital has reached more than 800, exceeding the spring flu peak in Guangzhou in March 2023. The outpatient and emergency departments of Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Hospital are fully booked, and it is common to wait in line for several hours. Dozens of inpatient beds have also been reserved, waiting to be freed up to treat children with pneumonia. But in general, hospitals in Guangzhou are much more relaxed than Beijing. At least in the waiting hall, everyone has a seat and an infusion pole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When influenza is prone to occur every spring and winter, there will be a peak period for consultations in pediatric clinics, but this year’s round of respiratory tract infections lasts particularly long. An Yang, a pediatric resident at a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, has been working intensively for several months. “Since August and September, drug-resistant mycoplasma infections have been present, and they have eased for a while, but B and A have started again. , and may overlap, and the symptoms will be more severe.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ward managed by Anyang is in a saturated state all year round. If a child who needs hospitalization is found, the outpatient and emergency doctors will first ask if there are any children in the ward. There are no beds. If they cannot be vacated temporarily, the doctor will provide emergency infusion and symptomatic treatment. At the same time, it is recommended to consult other hospitals for bed inpatient treatment. In fact, most children who come to the outpatient and emergency department have mild symptoms assessed by doctors and can be treated with oral medications and observe the effects. For children with more severe conditions, intravenous administration may be considered. Anyang and colleagues found that one of the characteristics of this round of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the high rate of drug resistance. &quot;Azithromycin, commonly used in pediatric treatment, is not effective orally, and the intravenous effect is not as good as before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Azithromycin is still used in pediatrics. Azithromycin has been used in pediatrics for a long time, and there is a lot of experience in clinical observation of drug effects and adverse reactions. If quinolones and tetracyclines are abused, the gains may outweigh the losses.&quot; Anyang said, the 2023 edition of &quot;Children&#39;s Guide&quot; issued by the National Health Commission In the &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumonia&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Guidelines&quot;&lt;/span>;), in addition to the macrolide antibiotics represented by azithromycin, New tetracyclines and quinolones have also been recommended, but their side effects have been repeatedly emphasized: new tetracyclines may affect enamel development and cause yellowing of teeth, and are not recommended for children under 8 years old; quinolones may affect cartilage development and increase tendons. Risk of breakage, not recommended for use by children under 18 years of age. &quot;Nowadays, partial drug resistance gene testing of Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be done, and the results can be obtained quickly. However, azithromycin is generally used to observe the efficacy first. If clinical drug resistance is found, the drug resistance gene test will be used to determine whether to use other antibiotics for treatment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Computational biologists at University College London said in a statement to the UK&#39;s Science Media Center that lockdown measures implemented to slow the spread of the new coronavirus have prevented the spread of seasonal pathogens and reduced people&#39;s ability to build immunity to these microorganisms. opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned a similar statement - the new crown epidemic may have caused an immunity gap (immunity gap). During the epidemic, the spread of other viruses and bacteria decreased sharply, which may cause some children to Lack of immune defense against influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses that cause colds. An immune gap is a deficiency in protective immunity caused by chronic low exposure to a specific pathogen, leaving a greater proportion of the population susceptible to the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above statement is still controversial, and Anyang is not convinced. He believes that this is related to the popular microorganism itself. There will be a pandemic year every few years. &quot;Maybe this year&#39;s mycoplasma is special.&quot; What he feels is special is that mycoplasma pneumonia is prone to occur in children aged 5 to 14 years old, but this year people of all ages are infected. He was also suspected of being infected before. He coughed continuously for two or three weeks and took medicine by himself for a week. , using an atomizer. He didn&#39;t have a diagnosis because he didn&#39;t have time to get tested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6q2cRNAHhyMqD2lD8A9CZVYx7gDgjYd1sTxmDwfq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6q2cRNAHhyMqD2lD8A9CZVYx7gDgjYd1sTxmDwfq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260903&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 29, 2023, Children&#39;s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, children and their families waiting outside the clinic&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(South People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Big hospital superstition&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ideally, tertiary hospitals should not be the first choice for pneumonia patients. &quot;Go to the community first.&quot; Hospitals provide oral antibiotics. Some people will recover gradually, but some people will not recover. Then they go to a large hospital and undergo outpatient treatment, and then screen out the severe patients.&quot; However, hierarchical diagnosis and treatment in pediatrics is generally more difficult, and An Yang has almost never seen patients who take antibiotics. Patients who come to see a doctor based on their community hospital visit records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, as long as you follow the guidelines, the medication is almost the same. It depends on whether they can judge the serious condition in time.&quot; As long as the judgment of the serious condition is not delayed, Anyang feels that the treatment in community hospitals is not much different from that in tertiary hospitals. &quot;Severe symptoms are more obvious, such as low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and obvious white lesions on the chest X-ray.&quot; The severe rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is relatively low. In the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Hospital, which is densely populated, patients are transferred to the ICU every day (&lt;span style There are 1 to 2 critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the &quot;big hospital superstition&quot; in pediatrics stems from the reality. Pediatrics are highly dependent on clinical experience, and their diagnosis ideas are very different from those of adults. Parents will trust hospitals with greater patient volume; secondly, large hospitals The medical resources in China are more abundant, but some grassroots hospitals have limited conditions. There are no night clinics, no tests, and no X-rays. &quot;For more complex diseases, the local second-level hospitals will directly recommend them to us.&quot; Anyang said that over time, many people will skip the first- and second-level hospitals and go straight to the third-level hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xiaochun, chief physician of the neonatal surgery department of the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital, believes that parents’ emphasis on their children is also the reason why they choose large hospitals. Not long ago, a friend of Zhu Xiaochun&#39;s child had a high fever. He had already seen the best pediatrician in the local county hospital and called Zhu Xiaochun to consult about his condition. He was still worried and had to drive hundreds of kilometers to the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Center. See a doctor in the hospital. I spent thousands of dollars on metagenomic testing of pathogenic microorganisms (mNGS) and found out that I was infected with a rare mycoplasma. “It actually doesn’t mean much, it’s still a mycoplasma infection. After becoming resistant to azithromycin, I switched to tetracycline and my fever went away.” Some.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, a friend suggested that &quot;the child&#39;s mental state is not good&quot; and he saw the respiratory department and neurology department. The neurologist suggested that he stop taking the medicine for a few days and then consider whether to do anything based on his mental state. lumbar puncture. After my friend stopped taking the medicine for three days, he took his child to Chimelong Paradise and told Zhu Xiaochun that &quot;the child is fine.&quot; Zhu Xiaochun summed it up: &quot;Many times it is the parents&#39; nervousness that causes doctors to passively over-treat. If the doctor doesn&#39;t do this, the parents will blame you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Jie, a pediatric respiratory doctor, encountered Many parents ask for blood tests as soon as they arrive. She opposes excessive testing. If the patient&#39;s symptoms are very typical, she will directly provide empirical treatment to save time. But she also understands the parent&#39;s appeal, &quot;He will feel that he has been queuing for 8 hours and needs to get checked. If he doesn&#39;t do it, he will go back. Queuing for such a long time is a sunk cost. If it were me, I would get a test As a result, I feel confident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Yang found that the biggest feature of this round of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is that &quot;parents are generally anxious&quot;, &quot;I was very anxious before hospitalization, and rushed to be discharged after staying for two days. After a slight improvement, they are asking when they will be discharged from the hospital. The children have to go to school. They have missed classes and mid-term exams. Especially for children who have just entered elementary school or the first grade of junior high school, parents are particularly worried about the long absence from school. If you can’t keep up, it will be difficult to integrate into the class.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the guidelines, the treatment course for pneumonia is 7 to 14 days, but even children who are hospitalized with severe symptoms will not be able to stay for a full course of treatment due to the shortage of hospital beds. . But this does not mean that children can go to school. &quot;In the later stages of (respiratory tract infections) diseases, the airways will be in a more sensitive stage and are easily infected by other bacteria and viruses again.&quot; Regarding this round of infection peak, Anyang In addition to public health common sense such as washing hands frequently and wearing masks, the advice also includes &quot;don&#39;t be so anxious to go to school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0LLECBPfqAVrF3oHxhPdqAFg7vxfhYzrpbcdadqa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0LLECBPfqAVrF3oHxhPdqAFg7vxfhYzrpbcdadqa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260901&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital Panyu Campus, children using atomizers&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is normal for pediatricians to be busy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The continuation of this wave of infections has put direct pressure on pediatricians on duty in outpatient and emergency departments, but for those who have just worked for three years and are still serving as For An Yang, a resident physician, the impact is not big. &quot;The pediatric wards of tertiary hospitals are generally in full working conditions. There are no (empty) beds at any time. Either this disease or that disease, there is always one to be admitted.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyang chose pediatrics for a very practical reason, &quot;My score in the postgraduate entrance examination is not high, so I have to find a major with good employment first.&quot; The shortage of pediatricians is normal, both in large hospitals and primary hospitals. The &quot;2015 China Health Statistics Yearbook&quot; shows that since 2010, the total number of pediatricians in China has dropped from 105,000 to 100,000, with an average of only 0.43 pediatricians per 1,000 children, which is equivalent to the national average of 2.06 physicians per 1,000 people. They are far apart, so the conditions for admissions and employment in pediatrics are more relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the comprehensive appeal of pediatrics is still not strong. It was not until after working that An Yang deeply understood why his brothers and sisters advised everyone not to study pediatrics. For new doctors, there are too many things to learn and memorize in pediatrics. Other doctors only need to be proficient in part of the content, while pediatrics requires further subdivisions. Moreover, children of different ages have different levels of organ growth and development and different physiological characteristics, which leads to poor diagnosis. The indicators and dosages are different. &quot;Many drugs do not have clear dosages for children, and most of them are still used empirically.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyang also needs to learn how to coax children from scratch, &quot;In the beginning, talk to children When interacting with others, it was difficult to behave in a childish way, but it gradually got better. Some children prefer funny voices, so you have to explain the problem to them in a child&#39;s tone.&quot; For children who really can&#39;t listen, you can only When he was crying, An Yang saw a doctor. Now his tolerance for crying has been greatly improved. &quot;I don&#39;t feel it if you make a fuss next to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes the patient&#39;s cooperation will be poor. Directly affects diagnosis and treatment. Anyang would secretly perform liver and spleen palpation while the children were asleep, because when they cried, the entire abdominal wall was hard and &quot;impossible to touch.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children will be given sedatives before doing some more complex examinations, but the examining doctor is unwilling to bear the risk of medication, so Anyang needs to accompany the child with sedatives for examinations - queuing, examination, It takes a lot of time to wait for the results, and there are other children&#39;s problems in the ward that need to be dealt with, so the working hours are extended indefinitely. Anyang only has half a day to one day off every week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the pediatric department where Anyang works, according to the division of work responsibilities, an attending doctor only works with 1-2 resident doctors and has to manage more than a dozen beds. The shortage of staff is obvious, but the hospital has no plans to recruit people and relies entirely on the support of &quot;regular trainees&quot; - medical graduates with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above who are new to medical positions must undergo three years of standardized residency training. The low income of graduates during the training period is the main way for hospitals to alleviate staff shortages at low cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he has not been working for a long time, Anyang has clearly understood that pediatrics cannot bring higher economic benefits to the hospital. &quot;The hospital also has to consider revenue and expenditure, so what incentive does it have to recruit pediatricians?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/XUPRhTDWswffE5pT7YKoHNCSTRRDC2aFVXkulRBE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/XUPRhTDWswffE5pT7YKoHNCSTRRDC2aFVXkulRBE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260902&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Parents and children waiting to be called in the emergency waiting room at the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you can choose, how to choose?&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doctors are trained and hard-working.&quot; Zhu Xiaochun has been in Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital Although he is the chief physician, he is still very busy. On the afternoon of the afternoon when he was interviewed by Southern People Weekly, he read all the patients who came to register, but the interview was still interrupted by patients who wanted to add more patients. A parent took his child to the imaging department after 4 p.m. The imaging department was already doing the finishing work, and the nurse asked him to do the examination again tomorrow. After Zhu Xiaochun heard about it, he called the imaging department to coordinate, &quot;The patient is from out of town. It is not easy to come here. It is a big help if he can help.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually there are 36 patients in a half-day consultation. Zhu Xiaochun could add up to 45 numbers at most. &quot;If you can see it, let others see it.&quot; The registration system was closed at 11:45 in the morning, but he continued to add numbers until 13:30. Patients who could not be registered were not counted. workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics is a &quot;dumb department&quot;. Children cannot accurately describe their physiological conditions, which makes pediatric diagnosis more difficult. Doctors must be experienced and patient. Zhu Xiaochun sees several children with &quot;stomach pain&quot; every time he visits a doctor. The children can&#39;t tell where the pain is, so they just say it hurts everywhere. &quot;You have to find the cause accurately. If it&#39;s a complication from surgery, you have to make a prompt decision.&quot; Otherwise, serious complications may occur. Sometimes there is a lot of reasoning involved in the diagnosis process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A child who complained of stomachache said he was beaten by two classmates. After punching him, Zhu Xiaochun first asked him to check to see if he had injured his internal organs, but no obvious problems were found. After careful questioning, I found that the child had some diarrhea. In the end, other causes were ruled out, and it was basically concluded that the stomachache was caused by diarrhea. &quot;You can&#39;t limit yourself to his words. Sometimes it just happens.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics is periodically overcrowded with consultations every year. Internal medicine is at the peak of seasonal influenza, and surgery is during the summer vacation—every summer, urology is the place to go. Pediatric offices are crowded with surgically circumcised children. As the director of the pediatric surgery department, Zhu Xiaochun needs to balance the work intensity of the department. In 2022, he transferred an attending doctor from the cardiorenal surgery department to support the urology department. This year, he really can&#39;t find anyone. Some doctors want to go to the countryside for free clinics and have to work at the transfer center. The hospital has no new recruits, so he can only wait for himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are only more than 8,000 pediatric surgeons in the country.” Zhu Xiaochun said that he believed the main reason was that pediatric treatment was so poor. In late November, he went to a free clinic in the county. The chief surgeon of a hospital said that the pediatric surgeons in his hospital were no longer willing to work. “Surgeries in small hospitals are all on the first floor, and the breast surgery is next to the pediatric surgery. Breast surgery is so easy.” , low risk, high performance. If you treat the same number of patients, pediatric surgery will be exhausted. The difference in effort is clear at a glance, but the performance is similar. If you can make a choice, how to choose?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Exploring new Solution&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;pediatrics shortage&quot; has been around for a long time. In 1998, the pediatrics major was eliminated from the undergraduate education of medical schools and replaced by the clinical medicine major. The pediatrics major was not subdivided until the graduate level. In 1999, undergraduate enrollment in pediatrics was suspended nationwide, and it was not resumed until 2016, when the “universal two-child” policy was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the National Health Commission issued an implementation plan for the implementation of the 2021-2030 Outline for the Development of Women and Children in China. The plan points out that by 2030, there will be 1.12 pediatric practicing (assistant) doctors per 1,000 children, and the number of beds will increase to 3.17. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A doctor interviewed believes that in order to attract more people to choose pediatrics, the scores for the postgraduate entrance examination and practicing physician examination have been lowered. The hospital’s recruitment conditions for pediatric medical staff are also looser than those for adult departments, but in fact The effect is not good, and there is still a shortage of people in pediatrics because the crux of the problem has not been solved. “If departments like pediatrics and emergency departments, which are tired, hard-working and have little money, want to attract talents and reverse the talent gap, the most direct stimulus is to increase the investment of resources in the department and increase the income of the medical staff in the department. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the “pediatric shortage”, the promotion of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment is particularly important to alleviate the “difficulty in pediatric medical care”. In 2015, the &quot;Guiding Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Construction of a Hierarchical Diagnosis and Treatment System&quot; was released, which clarified the concept of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment and proposed a model of first diagnosis at the grassroots level, two-way referral, acute and chronic treatment, and linkage between the upper and lower levels. Article 30 of the Basic Medical Care and Health Promotion Law, which came into effect in June 2020, once again emphasizes that &quot;the state promotes the implementation of a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system for basic medical services and guides non-emergency patients to seek treatment at primary medical and health institutions first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the statistical bulletin on the development of my country&#39;s health industry, in the past five years, the number of diagnoses and treatments in hospitals at all levels accounted for about 45% of the total number of diagnoses and treatments in medical and health institutions nationwide, and primary medical and health institutions accounted for about 50%, of which townships The diagnosis and treatment volume of health centers and community health service centers (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Station&lt;/span>;) is about 24%, which is more than 80% in developed countries. The number of medical visits that occur in medical institutions outside hospitals is still far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to promote the implementation of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment, large hospitals will form a consortium of public medical institutions with grassroots hospitals. Zhu Xiaochun introduced that Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital has established a medical consortium with more than 100 units to provide technical support and supplement medical resources. “We will go to villages and towns to give lectures to the specialty alliances of the medical consortium and conduct remote consultations online. , allowing patients with mild symptoms to stay at the grassroots level, and allowing patients who must be transferred to be transferred in time. After our patients are stabilized after surgery, they can also be transferred to grassroots hospitals to achieve two-way referral.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General practitioner Wu Tianlong has worked at the Wenhua Community Health Service Center in Luohu District, Shenzhen (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;social health&quot;&lt;/span>;) for 13 years , he believes that the linkage between social health and higher-level hospitals is a benign two-way interaction. &quot;We have the opportunity to go to higher-level hospitals for sub-specialty training, such as going to the Children&#39;s Hospital in Shenzhen for three months of off-the-job study to learn how to deal with common diseases. At the same time, we It is also the training base of Shenzhen People’s Hospital. Medical students spend the first half of the year in our community and can learn the skills of pediatric reception and many public health services.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wenhua Community Health has 12 doctors. , both are general practitioners. Wu Tianlong feels that they can basically meet the needs of the community. &quot;Now many community residents will first choose to see a doctor in the community health service instead of going to a big hospital. The number of outpatient clinics has increased several times compared with before.&quot; He usually sees basic medical care. Respiratory diseases are also essential skills for social health doctors. Wu Tianlong sees sixty or seventy patients a day, with an average of 8 to 10 minutes per patient. Two-thirds of them are children, and most of them are respiratory infections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen Shekang’s hierarchical diagnosis and treatment is at the forefront of the country. During the fever peak in December 2022, Shekang’s fever clinic “carried” 65% of the diagnosis and treatment volume. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of ordinary people to go to social health centers, Shenzhen City requires participants in the second and third tiers of basic medical insurance to select a social health center in the city as a designated medical institution for outpatient treatment, and continue to devote themselves to hospitals, public health Information collaboration between institutions and social health enables mutual recognition of test results and exchange of medical resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most critical thing is to “straighten out the internal interest mechanism.” Li Chuangzeng, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission, concluded, “Let doctors in large hospitals have the incentive to transfer patients; doctors in social health centers have the incentive to move up.

Visual China | Picture&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The high-strength steel produced by Hebei Iron and Steel Group crossed Shanhaiguan and was transported to the BMW Brilliance Shenyang factory 500 kilometers away. The stamping workshop here is stamped and formed with a force of up to 10,300 tons to become the body of the BMW car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Behind these seemingly &quot;heavy industrial style&quot; scenes is the support of lighter and more fashionable &quot;green electricity&quot; - the production of two factories inside and outside Shanhaiguan is Renewable energy electricity is used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking across the country, green power trading, which was officially launched two years ago, now covers the whole country and the rules are more complete. In the first three months of 2023, the national green power transaction scale has reached 25.026 billion kilowatt hours, exceeding the entire year of 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend&#39;s research found that despite the rapid growth of green electricity trading volume, the endogenous motivation of different market entities to participate in green electricity trading is still weak. At present, green power transactions are dominated by large enterprises and foreign trade companies, while small and medium-sized enterprises are still &quot;bystanders&quot; to green power transactions. Data also shows that the country&#39;s renewable energy power generation will reach 2.7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2022, of which green power trading volume only accounts for 0.84%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason is that the &quot;Research Report on China&#39;s Green Electricity Consumption Path&quot; released by the Energy Foundation to support the Jianheng Certification Center pointed out that the renewable energy power in most provinces The weight of consumption responsibilities is mainly completed by power grid enterprises to ensure consumption, and the assessment indicators have not yet been specifically broken down and implemented on the electricity sales companies or power users that should be assessed; the green electricity trading market has not yet effectively formed a market-based pricing mechanism, and various regions give priority to regional Green power consumption, &quot;Only when the green power supply in the region cannot meet the consumption demand, the purchase of cheaper external green power will be considered.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From this perspective, how to promote market entities of different sizes to participate in green electricity transactions in the future will be the focus of decision-makers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zheng Ying, a special researcher at the China Carbon Neutral Fifty Forum and director of the Dual-Carbon Business Department of Beijing Electric Chain Technology, believes that when the &quot;dual-carbon&quot; policy is gradually advanced Under this situation, both large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises are facing increasing internal and external emission reduction constraints and pressures, and participating in medium and long-term green power transactions or purchasing green certificates will become important ways to reduce emissions. &quot;In the future, dual control assessment of energy consumption and even dual control assessment of carbon emissions will become the main battlefield for the domestic application of green power/green certificates.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Favor green power, and the &quot;giants&quot; will take the lead&lt;/h4>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking at the 2021 and 2022 Chinese enterprise green power transaction rankings compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, it can be found that companies active in the green power market are roughly divided into Internet companies, large state-owned enterprises and foreign companies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Internet technology companies have always presented themselves as low-carbon and avant-garde. However, data centers, as important infrastructure of the Internet, are also large energy consumers. The most important thing is to reduce the carbon emissions of data centers. The effective way is to use green electricity. This has also made Alibaba Cloud, Tencent, Chindata and GDS become big buyers of green electricity. In 2022, Alibaba&#39;s green power transaction volume reached 860 million kilowatt hours, and Tencent&#39;s reached 504 million kilowatt hours, both entering the top five in corporate green power procurement rankings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, even for leading Internet companies, the proportion of green electricity usage in total electricity consumption is not high. In 2020, GDS&#39;s renewable energy usage ratio was 22.6%, and this number increased to 34.3% in 2021; during fiscal year 2022, 21.6% of the electricity used by Alibaba Cloud came from clean energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to Internet companies, green electricity trading by steel companies, traditional large carbon emitters, is more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Green electricity trading practitioners believe that large steel companies are often local leading companies and have always been the main targets of environmental protection supervision. They must play a role in practicing green development. Take the lead. Compared with improving processes, using green electricity is an easier and faster-effective emission reduction measure. In addition, in recent years, coal prices have been high, and thermal power prices have risen accordingly, making green power “less expensive.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What&#39;s more important is the pressure from the external market - a large part of the high-precision steel products developed by steel companies must be sold to foreign companies or exported overseas, facing meet the stringent requirements of product carbon footprint. For example, in March 2022, HBIS Group purchased 270 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity at the North Hebei Power Trading Center, partly because HBIS signed a &quot;Memorandum of Cooperation on Building a Green Low-Carbon Steel Supply Chain&quot; with BMW Brilliance, one of its major customers. , HBIS provides BMW with high-strength steel with a lower carbon footprint by using green electricity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Foreign companies favor green power and have chosen to sign medium- and long-term green power agreements. This is due to factors such as the lack of international recognition of domestic green certificates and the more convenient green power transactions. related. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Take the German-owned enterprise BMW Brilliance as an example. In 2021, it purchased 2.78 billion kilowatt-hours of green electricity and was the &quot;big buyer&quot; of green electricity transactions that year. It can meet the requirements of BMW Shenyang factory to use 100% green electricity for production. Guo Junhan, manager of BMW Brilliance&#39;s business development and corporate sustainability department, said that the company&#39;s purchase and use of green electricity will eventually be summarized in the non-financial statements of the German BMW Group and go through PwC (China) and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Audited by Road (Germany) to ensure that it meets the EU’s carbon emission control requirements for car companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The EU&#39;s green electricity trading is very different from China&#39;s. Many European audit institutions are not familiar with China&#39;s green electricity trading model, making the entire audit process relatively lengthy. &quot;In view of the situation and types of China&#39;s green electricity transactions, including China&#39;s green certificate, we will have regular communications with the audit institutions to inform them of China&#39;s current development situation,&quot; Guo Junhan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to &quot;prioritize&quot; green electricity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared with large enterprises that are the vanguard of emission reduction, the products of domestic export-oriented enterprises and foreign enterprises Suppliers are also feeling the pressure to reduce carbon emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhejiang Shenzhou International is one of the first companies in Zhejiang Province to participate in green electricity transactions. It is engaged in OEM processing for internationally renowned clothing brands. These clothing brands are relatively Pay attention to the carbon footprint of products and ask supply chain partners to get on board. Especially in the context of the EU&#39;s imminent imposition of &quot;carbon tariffs&quot;, purchasing green power is an important means to maintain orders from international partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The general manager of a Dongguan electronics company told Southern Weekend that 40% of the company&#39;s annual turnover comes from export business, and its overseas customers value the company&#39;s green electricity transactions. volume, the use of green electricity has become a bonus for the company’s exports. &quot;Green power has a premium over thermal power. Based on cost, we determine the proportion of green power to buy. It mainly depends on how much electricity is needed to manufacture export products. The rest still uses thermal power.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text- align: left;&quot;>;Song Yu, a trader of Envision Energy&#39;s environmental products, also told Southern Weekend that their customers are mainly export-oriented companies in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. &quot;The main purpose of buying green power is to meet the requirements of foreign customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, more domestic small and medium-sized enterprises have not yet &quot;prioritized&quot; green power. &quot;Whether it is total energy consumption control or the weight of renewable energy consumption responsibilities, these policies are issued by various ministries and commissions to local governments, rather than directly targeting electricity-consuming enterprises.&quot; This also makes it almost impossible for small and medium-sized enterprises to purchase green electricity. Endogenous motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The best way to inspire motivation is to discover business needs. For example, many small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned about whether green power purchases can be given priority or exemption from contract performance during special periods. From 2021 to 2022, many provinces in China will experience power shortages and even power rationing. Some companies asked Song Yu whether they can give priority to ensuring electricity consumption when buying green power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Four Yunnan companies that have purchased green electricity also told Southern Weekend that Yunnan, which mainly relies on hydropower, will enter a power shortage every autumn and winter dry season. According to the state, enterprises must make concessions for residents&#39; electricity use. They have not heard that buying green electricity can avoid power restrictions. This shows that although the state and local governments encourage enterprises to participate in green electricity transactions, there is still a gap between the incentives and the expectations of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend found that Qinghai Province&#39;s &quot;2023 Power Trading Plan&quot; stipulates that for users participating in green power trading within the province, the assessment exemption for deviations in power will be appropriately relaxed According to the standard, users who use more than 30% of green electricity will be exempted from the monthly deviation assessment; Shanxi Province&#39;s &quot;Implementation Plan for Promoting Green Consumption&quot; proposes that when implementing orderly electricity use on the user side during periods of tight power supply, the user&#39;s historical green electricity consumption during the year will be exempted. The proportions are reversely allocated to orderly power consumption tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, in the southeast coastal areas with a stronger demand for green power, no similar policies were introduced. Li Wei, an expert in the power system, has participated in the system design of the green certificate. She said to the southern weekend that green electricity transactions were limited by space and physical restrictions, and it was difficult for enterprises in the southeast region to be relatively lacking to obtain power priority by buying green electricity. &quot;For example, Zhejiang, the amount of green electricity that can be adjusted from foreign provinces every day is limited, such as 100 million degrees, and then Zhejiang&#39;s province can send 100 million degrees of green electricity, then there will be only 200 million degrees of green electricity in the market. , While buying it. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id =&quot; 74034 &quot;group-id =&quot; 0 &quot; Asset-id = &quot;70833&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/cbac554b2d.jpg&quot; img-tital = &quot;August 21, 2023, photovoltaic board Neatly arranged in the national renewable energy demonstration zone located in Zhangjiakou, Hebei.

In the provincial -level energy consumption authority, when completing the requirements of dual -control assessment of the energy consumption, in fact, in accordance with the principle of &quot;grasping the big and small&quot;, the task index is decomposed to some key energy -consuming enterprises, but the &quot;open side of the net to the SME&quot; network opens the Internet &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, Zheng Ying learned from some companies that many companies have not been punished even if the government&#39;s dual-control requirements have not completed the government&#39;s energy consumption dual control requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This may be because under the pressure of economic downturn, local governments must consider not only the company&#39;s ability to bear punishment measures, but also the negative impact on investment promotion. Under the requirements of energy consumption dual control, it is not known to how much the willingness to purchase green certificates and green electricity to increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;I think, when the time is mature, it is still necessary The degree of improvement may still be limited. After all, in the current stage of the development of the green certificate market, if you want to increase the willingness and motivation of the enterprise to buy a large scale, you still need a stronger policy guidance and constraints, instead of relying on enterprises to buy them voluntarily. &quot; Zheng Ying analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The good news is that the &quot;Fourteenth Five-Year Plan&quot; plan has been proposed to gradually change the energy consumption dual-control to the dual-control of carbon emissions. At that time, enterprises can achieve carbon emissions through the case of insufficient carbon indicators to achieve the standard of carbon emissions. Before this transition, the energy consumption dual control system improves its assessment index allocation and reward and punishment mechanism to lay the foundation for the debut of the dual control of carbon emissions is the meaning of the title. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The linkage between green electricity, green syndrome and carbon market is imminent &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It will undoubtedly greatly enhance the motivation to buy green electricity. &quot;Many of our customers are concerned about whether the green certificate he bought can be used in carbon transactions in the future to deduct a part of the carbon row.&quot; Said the person in charge of a Tianjin electricity sales company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In fact, green power is the participants who can be measured and verified the most accurate measurement and verification in carbon transactions. The accurate carbon reduction measurement method is naturally connected with the carbon trading system represented by CCER. However, the &quot;electric carbon linkage&quot; looks like water is successful, but it is difficult to make it difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In August 2023, three ministries and commissions such as the National Development and Reform Commission jointly issued the &quot;Notice on the full coverage of the green power certificate of renewable energy,&quot; &quot;(Hereinafter referred to as&quot; Notice &quot;), emphasizing the connection between the green certificate and the carbon market. On October 24th, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment formulated and released 4 voluntary emissions of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects. The grid -ranging thermal power generation and grid -connected sea wind power generation were clear. The mechanism does not exist in the case of repeated identification or emission reduction and repetition calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In this case, the environmental attributes of the power generation of related renewable energy projects have attributed to green certificates or CCER, which has attracted much attention from the industry. Zheng Ying said that the &quot;Notice&quot; clearly states that the green certificate is the only proof of my country&#39;s renewable energy and electricity and the environmental attributes, and it is the only proof that determines the production and consumption of renewable energy power and consumption. If the environmental attributes of renewable energy can be identified by green and CCER at the same time, it will cause environmental attributes to be repeatedly developed and calculated in the two mechanisms. &quot;The worst result is that the green certificate and CCER recognize the restrictions at the same time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, Apple, Google, TSMC, Coca-Cola and other more than 300 Family well -known international enterprises have joined the RE100 initiative. Many domestic export -oriented companies need to be certified by RE100, but Li Wei introduced that RE100 is not completely recognized by domestic green certificates It is Re100 that &quot;after the issuance of the Chinese green certificate, the environmental rights and interests should be followed according to the green certificate, but some power generation projects have received the environmental voucher issued by CCER at the same time, which has a double measurement and dual benefit. Electric power companies are used. It is forced to prove itself. For example, the power field it bought, the part of the electric field, has no longer applying for other environmental vouchers except the green certificate. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On October 18, 2023, the notice of the &quot;notice of 2023-2025 in 2023-2025 &quot;It is mentioned that&quot; enterprises that use non -alpoped energy power through market -oriented trading need to report this part of the electricity consumption separately and provide relevant certification materials. &quot;It is stipulated that the proof materials do not include green power certificates. The document also stipulates that the emission volume corresponding to the non -chemical energy power purchased by the enterprise is temporarily calculated according to the average carbon emission factor of the national power grid, which means that the green power purchased by the enterprise does not work for the time being in the carbon emissions accounting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;74035&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70834&quot; &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/08305028c4.png&quot; IMG- TITLE = &quot;October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced the&quot; Taking 2023 &quot; —From 2025, the notice of some key industries corporate greenhouse gas emissions reports and verification work &quot;.png&quot; alt = &quot;&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;749&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/08305028c4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260832&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; On October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced the&quot; Notice on Doing a Notice on the Report and Checking Report and Checking Report of Parts of the Enterprise Enterprises in 2023-2025 &quot; STYLE = &quot;Text-Align: left;&quot;>; Zheng Ying believes that to solve the problem of synergy, we must first clarify what the environmental attributes of renewable energy power are. &quot;If the green certificate represents zero emissions, when the power represents the power representative in the future, the power representation can be calculated directly according to zero emissions; if it is calculated as a reduction, its application method in carbon emissions accounts is not as CCER in the CCer. The difference is that CCER is also reduced displacement. The only difference is that in order to prevent drifting, the reduction of the discharge of the green syndrome can only be used to reduce the power emissions of outsourcing in the range 2. Reduce displacement. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p style =&quot; text-align: left; &quot;>; After clarifying the environmental attributes of green electricity, the problem of duplicate calculation needs to be solved. The first is to calculate the power of the power represented by the green certificate when calculating the power grid emissions factor; the second is that the consumption side is purchased or does not purchase the green certificate. carbon emission. How to improve the power grid emissions factors to ensure that the environmental attributes of the green certificate will not be reused or calculated on the power generation side or the consumer side. &quot;The core of the whole thing will eventually point to the construction of China&#39;s power grid emissions factor system, and whether the data of the two markets of green and CCER can be shared.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot; >; Li Wei thinks that the best way is to enable the value of green syndrome in the carbon emission reduction can be directly applied to the carbon market. For example, it is likely to be included in the CCER offshore wind power project. If the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recognizes the carbon emission reduction value represented by the green certificate, the carbon reduction displacement represented by the green certificate of the offshore wind power project can directly enter the CCER market without having to do it without having to do it. The offshore wind power project will issue a CCER certificate and give it another environmental rights to avoid repeated calculations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Increase the scale of green power transactions across the province &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is necessary to point out that, although the current cross-regional power market trading platform has been established, However, in the medium- and long -term power direct trading market, direct transactions in the province are still the main province. A Pwa&#39;s report pointed out that the proportion of direct transactions between provinces accounted for only 2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; This status quo is also one of the important reasons for the green power &quot;campaign&quot; existing in the western region with rich landscape resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to the support of the &quot;Capital Green Electric Power Trading Policy and Suggestion Report&quot; by the support of the capital of Beijing, the Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Eastern provinces Both their willingness to sell green power to the outside world is not strong, making the capital Beijing and the provinces and cities signing green electricity facing many difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The province of green electricity &quot;campaign&quot; is to give priority to ensure the completion of the province&#39;s renewable energy power consumption task. &quot;Another reason is that because of the cheap electricity price and rich energy of the western region, the western region will attract a certain amount of high energy -consuming enterprises to invest in local production and invest in local green power consumption growth.&quot; Zheng Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; According to the above report, at present, cross-provincial and cross-regional green power transactions are mainly carried out through the transaction method of &quot;network&quot; and &quot;point-to-network&quot;. &quot;The transaction method broke the control of the power grid company to the 13th channel of cross -regional electricity in the province, but at present, the state has not clearly explicitly explicitly implement the specific implementation rules of the&quot; point -to -point &quot;transaction. &quot;Cross -provincial and regional green power transactions, the market is insufficient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; For provinces and regions relying on external power adjustment, we need to comprehensively consider the characteristics of their own location to seek a diverse energy insurance supply solution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Feng, director of the clean power project of the Energy Foundation, pointed out that a typical southeast coastal province represented by Zhejiang can not only deploy new high-voltage channels, but also It can strengthen cooperation with the development of renewable energy and the upstream and downstream of the new energy industry chain between government and provincial enterprises between provinces and provincial enterprises. For example, Zhejiang Tianneng Group reached a cooperation with Gansu Province Baiyedon Color Group and Golden Silk Road Fund to jointly promote the construction of a new energy industry ecosystem in Zhejiang and Gansu provinces. It is dedicated to the development and construction of the development and construction of low -carbon energy projects; the other is Beijing, on the one hand, it depends on external adjustment, but on the other hand, it is in the range of Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei regional power grids, which means that the scale of its external power adjustment depends on Beijing In order to complete the &quot;Fourteen Five -Year Plan&quot; green power target, the establishment of the &quot;14th Five -Year Plan&quot; should promote green transactions and promote green power growth from the two levels of the domain (Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; To maximize the value of green electricity transactions between different provinces, the relevant mechanism of the power market may play a key role. The report &quot;China Construction of the National Unified Electric Power Market System&quot; jointly released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Energy Foundation shows that regional transactions can promote the sharing of resources within a larger scale, so it can bring system toughness and help to improve the systemic toughness and help help Investment in reducing the need to reducing the installation. The report pointed out that compared with the coordination of the provincial province, building a national market can reduce operating costs by 6%-12%and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2%-10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恐龙灭绝的新细节]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261958]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; In 66 million years ago, the Baiji-Gurin-Jining Biostatic Extinction, including non-bird dinosaur Within, about three -quarters of the species on the earth are extinct.

The size of these particles is 0.8 to 8 microns, forming a huge dust cloud group into a flat flow layer, and then spreads the world to cover the sky and obstruct the effective radiation of photosynthesis for a long time. The cooling effect of sulfur -containing gases such as sulfur -containing gases and high fires after the impact may cause the disaster of the great extinction of this creature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our research clearly states that the impact of sulfur and smoke may have been overvalued before, and the impact of fine dust may be underestimated.&quot; Philip Kyk, a professor at the University of Liberty, who participated in this research, Philippe Claeys told the southern weekend reporter, &quot;We strongly advocate the latter is the main reason for extinction.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Because the simulation data shows that the amount of silicic acid dust is the largest after the impact, and these are these Dust and smoke can be suspended in the atmosphere for 15 years. In comparison, although sulfur -containing gases can also cover the sun and make the temperature of the earth cold, its settlement speed is fast, and it only stays in the atmosphere for nearly 8 years. From this comprehensive, after the impact of Hick Suruber, it may affect the climate at the time by interference in the atmosphere for 15 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Related research was published in Nature Geoscience in November 2023. These impacts may include the global average surface temperature decreased by as much as 25 degrees Celsius, creating endless &quot;cold winter&quot;, and if the temperature wants to recover as early, it may take nearly 20 years. What is even more fatal is that due to the influence of a large amount of dust, the recovery of photosynthesis also takes about two years. During this period, the cold and cold environment will cause food deficiency, and species that cannot adapt to this environment for a long time may be extinct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many of the latest studies have also been confirmed by paleontological evidence. For example, research shows that the photosynthetic effect is first recovered in the summer of the southern hemisphere. Consistent. However, in the future, it is still necessary to study the records of related strata in different places around the world to better understand the differences and recovery of the extinction and recovery of various regions, so as to better confirm the impact of this extinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sedimentary samples analyzed in the current research are originally from the fossil site of Tanis, North Dakota, and belong to the White-Cycles-Ancient Merchants Line of the Land. Three thousand kilometers. 66 million years ago, when the asteroid hits the position of the Yicatan Peninsula, a fireball of 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter is at a speed of nearly 20 kilometers per second at the ground. At the same time, the melted sphere and mineral debris shot out of the pit like an artillery shell, falling in the distance, and then deposited in the rock layer with the dust, smoke and other substances that settle down, and became a testimony of this incident. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1980, Professor LUIS W. Alvarez, Professor of the University of California, who had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, has already won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Alvarez and others found that among some deep-sea limestals in Italy, Denmark, New Zealand and other places, the accuracy of the background base before the Baiji-Gujinji creatures is abnormally more than dozens or even hundreds of times before the Great Kondi Biostatic. It is speculated that these crickets do not come from the crust, but aliens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Walter Alvarez was an associate professor at the Department of Geology and Earth Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. They together published an article in Science and proposed that asteroids hit the earth and caused the White-Clear-Ancients Premature hypothesis of Disciplinary Biostatic. According to the analysis at the time, after a huge little asteroid hit the earth, it would inject 60 times the rocks of its own quality into the atmosphere in the form of powder, and then floated along the flat stratum to the world to suppress the photosynthesis and cause biological extinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The latest research further proves the explanation of dust around the dust, and negates the more critical statement about the dangers of sulfur. Felip Chrys, who participated in the latest research, is also a geologist, planetary scientist, and celestial chemist. He is now a professor at archeology, environmental change, and Earth Chemistry Research Center of the University of Liberty of Brussels. Walter Alvarez cooperated to conduct research in this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that in September 2022, researchers at Datmouth College, Princeton University and other institutions analyzed the data of the fire into the province of Rock Provincial and Potential Bio, and believed The main driving factor of great extinction. The reason is that from the perspective of the geological timeline, the emergence of the fire in the province of fire has a clear correlation with the time interval between the animals that appear to be replaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This study was published in the &quot;Academy of Sciences&quot; (PNAS). The fire of the fire is a large -scale volcanic eruption, which usually includes more than 100,000 cubic kilometers of magma. Wherever it goes, hundreds of thousands of or even millions of square kilometers of magma can be formed. A large amount of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other substances can be released. Researchers from Dartmouth College and other institutions believe that the two are not accidental at the same time. It may be a causal relationship, but it is not enough to determine the causal relationship with a certain extermination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Each extinction is a complex and different process, and it cannot be attributed to a single reason, such as large volcanic incidents. Because similar or almost similar time is not enough to prove that the volcanic effect is caused by extinction. An excessive simplified way. To find the culprit, the culprit requires excellent detective work. &quot;Philip Chrys explained to the southern weekend reporter that&quot; 66 million years ago, the impact of a large meteorite on the Yicatan Peninsula caused dinosaurs With most of the extinction of land and marine biospheres, scientists have a wide consensus on this. We have only studied the Baiji Period-Ancient Broker Line of 66 million years ago. Back is the cause of extinction, but we cannot explain other big extinction events accordingly. The collapse of these large biospheres is likely to be much more complicated than some people think. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10万亿级中信集团迎来新任掌舵者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261996]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 17:42:27 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of CITIC Group, on the morning of December 6, China CITIC Group Co., Ltd. held a cadre meeting. .

Southern Weekend reporters randomly entered several live broadcast rooms and found that the number of viewers ranged from single digits to thousands. The largest room had about 3,500 people watching at the same time. The live broadcast had received 194,000 likes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not all stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms are authentic and trustworthy. At the beginning of November, some netizens posted a message to remind everyone not to be deceived by such live broadcast rooms. A netizen said that after placing an order for dog food during a stray dog ​​rescue live broadcast, he asked the host to touch a certain puppy in the camera, and was immediately blocked. This online post was on the hot list of social platforms and attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In several stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms, Southern Weekend reporters tried to leave messages, asking how to ensure the delivery of dog food, the specific address of the base, whether the details would be made public, etc. The questions were either ignored or received vague answers. . One anchor replied that the location of the base is &quot;Huanyang Village, Sheyang County&quot;, but after further questioning about the specific address, the anchor stopped responding. After raising several questions in succession, Southern Weekend&#39;s reporter was blocked from the live broadcast room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Southern Weekend reporters contacted the neighborhood committee where the anchor claimed the address. The staff said that the so-called Huanyang Village does not exist now and has been merged. After being visited by a grid worker, the staff member confirmed to Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;We do not have a stray dog ​​rescue center here. We do not have a so-called base here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to doubts about the authenticity of the rescue station, there are also people who smell more business opportunities besides live broadcast. A large number of teaching articles have appeared on the Internet, and training groups have been organized, claiming to teach people to create stray dog ​​live broadcasts and &quot;earned 8 million yuan a year.&quot; Southern Weekend reporters found a teacher who claimed to reward more than 100,000 yuan a day and asked about the operating costs. The other person replied, &quot;It mainly depends on the scene, (including) dogs, food, rent, water and electricity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teacher also reminded and suggested: &quot;Now the popularity of this gameplay has passed.

In the footage, most of the stray dogs are crowded In a small room, looking listless. Some dogs had signs hanging on them, saying things like &quot;Please feed&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve been hungry for a long time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the live broadcast content is monotonous, and the specific conditions of the dogs are not introduced, but they are repeatedly sold miserably. Xin Chaochao felt sorry for these thin stray dogs and placed an order for dog food according to the anchor&#39;s prompts without hesitation. A serving of dog food costs about ten yuan, which is not high. She buys two or three servings at a time as a small act of kindness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Xin Chaochao went to an offline stray dog ​​rescue base. She found that the staff knew the life experience of each dog very well, and most of the dogs were very energetic, which was completely different from those in the live broadcast room. She tried to leave comments in the live broadcast room, asking the anchor whether she could adopt or volunteer, but these comments were always ignored by the anchor. She realized something was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue was once blocked by a stray dog ​​live broadcast room. She now volunteers at an offline stray dog ​​base. At that time, she had insomnia at night, so she would open the live broadcast room and watch the puppy sleep for a while. After watching more, she found that although many live broadcast accounts were displayed in different cities, the layout, decoration, dog status, etc. of the room were almost exactly the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, she saw a live broadcast room showing a stray dog ​​in the same city as herself, so she left a message in the live broadcast room, saying that she had rescue experience and asked if she could go and help. The anchor has repeatedly emphasized that he is short of food and people. Li Xue left several messages, but the anchor did not respond and later blocked her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Apai Caring for Small Animals Social Development Center has been established for seven years and specializes in stray animal rescue. The person in charge, Chen Qiang, has also seen similar live broadcasts of stray dogs. In her experience, real animal rescues will let the animals out to walk around and bask in the sun, but the dogs in the live broadcast room are usually just sleeping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that if the density of animals is too high, it will be difficult to sleep peacefully for a long time, and dogs have territorial and spatial awareness, and too much concentration can easily lead to biting. &quot;In a crowded space, more than 20 animals are sleeping together, as if they are in love with each other, which is contrary to our understanding.&quot; Chen Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the operation of asking viewers to buy dog ​​food and send it to the base, Chen Qiang thinks it is also very suspicious. The goods taken may not actually be sent, and the transaction does not really happen. &quot;We don&#39;t know. All I know is that the money has been paid.&quot; Li Xue also believes that &quot;it&#39;s just a name, I don&#39;t know whether it will be shipped or not.&quot; She also observed that some new live broadcast rooms do not put out shopping links as soon as they are launched, but &quot;pretend to have no desires and desires for two days&quot; before starting to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to dog food, these stray dog ​​live broadcast accounts will also sell pet products or common daily necessities, guiding viewers to click on links to purchase. Chen Qiang found that the origin of many products was unknown. “We cannot see where the products come from or whether they have been to the brand or factory for evaluation.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter clicked on a purchase link. The product name is &quot;Rescue Station (Specialized Whole Dog Food)&quot;. There are eight specifications to choose from. The price ranges from 30 yuan to 1,000 yuan. It has been sold. 93 pieces. But looking at the store where the link is located, the business license shows that the operator is a stationery store, an individual industrial and commercial owner, and the registration date is 2020. The store has four types of dog food on sale. The link with the highest sales was put on the shelves on October 20, and 383 copies have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The store’s customer service told the Southern Weekend reporter that the dog food was produced in the warehouse and sent directly to the base, and then the Southern Weekend reporter was blacklisted. The other two dog food stores said they have cooperation with anchors, who promote the manufacturers or receive commissions for bringing goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Window shopping link of a stray dog ​​live broadcast account.

(Screenshot by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Rongrong)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Self-written and self-directed rescue script&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to live broadcasts, such accounts will also shoot videos of rescuing stray dogs. Li Xue once watched a rescue video. The anchor claimed to have rescued an injured puppy. It was so seriously injured that its bones were even exposed. Every once in a while, the anchor will update its recovery status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue sent the video to her rescue group, and a veterinarian told her that based on the tragic situation in the video, it would be impossible to return to the current state unless it was a medical miracle. Li Xue guessed that the owner of the account might be the dog abuser himself. He was directing and acting, and the video was actually a flashback update. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue once saw an anchor filming at a dog meat stall, claiming to have bought the dogs and calling on everyone to donate. She thought this was counterintuitive, &quot;As an animal rescuer, going to a place where dogs are slaughtered to take pictures is something you wouldn&#39;t do under normal circumstances.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2022, according to media reports, Ma Changchun, a stray dog ​​anchor in Xuyi County, Huai&#39;an City, Jiangsu Province, was suspected of stealing dogs and using stray dogs to live broadcast to defraud rewards. Data shows that he has more than 1.51 million fans, and his total live broadcast income in 180 days is as high as 16.228 million yuan. A fellow anchorman said that Ma Changchun once went to his base to buy a dog for live broadcast, and when the dog got sick, he sold it directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Man Yun was one of the first bloggers to expose this matter, and had previously donated money to some live broadcast rooms. At that time, people on Douyin began to question Ma Changchun&#39;s fraud. The evidence cited included: the videos posted by his account were labeled &quot;meat dog breeding&quot;, and there were dog catching nets in his courtyard. Man Yun synthesized this information and posted it on his account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the large traffic on Manyun’s account, more and more netizens are approaching her to provide clues. Some people claimed that a stray dog ​​in Ma Changchun&#39;s live broadcast room was the dog he had lost before, but his comments and private message requests were ignored; netizens asked Ma Changchun if he sells dogs, and he once gave an affirmative answer; a caring person donated 250 kilograms of rice and 60 kilograms of salmon mince, but Ma still said that the dog was not full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Man Yun and some caring people called the police. Afterwards, the local police said that they had conducted an on-site investigation and found that there was currently no problem with the source of the dog and that no relevant illegal activities had been found. Soon after, Ma Changchun’s account was banned and removed from the platform, and this millionaire anchor disappeared from the Internet world. Since then, the live broadcast of stray dogs whose authenticity is difficult to distinguish has planted doubts in people&#39;s minds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A stray dog ​​live broadcast room teacher told Southern Weekend reporters that in order to create this type of account, first of all, &quot;there must be a place to raise dogs, dogs, and dog food.&quot; He concluded that it is very simple to find a venue. It can be an old factory building or a simple greenhouse. Dogs can be adopted or bought cheaply from the dog market. “You can also cooperate with other dog farms and find the ones that can attract audiences, such as Dogs can be cute, unique, and capable of fighting, or they can be pitiful and sympathetic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He mentioned that if he wanted to appear miserable, &quot;unless (he) adopts a stray dog.&quot; He also suggested, &quot;There is no need to have so many stray dogs at once. If you have a few stray dogs, each one has a name and has its own characteristics and stories. Isn&#39;t it better than having more than 70 stray dogs?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;It is too easy to get such a bunch of dogs in this society.&quot; Xin Chaochao speculated that the dogs in some live broadcast rooms may be &quot;dogs that people in the countryside do not want, or are stolen, or Dogs that are sold at low prices in breeding farms, or from the pet market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing volunteer activities at the rescue base, Li Xue learned that some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms did not have their own dog farms, but rented them temporarily. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Is there support for offline adoption and rescue, and is there any follow-up? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Apai Care Small Animal Social Development Center currently has about 80 animals, almost all of which were rescued by caring people who notified the center after encountering them by chance. Chen Qiang told a reporter from Southern Weekend that at most, he would receive 70 or 80 stray animal rescue messages a day, and “sometimes it’s impossible to save them at all.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the stray animals are seriously injured and sick. In addition to treatment, the center also bathes and deworms the animals regularly, so that they can be adopted smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Any base that really helps stray animals is willing to adopt the animals, because only in this way can more resources be freed up to receive new animals.” According to Chen Qiang’s observation, many stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms do not They will respond positively to the audience&#39;s desire to adopt, and will not let anyone know its detailed address and go on-site inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that although some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms claim to allow adoption on their homepages, the conditions are tied to money. For example, a live broadcast room claims to have more than 100 dogs. As long as you insist on &quot;cloud raising&quot; in the live broadcast room for three months, you can adopt one and take it home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;cloud feeding&quot; means &quot;adding meat to their daily meals&quot;, that is, donations. The anchor said, &quot;If you can&#39;t stick to them for three months, don&#39;t tell me how much you like them. Even if you take them back, you may not be able to live better than me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang believes that Yunyang sounds &quot;like a bundled sale.&quot; The person in charge of another animal rescue center in Guangzhou told Southern Weekend reporters that in general animal adoption, the adopter&#39;s concept of pet care and sense of responsibility are valued, and they can have a general understanding during the communication process. After the animal is adopted, they will do some return visits in the first two years to understand the animal&#39;s living conditions. If there are no problems, they will not disturb it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Xue’s view, whether to support offline public adoption is also one of the ways to distinguish between genuine and fake live broadcast rooms. If the other party is willing to disclose the address and accept adoption, it is best to go to the homepage to see if the other party has been selling the dog. &quot;Regular rescues want to adopt the dog out more, and they prefer to take photos of the lively and positive side of the dog.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the monthly expenditure of Apai Care for Small Animals Social Development Center is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. As a legally registered public welfare organization, 80% of their funding sources rely on public donations. One of the channels is to launch fundraising projects through public fundraising platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that many stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms also have public fundraising links. When you click on the link, the project information shows that it has been registered with the Civil Affairs Bureau, but the content of the project is inconsistent with the situation mentioned in the live broadcast room. incompatible. In addition, Li Xue believes that whether there is a follow-up to the rescue is also one of the ways to identify it. Formal rescue will usually update the follow-up situation, including the details of the use of the money, and will also make it public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After all, it is something across the screen. Instead of distinguishing what is true and false on the Internet, it is better to understand the real things in the local area. What you can see is the real thing. No matter what you do on the Internet, Even if we try to identify it, we can&#39;t be 100% sure,&quot; Xin Chaochao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Ma Changchun incident, Man Yun has not watched the stray dog ​​live broadcast room for a long time. &quot;Because I was deceived, I am really sad. How can they take advantage of everyone like this? I no longer watch it.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Manyun mainly rescues animals in real life and feeds stray animals when they encounter them. She rescued two stray dogs, which were eventually adopted by friends, and she also owns a stray dog ​​that a friend picked up. &quot;I feel like it&#39;s so tiring to distinguish this kind of thing, so just do it in reality. The things around you are more important and you can&#39;t see them online.&quot; Man Yun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the person in charge of a relief organization, Chen Qiang feels torn, “Sometimes I really hope to tell the public about things that are not really charity work, but sometimes I’m afraid that the public doesn’t have the ability to distinguish and will misunderstand many real ( (Rescue) organization. Anyway, I can’t tell the difference, so I just say you are all liars, which is really contradictory.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s very helpless, there is no other way, your kindness is probably the reason why they wander. &quot;Li Xue said, &quot;When there is no way to identify, it is great to do a good job in helping people around you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Li Xue, Xin Chaochao and Manyun are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多地健康码重出江湖？相关部门有必要澄清以释众疑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261962]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Recently, there are media reports that health codes in some places have &quot;reappeared&quot; &quot;Jianghu&quot; has aroused strong public attention. Nowadays, &quot;Category B and B management&quot; have been implemented to deal with the new coronavirus, and many places have also announced that the health code system will be offline and relevant data will be destroyed. Why is the health code back on the scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Recently, respiratory infectious diseases have broken out again. At this time, the health code has returned to the world, which makes many people wonder. However, some netizens said that this is just because the health code system in some places has not been offline and has always been there. It is not that it has just &quot;reappeared&quot; recently, so there is no need to worry. In response to relevant questions, the official citizen hotline in some places stated that as long as it does not affect life and travel, it is &quot;nothing&quot;, meaning that there is no need to worry about it &lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;, &quot;(epidemic) ) has passed.&quot;&lt;/span>;However, the health code is of great importance, and it is still necessary for relevant departments to provide further explanations to eliminate public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After the COVID-19 &quot;Category B and B&quot;, the future of the health code has aroused widespread discussion. Many places have announced that they will offline the health code system and delete the data. For example, on February 14, 2023, the relevant departments of a certain province issued an announcement announcing that from 11:00 on February 16, 2023, service entrances such as antigen self-testing, health declaration, digital space, and epidemic prevention workbench will be completely closed. Delete and destroy all data related to the service to ensure the security of personal information. Although the announcement at the time did not mention that the health code applet would be completely offline and all data deleted, the public generally believed that the health code had completed its historical mission and should completely withdraw from the historical stage and destroy all data behind the entire system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There is no doubt that the health code system stores a large amount of personal information. Information such as name, ID number, mobile phone number, and even face authentication are all extremely sensitive personal information. The health code system may also store travel information such as when and where each person has been, and medical and health information such as whether they have been vaccinated. This information is also personal privacy. During the epidemic, for the needs of prevention and control, the public can understand, accept and support. After the epidemic is over, the relevant systems have no reason to continue to save these users’ private data and should be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, Wang Chunhui, a member of the Information and Communication Economics Expert Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and director of the Network and Data Law Research Department of the Chinese Behavioral Law Society, also said in an interview with the media that itinerary cards, health codes The mission has ended, the purpose of processing personal information is no longer necessary, and all personal information should be deleted in accordance with the law. Many places have also announced that personal data in the health code system will be destroyed, and some cities have also held public destruction ceremonies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, judging from the current situation, there are still many places where the health code system seems to have not been offline, and some places still retain at least part of the data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Storing this data for a long time, even if the health code system is not completely offline, the risk of data leakage will increase dramatically. Because after the epidemic, the technical maintenance of the health code system has basically come to a standstill. If the data is not destroyed and the system is not offline and is exposed to the Internet, it is likely to be attacked by hackers. If the data is leaked, the consequences will be disastrous. Even when the health code system was still running, the information of 48.5 million users of a certain health code system was suspected to have appeared on the dark web for sale. Investigators checked 47 sets of data published by the sellers and found that the names, ID numbers, and mobile phone numbers of these users were all true, and they had indeed registered for the city&#39;s health code application. These leaked data will exist permanently on the dark web and will continue to be sold back and forth. The mobile phone number can be changed, but the name and ID number are used for a lifetime. You don’t know when this information may be used to commit telecom fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The health code system is independently developed by each locality, and each locality is responsible for the handling after deactivation. Some places have announced that they will stop services and destroy data, but judging from the current situation, some places have not actually done this. Of course, there are also health code applications in many places that have indeed stopped serving, and mini programs are no longer available. But users have no way of knowing whether the data behind it has been destroyed. It is necessary for an authoritative third party to supervise and verify the deactivation and data destruction of health code systems in various places to ensure that these data, which store a large amount of user sensitive information, are completely destroyed and will not be leaked or used without the user&#39;s knowledge. case for other purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Whether the health code is &quot;reappearing&quot; or &quot;never offline&quot;, it shows that at least some data is still retained in some places. It is necessary for these places to issue official clarifications on this, and to take down the health code program under supervision as soon as possible and destroy the data to eliminate public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“中印两国可以同时崛起”:访印度前驻华大使阿肖克·康特]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“没有中印参与，全球重大议题很难解决”：访印度前驻华大使]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261954]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the afternoon of December 3, Conte accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

(Picture/Southern Weekend reporter Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China and India are rising at the same time. How to handle Sino-Indian relations is not only related to the interests of the two countries, but also crucial to the entire world.&quot; December 3, 2023 On Japan, Ashok K. Kantha, former Indian Ambassador to China, said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend on the sidelines of the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kant is a senior Indian diplomat and China expert. He served as the Consul General of India in Hong Kong, China, and as the Ambassador of India to China from 2014 to 2016. Currently, Conte works at the China Institute, an authoritative academic institution, which is located in New Delhi, the capital of India. It is the oldest institution on China issues in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have worked in China and been engaged in China research for 15 years. I can only say that I have a certain understanding of China. China is very big and complex. No one dares to say that they fully understand China.&quot; Conte said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Indian ambassador to China, Kant has witnessed the good development of Sino-Indian relations. During his tenure, the heads of state of China and India visited each other&#39;s hometowns. But he admitted frankly that &quot;the current Sino-Indian relations need to resolve some outstanding issues and pass them smoothly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are many similarities between China and India.&quot; Conte said that historically, the two countries used to be the world&#39;s largest economies, but subsequently lagged behind world development. Now China and India are re-emerging. , &quot;Both sides should support each other.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Seeing China from Two Perspectives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First time participating in &quot;Understanding China&quot; How do you feel about international conferences? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For me, this is a good opportunity to try to understand China’s views on various issues. Especially how China tells its story to the outside world. This morning, I attended a closed-door seminar on Sino-US relations. Participants from China, the United States, South Korea and India had a long discussion, and I was also one of the speakers. This discussion was very fruitful and can help us understand a very critical issue - how the future development trajectory of Sino-US relations will affect the entire world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What suggestions do you have for promoting mutual understanding between China and India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China has a long civilization and is also the world&#39;s second largest economy and the most important trading partner of nearly 40 countries around the world. There is no doubt that issues involving China will arouse the attention of other countries, including India, and some of China&#39;s measures will also cause concerns in other countries, so it is very important to understand China&#39;s ambitions and how China develops. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, China is India&#39;s largest neighbor, and India also hopes to maintain friendly relations with China. However, currently, relations between the two countries are in a difficult period due to border issues. If the boundary issue cannot be normalized, it will be difficult for the overall relations between China and India to return to normal. Against this backdrop, we hope to be able to communicate our concerns and expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You have served as India’s ambassador to China before. What new feelings do you have when you return to China this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have worked in China for a long time. The first time I came to China was in 1981, when I was a young diplomat. Later, I served as the Consul General of India in Hong Kong, China and the Ambassador of India to China. But at that time, I was working in China as a diplomat. Today, as an ordinary Indian citizen studying China issues, I went to China to participate in a conference and tried to understand China. These are two different perspectives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-India relations are very important. It is a complex relationship with challenges, but we hope to have constructive engagement with China. In the early years, I was working in China on behalf of India. My perspective on the problem and my specific working methods were all different. As an ordinary citizen, I can promote mutual understanding between China and India in my own way. In particular, I have many old friends in China. We can talk openly and honestly. I will tell them what concerns India has and what changes it expects China to make. The dialogue between us is very friendly and candid. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The most populous&quot; has mixed blessings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2023, India will surpass China and become the The most populous country in the world, what does this mean for India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think it made a big difference. India and China are the two most populous countries in the world, with about 1.4 billion people each. For India, we need to take greater responsibility to look after such a huge population to ensure that the country continues to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, India and China were once the largest economies in the world. Research by Angus Maddison, a well-known British economist, pointed out that in the 17th and 18th centuries, the economies of China and India were leading the world, but later India encountered colonial rule and lost development opportunities, and its economic growth continued to slow down. Slowly, GDP dropped from about 25% of the world at that time to 4% in 1950. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, we are working hard to rebuild our country and our economy. India has been doing very well over the past three decades, with economic growth rate second only to China. But we also face huge challenges in many areas, especially in providing a better life for our people and in technological development and transformation. China and India are very similar and we can learn from each other&#39;s experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What opportunities and challenges will becoming the world&#39;s most populous country bring to India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One of India’s great advantages is that it has a very young population. The median age of the population in India is about 28 years old, and that&#39;s the demographic dividend we have. A larger youth population means more people to serve in the Indian economy. We must make full use of this dividend and think about how to enable this young working population to contribute to India&#39;s achievement of becoming a developed economy. India&#39;s goal is to become a developed country by 2047, the 100th anniversary of India&#39;s independence. Although this task is difficult, India is working towards this goal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, India provides jobs for nearly 12 million new workers every year, which is a huge number. Similar to China, India is also facing the problem of youth unemployment or underemployment, so we must create new job opportunities on a large scale. But this goal can only be achieved by ensuring that the economy continues to grow at a rate of 7% or 8%. It&#39;s a big challenge, but one we can meet. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Without the participation of China and India, it is difficult to solve major global issues&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As China&#39;s largest neighbor and a member of the BRICS, how does India view its relationship with China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India and China have a complex relationship with many unresolved issues, including border disputes. Both China and India are trying to establish a constructive and friendly partnership. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the situation on the Sino-Indian border is not stable. If the border issue is not resolved, it will be difficult for the overall relations between the two countries to return to normal. Therefore, the direct challenge we face is how to restore peace and tranquility on the border. Now, China and India have made some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done. We need to have closer and more strategic dialogue so that bilateral issues can be effectively resolved, so as to contribute to the two countries&#39; efforts in regional and global issues. to create conditions for joint cooperation. China and India are the two most populous countries in the world and rank among the world&#39;s five largest economies. Without the participation of China and India, major global issues such as climate change, terrorism and artificial intelligence will be difficult to fully resolve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As the two largest developing countries in the world, how can the two sides enhance mutual trust and cooperation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China and India have maintained good cooperation in many fields in the past, and China is India&#39;s second largest trading partner. In 2022, bilateral trade between China and India will be close to US$135 billion. But India is also worried. India&#39;s trade deficit with China exceeds 100 billion US dollars. India looks forward to pursuing a more balanced economic engagement with China, but we also need to respect each other&#39;s concerns, interests and ambitions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now China and India are rising at the same time and becoming two major countries in the world. In this process, how to handle Sino-Indian relations is not only related to the interests of the two countries, but also to the entire world. Crucial. China and India can rise at the same time, and both sides should support each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;India will not join any military alliance&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For a long time, India has Diplomatically, India pursues a policy of non-alignment, but in recent years, India seems to be turning to the United States and strengthening military cooperation with Japan.

However, we will maintain an independent foreign policy and make decisions based on specific issues without joining any military alliance. This basic national policy has not changed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the relationship between India and the United States has changed, especially in the past 20 years. The United States has become India&#39;s largest trading partner. We cooperate with the United States, Western countries and Japan because we believe this is very important for India&#39;s economic and technological transformation. In fact, China is also working closely with these countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India seeks to establish closer ties with the United States and is also strengthening security cooperation under the &quot;Quadrilateral Mechanism&quot;. But what needs to be made clear is that the &quot;Quadrilateral Security Dialogue&quot; between the United States, Japan, India, and Australia is not a military mechanism, and India is not willing to join any alliance. We just want to maintain our strategic independence. India&#39;s stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates all this. We have adopted a stance that is completely different from that of the United States and Western countries. India will maintain an independent foreign policy on all issues. On some issues, we will cooperate with the United States and Japan, but on some issues, we may also have differences with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What factors will India pay attention to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India does not want to see any confrontation and armed conflict between China and the United States, because this will have a negative impact on global development . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, the heads of state of China and the United States will meet in San Francisco, which will help restore Sino-US relations to a certain extent. India welcomes such changes and looks forward to seeing the world’s most Two powerful countries re-establish a more stable relationship. However, the strategic competition between China and the United States still faces potential structural challenges, and it is still unclear how the relationship between the two parties will evolve. We hope that China and the United States will avoid conflict, because this is not in the interest of both parties, nor is it in the interest of other countries, including India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[面对民主制度的退潮，查尔斯·泰勒开出了这样的药方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261938]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 12:02:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 12/05/ibDnm46IXLOJQYg6c9u3Z3FsQhTaeL8ipzgyGOqz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;726&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/ibDnm46IXLOJQYg6c9u3Z3FsQhTaeL8 ipzgyGOqz. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260822&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor and his new book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; (with Craig Calhoun, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the end of the last century, the trends of neoliberalism, globalization and democratization have swept the world, as if the entire There is only one way, one path in the world. But twenty or thirty years later, since Brexit, Trump’s rise to power, and right-wing parties winning elections around the world, political scientists are talking about the decline of democracy, both trying to explain why (as Fukuyama puts it in his book Identity Politics) Identity analyzes how disadvantaged communities thrive), while also continuing to defend democracy (e.g. Przewski&#39;s Why Bother with Elections?). Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor also co-authored a new book with two scholars, &quot;Degenerations of Democracy&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2022), which adds to the literature that has emerged in recent years on the decline of democracy. , adding another important book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before talking about the new book, let me first explain the background. Taylor wrote a masterpiece, &quot;A Secular Age&quot;, analyzing how the Western world evolved from the medieval era when &quot;no god was necessary&quot; to a secular era where God was &quot;all-powerful&quot;. The world experienced a helpless time. The historical process of looking back. Recognizing that history moves forward (rather than repeating ebbs and flows) is equally important to understanding the decline of democracy today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as in the new book, the authors led by Taylor describe today&#39;s democracy as a &quot;degenerate&quot; rather than a &quot;retreat&quot;. To clarify the difference between the two words, the point I want to explain is that With the qualitative change of the democratic system, it will no longer be able to return to &quot;normal&quot; as before. It will not be regarded as the &quot;golden rule&quot; as before (that is, democratic countries have a transcendent status but non-democratic countries are eager to imitate it). The kind of system that was once The &quot;good days of democracy&quot; that briefly appeared are long gone from a global perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another focus of the author in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; is to define democracy as a telic concept. In other words: democracy is an ideal situation, but the world can never be so ideally democratic (It is defined by standards that can never be met). To move towards democracy, elections are certainly one of the keys, but the presence of elections certainly does not mean democracy (just like the lack of rotation of political parties in Japan does not mean the lack of local democracy), democratic elections must have the two qualities of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; Big conditions. In reality, there is never true and ultimate freedom and fairness, but there is often the possibility of being a little freer and a little fairer. Similarly, the author regards democracy as a goal in the book, either getting closer to democracy or moving further and further away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like other scholars of democratic theory, Taylor and other authors in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; also hope to explain why the current world is contrary to democracy, and their answer is that the public has lost a kind of will that will change tomorrow. People feel they are deprived of the ability to make good lives for themselves and their families, so the public no longer has clear ideological preferences as before, but it is easier to resort to emotions and vent their dissatisfaction in life. Complaining collectively in small groups has become the greatest comfort in life. This is called populism. It is against this background that the democratic system has gradually changed from the past where everyone competed to pursue their own interests (agonistic), into an antagonistic arena. This is what the author calls the decline of democracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to ask how a democratic system can be brought back to life, the key must be to analyze the cause of death. The fundamental reason for the decline of the democratic system is the loss of the people&#39;s trust. If no one trusts any system, politics and political-related figures will only be hated by gods and ghosts. The author believes that ideal democracy is practiced through representative politics, that is, the people vote for political parties and authorize the formation of the government. The government is elected by one person and one vote. Everyone has a &quot;share&quot;, and the government therefore needs to be accountable to the people. However, scholars such as Charles Taylor revealed the miserable situation of democracy in the real world in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In political research, the decline of the democratic system and the people&#39;s indifference or even disgust with politics are not something that has only happened in recent years. It is only the situation that has taken a turn for the worse in recent years that has attracted more attention. The situation is exactly like global warming. It has been talked about for decades, but in recent years it has really started to feel like it has burned its heels. So now more people are coming out to speak out for the earth, but we know that the distance problem will be alleviated (let alone solved). The volume is still far from enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for democratic systems. The voting rates in old Western democracies have been low for decades, and political party support has also been deteriorating. Behind these things is that the democratic system and the people are getting further and further apart. The death of democracy will have as much impact on the world as global warming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, the three authors describe the failed democratic system in reality: social inequality is infinitely magnified through the democratic system, and power and wealth are concentrated in a very small number of people. Regularly held elections and the political parties participating in them are to blame. The political parties themselves enjoy it, but (most) people don&#39;t actually feel it. Social development has become more diverse, but representative political parties have been unable to keep up. The opposition between left and right has left the people feeling indifferent. Political parties no longer represent the people, and a sense of powerlessness has enveloped the public. This is the key point that the author emphasizes repeatedly in the book: the people have lost their sense of accomplishment (efficacy). Who wants to get involved in politics when the “sacred vote” is effectively optional? The people&#39;s inefficacy is both the cause and the result of the decline of the democratic system. All problems are intertwined to form a vicious cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the system is incompetent and useless, populism, which allows people to share the same hatred and hatred, becomes extremely attractive. However, the author emphasizes very much in the book: populism is not the cause of the decline of democratic systems. Populism does indeed grow stronger when the democratic system is at its most fragile, but don’t forget that populism originally relied on the democratic system and mass mobilization. Forcibly treating populism as the biggest enemy actually ignores the root of the problem. If the democratic system is to be revived and active again, the most important thing to do is to re-inject a sense of achievement into the people and make them believe that the vote in their hands is not a piece of waste paper, but that they can really make a difference because of their vote. And elect a government that is responsible for itself and the country, but how to do it and is it possible? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In their book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, Taylor and others wrote that the democratic system was beyond recovery, but the great philosophers did not just end it irresponsibly. Before they concluded, they wrote that it might be The most important chapter of the book, &quot;What to do?&quot; attempts to propose four life-saving methods for the declining democratic system. I will briefly summarize them here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The primary method is to restart democracy (Renew the Democratic Project). To put it simply and concisely, it is to re-respect the people of every country, because as mentioned before, one of the main reasons for the decline of democracy is that the people feel powerless and angry. For democracy to become an effective system, it must first make the people believe that they are part of the country again. That is to say, everyone&#39;s social background, blood culture, ideology and beliefs can be different, but the premise is that everyone should have the most basic and important thing in common - national identity, and use this identity to identify and transcend. and accommodate their differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is extremely difficult to achieve mutual respect between people. If you look at the long-standing card of &quot;immigration&quot; in Western countries, you will know how divided and exclusionary the reality is. But the author said that the connection between people can be achieved in many ways, and uniting the masses with emotions like populism is one of the ways; similarly, returning to the community and starting to cultivate people&#39;s sense of belonging in the community can also be used to unite the people with emotions. People unite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second way to save democracy is to Overcome Neoliberal Bias against the Public Good. Under marketism, public expenditures have been continuously reduced in recent decades. When the world is at peace, the world is at peace. But when a crisis occurs, public institutions can respond immediately to whatever extent they can withstand it, at the cost of countless lives. Adequate and effective public expenditure is also an important source of people&#39;s sense of belonging to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last two methods: Think Big and It Takes a Movement. Before establishing something, we must first break it. Since the democratic system is now outdated and ineffective, more powerful reforms are needed. After reading this, the biggest revelation for readers may not be that democracy can be saved, but that the problem of democratic decline is so serious that it is almost impossible to save, because all the methods mentioned by the author are far from reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to work needs, I recently stayed in Belgium and visited the European Parliament a few days ago. I talked about how the EU&#39;s democratic system is innovative, how to value the opinions of people of all countries, and how to embody the practice of democracy. But the reality is that Belgium is like other European and American cities: there are many homeless people on the streets, and there are people (and more than one) begging on every subway ride. I tried two rides back and forth on the same day, and I met the same person. A beggar is really destined, and I lament that my fate in Belgium actually fell on a beggar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should I do? If you ignore various social problems, you will naturally not be able to gain the trust of the people. So is this book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; worthless and just to release emotions? Not really. Do you remember the key point mentioned at the beginning of the book? Democracy is a &quot;telic concept&quot;. The ultimate democracy is just a goal. The people can always look at the benchmark and run straight. Even if we can never reach the benchmark, we can still get closer to the benchmark. distance between. Human beings grow old, sick and die, and governments and regimes come and go. If we can walk in the direction of democracy and freedom and try our best to bring the goal closer instead of farther away, even if it is only a small amount, it is considered progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 12:25:19 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“脱钩是一种‘双输’战略”：专访奥地利前总理沃尔夫冈·许塞尔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261950]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:35:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I need a cup of coffee.&quot; At noon on December 3, 2023, before the official interview began, Xussel Again, stress this to your assistant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From December 1st to 3rd, 78-year-old former Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel spent three busy days in Guangzhou. Opening speeches, media meetings, parallel forum speeches... his schedule is filled with &quot;brain activities&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his first time to participate in the &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &quot;This is an open discussion, very interesting and exciting.&quot; Xussel told Southern Weekend reporters, and &quot;people read and wrote &quot;Good speech&quot; is different. This is a conversation with controversy, &quot;both positive and negative, and people express their own opinions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are representatives from different countries here. Whether they are Europeans, Americans, or Chinese, everyone can participate. This makes it possible for people to reflect on their existing positions, understand new ideas, and gain enlightenment.&quot; Xu Sai I said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 40 years, Xussel has visited China more than ten times and witnessed China&#39;s &quot;incredible development.&quot; Xussel is friendly to China and values ​​relations with China. During his term as prime minister from 2002 to 2007, the trade volume between China and Austria doubled several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, against the background of tense Sino-US relations, voices such as &quot;decoupling theory&quot; and &quot;deglobalization&quot; have become increasingly popular, casting a shadow on China-EU cooperation. Schüssel said he was &quot;totally opposed to decoupling&quot; because it was globalization and international trade that brought affluence and prosperity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. And decoupling is a &#39;lose-lose&#39; strategy.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;At noon on December 3, Wolfgang Schüssel accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

In the past, China did not have free movement, free enterprise, private ownership and private property, but today the situation is completely different and China is developing in a positive direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination is very interesting. Usually we believe that market economy, free enterprise, private companies, etc., are complementary to freedom, openness, and pluralistic democracy. China, on the other hand, shows a different model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the Communist Party has a certain dynamic, an elitist management approach. They take the best and most talented people and then put those people to the test. If these people are successful, then they will be assigned to different positions again and then enter the next stage. This is a very interesting model. It&#39;s not our model, but it&#39;s a very effective model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How does Europe view the rise of China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, the European people respect China’s peaceful rise very much. I am an economist. I remember when Deng Xiaoping came to power, China&#39;s GDP was less than 200 billion US dollars. Today, that number is $7 trillion. This is incredible growth. China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and their living conditions have now greatly improved. The “One Belt, One Road” initiative proposed by China is also playing an important role. So I think China plays an important role on the international stage and has huge influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have great respect and admiration for the Chinese model. Of course, we have different views on our respective political systems, that&#39;s for sure. But no matter what, every country has the right to choose its own future, and China does not belong to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent times, Europe’s voice on China has not been positive. What is the reason behind this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, one million people have been killed or disabled in the past two years. Mostly young people. Every day, missiles and drones rain down on Ukraine, destroying infrastructure, homes, and apartments. Today, the area where the battle was fought looks like the moon, a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I think both Europe and China should use their influence to stop this war and respect the sovereignty of independent countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Decoupling&quot; is a &quot;lose-lose&quot; strategy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What do you think? &quot;Decoupling theory&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am completely opposed to decoupling. it&#39;s out of the question. It is globalization and international trade that bring affluence and prosperity. According to customs figures, global trade has exploded over time. Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. So (decoupling) is absolutely impossible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some research suggests that when decoupling actually occurs, it will cause a loss of more than 7% of global GDP. For countries that are more deeply integrated into global supply chains, decoupling will do more harm. Like China or Austria, Europe and the United States. Therefore, decoupling is really a “lose-lose” strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Are de-risking and decoupling the same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;De-risking is different. I know some people suggest that these two statements are consistent, but in fact they are not the same. De-risking refers to the reluctance of people to rely heavily on a single partner. Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Suddenly, we saw a shortage of medical equipment. Moreover, due to the trade blockade, all channels have been closed. We have no medicines from India and no masks from China. De-risking means you have to leave some protection areas in place to protect your people, just in case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, in terms of energy, we cannot completely rely on Russia. We have to diversify our sources. If someone blew up the pipeline in Austria, or Ukraine or Russia stopped the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, everything would be ruined. No energy, no electricity, you can imagine what that means for the economy. So, you have to diversify. China is also de-risking. China needs to maintain sovereignty in data, supply chains, etc. This is completely understandable, and we will do the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is national defense. The Europeans have outsourced national defense to the Americans. Trump said that we will eventually leave NATO and Europe will be responsible for itself. This is what de-risking means. We have to invest more in our own defense because in a crisis you have to protect your own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should you do if you suddenly encounter cyber hackers, surprise attacks, or blockades? What about your government, your site, your hospital, your energy company? Just like a company, we analyze potential risks in all directions of the company from a professional perspective - including paying attention to usage context, technical risks, external risks, market risks, etc. Every company will protect itself from risks, and the government must do the same . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent years, China has emphasized high-level opening up. What opportunities do you think this will bring? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think China’s opening up to the outside world is very important. Two factors struck me during the discussions at this conference. The first one is that a Chinese friend suggested that China is now focusing on developing a unified domestic market, such as managing the financial market, allocation, lending standards, etc. in all provinces with the same rules. This is exactly what the EU has always wanted to do but has not quite done yet. And once we complete that, it will be a huge catalyst for new growth. So, China is also following the same path. If China provides a large-scale market for its consumers and industrial partners, this is a major benefit for all of us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point is that China is now committed to developing regional trade with ASEAN countries, which will also help Europe. Because I know that many companies in Europe are also interested in establishing ties with ASEAN countries. In many cases, people cannot accurately tell where a product comes from. For example, if you look at my smartphone, it contains 700-800 different components. They may be from Vietnam, Thailand, China, the United States, etc. As another example, my Audi car is made up of 900 different parts. It&#39;s assembled in Mexico, its engine comes from Slovakia, the gasoline comes from Hungary, parts come from China, and some elements come from Germany. So, this isn&#39;t just a &quot;German car&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think this kind of inter-regional cooperation is beneficial. Moreover, cooperation enhances neighborly relations. For example, the EU intends to integrate the Western Balkan countries into the EU. Thirty years ago, a bloody war broke out in the Balkans. If Serbia develops cooperative trade with Croatia, Slovenia, etc., it will &quot;force&quot; peace. Therefore, I believe that inter-regional cooperation is conducive to prosperity, conducive to peace, and conducive to a harmonious future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“In short, we need to cooperate”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2020, Austria’s first trip from The China-Europe train from Vienna to Xi&#39;an sets off. How do you evaluate the impact of China-Europe freight trains on Austria? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China-Europe freight trains are very important. Shipping containers by rail is much faster and more environmentally friendly than shipping by sea. Although shipping is cheap, it does have more negative impacts in terms of environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. So in my opinion, rail transportation is one of the elements of the future, which can both reduce costs and make cooperation more effective. Such applications have been very successful in Germany. If you look at the actual data, you will find that trade is growing positively, and it is not the so-called &quot;deglobalization&quot; or &quot;decoupling&quot; trend. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the changes in Sino-US relations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;First of all, 80% of the world’s population is neither Chinese nor American. Therefore, I think Sino-US cooperation is not the only cooperation that both sides need. I think we should really work on promoting cooperation between Europe and China. Currently, we are looking for and working hard to develop together. By the way, same interests as China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a multipolar world requires well-functioning institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. This is important, if something goes wrong, arbitration is always better than bilateral tensions and that is in our interest. First, it is important to resume military engagement because no one wants to cause an accident, but it can happen. Likewise, what we need is a multipolar world, not a bipolar world. This could be beneficial to all of us if there were some effectively functioning international institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few weeks ago, the heads of state of China and the United States met in San Francisco, and I felt very optimistic about it. This is a positive step towards cooperation. We should look forward to a positive and bright future, because the world needs such a future, and we are also facing common problems, such as climate change, financial problems, inflation, regional conflicts, etc. All in all, we need to work together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Do you think Austria or Europe will choose sides? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge. I trust the leaders on both sides, they are rational politicians. I believe that good political initiatives always have the welfare of the people at heart. And the happiness of the people means prosperity, it means peace, it means employment, it means a good position when competing with other countries - of course in a peaceful and economic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this conference, we honor Henry Kissinger. He is one of the architects of such a good policy. He was born in Germany and was deported. (He) came to the United States as a refugee from Nazi Germany but became a historian and an advocate for peaceful cooperation. Not confrontation, but working together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recently commemorated the late Premier of China, Li Keqiang.
