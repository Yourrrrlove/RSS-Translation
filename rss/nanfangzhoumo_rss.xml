There are also many people who are eager to travel and use third-party platforms&#39; &quot;Light Speed ​​Ticket Grabbing&quot; and &quot;Ticket Grabbing Magic Tool&quot;. Tickets usually cost extra. In this regard, Railway 12306 issued a statement through its official Weibo, stating that it has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statement said: &quot;Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only are there traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, bundled sales services, etc., but there may also be risks of personal information leakage. Please Passengers must purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the true meaning of this statement? Will &quot;ticket-grabbing tools&quot; lose their market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must understand why for many years, it is difficult to get a ticket for high-speed rail on many lines during long holidays. But first, starting from this year, the shortage of tickets on some lines may change. And turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use intensity of high-speed rail passengers on different lines is different. Some lines are more popular, with constant demand for commuting, business travel, tourism, etc., and there are many trains every day, such as between cities in the Pearl River Delta or Yangtze River Delta regions. There are lines between major urban agglomerations, as well as lines to popular attractions; some lines are not so popular and have relatively few flights. During the long holidays, in order to cope with the surge in travel demand, the high-speed rail will open some additional trains. However, it is obvious that the former will increase the absolute demand and relative demand much more, but the potential for additional operations is limited; the latter has great potential for additional operations, but the increase demand is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, for a long time, most high-speed rail lines have had the same price during normal times and long holidays, which often leads to the following consequences: when demand is low during normal times, the fare is higher than the market equilibrium price; during long holidays When demand increases sharply, ticket prices are significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, causing tickets to sell out as soon as they are released. The National Railway is well aware of this situation, so it is also making improvements to make fares more market-oriented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway began to implement floating fares. The highest second-class fare for the entire journey was 598 yuan, an increase of 8%; the lowest fare was 498 yuan, a decrease of 10%, that is, the upper limit was increased. , the lower limit is lowered, which is the first time in the nine years since the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway was opened that a floating fare mechanism has been implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from May 30, 2023, the railway department will conduct &quot;fare inspections&quot; on many high-speed rail lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity, Nanjing-Hangzhou High-speed Railway, Nan-Guangzhou High-speed Railway, Jiaoji Passenger Line, and Liunan Passenger Line. &quot;Optimization adjustment&quot;, the upper limit is the published fare, the lower limit is 34% of the published fare, the upper limit is further increased, the lower limit is lowered, and the floating range is further relaxed. Taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity as an example, the published fare for second-class seats from Nanjing Station to Shanghai Station is 166 yuan, which is the highest fare after adjustment, an increase of 19% from the pre-adjusted fare of 139.5 yuan; the lowest fare is 110 yuan. The fare dropped by 21% from the 139.5 yuan before adjustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to raising and floating the fare caps on some popular lines, the railway department has also launched discount tickets. China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group announced that &quot;in order to facilitate intercity passengers&#39; business travel and commuting travel&quot;, starting from June 20, 2023, the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Tanzhou Intercity Railway will officially launch regular tickets and time-counted tickets. Passengers can Take the S-shaped train running on the route at the designated departure station. Take the 60-time/30-day regular ticket from Chengdu East to Chongqing West priced at 5,852 yuan, which is equivalent to 97.5 yuan per time, which is close to the lowest operating fare for ordinary tickets, with a discount of up to 52%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general trend is that the pricing strategy of high-speed rail is in line with that of airplanes. Unless there is an emergency, as long as you buy a ticket some time in advance, you can basically buy a ticket, and even the price is very favorable. This is because the air ticket will be set at a high &quot;original price&quot;, which is much higher than the market equilibrium most of the time. The price does not go up, but only goes down, with discounts of 30% or 40% off, giving passengers a sense of gain. This is a pricing strategy that is purely market-oriented and accurately grasps the psychology of passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pricing strategy of high-speed trains is completely copied from that of air tickets. Starting from September 15th, high-speed trains will go on sale during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays. When purchasing tickets, many people found that compared with normal times, some high-speed trains and trains and trains increased significantly during the National Day holiday. A passenger posted on social media that a dormitory ticket from Beijing to Shenzhen only costs 1,150 yuan on weekdays, but on September 28 the upper berth price increased to 1,860 yuan and the lower berth price increased to 2,090 yuan. On the same day, the lowest direct fare from Beijing to Shenzhen is 1,100 yuan (excluding tax). On the official website, the published fare for Beijing to Shenzhen is 2,264 yuan, with discounts of 1,860 yuan and 2,090 yuan, approximately 12% off and 92% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, floating fares are not yet implemented on all lines. If you cannot get tickets during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, it only means that the fares are still low relative to demand. For this line Either fixed fares are still being implemented, or floating fares are not in place. This is the explanation from economics. And this means that the &quot;ticket-grabbing artifact&quot; still has room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essence of &quot;ticket grabbing artifacts&quot; is digital scalpers. When the official price of a commodity is significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, the price difference is &quot;unowned income&quot;, and many people are motivated to compete for this. In terms of income, scalpers are one of them. Those who are diligent and queue up early to earn hard money, and those who have the skills to get insider tickets will share the income with insiders. Digital scalpers are also scalpers, but if a third-party platform claims to have &quot;priority to purchase tickets&quot;, it is a lie. If you buy an acceleration package, they will help you buy tickets at 12306. In this sense, clarification from the railways is necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, using algorithms and apps to grab tickets is definitely faster than hand speed. This is the market niche of the “ticket grabbing artifact”. The railway department&#39;s clarification cannot persuade passengers who are eager to return home and are eager to get tickets. Of course, 12306 can ban certain IPs or even the App itself that frequently brushes tickets, but it is also difficult to completely exclude machine ticket purchases, leaving only hand ticket purchases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, &quot;As long as there is room for profit, technology will continue to evolve.&quot; Therefore, the fundamental solution is to further marketize fares so that passengers’ bids reflect their demand intensity as much as possible. In this way, people who really want to go somewhere can always go there if they can&#39;t wait for a whole day. Those who don&#39;t mind delaying for a day or two can also save a lot of money and get what they want; the high-speed rail can also make more money to pay for the operating costs of the high-speed rail. , cost and even bank principal and interest, digital scalpers naturally have no room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[汪顺破纪录夺金：看看这个成绩，还行吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 18:57:22&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/QlfWjfuC6wKHukCvJfShO65Zew6GziVEFjCHXCWb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QlfWjfuC6wKHukCvJfShO65Zew6GziVEFjCHX CWb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun in the competition &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;1:54.62&quot;, Wang Shun is far ahead in the swimming pool, followed by continuous Cheering and cheering, the big screen gave a more accurate record. On September 24, 2023, in the men&#39;s 200-meter medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese star Wang Shun broke the Asian record and won the gold medal in 1 minute, 54 seconds and 62 seconds. Qin Haiyang ranked second in 1 minute, 57 seconds and 41 seconds. The Chinese team once again won the gold medal. silver medal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At the Asian Games at home, let the national flag be raised, the national anthem played, and I will do what I say. Compared with the gold medal, I am more happy to break my own Asian record! At the age of 29 , it’s just a number. Those who say I can’t do it, do you think this result is okay?” Wang Shun expressed his feelings through Weibo after the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun was holding back his energy to participate in this Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/emEbmlTytFrG20Di9EvJIEIsqged7cFynD4e9Rz3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;653&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/emEbmlTytFrG20Di9EvJIEIsqged7cFynD4e9Rz3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 30, 2021, in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Tokyo Olympics, Wang Shun celebrated winning &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Flower and countercurrent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The voice that Wang Shun &quot;can&#39;t do it&quot; still existed until the Asian Games. At the World Swimming Championships two months ago, Wang Shun failed to enter the finals in any of the three competitions he signed up for, leaving him far behind his peak form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, in the preliminaries of the Asian Games, Wang Shunyou clocked 1:58.84, which was still far behind his 11th place finish at the World Championships (1:57.97). Teammate Qin Haiyang ranked first 0.12 seconds ahead of Wang Shun and advanced to the finals that night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final final, Wang Shun led the way and won the gold medal, and at the same time broke the Asian record (1 minute 55 seconds 00) held by him, which was previously set by him at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s like I (can) swim,&quot; Wang Shun and the story of this blue swimming pool began in the summer when he was 5 years old. He followed his father to the swimming pool for the first time. When he saw his father jumping into the pool, he jumped in immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The body sank and he was scrambling to grab something. Wang Shun quickly choked on the water, but he didn’t feel scared. “I didn’t feel like I was choking on the water and wanted to stay away from it. Instead, I wanted to To conquer it. Perhaps, I have a natural affinity for water. In the water, I feel unprecedented happiness and relaxation, and I feel like a fish in the water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun&#39;s past achievements are indeed marked by the feeling of being like a fish in the water. : Born in Ningbo, Zhejiang in 1994. In 2007, he was selected by coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the first team of Zhejiang Province. In 2009, he followed coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the second team of the Chinese swimming team. In the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, he became the runner-up in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley; in 2016 In 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley at the FINA Short Course Swimming World Championships and won China&#39;s first world championship in men&#39;s medley; on July 30, 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley championship at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in water, it’s not always possible to go downstream. After winning the Tokyo Olympics, Wang Shun lost his goal and felt that he could no longer get happiness from swimming. Raising the national flag and playing the national anthem at the Olympic Games has been Wang Shun&#39;s ultimate goal in his sports career of more than 20 years. He has long said, &quot;Athletes must have clear goals.&quot; From national champion to world champion, and then to Olympic champion, he has improved his competitive performance step by step. &quot;I always encourage myself to achieve good results.&quot; It&#39;s hard won, it&#39;s all step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252116&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, Chinese player Wang Shun (right) shook hands with teammate Qin Haiyang after the game&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the cheers, there was confusion without a goal. Looking back at the glorious moments in the past, Wang Shun said: &quot;Olympic championship has always been the ultimate goal pursued by all athletes. Before winning the Olympic championship, it took me more than 20 years to establish this goal and work unswervingly towards it. Let&#39;s go. After winning the championship, I found that the goal had dissipated and all the sources of motivation would disappear. I had to set new goals again, which was more difficult. I spent a year to re-establish the goals and then go Hit the peak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 2023, World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. Wang Shun feels that he has regained his motivation, hoping to forget the halo of the Olympic champion, continue to surpass himself, and fill the last gap in his gold medal Grand Slam (Olympic Games, Asian Games, Short Course World Championships and Long Pond World Championships) - Long Pond World Championships Tournament champion. However, Wang Shun ranked 16th in the men&#39;s 200-meter medley preliminaries of this competition and was almost eliminated; he ranked 11th in the semi-finals and missed the finals. In the 400-meter medley, he was disqualified due to a foul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Wang Shun okay? Such questions come from the outside world and from his heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval from the Fukuoka World Championships to the Hangzhou Asian Games was less than two months, and Wang Shun has been adjusting his condition. He is 29 years old this year and this is his fourth time participating in the Asian Games. At the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun was still a newcomer. It was the first time he stood on the stage of the Asian Games and competed in the same swimming pool with his Asian opponents. Looking back today, he is &quot;still full of enthusiasm.&quot; But Wang Shun is no longer just a passionate novice. He has reached his peak, experienced ups and downs over a long period of time, and finally chose to jump into the swimming pool again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;619&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252115&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming competition held at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Natatorium in Zhejiang Province, Chinese player Wang Shun won 1 point Winning the championship with a time of 54.62 seconds &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;He has to look at it carefully&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun was still a child when he first faced the choice of swimming pool. At that time, he was studying painting and doing well, and at the same time he received an olive branch from the swimming team. Should he choose to become a professional swimmer? There was no such precedent in his family. It was instinctive and risky, so he chose the swimming pool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Swimming has always given me a sense of progress.” As an adult, Wang Shun explained his choice this way. When time passed long enough, he experienced and felt more and more the other side of swimming: boring, repetitive, and self-confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swim in the 50-meter-long, 25-meter-wide swimming pool with 8 lanes, and take the trouble to go back and forth between the starting point and the end point again and again. He said: &quot;Swimming is a relatively boring sport. During competition and daily training, you rarely communicate with others. The only thing you can hear is the water sliding towards you, and the sound flowing through your ears is the most intimate thing for me. partners.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun once accidentally said in an interview that for 7 months in 2022, he would train at the base, just like building blocks. Every day he would start with basic training and train in one class. The class swims 13,000-16,000 meters, and sometimes there are two or three training classes in a row, including reaching the edge, turning around, rolling, and returning, and a complete set of water movements are repeated in a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His hands looked thin, with sharp knuckles, but rough calluses formed on the palms. During the first two years of training, the skin on his hands would wrinkle from being soaked in water for too long. Over time, the body gradually adapts, and &quot;the apparent reaction is basically gone.&quot; Long-term, fixed training also changed his daily routine. &quot;When I was on vacation, I was fine one day, but if I didn&#39;t go to the swimming pool the next day, I would feel uncomfortable all over. As long as I get to the swimming pool, I will feel very comfortable. Now I have such an emotion towards water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In addition to physical training, facing one&#39;s own heart is also a required course in this track. At the 2019 World Championships, Wang Shun was very eager to win a gold medal, but he did not even perform at his normal level. At the Military World Games three months later, Wang Shun&#39;s desire remained unabated, &quot;I must prove myself.&quot; He desperately increased the difficulty of training, but as a result, his lungs ruptured and he developed a pneumothorax due to excessive training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treatment plan given by the doctor at that time was to inhale oxygen for one hour a day, but he hoped to recover as soon as possible and bring glory to the country, so he started to inhale oxygen for two hours a day. Even so, the doctor still recommended that he give up the game and rest for a week. He refused. After lying in bed for five days, he returned to the training ground and tried his best in the next day&#39;s game to win the championship. Now when he recalls the situation at that time, he still feels sad: &quot;There are many things that you may not be able to see. To me, it&#39;s like risking your life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;774&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 23, 2023 , the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, torchbearer Wang Shun and digital torchbearers jointly lit the main torch &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that The peak moment is the Tokyo Olympics. On the day he won the championship, Wang Shun wrote on Weibo: &quot;Although my name is Shun, it is actually not smooth. Today I want to say to my coach that I have fulfilled our agreement! Winning the championship is not the end. Walking off the podium, Everything starts from scratch, see you in Paris...&quot; From the bronze medal in Rio to the gold medal in Tokyo, Wang Shun described the feeling as &quot;indescribable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I want to look at it carefully,” Wang Shun said. The gold medal is very heavy, which is a recognition of himself for so many years. It, what I am for - it is for it that I keep fighting. I feel that it is much heavier than I imagined. Although everyone only sees a gold medal, my life is included in it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;After the peak, he experienced a trough, and at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun once again proved himself with a fuller mentality. In an interview after the game, when asked if it exceeded expectations, Wang Shun said, &quot;It exceeded expectations. It was expected to be within 56 seconds, but I didn&#39;t expect that it would break the Asian record today.&quot; A reporter joked, &quot;Did the ignition yesterday give you strength?&quot; &quot; Wang Shun replied: It was the elders in my hometown who gave me strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just the night before winning the championship, on September 23, at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun and the &quot;Digital Human Torchbearers&quot; lit the main torch of the Asian Games together. As the last torch bearer, he Become a live witness of a classic scene in Asian Games history. The arena also witnessed the ups and downs of Wang Shun&#39;s swimming career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on this long journey, what is the greatest satisfaction as an athlete?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun once answered in an interview, &quot;After you try your best, you improve by 0.1 (second) Or the happiness that 0.01 seconds brings to you, this is the greatest sense of satisfaction I can create. This sense of satisfaction is not coherent, no one can keep improving, the feeling is intermittent, some are good and some are bad, just like Just like an electrocardiogram, there are ups and downs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He likes the small moments on the field, &quot;When you look back at the results on the big screen, you realize that your best time has improved by 0.1 (second) , 0.2 (seconds) or 0.01 (seconds), 0.02 seconds, at that moment, you will feel that the training during this period of time has not been in vain. 0.1 seconds may have challenged your own limits, and also challenged the limits of human beings.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the pre-match interview of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the reporter asked: What does swimming mean to you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun replied: &quot;I loved swimming when I was a child, but now it is more of a responsibility. The Olympic championship is just a new starting point. I have to work harder for Chinese swimming. I hope I can be at home.&quot; We achieved good results at the Hangzhou Asian Games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this result, as Wang Shun thought, he will continue to swim for a longer period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Reference materials: &quot;Glass Magazine&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Metropolitan Express&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>; &lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大凉山11网红锒铛入狱：虚假助农的流量骗局]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257623]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/fCrq1aEqoZtFKFQvO3eQ2mgPihFz8XyVEf8mlo7M.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/fCrq1aEqoZtFKFQvO3eQ2mgPihFz 8XyVEf8mlo7M. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252100&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liangshan, Sichuan, Atuleer Village, Zhiermo Township, Zhaojue County, a local Villagers live broadcast on their way down the mountain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time fans learned about the fate of these Daliangshan Internet celebrities who suddenly disappeared was in 2023 At the press conference of Liangshan’s “Series of Internet Celebrities Live Broadcasting Cases” on September 20, 2019, they were no longer able to update their daily life videos as usual. Recently, many Internet celebrities in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province have been jailed for false advertising and selling fake goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the days after the shock, the aftermath still affected the live broadcast rooms of some Liangshan anchors. People question, who are the locals? What are the local products? Which are the true stories? What is script arrangement? Since the rise of short video platforms, users have curiously turned their perspectives to the countryside and no longer have to imagine life in a different place in their minds. Through the lens of local people, people saw the scenery and culture, and also ate fruits and vegetables sent from the local area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the relevant departments of Liangshan Prefecture launched a special campaign to &quot;clarify and strictly rectify the &#39;self-media&#39; chaos&quot; and disclosed &quot;miserable auctions&quot;, &quot;false aid to farmers&quot;, &quot;fake charity&quot;, etc. Violations of laws and regulations; 54 suspects were arrested, including 11 Internet celebrity anchors involved, 5 MCN institutions were destroyed, and 14 companies involved were seized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the most attention-grabbing ones are that accounts with more than 2 million followers including &quot;Xiao Yu&quot;, &quot;Zhao Ling&#39;er&quot;, &quot;Liangshan Qubu&quot; and &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; have been permanently suspended.

In less than a year, the number of followers of the two accounts &quot;Zhao Ling&#39;er&quot; and &quot;Liangshan Qubu&quot; has exceeded 2 million, and they have brought goods to cash.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of some fans, Qu Bu was deceived. A Sannong video blogger named &quot;Wang Ershuai&quot; who is familiar with these Daliangshan Internet celebrities explained in a live broadcast on the evening of September 22, &quot;I just said that I was bribed with money.&quot; &quot;Everything they did was negotiated.&quot; He gave an example. After selling for 10 million, the company received 3 million, but the boss took away the majority, and Qu Bu got 500,000 to 600,000. Zhao Ling&#39;er was a little higher than Qu Bu. , &quot;You are an amateur. You are nothing. You used to tighten screws in a factory. Will you do anything if I am given such a platform?&quot; You can’t make so much money by tightening screws for a lifetime.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge, a agriculture video blogger who has been in the industry for many years, told Southern Weekend reporters that some agriculture bloggers around him would hire local actors to perform. This is A semi-public secret in the industry, &quot;It costs a few hundred yuan to hire an actor. Some actors are quite expensive and you can&#39;t even hire them for a few hundred yuan.&quot; (Because) If you call any farmer or ordinary person, it will be obvious in front of the camera. Many people have camera phobia. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge said that some professional actors cost about one or two thousand yuan to shoot one or two jokes, but there are more “temporary hires”. These jokes are similar: meeting local farmers and having kind conversations, expressing He acted like he was helping others, and paired it with tragic music. &quot;As soon as the music started, everyone thought this anchor was awesome, really good. &quot;Using the same routine, bloggers started to tour the country, going to Hainan Island to sell pineapples, to Fujian to sell grapefruits, etc. Such live broadcast rooms have good data and high sales.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Internet celebrities from Daliang Mountain We were not satisfied with this, and implemented &quot;iterative upgrades&quot; based on the above-mentioned conventional routines.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2022, Zhao Ling&#39;er appeared for the first time as a young man who returned to his hometown to help farmers and start businesses. &quot;Qubu, a simple young man from the Yi ethnic group in Liangshan, began the story of Daliang Mountain. Zhao Ling&#39;er emphasized that he and Qubu met by chance. &quot;There is no team, let alone the capital and packaging of a big company as everyone talks about.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Just three months ago, Xiao Yu, a &quot;philanthropic blogger&quot; who claimed to be shooting in Daliang Mountain, also &quot;stumbled into the depths of lotus flowers&quot; and met the simple and hard-working &quot;Four Girls of Liangshan&quot;.

Both are about encountering a single ethnic minority young man by chance, going to a stranger&#39;s house for dinner, killing a chicken to entertain him, taking out the bacon, and talking about the poor family situation during the meal. Established a deep friendship and created a relationship of assistance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, &quot;Little Zhongxing China&quot; also posted a video in October 2022, meeting &quot;Shiyi&quot;, a Yi girl from Daliang Mountain . It is reported that, like Zhao Ling&#39;er and Qu Bu, Eleven also signed a contract with this MCN organization in Chengdu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, Xiaoyu published an oral story in the self-media &quot;Interview with Real People&quot; . He claimed to be from Shangqiu, Henan Province. He started engaging in e-commerce in 2018 and earned 1 million yuan in one year. He was initially inspired by the story of the &quot;Cliff Village&quot; in Daliang Mountain. After going there, he found that the rattan ladders had turned into steel bars.

Filming and live broadcast site. Local villager Hai Laihaqu said in an interview, &quot;One day the lights suddenly came on in the old house that no one could live in, and I later found out that they were filming videos and live broadcasts there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;When Xiaoyu was delivering supplies in Daliang Mountain, a local photographer asked to take pictures. &quot;What surprised me was that I only spent seven or eight thousand yuan on the last batch of supplies, but netizens gave rewards or gifts for the total amount About ten to twenty thousand. &quot;Xiaoyu has since tasted the sweetness and plunged into Daliang Mountain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 22, 2022, Chengdu Xiaoyu Zhunong Media Co., Ltd. was established. A month later, Zhao Ling&#39;er&#39;s account released an encounter with Qubu video. Qubu is similar to Ding Zhen, who became popular in 2020. They are both from remote villages, with dark skin, handsome face and innocent smile. He is considered to have the potential of an internet celebrity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Ershuai remembered that when he first came to Daliang Mountain, Xiao Yu told him that if he wanted to truly understand the people in the mountains, he had to eat and live here. Make friends with them for a little money.&quot; According to media reports, Xiaoyu&#39;s team did not communicate much with local villagers in Daliang Mountain, but when they needed villagers to appear on camera, they would give them some money. They rented several local houses and They grow corn on the land and cook on the mountain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter asked Wang Ershuai in the live broadcast room how to tell the authenticity of Internet celebrities. Wang Ershuai replied: &quot;You can tell the difference clearly after watching it too much.&quot; Come on... you can analyze it yourself. I can tell you about the things that have been revealed now. I will not talk about the things that have not been revealed. After all, people still rely on this thing to make a living and make money. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QgOxEPgrynEebvrA1wH3Ncg4n5GaWwYF4MRzSaUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QgOxEPgrynEebvrA1wH3Ncg4n5GaWwYF4MRzSaUQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252099&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;With the support of short video platforms for content that helps farmers, Daliang Mountain has become a traffic hotspot.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The track selected by traffic&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xiaoyu is not the earliest Daliangshan Internet celebrity. The Liangshan Public Security Bureau discovered that since 2020 , Tang Mou, the head of Chengdu Aowei Culture Media Co., Ltd. (MCN Organization), used scripts, staged shots, etc. to incubate &quot;Liangshan Mengyang&quot; (Axi Moumou, female) with more than three million fans on the short video platform.

Meng Yang dropped out of school early and worked in Guangdong. Villagers believe that Meng Yang’s fortune is inseparable from “meeting a good boss.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police stated that the above-mentioned illegal and criminal acts are well-organized and confusing. The case is strong and involves a wide range of areas, forming a gray industrial chain of counterfeiting and selling in recent years, including front-end creation of characters, incubation of Internet celebrities, mid-end script shooting, e-commerce operations, end-end supply of agricultural products, and traffic realization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Why are these MCN institutions so keen on &quot;mining gold&quot; in Daliang Mountain?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin, a senior practitioner of agricultural products e-commerce, analyzed that Daliang Mountain is a natural reservoir of products and traffic. First of all, Daliang Mountain&#39;s The products have become popular among Internet celebrities; secondly, the topic of Daliang Mountain caters to traffic, “Daliang Mountain has ethnic minorities, beautiful scenery, and rich cultural heritage. People are rare for these few things, which solves the biggest traffic problem. &quot; Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The economic development of Daliang Mountain is relatively slower than that of coastal areas, and with the attribute of helping farmers, this matter will develop more logically. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Daliang Mountain, but also Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, places with “products, scenery, people, and culture” are sought after.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge believes: &quot;It&#39;s more credible to shoot there. There must be a choice. Why doesn&#39;t anyone choose to go to Zhejiang to help farmers? &quot;According to his many years of experience in carrying goods in the countryside, many short video bloggers like Meng Yang are suspected of exaggerating the misery of the countryside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A farmer practitioner from a mountainous area in the north told Southern Weekend reporter, people always have a prejudice against mountainous areas. In fact, including the business environment, some local things may be better than those in developed cities, but these have no attention and traffic. &quot;There is no electricity in mountainous areas in xx&quot;, this topic is With traffic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supporting farmers has become the focus of short video platforms. On September 12, the first &quot;Kuaishou Light Chasing Conference&quot; announced the launch of Kuaishou Village Broadcasting &quot;Stars Project&quot;, which will be launched in the next three years.

Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, Anhui and Sichuan have become the agricultural products on the platform. Businesses originate from the top five provinces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police released the script of the MCN agency’s agriculture and rural areas video, which includes “collecting mountain goods”. For example, Shiyi and her cousin went to local villagers with scales, bags, backpacks, etc. Collect mountain goods at home.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of rural areas and farmers caters to the traffic algorithm of short video platforms in disguise. Nie Wenchang, chairman of an e-commerce group in Shandong, established one of the first live broadcast bases in Linyi. He told Southern Weekend reporters Analysis, &quot;The popularity will be high after the script is written. It is done according to some rules of the platform to boost the popularity. &quot; He said that the theme of rural life has broad resonance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin believes that the reason why these videos are popular is that they trigger the platform&#39;s mechanism, &quot;data feedback, not human feedback.&quot; Data indicators determine this If it is a &quot;good&quot; video, more traffic will be injected. Judging from the logic of the platform, the speed of fans accumulation of Daliangshan Internet celebrities is normal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters that these scripts There is a lack of normal life logic, and the routines are not new, but short videos are often driven by emotions and do not need to think about logic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Daliangshan internet celebrity incident, Southern Weekend reporters called several farmers-helping culture The phone calls of media companies may not be connected, or they may remain silent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Looks like helping farmers, but is actually selling goods&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Using false personas to attract people After becoming fans, the above-mentioned companies will open online stores and live broadcast to sell goods.

The &quot;Opinions&quot; also stipulate that there are those who commit cyber violence against minors and disabled people, organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to commit cyber violence, fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics to infringe on the human dignity of others, and use &quot;deep synthesis&quot; and other generative methods If artificial intelligence technology releases illegal information, or if network service providers initiate or organize cyber violence, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is to clarify the boundaries between illegal crimes and legal behaviors of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that reporting or exposing other people&#39;s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks should not be considered a defamation crime as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly spread the facts to be fabricated. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth is to clarify the work requirements for public security organs to assist in evidence collection. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, in cases where the victim files a private prosecution for online insult or defamation, if the people&#39;s court determines after review that it is indeed difficult for the victim to provide evidence, it may request the public security organs to provide assistance. The &quot;Opinions&quot; reiterate the provisions of the Criminal Law, and also clarify that the public security organs should promptly identify the perpetrators of online insults and slander according to the requirements of the People&#39;s Court and the specific circumstances of the case, and collect evidence and materials such as the spread and spread of relevant information and the impact caused. Network service providers shall provide necessary technical support and assistance for public security organs to obtain evidence in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth is to clarify the public prosecution standards for criminal cases of online insult and defamation. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, those who commit crimes of insult or slander and seriously endanger social order and national interests shall be prosecuted in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that in cases of online insult and defamation, public prosecution procedures will apply if one of the following circumstances occurs: (1) causing serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives, and causing a bad impact on society; (2) arbitrarily using The general public is the target of infringement, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously disrupting the order of the Internet, and having a bad impact on society; (3) Insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times, causing social harm Those with a bad impact; (4) Organizing and instigating people to spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms, with a bad impact on society; (5) Other situations that seriously endanger social order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seventh is to clarify the transition process from private prosecution to public prosecution in criminal cases of online insult and defamation. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that for online insults and slander that seriously endanger social order, the public security organs have filed a case as a public prosecution case, and the victim simultaneously files a private prosecution in the People&#39;s Court, the People&#39;s Court may request the private prosecutor to withdraw the private prosecution or rule not to accept it; it has been accepted If the case is found, a ruling should be made to terminate the trial and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. The original private prosecutor can participate in the lawsuit as a victim. The victim files a private prosecution before the public security organ files a case. If, upon review, the people&#39;s court determines that the relevant online insults and defamation seriously endanger social order, the case shall be transferred to the public security organ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighth, support civil rights protection against online violence in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if cyber violence is committed against others and infringes on others&#39; reputation rights, privacy rights and other personality rights, and the victim requests the perpetrator to bear civil liability, the people&#39;s court will support it in accordance with the law. If the right holder has evidence to prove that the perpetrator is committing or is about to commit an illegal act that infringes upon his or her personality rights, and failure to stop it in time will cause irreparable damage to his or her legitimate rights and interests, the people&#39;s court may, upon the right holder&#39;s application, issue an injunction against infringement of personality rights in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ninth is to clarify the rules for public interest litigation in cases of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if online violence harms public interests, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. If a network service provider fails to perform its information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information, resulting in the large-scale dissemination of illegal information or other serious circumstances that harm the public interest, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. When handling public interest litigation cases in the field of cyber violence control, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may require network service providers to provide necessary technical support and assistance in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tenth is to proactively perform duties and promote comprehensive management of cyber violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that when handling cases of cyber violence, information on the progress of the case should be released to the public in a timely manner in accordance with the law, clarify the truth, and eliminate the adverse effects of cyber violence, so as to reduce the harm to the victims and help the victims get out of their predicaments; carry out legal publicity and give full play to law enforcement The role of rule guidance, value orientation and behavioral norms in handling cases is to educate and guide netizens to consciously abide by the law and lead social civilization; to conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes that promote the occurrence of online violence, promote multi-dimensional co-governance of online violence, and fundamentally reduce online violence occurrence, creating a clear cyberspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一文止步八强，新旧交替的女子重剑队亟待历练]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257567]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEzLcs4MrEYLK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEz Lcs4MrEYLK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251880&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, women&#39;s individual epee four in the fencing event of the Hangzhou Asian Games In the quarter-finals, Chinese player Sun Yiwen (right) lost to South Korean player Song Shiluo 12-14 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;12 to 14, on September 24, the first official competition day of the Hangzhou Asian Games, in the quarter-finals of the women’s individual epee fencing event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese player Sun Yiwen lost to South Korean player Song Se-ra and stopped in the quarterfinals. So far, all Chinese players in this project have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yiwen’s third Asian Games trip. She and her teammates won the women&#39;s epee team championship twice before. At the last Asian Games in Jakarta, Sun Yiwen also reached the finals of individual events, but ultimately lost to South Korean star Kang Young-mi and won a silver medal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This sport pays great attention to variety, balance, game and precision.” A game lasts up to 9 minutes. If you hit at the same time, you must be 1/25 second earlier than the opponent to score. A blink of an eye is 0.75 seconds, which is enough to turn the tide or give up victory. To do this, fencers need to &quot;count one step at a time.&quot; Excellent fencers are often in a &quot;man-sword-in-one&quot; state, that is, under various circumstances, they can hit the opponent&#39;s exposed effective parts (including the torso, legs, feet, hands, arms, and helmets) at the fastest speed and the shortest route. . Behind the &quot;subconscious&quot; sword thrusts again and again is the muscle memory cultivated over many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tokyo Olympic champion Sun Yiwen is the number one Chinese women&#39;s epee player. He has always been good at &quot;stopping with stillness and attacking later.&quot; &quot;Determined, calm, and explosive&quot; is how she sums up her playing style. However, after winning the Tokyo Olympics and Xi&#39;an Games, Sun Yiwen has been trapped by injuries and will not resume training until October 2022 and systematically participate in events. To &quot;find the feeling of starting over&quot;, the road is rough. Sun Yiwen once lamented that he &quot;can&#39;t even play games anymore&quot; and was &quot;very unfamiliar.&quot; It was not until the International Fencing Federation World Cup Barcelona in February 2023 that he gradually regained his form and won two bronze medals in a row, both individual and team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 24, 2021, Sun Yiwen (right) celebrated with his coach after winning the women&#39;s individual epee final in fencing at the Tokyo Olympics&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous interviews with the media, Sun Yiwen once said that winning a gold medal is not necessary for this comeback. After reviewing the schedule performance of the last Olympic Games, she and the coaching staff found that although they won the gold medal, many problems and deficiencies were still exposed in the process. If they can be improved, the state will be better than before. &quot;There is a new coach in the team who has taught me many new ideas and moves. Now I dare to try new moves in the game and explore new areas. This is what makes me most interesting and what makes me happy.&quot; The reason why I decided to stick to another Olympic cycle is that I am still learning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, the Chinese fencing team is facing a transitional period of replacement of old and new players and adjustment of the coaching team. Three-quarters of the athletes participating in the Asian Games have never competed in the Tokyo Olympics. The Hangzhou Asian Games is regarded as an important training opportunity for this young team to prepare for the Paris Olympics. According to the competition plan, the fencing competition of the Hangzhou Asian Games will be held from September 24th to 29th, with a total of 12 gold medals produced. On September 27, Sun Yiwen will also lead his young teammates to continue their pursuit of medals in the women&#39;s epee team competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Zhang Xin, Secretary-General of the Chinese Sports Delegation at the Hangzhou Asian Games and Director of the Competitive Sports Department of the State Sports General Administration, said, the Hangzhou Asian Games is the &quot;high school entrance examination&quot; before the Paris Olympics. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Sun Yiwen will usher in her third Olympic trip in Paris, and before that, she and the young Chinese fencing team still need to overcome many obstacles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 20, 2023, in the 2023 Asian Fencing Championships Women’s Epee Team Third Place Competition held in Wuxi, Jiangsu, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team and won the bronze medal. Chinese team players Tang Junyao (first from left), Lin Sheng (second from left), Zhu Mingye (third from left) and Sun Yiwen took a group photo after the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Behind the &quot;Duel of Swords&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen never considered himself a &quot;talented player&quot;. She attributes her gains in her career to her seriousness and stubbornness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen was born in Wanggezhuang Village, Qixia City, Yantai, Shandong Province in 1992. When she was young, her health was very poor and she would catch a cold every winter. Sun Yiwen&#39;s father, Sun Hongming, is a local village doctor. Under his father&#39;s supervision and company, she has developed the habit of running and exercising since she was a child. Long-term persistence pays off. In elementary school, Sun Yiwen had become the school&#39;s top sports student. When he was 11 years old, Sun Yiwen was selected by the Qixia Sports and Competition School to focus on middle and long-distance running. Two years later, she had grown to 1.66 meters, and her best standing long jump score was over 2.5 meters. Because of her tallness, long wingspan, strong instantaneous explosive power, and being left-handed, she was spotted by Xu Zhaowei, the then head coach of the Yantai City Fencing Team, and officially embarked on the road of fencing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fencing is a project that requires very comprehensive abilities. &quot;Strength, speed, explosive power, endurance, coordination, flexibility, and thinking&quot;, none of them can be missing. The initial training was hard and boring. Morning training starts at 5:30 in the morning. Basic steps and movements last for several hours. In order to develop their endurance shortcomings, the team members also need to receive additional running training. From Monday to Friday, I run 3,000 meters in the morning and evening, and there is also a 6-kilometer cross-country race on the weekends. If you fail to complete the task within the stipulated time, you will be fined. The longer it takes, the greater the fine. After the high-intensity training during the day, there are cultural classes in the evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a week, Sun Yiwen wanted to give up. In order to comfort and encourage his daughter, Sun Hongming rushed to Yantai from his hometown and stayed with his daughter for two days. After the initial adaptation period, Sun Yiwen, who is physically fit and good at thinking, began to gradually emerge. &quot;Every time I practice an action and I can&#39;t do it, I will carefully review it and think about why. Every time I win or lose a game, I will dig deeper into the underlying logic.&quot; At the 2010 Shandong Provincial Games, the 18-year-old Sun Yiwen represented the Yantai Fencing Team and won 8 gold medals with his teammates. After the competition, she was successfully selected for the provincial fencing team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But life was not smooth. For a long time, because there was no establishment in the provincial team, Sun Yiwen had to pay for outings by himself. Sometimes a game would cost half a year&#39;s salary of my father. At that time, his younger brother was still studying at home, and Sun Hongming and his wife were living in a very tight situation in their hometown. Due to technical and tactical breakthroughs facing bottlenecks, Sun Yiwen was withdrawn from the provincial team twice. Worried that he would not be able to get ahead by practicing fencing, Sun Yiwen once proposed to his father that he should give up fencing and go out to work to support his family as soon as possible. The father knows his daughter&#39;s thoughts well. Just like when he was a child, Sun Hongming sought psychological relief on the one hand, and actively communicated with the coach on the other. In the end, no one gave up. Fortunately, under the advice of her coach, Sun Yiwen began to try to change the gun-handled sword to a straight-handled sword. After that, her hard training finally paid off. For a time, there was no female player in the province who could match her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Sun Yiwen was selected for the national fencing team. In the same year, at the age of 21, she made her debut in international competitions and won the women&#39;s epee World Cup Grand Prix team championship. Two years later, she won her first individual championship at the Italian Fencing World Cup. However, it was the 2021 Tokyo Olympics that really brought Sun Yiwen to the pinnacle of his career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Sun Yiwen, as a &quot;dark horse&quot;, won the individual bronze medal and team silver medal in women&#39;s epee. But with the end of the Rio Olympics, the national women&#39;s fencing team has also undergone earth-shaking changes. At that time, the head coach &quot;Bole&quot; Levavasseur, who had a profound influence on Sun Yiwen&#39;s thinking and technology, resigned, and the main players such as Xu Anqi and Sun Yujie retired. The burden of leading the new team suddenly fell on Sun Yiwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sun Yiwen&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Sun Yiwen was used to &quot; The &quot;second intention&quot; style of play is to first use fake moves to confuse the opponent, and then attack by surprise. However, the successor head coach Yuge Oberly is good at direct offensive tactics, which is exactly Sun Yiwen&#39;s shortcoming. During the running-in period, which lasted for about a year, Sun Yiwen&#39;s performance in competitions has been mediocre. She felt as if she had returned to the state when she had just joined the fencing team at the age of 15, and everything had to start from scratch. &quot;My thoughts and thoughts at that time were completely chaotic, like a ball of knotted hemp rope.&quot; She has experienced too many ups and downs. Sun Yiwen could only encourage himself silently, &quot;This state must be temporary. There will always be low points in life. It depends on how you overcome it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, due to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, Held in 2016, Sun Yiwen adjusted back to his form in time during the Olympic points competition. By blending the strengths of both sets of technical ideas, she developed a new combat style. In the summer of 2021, she won the gold medal in the Tokyo Olympics women&#39;s epee individual finals, defeating Romania&#39;s Popescu, who was ranked number one in the world at the time. The only regret was that in the subsequent team competition, Sun Yiwen was injured and had to be replaced. The Chinese women&#39;s epee team eventually failed to reach the top four of the team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, Sun Yiwen missed several major events in 2022 due to injuries. In an interview with the media in early 2022, she described her injuries this way, &quot;I now have a torn posterior cruciate ligament and water accumulation in my left leg, a knee cyst, a worn meniscus, and a long stretch from the back of my right leg to the knee. Injury. Even if I move a few times or when the weather is bad, my knee will still hurt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many other sports, few people can maintain absolute dominance in the field of fencing. force. In the past year, Sun Yiwen has been participating in the competition while sick due to the lumbosacral pressure on the nerves in her legs. She has been exploring how to coexist with the injury technically and psychologically. At the World Fencing Championships in Milan in July, Sun Yiwen won the bronze medal in the women&#39;s epee individual event. This was her first time winning an individual event medal at the World Championships. In a post-match interview, Sun Yiwen said that this bronze medal was a &quot;heart booster&quot; for her and made her understand that she &quot;can do it&quot; despite injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t care about winning or losing, but I have perseverance. I think I can do things that others can do. Injuries, difficulties and problems are in front of me, and I will never run away from them. I won&#39;t be afraid, I will definitely solve it. The higher you go, the more problems you will encounter.&quot; In Sun Yiwen&#39;s view, the most important lesson her 18-year fencing career has taught her is &quot;not to accept weakness. Don’t admit defeat.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;（参考资料：《博客天下》《GQ报道》、潮新闻、大众网烟台频道、福布斯中国、《精彩OK》《齐鲁晚报》、中国新闻网、《北京日报》、上观新闻等。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从北京、广州到杭州：33年3届亚运会见证中国经济社会发展与国民精神进化丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257571]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, the 19th Asian Games opened in Hangzhou. During the lighting ceremony, a giant &quot;digital man&quot; rushed from outside the venue and lit the main torch together with the real people present, bringing this technologically full opening ceremony to a climax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s not just about digital people igniting fires. This opening ceremony can be said to be the opening ceremony of a sports meeting with the strongest sense of technology to date. A &quot;net screen&quot; with a total length of 185 meters and a height of 20 meters hangs in the air, and a 6,000-square-meter ground screen on the ground turns the &quot;Big Lotus&quot; of the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium into a huge three-dimensional display screen. In addition, with the blessing of naked-eye 3D, AR and other digital technologies, the digital fireworks are dazzling, and the opening performance combines virtual and real scenes, giving it a full sense of the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the third time China has hosted the Asian Games in more than 30 years. The hosting of these three Asian Games also reflects the development process of China&#39;s economic society and national spiritual mentality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, the 11th Asian Games was held in Beijing. This was the first time that China hosted a large-scale international comprehensive sports event. It was also the early stage of China&#39;s reform and opening up. In 1983, China applied to host the Asian Games, hoping to show an image of openness to the outside world. Economically, China&#39;s development was just starting at that time. By 1990, when the Asian Games were held, the country&#39;s total GDP was only 1.89 trillion yuan, less than 360.9 billion U.S. dollars. Its per capita GDP ranked outside the 130th place in the world, and it was also the lowest in Asia. Not forward. At that time, even the preparations for the Asian Games lacked funds, so they had to launch a nationwide fundraising campaign. Tens of millions of people across the country participated and donated a total of 270 million yuan, more than one-tenth of the total investment in the Beijing Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time China hosted the Asian Games was the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games. In the past 20 years, especially at the beginning of the new century, China&#39;s accession to the WTO and integration into the global market have made China the world&#39;s factory, and its economy has developed by leaps and bounds. Although affected by the financial crisis in 2008, China&#39;s economy quickly resumed development. In 2010, China&#39;s total GDP exceeded 40 trillion yuan, equivalent to more than 6 trillion US dollars, surpassing Japan for the first time, ranking first in Asia and second in the world. The Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou. Guangzhou has been a commercial capital for thousands of years and the forefront of reform and opening up. The Pearl River Delta is also the most active region for China&#39;s export-oriented economy and one of China&#39;s most important manufacturing and foreign trade bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, the Hangzhou Asian Games has been more than ten years since the Guangzhou Asian Games. Over the past ten years, China&#39;s economy has nearly tripled. More importantly, the scientific and technological content of China&#39;s economy has also been greatly improved, especially in the field of digital economy, which leads the world. Hangzhou is the home base of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The gorgeous digital people and digital fireworks at the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games are a concentrated display of China&#39;s high-end digital technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the attention attracted by these three Asian Games is also different. I believe older friends will have a better understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the successful bid to the preparation and successful hosting of the Beijing Asian Games, it has attracted unprecedented attention from the whole country. I remember that televisions were not yet popular in China, especially in rural areas. Black and white TVs were rare, and color TVs were even rarer. In some villages, only the village committee had a color TV for villagers to watch. Farmers are busy with farm work during the day and have no time to watch the live broadcast of the Asian Games. At night, the color TV in the village committee is crowded with farmers watching the game. Of course, more news about the game was heard from the loudspeaker broadcast in the village the next morning. Every time there was news that the Chinese team had won, it would cause a burst of carnival. The emblem composed of the Great Wall pattern, the mascot panda Panpan, and the promotional song &quot;Asian Heroes&quot; have all become the memories of a generation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony of the Guangzhou Asian Games was ingenious and brilliant. The &quot;Sail of White Clouds&quot; showed a grand atmosphere of openness and pioneering. However, in terms of attention, I am afraid it cannot compare with the national participation of the Beijing Asian Games. the hot state. I came to Guangzhou from Beijing to work in October 2010, just before the Guangzhou Asian Games. Just two years ago, China just hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. All the top events in the world have been held, and the psychological threshold of the Chinese people has naturally increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, mobile networks have become the main channel of communication. Everyone has a variety of short videos and news apps installed on their mobile phones. Even payment tools such as Alipay have video reports of the Asian Games. Information about the Asian Games can be received anytime and anywhere. In such a convenient communication environment, more than 100 million people participated in the Asian Games digital torch relay event. However, with the continuous evolution of lifestyles, we can no longer see the state where everyone sits in front of the TV. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change in attention to the Asian Games is also an inevitable result of the development of China&#39;s economic society and national mentality. At the time of the Beijing Asian Games, China&#39;s economy was still relatively backward. The Asian Games was an opportunity to unite the strength of the Chinese people and show their national pride. The vigorous publicity by the official media made the Beijing Asian Games known to everyone. As for the Guangzhou Asian Games and this time the Hangzhou Asian Games, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic level, there have been countless world-class sports events held in China. Ordinary people also have more channels to access more information, and their attention is divided. Of course, this is also a good thing. Those who love sports will continue to pay attention to the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third Asian Games in thirty years is a testimony to China’s development and the evolution of the national spirit. In this sense, the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has increased technological content and attracted less attention than it did in the past, which is a reflection of its richness, development and progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“常·识”背后的南方报业融合转型密码]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257611]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 14:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, Huang Changkai, Secretary of the Party Committee and President of Southern Newspaper Media Group, wrote the monograph &quot;Common Knowledge - Southern The book &quot;Newspaper Media Convergence Comics&quot; was officially published by Nanfang Daily Publishing House. This is another professional masterpiece by the author following &quot;Communication Power - Media Integration Practice of Southern Newspaper Industry&quot;, which deeply summarizes the practice and experience of the integration transformation of southern newspapers and profoundly explains the understanding and understanding of the regularity of integration transformation of provincial party newspaper groups. Although the title of the book is &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;, it is closely combined with the extraordinary process of the southern newspaper industry in recent years to successfully explore the path of integrated development that is in line with the spirit of the central government, industry trends and with southern characteristics. It shows the southern newspaper people&#39;s perspective on media integration and transformation.

A must-answer question for people&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;. Media integration is a systematic project that involves &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;innovation of ideas, content, forms, methods, and means. It involves many tasks such as resource integration, process optimization, and platform reengineering, and involves all aspects of technology, operation, and management problems. . Where to solve the problem and how to solve the problem? How to focus on the key reforms that &quot;pulse one person to mobilize the whole body&quot;, innovative measures to achieve the traction effect of &quot;one child is full of vitality&quot;, and how to rectify the complex relationships between various aspects and different links? To this, we can find part of the answer just from the content structure of the book &quot;Common Knowledge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the content structure, the book is divided into eight themes, namely &quot;Old Business and New Business&quot;, &quot;Rice Bowl and Stage&quot;, &quot;Career and Talent&quot;, &quot;Main Business and Industry&quot;, &quot;Content and Technology&quot; &quot;Removal of disadvantages and innovation&quot;, &quot;Management and construction&quot;, &quot;Big ecology and small ecology&quot;. Furthermore, the eight themes actually illustrate eight sets of major dialectical relationships that need to be accurately grasped to crack media integration. For example, &quot;Old Industry and New Industry&quot; focuses on a dialectical view of the relationship between traditional media and emerging media, and how to achieve complementary advantages, one can grow stronger than the other, and one can be better than the other during the iterative process of integration and transformation. &quot;Jobs and Stages&quot; focuses on how, in the face of the irreversible trend of the decline of traditional media, how to build a bigger and stronger self-controlled and controllable communication platform, provide a secure job, and create a stage for entrepreneurs to start their own business.以此类推，“事业与人才”关切的是融合转型的人才队伍建设；“主业与产业”探讨的是如何实现采编与经营的良性互促；“内容与技术”关注的是筑牢融合转型的技术底盘；“除弊与革新”指向的是融合转型的体制机制变革；“管理与建设”聚焦的是守好意识形态主阵地，如何既要管住又要管得出新出彩；“大生态与小生态”，展现的是对南方报业这样拥有多个子媒、多端口、多阵地的省级党报集团来说，如何构建错位发展、协同融洽的全媒体传播体系，放大融合发展的传播力和影响力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3bc02f7af596f0fabf0199532b415f1d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;530&quot;

&lt;p>;详读《常·识》不难看出，八组辩证关系不是“凭空之论”，而是源于南方报业成功的融合转型实践，是融合转型“南方打法”的深刻总结。近年来，南方报业以提升现代传播力为首要任务，深入实施“三个一体化”和“四化”战略战术（详见《传播力——南方报业媒体融合实践》一书），构建起覆盖用户超4.57亿的报刊网端微屏全媒体传播体系，旗下南方日报、南方杂志、南方网、南方农村报、南方周末、南方都市报、南方+客户端等7家媒体机构全部跻身“亿元媒体”俱乐部，南方+、GDToday 新闻网（客户端）、南周App、南都App、N视频、粤学习等自主可控、传播力强的新型传播平台发展势头良好，南方+以超1.7亿下载量和日活超600万的出色表现，牢牢占据广东省委省政府第一权威移动发布平台地位，位列全国省级党报自有客户端传播力第一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的融合转型不俗表现，正是源于对书中所探讨的八组辩证关系的正确把握。作者所谓“漫论”，绝非泛泛而论，关注的恰恰是媒体融合转型的一系列重点难题、重要主题、重大课题。作者对八组辩证关系的深入阐释，是对有效破解媒体融合转型那些“既要、又要”两难问题的回答，从中亦可窥见南方报业融合转型的成功密码。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;从“常·识”感受规律性认识：&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;转型不是转行&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;作者在自序中称，“书名曰《常·识》，既有平常观点之意，也是正常见识之谓”。综观全书对“没有传播力就没有一切”“南方+要出什么圈”“名记要成为怎样的人”“我们要做什么样的产业” “让管住管好从&#39;两难&#39;变成&#39;两全&#39;”等一系列行业关切话题的深入论述，可谓“金句频出”，给人留下了深刻印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;常识不同寻常。一直以来，面对互联网新媒体持续猛烈的冲击，媒体转型向何处去，是&lt;span>;最突出&lt;/span>;的难题。实践证明，对这个问题能否正确作答，往往决定了一个媒体的路径选择和前途未来。对此，作者明确指出“转型不是转行”，强调“作为主流媒体，不管报刊、广电还是网站、客户端，我们都要扪心自问：我们到底是做什么的”“南方报业要清楚自己的定位，不管怎么转、怎么融，媒体属性的基石地位不容动摇”。在行业激烈变革的当下，坚守“乱云飞渡仍从容”的战略定力，虽是常识，却仍需要不同寻常的“人间清醒”。类似还有书中的“轻忽媒体业务无异于舍本逐末”“自主可控不等于从零开始”，等等，看似并不深奥玄妙的道理，却往往需要人们在融合转型的现实中作出清醒正确的抉择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1ddee1f0902287b520469a2b18222ed6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;

&lt;p>;常识也是共识。正如作者所言，《常·识》“呈现的绝不是我一个人的实践思考，而是集体智慧的结晶”，既源自南方报业融合转型实践，也凝练了南方报业全体员工的共识。透过书中的论述不难看出，诸如“将内容生产传播作为安身立命之本”“建设新型主流媒体要抱持&#39;长期主义&#39;”“南方报业最珍贵的资产有两项：第一项是人才，第二项是传播力”“名记不是评出来的，是打出来的”“只有&#39;下沉&#39;才能基业长青”，不仅仅是南方报业融合转型坚持的重要理念原则，也早已融入集团发展的日常，成为南方报业上下践行的共识。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;常识更是规律性认识。书中很多“金句”，既是洞见，也体现着对媒体融合发展规律的深刻认识。比如，谈到转型的实质，指出“转型，就是媒体从&#39;纸&#39;的形态转成&#39;网&#39;的形态；融合，就是新旧两种媒体形态的融合共生”；谈到主业和产业的关系，指出“通过做强主业，让传播力、影响力产生溢出效益，从而搞好主业经营，撬动产业、带来多元收入”；谈到技术与内容的关系，指出“内容传播到哪里，技术支撑就跟到哪里”……类似这样的论述，无疑对整个业界都有极强的启发意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;媒体融合发展是一篇大文章。今年是习近平总书记作出“加快传统媒体和新兴媒体融合发展”重要指示10&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;周年。在这样一个重要的时间节点，《常·识》的出版，无疑为我们总结整个行业的媒体融合转型实践，加快推进媒体融合向纵深发展提供了可供研究的生动样本和借鉴参考。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/1f89d7f6202dd2ba9ff83a96f15f47a8.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;北京，国家审计署。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至2023年4月，对2021年度审计发现的问题，已整改问题金额8501.11亿元，完善制度2900多项，追责问责1.4万多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是2023年6月26日，审计署审计长侯凯在作《国务院关于2022年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》时公布的数据。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看到2022年度审计工作报告时，中国审计学会副会长、西南财经大学会计学院教授蔡春认为，随着审计水平的提高和制度建设的完善，审计已是常态化服务国家治理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众对审计工作产生印象至少是20年前的事。 2003年6月25日，时任审计署审计长李金华向全国人大常委会作2002年度审计工作报告，财政部、教育部、原国家计委等一批部委被公开批评。那时，互联网刚刚兴起不久，报告在审计署官网全文公开，引发全民关注，并称其为“审计风暴”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南京审计大学政府审计学院教授郑小荣认为，20年前，公众曾习惯政府对财政收支情况保密，在当时，“公开本身就是一个热点”，而现在，即使舆论不关注，审计也照常发挥作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而回顾过往20年不难发现，随着社会的发展，审计的重点也在发生改变。不同时期有不同重点，有些内容已成为历史。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;和盘托出&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2022年度审计工作报告有不少亮点。不同于以往的科技成果转化审计，这次首次聚焦基础研究和关键核心技术攻坚任务，指出部分任务部署和要求偏离预定目标，部分科研成果涉嫌造假等问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计发现，45项重点任务从制定实施方案到签订任务合同，层层降低指标要求，有的技术国内已量产，无需攻关。 649个已验收项目通过率为96.5%，但抽查其中135个发现实际有34个未完成全部任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣观察到，“年年审，年年发现问题”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年度审计工作报告指出，41个地区向亏损企业征收国有资本收益、征收过头税费或直接乱罚款乱摊派等，违规组织财政收入77.5亿元；49个地区通过承诺兜底回购、国有企业垫资建设等方式，违规新增隐性债务415.16亿元；12个地区不得不从上级超预算额度调拨库款、由银行垫款或对外借款280.72亿元维持基本运转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中央各部委所属单位疏于管理和监督的问题仍然存在。例如，3个部门和29家所属单位铺张浪费，有的多花费2700多万元租用办公场所，人均办公面积达137平方米，有的超合同进度年底突击花钱8458.07万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20年前,类似的问题就被点名，2002年度审计工作报告曾指出，一部委编造虚假项目预算，并与某工程处签订虚假施工合同，将135万元预算资金拨付该工程处，然后分批收回，主要用于发放职工补贴。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一名审计干部回忆，正是在2003年，审计署才被公众认识。距离审计署成立的1983年，已过去20年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2003年6月25日，2002年度审计工作报告在审计署官网全文公开后，被媒体广泛转载。兰州大学经济学院教授杨肃昌仍对这份报告带来的震惊记忆犹新，“（原来）问题这么严重”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一年披露的问题包括：县市财政收入“水分”较大，人为隐瞒赤字普遍，债务负担沉重；企业漏缴基本养老保险基金问题比较普遍，有关管理部门挤占挪用4.2亿元；教育部全国大学英语四六级考试委员会违规集中各地考试费2.24亿元，从中坐支相关考试费用等1.9亿元。等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于公布的问题触目惊心，公众将其称为“审计风暴”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，“审计风暴”或可再往前追溯到1999年。按照当时的审计工作程序，每年5月份，审计署要就上一年审计工作情况向国务院出具审计结果报告，根据这份报告，再起草向全国人大常委会提交的审计工作报告。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;向全国人大常委会的报告和盘托出了审计发现的问题。 1999年6月26日，李金华向全国人大常委会作《1998年度审计工作报告》，指出国务院43个部门和直属单位挤占挪用财政资金31.24亿元等问题，《中国经济时报》曾援引部分委员的话，表示是“多年来最好的一个审计工作报告”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;十八大后扶贫审计成为重点&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2003年以来，审计工作都聚焦了哪些领域？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者梳理发现，从2002年到2022年的21份《审计工作报告》中，除每年固定的财政审计外，资源环境保护、社保基金、农业农村是最为关注的领域，分别出现17次、13次、13次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不同时期，审计工作也有不同重点。以“三公”经费为例，2007年度审计工作报告用了103个字，首次指出税务部门存在无编制和超编制购置小汽车，以及招待费、会议费、培训费和出国费控制不够严格的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中共十八大后，随着中央八项规定的制定、执行，“三公”经费开始成为审计监督的重点。 2013年度审计工作报告史无前例地用1244字的篇幅，直指“三公”经费和会议费管理使用问题，点名22个中央部门和所属单位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年，中央部门“三公”经费和会议费支出比上年下降27%，部门本级公务用车改革基本完成。但审计仍然发现，科技部、原文化部等33个部门和单位长期占用其他单位车辆，或以租赁方式变相配备公务用车122辆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后连续九年，“三公”经费一直都被提及。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扶贫也一度是报告关注的焦点。 2013年11月提出“精准扶贫”战略后，次年，审计报告在时隔十年之后，再次出现关于扶贫审计的内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;报告指出，审计19个国家扶贫开发工作重点县后发现，1595.71万元扶贫资金被个人侵占，1.73亿元扶贫资金被虚报冒领或挤占挪用，有5个县的扶贫工作主管部门在扶贫管理费等经费中违规列支吃喝、旅游费用53.36万元，还有2.27亿元扶贫资金闲置1年以上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1271&quot; height=&quot;739&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/evLOaYcG1oPhzGE1tX8YmI86cZI29BnAy3yyGxM4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251919&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2022年度审计工作报告指出，高标准农田建设资金，地方统筹整合使用时存在难度。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年11月29日，中共中央、国务院发布《关于打赢脱贫攻坚战的决定》，提出确保到2020年农村贫困人口实现脱贫，要求抓好精准识别、建档立卡关键环节，使建档立卡贫困人口中有5000万人左右通过产业扶持等措施实现脱贫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这在第二年的报告中就有所体现，《2015年度审计工作报告》提到，抽查云南省寻甸县2015年发放的1339笔扶贫到户贴息贷款6560万元中，仅有711笔3433万元（占52%）发放给建档立卡贫困户。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年至今，报告则连续两年对就业补助和促进就业资金进行审计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;有板块7次更名&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;20年来，审计工作报告的形式也在发生改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个变化是报告名称。 2013年作的2012年度审计报告名称为《关于2012年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》，次年改为《国务院关于2013年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》，这一格式固定至今。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不是简单地多了3个字。郑小荣认为，根据审计法规定，审计工作报告由国务院向全国人大常委会提出，在实践中由审计署代表国务院作报告。标题中增加“国务院”更符合审计法精神，也更能体现审计工作报告的权威性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，审计工作报告开篇的称呼，则由此前的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会”，调整为“委员长、各位副委员长、秘书长，各位委员”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在郑小荣看来，全国人大常委会是一个机构，后者更为具体，“类似于点名”,称呼的变化是“希望在审议、决议工作报告时，每位参会者都高度重视，强化人大监督的作用”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众对哪些单位被点名格外关注。 20年来，“点名”经历了从模糊到逐步清晰的过程，被点名单位的数量也有变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2002年度审计工作报告模糊处理了部分地区和单位信息，用“某省”“某区政府”“部分航空公司”等替代。而审计发现的违法违纪人员，直到2006年度审计工作报告才开始出现当事人姓名，此前只点出其单位和职务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣认为，这是审计机关谨慎的表现，信息公开在当时仍然敏感，“信息公开以后，会有意想不到的结果”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;另一个变化是，2017年以后，报告中点名的单位数量减少。南方周末记者不完全统计，2017年报告点名24家单位，这一数字在2018年下降到3家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在西南财经大学审计系主任李越冬看来，这与审计功能的变化有一定关系，“现在更多的是帮助被审计单位解决问题。”审计取证的时间有限，也更加强调发现重大问题，“一些小问题不一定出现在报告中，告知整改就可以了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣补充说，过去一些被审计单位在工作过程中不太配合，在报告中点名一度是促进其整改的方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计工作报告中的固定章节，也经历了多次更名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者梳理发现，2008年度审计工作报告首次出现“重大违法违规问题揭露和查处情况”这一章节，除了公布移送的重大违法违规问题和经济犯罪案件线索数量、涉案人数外，还对犯罪形式、手段和方法进行总结。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，该章节历经7次更名，如2012年的“审计查出的重大违法违规问题和经济犯罪案件”，2013年改为“审计发现的重大违法违规案件情况”，2014年是“审计查出的涉嫌重大违法违规案件情况”。 2021年更名为“重大违纪违法问题线索”并保留至今，提及的问题包括“小官贪腐”、基层微腐败和“靠山吃山”等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在21份审计工作报告中，章节的内容、位置和名称，整体并不固定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郑小荣也注意到这个现象，他认为，在制度逐渐规范的过程中，审计机关对审计工作报告的形式具有裁量权，也会影响报告的文本形式和框架。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;打破壁垒&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“不同层级的政府，都承担着公共受托经济责任，在履行责任的同时，政府也被赋予了特定的权力。”蔡春认为，审计的作用，就是保障政府责任的履行，促进公共权力的运用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者梳理发现，2009年度审计工作报告，就已经指出地方政府债务总体规模较大、部分地方政府偿债压力较大、财政资金偿债能力不足的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，按照国务院要求，2011年审计署组织全国审计机关4万多人，以“见账、见人、见物，逐笔、逐项审核”为原则，对全国所有涉及地方政府性债务的25590个政府部门和机构、6576家融资平台公司、54061个其他单位、373805个项目和1873683笔债务进行审计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计整改一度是“老大难”问题。在2021年审计法修订前，对于审计对象不按要求整改的，该采取什么样的措施，并没有作出具体规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到新修订的审计法作出回应：“审计结果以及整改情况应当作为考核、任免、奖惩领导干部和制定政策、完善制度的重要参考；拒不整改或者整改时弄虚作假的，依法追究法律责任。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据审计法规定，审计机关受本级政府和上一级审计机关双重领导。而在现实中，本级政府对本级审计机关的影响更大。湖南省怀化市审计局工作人员刘空军曾在2009年发表文章称，当地13个县(市、区)基层审计机关，62%的班子成员调整没有事先征求上一级审计机关的意见，双重管理流于形式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而据郑小荣介绍，在审计结果上报本级人大前，政府有机会拦截、筛选反映的问题，“有些问题不能查深查透，监督权没办法往下延伸”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年前后，关于审计体制改革的问题有多种观点，根据一篇2013年发布于审计署官网的文章中，审计署长沙办黄凯把各方观点归纳为升格论、垂直论、独立论和立法论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而最被业内人士推崇的是立法论，审计机关隶属于人民代表大会，对政府部门独立行使审计监督权力。早在2002年，杨肃昌对62位审计署官员、地方审计机关官员、政府官员、人大干部、审计学者开展问卷调查，其中77%的受访者赞同或基本赞同立法型审计体制改革。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对审计体制改革的讨论没有停止。 2017年12月，中共十九大召开后，杨肃昌受审计署邀请，讨论审计体制改革的走向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;答案很快揭晓。 2018年3月，中共中央印发《深化党和国家机构改革方案》，宣布组建中央审计委员会。 “没想到会成立。”杨肃昌说，从现实角度看，“在中央审计委员会的领导下，审计工作与党的领导和监督体制融为一体。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;审计发现的问题“必须向中央审计委员会报告，而且是直达”。郑小荣认为，虽然目前审计机关仍然受本级政府和上一级审计机关双重领导，但中央审计委员会打破了政府管理下形成的壁垒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[印度裔CEO正在“统治”世界，凭的是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there is a half-joking saying circulating in the field of workplace human resources (HR): Indians are using a A strange way to &quot;rule&quot; the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning is: Indian-origin professional managers and workplace elites are achieving greater and greater success in the world. More than 30% of the CEOs of large Silicon Valley companies in the United States are Indians. Among U.S. companies, the top ten Indian-Americans serve as chairman, CEO, president, and chief operating officer: Google &amp;amp; Alphabet, Microsoft, FedEx, IBM, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, NetApp, Barclays Group, Starbucks, and Adobe , Micron Technology and other world-renowned companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Led by this type of Indian professional managers who hold top-level positions, these companies have recruited a large number of younger, lower-level Indian elites for high- and middle-level management positions, technical positions, Key positions such as finance and human resources are increasingly occupied by Indian career elites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indians have an increasing influence in the Western world and have become the most powerful minority group in American and British societies. Many Westerners know that Indians are not easy to mess with, and the social status they have gained , the social achievements achieved far exceed those of local Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have interviewed some HR organizations to understand why they are willing to promote Indian professional managers, what employers think of Indian managers, and why Indians have achieved such achievements. The feedback received shows that Indians The advantages of ethnic-American workplace elites are roughly as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Value recognition: India was a British colony for a long time, and Indians were once ridiculed as British &quot;long-term laborers and coolies.&quot; However, Indians identify with and want to integrate into Britain and the United States. Social and lifestyle motivations are strong. Their purpose of studying hard is often to enter the British and American society, and gradually become &quot;foremen, housekeepers, and shopkeepers&quot; from &quot;long-term workers&quot;. When Indians go to Britain and the United States, they have no intention of going back. Instead, they try their best to take root there and transform from &quot;Indians&quot; to &quot;Indians.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communication advantages: As a former British colony, high-end schools in India focus on English education. Therefore, its educational elites, despite their thick accents, have no barriers to language communication, which is a great advantage in the British and American workplaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Hindi belongs to the &quot;Eurasian language family&quot; and has many similarities with Western languages, based on Hinglish, there are also fewer obstacles for Indians to learn French, German, and Spanish. few. Therefore, the current trend of Indian workplace elites spreading from English-speaking societies to the entire Western world. The second communication advantage of Indians is that their living customs advocate chatting, chatting, and debating. Therefore, they can get along well with Westerners. Even if they have different opinions, they can chat and dare to talk. It is easier for them to get familiar with each other, which is good for promotion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural diversity: India has 6 major religions, 22 official regional languages, 212 ethnic groups, and 414 tribes. Religions, cultures, and living customs vary greatly among regions and ethnic groups. Such a complex society makes Indians more adaptable to culturally diverse lifestyles. There has never been a &quot;grand unification&quot; in India&#39;s history, and its unification was all established with the help of the British. Therefore, when Indians come to the Western world, not only do they not find it weird and weird, but they think Westerners are too serious, rigid, and simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teamwork: Indians focus on teamwork and interpersonal relationships, and their individuals usually have good interpersonal and communication skills, which are very important for senior management positions. Indians are very cooperative, and Indian executives in companies try their best to recruit Indian employees. There have even been cases of fraud: when an American hospital recruits doctors, the Indian director throws away all the resumes of non-Indian applicants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The folk rule of the Indian people is: those who are successfully recruited should give all of their 1-3 months&#39; salary (the higher the position, the higher the kickback) to the recruiter to express their gratitude for the kindness. . Almost no one in the Indian community violates this convention, forming a long-standing custom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obedience and loyalty: Corresponding to the above-mentioned Indian workplace custom of &quot;recruitment kickbacks&quot;, Indian employees are highly obedient to their superiors. Their subordinates are very good at communicating with their leaders. They will often ask their leaders: What else do you need from me? What am I not doing well? What can you do to be more satisfied? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have hired Indians, you will feel that they are generally more submissive, reliable, and secure, and leaders will gradually feel comfortable appointing and promoting them. One way of saying it is that Indian people often shake their heads slightly (to express approval and obedience) and say: I see, I see (I understand). It is known as &quot;Ah San, Ah San&quot; by Chinese people. Another theory is that Asan is &quot;Asir&quot;. At that time, the British often recruited Indians to serve as police officers in the colonies or concessions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People recruited by themselves are more capable, less likely to get into trouble, and less likely to cheat. This is also the reason why Indian executives dare to recruit subordinates of the same race. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resilience: Americans love to mock their government as useless and their president as incompetent. In the eyes of Indians, their own country and government are even worse. In order to survive in their own country, Indians have learned to persevere and make full use of limited resources to live under endless harsh conditions. This ability makes Indian employees more hardworking and hardworking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humility: As new immigrants from a backward and poor society, Indians understand and admit their limitations and deficiencies in many aspects. Therefore, they are more humble and open-minded during the learning process, making it easier for them to integrate into the local area and be accepted by the local society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Educational advantages in technology and engineering fields: As a late-developing country, India&#39;s education is similar to that in East Asia, with more emphasis on science and technology, engineering and other science and engineering courses. It is particularly distinctive in fields such as computers, engineering, and technological innovation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Indian Institute of Technology&quot; even boasts that &quot;those who cannot get into Indian Institute of Technology should go to MIT.&quot; This is of course bragging, but the large number of science and engineering talents it has trained have just made up for the excessive wealth in the English-speaking world. After a long period of peace, more and more wealthy young people no longer want to study hard to study science and engineering, but study &quot;literature, history, philosophy and arts&quot;. ” and other weaknesses of so-called “rich people’s disciplines”. The &quot;rich N generation&quot; in Europe and the United States learn the art of maintaining success and the method of controlling people, while the science and engineering talents from India serve as CEOs, directors, managers, technological elites... to achieve their own class jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dare to take risks and start a business: Indian individuals are more willing to take risks and start a business. They are more willing to set up their own companies and serve as CEOs after they grow. This entrepreneurial tendency has made them achieve great success in the business world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Indians are moving from the business world to the political world, and the jokes about &quot;dominating&quot; the world are gradually becoming serious: British Prime Minister Sunak, Singaporean President Shanmugaratnam, Irish Prime Minister Varadkar, Portuguese Prime Minister Costa, and the President of Mauritius Roopun, Prime Minister Jugnauth, Guyana President Irfaan Ali, Suriname President Santokhi, etc. are all Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently too many Indian cabinet members in the U.S. government: Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State, White House Chip Advisor and U.S. Commerce The department’s chief economist, deputy director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, senior White House staff and presidential speech writers are all Indians. However, Indians only account for 1.4% of the U.S. population. With such a small population weight, they can leverage such huge political influence. Leverage affects the national policies of the United States and even the direction of world politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The idea that Indian elites &quot;dominate&quot; the world is a joke to many people, but the trend cannot be underestimated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 12:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
