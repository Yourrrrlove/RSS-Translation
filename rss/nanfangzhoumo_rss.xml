When they went to the hotel and took apart the chandelier, they found that the camera was still there, which shocked them. People are extremely frightened when they think about it carefully. If someone is secretly photographed while staying in a hotel, what responsibility should the hotel bear? Hidden photography has been banned for many times. How can we eradicate the industrial chain behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a recent report from Guangxi TV, Mr. Hu from Nanning recently received an intimate video of himself and his fiancée staying in a hotel a year ago. When he arrived at the hotel, he discovered that the two cameras hidden in the chandelier were still there. The hotel manager said that they were also victims. There was no abnormality in other rooms after checking, and they only wanted to refund the room fee. The report attracted a lot of attention online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News about being secretly photographed while staying in a hotel appears frequently. Searching for &quot;hotel sneak shots&quot; on a certain search engine can yield tens of millions of related information. Recent news, in addition to the above mentioned, also appeared in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, Loudi, Hunan and other places. A few years ago, the person in charge of a hotel in Zhengzhou, Henan Province even claimed that 80% of hotels had secret cameras. In fact, hidden cameras are not only found in hotels, but also in fitting rooms of clothing stores, toilets in office buildings, and even in the toilets of high-speed trains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hidden cameras seriously violate the privacy of others and are undoubtedly illegal and criminal acts. If a hotel installs a camera without permission, the hotel will certainly be held responsible. But if someone else secretly installed it without the hotel’s knowledge, does the hotel need to take responsibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many such situations. According to industry insiders, bad guys can pretend to be guests staying in hotels, install cameras in just ten minutes at a time, and then change rooms for various reasons, and can secretly install several rooms at a time. In the case of a camera being discovered in a Lianyungang hotel, the suspect captured by the police was an unemployed person, not a hotel employee. In a guiding case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2022, criminals also secretly installed cameras in the rooms of many hotels to take photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, is it true that, as the manager of the hotel in Nanning claimed, they are also victims and do not need to bear responsibility for the infringement of their guests? Of course not. When travelers check into a hotel, they certainly regard the hotel room as a private place and have reasonable expectations for their privacy in the room. The hotel should fulfill its reasonable obligations to protect the privacy of guests. Guests were secretly photographed and their privacy was invaded, which is inseparable from the hotel&#39;s failure to fulfill its safety and security obligations. As for this hotel in Nanning, the camera is still there more than a year later, which shows how neglected management it is. If a candid camera incident occurs, the hotel will not only have to close down for rectification, but also compensate the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hotel has an obligation to protect the privacy of its guests. In fact, there are now portable detection instruments specifically for pinhole cameras on the market. As long as the hotel equips cleaning or security personnel with a set, most hidden cameras can be detected in a short time. The cost of doing this is not high. The key is that anti-candid photography should become a standard in the hotel industry and something every hotel must do, just like cleaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why candid photography in hotels is frequently banned is because there is a black industrial chain behind it. Criminals do not secretly shoot videos for excitement, but put these secretly shot videos on the dark web and other illegal websites for sale. Some websites and social accounts use the banner of &quot;hotel secret photography&quot; to attract users to pay to watch private videos. The entire black industry of candid photography may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year. In the aforementioned guidance case issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, criminals used illegal websites, instant messaging software, etc. to publish information and sell secretly filmed private videos. In 2021, Liaoning police also eliminated a black industry chain that used hidden cameras to secretly photograph and live broadcast in hotels for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to selling on the dark web, some people also use the private videos captured to extort money. At the end of 2022, after a woman in Loudi, Hunan was secretly filmed in a hotel, someone sent the video to her and extorted money. This time Mr. Hu from Nanning, Guangxi received a secretly filmed video. The other person probably did not remind him that he was secretly filmed, and it was also very possible that he was trying to blackmail him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must intensify our crackdown on secret photography. Now that all communication accounts implement real-name systems, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for the police to find criminals. For those who send messages for extortion, the police can find the blackmailer through the account that sent the message, and then follow the clues to find out how the blackmailer obtained the video, as well as the customer&#39;s contact information and other private information, and eliminate the entire chain. At the same time, they can Find out whether the hotel has any issues with leaking guest privacy. After all, even if criminals secretly install cameras, it would be difficult to know the guests&#39; contact information without a hotel insider, and there would be no way to extort money. Only the secret camera was found, and the police also have the means to find the installer. The police quickly caught the suspect using the cameras of Lianyungang Hotel and the women&#39;s restroom of an office building in Tianjin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of rampant candid photography, on the one hand, the police must intensify their crackdown on the black industrial chain. Management of secret photography and recording equipment must also be strengthened. Nowadays, various miniature hidden cameras can be purchased everywhere on the Internet, as well as various teaching videos on camera cracking and vulnerability exploitation, which have contributed to the proliferation of candid photography. The hotel industry should also formulate standards and incorporate anti-peeping cameras into the daily management of the industry to protect the privacy and security of guests as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“毛孩子”上幼儿园]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258991]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVAPLvRo1Tt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/V0LTOkR67vJedXXZb5clBZd8L6rjNgVA PLvRo1Tt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254465&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Two &quot;students&quot; participated in the agility game course in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an autumn afternoon, three pet dogs of different types participated in games under the guidance of their dog trainers.

They were the Shiba Inu, the Poodle and the Samoyed. At the beginning of the course, when they saw the stranger who was taking pictures with the camera, the three students immediately gave different feedback: the little Shiba Inu focused on the handler’s commands; the poodle kept barking while tentatively approaching the stranger, and the course was at a loss. The Samoyed also noticed the presence of the camera and tried to get closer in a friendly manner. When the dog trainer gave the instruction, it immediately returned to the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/tO4JE0DuciA7OwPu0kt49VMpwuAlvYIgyGVyx3U4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/tO4JE0DuciA7OwPu0kt49VMpwuAlvYIgyGVyx3U4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254453&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fat Tiger&quot; participates in the educational game class in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/kZ21UuvWMsdCj28jPMXKyxiita4EsHe9PMhCctsW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/kZ21UuvWMsdCj28jPMXKyxiita4EsHe9PMhCctsW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Fat Tiger&quot; experiences the cute beast theater in kindergarten&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dogs also have their own personalities. You can see that the three of them are completely different. This has nothing to do with their body shape. It is determined by genes first and is related to their growth experience. Poodles are very vigilant. In fact, they are very vigilant. It&#39;s not to attack you, it&#39;s just to scare you - &#39;Don&#39;t come here, don&#39;t hurt me, I&#39;m very fierce, listen to how loud I scream&#39;, but in fact this just reflects its timidity and sensitivity. The other two They can only focus on their own things, which shows that they are well socialized, can regulate their own behavior, do not affect others, and are very confident and brave when facing new things.&quot; Li, the founder of Cute Beasts Chen analyzed the students&#39; performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has been almost five years since Mengzhupai opened its kindergarten, during which time it experienced the COVID-19 epidemic and its business almost stagnated. Starting from the beginning of 2023, Li Chen found that the demand for pet foster care and kindergarten attendance had “exploded.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/FC6KETtmuncBPDSPDhxTSAhX45uo5giBOXqwQhFk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/FC6KETtmuncBPDSPDhxTSAhX45uo5giBOXqwQhFk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254463&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sister Wang and 9-year-old &quot;Coffee Bean&quot; are in the cute animal party.

I do my best to make your life colorful, send you to school, and make you live a full and happy life every day. It does not need to be just Wait for me at home. I will be very calm when I go out and don’t have to feel guilty. I always feel that the dog has only one thing in his life, which is to wait for me at home.” Li Chen believes that with the progress of society and the changes in the thinking of pet owners, Nowadays, pet owners are no longer concerned about whether their pets are eating imported dog food, but also about the mental health of their pets - whether you are happy today. Dogs also need their own spiritual world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slogan of the kindergarten is &quot;Let dogs be dogs again&quot;. Through many courses, training is provided to help them regain their instincts as animals, such as sniffing, hunting and swimming, and enhance the dogs&#39; confidence and physical fitness. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/u4ADV0FJUMQxzOuo358BIoMpSQ2kBW2owRMc26Xs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/u4ADV0FJUMQxzOuo358BIoMpSQ2kBW2owRMc26Xs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;San San’s mother took her 4 adopted elderly dogs to the cute animal party for a birthday party&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Chen, the current kindergarten parents are mainly those born in the 1980s and 1990s. They are not all middle-class or white-collar workers from well-off families, but they are very willing to give to &quot;hairy children&quot; Spend money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only young people, but some elderly people also spend a lot of money to create a healthy and comfortable life for their &quot;hairy children&quot;. Li Chen calls it &quot;a step-by-step relationship.&quot; She hosted a retired couple who regularly visited their daughter out of town every year. During the two or three months away from Beijing, they adopted two Chuan Chuan children (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Hybrid breed dog&lt;/span>;) and put it here with Li Chen. &quot;In their eyes, pets are the same as family members.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HIhqM5okdFH3w15o1XUrPF20x55vH5IW5PIUdth0. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HIhqM5okdFH3w15o1XUrPF20x55vH5IW5PIUdth0.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;254457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Three huskies are waiting in the restaurant&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coffee Bean is a teddy dog ​​who is 9 years old this year. Sister Wang remembers the first time after she went to kindergarten, the clerk dropped it off, turned around and left, with the coffee beans still chasing her. &quot;The dog&#39;s reaction was very real. From then on, I knew that they must be good to Doudou.&quot; This is the fifth year that Coffee Bean has come to the kindergarten. From the beginning, no one could touch him and he would bark when he saw people. Now he often pretends to be Doudou. Cuteness attracts the attention of those around you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Wang and her husband are from the DINK tribe. She “raises coffee beans as sons” and never hesitates to spend money on them. Whenever there is an event in the store, Sister Wang always thinks about renewing the fee. Li Chen saw the sufficient balance on her card and always advised her to spend rationally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Cheng used to love traveling and buying bags, but now she spends all the money she has saved on 90,000 yuan, which is about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan a month.

She felt that raising dogs and raising children each had their own advantages, but raising children was definitely more difficult, and 90,000 yuan brought her only happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding some news about uncivilized dog-raising circulating on the Internet, Xiao Cheng believes that it should not be a confrontation between dog-raising and non-dog-raising, but a confrontation between civilized dog-raising and uncivilized dog-raising. &quot;Dog owners must first do their best: leash, pick up poop, walk the dog at different times, and avoid pedestrians - especially the elderly and children. I also understand that some people are naturally afraid of dogs, so stay away from each other.

This plan was questioned by some shareholders at the time, who believed that it was a waste in terms of profitability. But Li Chen had his own ideas. Although some pet-themed movies would be reserved, the speakers in the theater were designed for humans and were not suitable for dogs&#39; hearing systems. &quot;I hope to provide owners and pets with a diversified choice, even if it meets some very niche needs, but there is no way to experience it elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/fhNiWp9f8o5hBGPiBdk2Dwh4lEhelsNP5xoThX4Q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/fhNiWp9f8o5hBGPiBdk2Dwh4lEhelsNP5xoThX4Q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This The huskies are being frightened - screening out and weeding out dogs who tend to be overly fearful, aggressive or overly excited about running, screaming, overly enthusiastic people.

Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can’t say that we beat dogs, we really have never beaten them.” On October 20, 2023, Zhang Yong was a little nervous when talking about the recent public opinion about dog hunting, and emphasized that they were civilized law enforcement. , the entire process was recorded with a law enforcement recorder and recorded in the ledger. &quot;It must be ensured that they are all alive and cannot be damaged.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director of the Publicity Unit of the Urban Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau of Saihan District, Hohhot City is worried about the public opinion that a Rottweiler dog bit a 4-year-old girl in Chongzhou The chain reaction of events. A video of a ferocious dog biting a person swept the entire Internet, and dog hunting operations took place in many places. It was reported on the Internet that a residential property management team had set up a &quot;dog fighting team&quot;, and security guards patrolled with sticks and nets; Bozhou in Anhui, Zhengzhou in Henan, Taixing in Jiangsu, Urban management departments in Qingdao, Shandong and other places have successively released videos of catching stray dogs, and netizens have begun heated discussions about whether stray dogs should be culled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Controversial cases also emerged. A stray dog ​​living in Chongqing University of International Business and Economics was driven to death by security guards. On October 20, the school reported that a student was chased by a stray dog ​​on his way back to bed. The school security guard had engaged in inappropriate behavior during the chase and the security guard involved had been suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that after this incident, many places carried out special rectifications on the behavior of ownerless dogs, aggressive dogs, and not wearing leashes. But at the same time, various rumors are also circulating on online platforms. In fact, in many places, catching stray dogs is a regular task. The captured stray dogs will be sent to stray animal rescue centers for shelter and will not be killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What responsibilities should the property owner bear?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the Rottweiler dog biting incident, slogans were hung in many places in the Xichen Oasis Community of Hengda where the girl lived: &quot;Walking dogs in a civilized manner and keeping the leash on them&quot; &quot;, keep your mouth shut and don&#39;t hurt others&quot; &quot;Tighten the &#39;civilized rope&#39; and be a civilized dog owner&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, a mother who lived above the victim girl told a Southern Weekend reporter , the day the girl was bitten, the angry owners were already discussing in the owner group: &quot;If such a big thing happened, where is the security guard?&quot; &quot;Why don&#39;t they know when an outside dog comes in?&quot; Under pressure, the property began patrolling daily to catch off-leash dogs. These tasks will be posted to the group one by one and reported to the owner, with arrest videos and photos attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tense atmosphere quickly spread to other communities. On October 17, the media reported that a &quot;dog fighting team&quot; was set up in Fuhe Yujing Community in Chengdu City. In the video, security guards were patrolling with sticks and nets. The property staff said: &quot;All stray dogs are left unattended and without leashes.&quot; Yes, the whole community needs to be rectified.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 18, the Sanduhui Chaowai Community in Chengdu hung a banner in the name of the property saying &quot;The community will hunt and kill unleashed cats and dogs.&quot; The word &quot;hunt and kill&quot; immediately caused worries and accusations from pet owners in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Li Ming, a resident of the community, the idea of ​​&quot;hunting and killing&quot; actually came from the community&#39;s mother group. Out of concern, the mothers suggested in the group &quot;methods to deal with stray dogs: first, kill or capture them as much as possible, second, drive them out of the community and then call the police to notify the community.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, those who opposed the culling called the government service hotline 12345 to complain one after another on the evening of the 18th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next morning, the property management company stated that the banner was inappropriate and had been removed. &quot;The property management company no longer dares to answer the phone. The street refused to allow them to kill the people by force and warned them in the morning.&quot; Li Ming said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called the property and street office of the community many times, but none of them got through. On the 20th, the Property Affairs Service Center of the Chengdu Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau responded to the media saying that the center had not received a notice that a dog hunting team was set up in a community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chang Sha, a lawyer at Beijing Jingdu Law Firm, has been involved in cases of dog injuries. She believes that the community property has a safety obligation to the owners. Therefore, if there is an ownerless dog in the community, the property owner must be responsible for evicting it. Or management responsibility, otherwise you will have to bear fault liability for stray dogs hurting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other hand, the property management company does not have the power to enforce the law, so for dogs with owners, the property management cannot take mandatory management measures, such as directly arresting them. In non-emergency situations, property management can only be handled by persuasion or handed over to urban management and public security agencies with law enforcement powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Remediation in many places, rumors go hand in hand&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 18th, when the owners of a Chengdu community were arguing about whether to cull stray dogs, the urban management department of Jinshui District, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province targeted dogs without leashes. The act was enforced overnight and broadcast live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dog-catching controversy began to spread to many places across the country, resulting in law enforcement actions. In this live broadcast in Zhengzhou, a young man holding a French bulldog was chased for a long distance. According to the live video, although the urban management personnel repeatedly emphasized that they would not harm the dog and would only take it back for registration and investigation, the young man tried to escape with the black dog after some unsuccessful negotiations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This video has become another spreading point of this Internet storm. Xiao Zhen, a citizen who also raises French bulldogs in Zhengzhou, told Southern Weekend reporters that it is indeed prohibited to raise French bulldogs in Zhengzhou. Dog licenses are usually not allowed, but the law enforcement is not strict and &quot;we would check occasionally in the past.&quot; At the same time, many cities across the country allow the breeding of French bulldogs, including Beijing, Shanghai, Xi&#39;an, Dalian, Harbin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha, etc. After learning that the young man needed to pay a fine of 5,000 yuan, the group of French bullfighting enthusiasts sent him red envelopes one after another, saying that they would help him get his dog back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Du Fan, president of the Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association, said that the current management of dogs in cities is mainly based on regulations formulated by each locality. Such administrative regulations are not very effective, so many people do not apply for dog licenses. Nor do they keep dogs according to regulations. (For details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258846&quot;>;&quot;Many experts talk about the Rottweiler dog biting a girl: &quot;The key is to manage people, followed by managing dogs&quot;&quot;&lt;/ a>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the division of powers for dog management in cities is not clear. Most cities are currently in charge of public security, and some are under the charge of urban management. Dog management also involves industry and commerce, food safety, and public security. Management and other departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident of Rottweiler dogs injuring children, many places issued special management actions. Bozhou in Anhui, Taixing in Jiangsu, Shenqiu in Henan, Shehong in Sichuan and other places targeted ownerless dogs, aggressive dogs, and unprotected dogs. The behavior of pulling ropes will be specially rectified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In it, rumors and facts are mixed. Southern Weekend reporters found that in videos calling for not killing stray dogs, photos of dozens of dog corpses and scenes of being thrown to death often appear, but there is no time stamp. Just looking at the background of the picture, buses and buildings should be numbers. years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the hot topic on Weibo &quot;Puppies don&#39;t feel like they are wandering&quot;, many netizens identified a photo of a puppy that was still grinning after being arrested as the one involved in the Chongqing University of International Business and Economics. It was a yellow dog, with the caption &quot;It was still laughing when it was caught, it thought it was going to have a home&quot;, and expressed condolences. However, the author of the original picture refuted the rumors and said that the smiling puppy was taken in April and is not the same dog as the one in Chongqing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s a bit out of focus.” Zhou Wei, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Zoological Society, found that as the situation developed, netizens’ discussions gradually turned into opposing issues such as loving dogs or not, and culling or not culling. , without going into details. For example, many video titles say &quot;catching&quot; stray dogs, but most of the current videos only show &quot;catching&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Normalization of Urban Management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found through searches that many dog-catching videos were released by the official accounts of urban management and public security agencies in various places, such as Qingdao West Coast New District Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau. It released three videos in a row, introducing that catching stray dogs is a regular task. The captured stray dogs will be sent to the stray animal rescue center for shelter and will not be killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distribution of dog leashes and dog muzzles has attracted attention. The Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau of Shehong City, Sichuan Province, which is considered by netizens to be a model of civilized law enforcement, told Southern Weekend reporters that they will set up dog leashes starting in 2021. The management office is equipped with professional dog-catching equipment and vehicles, and has 5 staff members daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Saihan District, Hohhot City, according to the City Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau, the bureau took over the work of catching stray dogs in 2020. In 2023 alone, it received more than 1,100 related reports and has captured stray dogs. There are more than 300 dogs, and most of the reports are about barking dogs disturbing people, especially in the early morning and early morning. Zhang Yong, head of the bureau&#39;s publicity department, said that when team members receive a reporting call, they must contact the person involved in a timely manner and respond to the person after handling the case. If they cannot catch the person, the team members will have to go there at least three times within a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This doesn&#39;t sound like an easy job. Zhang Yong said that they have specially formulated a long-term mechanism for this purpose, which is divided into day shift and night shift. &quot;There are 38 people in the mobile squadron participating in dog hunting.&quot; They have to patrol the 1,025 square kilometers under the jurisdiction of Saihan District. When the dog climbs over the fence and enters the bush, it is difficult for law enforcement officers to catch up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, stray dogs have a keen sense of smell. As soon as the law enforcement vehicles that carry stray dogs all the year round stop in a place, &quot;no dogs will come out of this area.&quot; Zhang Yong said that one of their team members saw a stray dog ​​while driving around in his car and called for a law enforcement vehicle. Before the vehicle arrived, the stray dog ​​started to get restless. &quot;It could smell the smell of the car.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every dog-catching team member in Saihan District has been bitten by a dog, and some have broken their legs while catching dogs. The tool they use is a fishing net. Dogs of different sizes use different types of fishing nets. The largest ones use fiber rope nets as thick as their thumbs. &quot;They have very good teeth and can bite through thin ropes in one bite.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sichuan Province Shehong City Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau and Qingdao West Coast New District Comprehensive Law Enforcement Administration both responded to Southern Weekend reporters that the tools used to catch dogs are mainly fishing nets. In most of the dog-catching videos circulated on the Internet, law enforcement officers used fishing nets. Only one video showed a dog-catching video with a license plate number from Taizhou, Zhejiang, using curved clamps. Zhou Wei believes that the fishing net is currently a more suitable tool for catching dogs. It has a soft texture and can trap dogs without causing too much harm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yong said that after the stray dogs are caught, they will be sent to the detention center managed by the public security department for adoption. After the dog is inspected, the detention center will give the urban management team member a receipt, which will clearly indicate the receipt. Quantity and condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from Southern Weekend called the Hohhot Public Security Bureau Dog Inspection Station, and the other party replied that the institute has 50 acres of kennels and is currently able to raise stray cats and dogs until they die of natural causes. In addition, the center is open to the public for adoption, and you can visit, adopt or donate materials during the open day. As for the number of stray cats and dogs currently detained in the inspection center, the staff member said that detailed data could not be provided for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Bodhi Nursing Home for Stray Fur Children in Shehong, Sichuan is a privately run base for stray cats and dogs. It occupies a hilltop in the mountains and feeds stray cats and dogs in different areas. In 2021, the base began to receive stray cats and dogs caught by the urban management department, 20-30 every year. &quot;They are sent here sporadically, and they are all caught after being complained about disturbing the residents.&quot; Ms. Ren, the person in charge of the base, said that the urban management department Part of the cost of dog food is provided. Cats and dogs will be checked for infectious diseases in advance before delivery. If there are injuries or illnesses, they will go to the pet hospital for treatment first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Ren said that Shehong has launched a special operation to capture stray cats and dogs since October 20, and 11 stray dogs were delivered in just one day. She was a little worried that too many cats and dogs would be sent in a short period of time and that the base would not be able to handle the load. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;More sophisticated, professional and scientific&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 20, the French Dou who was captured in Zhengzhou has been brought back to his hometown for adoption , and the Zhengzhou Urban Management Bureau told the media that the case is still going through the process and the fine has not yet been determined. The topic of why French bulldogs are banned has been hotly discussed in the dog breeding circle. Mao Jing, who has raised French bulldogs for many years, saw from this the management problems of dog breeding in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mao Jing said that French bulldogs are not clearly marked on Shanghai’s prohibited list, but French bulldogs have long been regarded as a type of bulldog and face different management methods in various districts of Shanghai. In 2014, she raised her first French bulldog, and she successfully applied for a dog license in Siping Street, Yangpu District. In 2016, Mao Jing was planning to raise a second French bulldog, but when she applied for a dog license in Jiangpu Street, the same district, her dog license was rejected.电话申诉后才得以通过，“办理人员不太了解这个犬种”。 2019年上海表示全市允许养法斗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在郑州法斗事件后，她特意对比了郑州和上海的禁养犬名单，发现上海明确禁养英国斗牛犬，但不禁养法斗；而郑州明确禁养法斗，但不禁养英斗。毛静说两种狗的体型、烈性不一样，相较之下英斗体型能长到60-80斤，“这样即使不咬人，撞人一下可能也比较严重”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们国内其实没有通行的犬类标准认定。”周威说，在早期引进国外犬种时，可能存在对犬种的习性认知不高或者翻译问题。 “其中体现管理滞后性。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国的宠物行业在十余年里跨越式发展，人与动物如何在城市共处的问题不断凸显。 《2021年中国宠物行业白皮书》显示，2021年全国城镇宠物狗和宠物猫总数超过1.12亿只。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;周威认为，目前在犬类管理方面，需要一套从源头开始，更为精细化、专业科学化的管理机制，比如在繁殖时就应该注意其品种基因以及如何训练的问题，而现在上游繁育阶段缺乏监管，到了养宠阶段才开始卡紧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜帆也持类似观点，他认为许多狗伤人事件可以追溯至源头：“为何被禁养的烈性犬仍然可以在市面上贩卖？”由此他建议从犬只出生到贩卖、饲养建立系列的监管机制，厘清部门责任主体和管理权责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;周威则建议，当下破题可以从科普教育开始，例如给校园、物业提供专业的培训服务：如何应对小区内的烈犬，如何正确地安置和捕捉；可以给养狗人提供培训：如何科学认识及管束所养的宠物犬，等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杜帆所在的武汉市小动物协会与当地公安部门达成合作，每月25日左右从留检所选择部分被捕捉的流浪狗向社会开放领养，呼吁“以领养代替购买”。杜帆说此前的两次领养活动举办顺利，全部留检狗狗被领养成功，“目前在准备第三次”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（南方周末记者高伊琛对本文亦有贡献，文中李明、毛静为化名）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中美经济工作组举行第一次会议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259175]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;根据国务院副总理、中美经贸中方牵头人何立峰和美国财政部部长珍妮特·耶伦7月在北京会谈期间达成的共识，10月24日，中美经济工作组以视频方式举行第一次会议。此次会议由两国财政部副部长级官员主持。双方就两国及全球宏观经济形势和政策、双边经济关系、合作应对全球挑战等议题进行了深入、坦诚、建设性的沟通。中方表达了中方的关切。双方将继续保持沟通。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“第一学历歧视”？别用这样的观念轻易否定企业丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259163]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, many media launched reports related to &quot;first degree discrimination&quot;. It is worth noting that on September 29, the Ministry of Education responded to a netizen’s question about “Whether the first degree after graduation is a junior college or a bachelor’s degree?” The concept of “first degree” is not used in the relevant policies and documents of the national education administration department regarding the learning experience of scientific and cultural education and skills training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from an objective point of view, graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from prestigious schools generally have some advantages in the job market. Needless to say, this may be &quot;first degree discrimination&quot; The realistic background in which relevant issues have received attention. But is similar recruitment behavior “merit-based” or “discriminatory”? It may not be possible to generalize, but the issues of corporate operational autonomy and employment autonomy that run through it are also important aspects worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, for graduate students from 985 universities, does the recruiting unit or human resources specialist make a clear employment choice based on the prerequisite of &quot;undergraduate degree from a prestigious school&quot;? This is actually hard to say. Especially as a for-profit organization, the company will ultimately look at whether the applicant&#39;s abilities and talents match the company&#39;s employment needs. It may also be that the company&#39;s interviewer confirms the match between the applicant&#39;s abilities and the company&#39;s needs through a comprehensive, complete and systematic assessment. . And graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees who have been blessed by famous schools may have shown certain advantages in this link and finally got the opportunity, but it may not necessarily be simple and crude academic qualifications that win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, the recruitment process of the employer is that the human resources specialist will screen the resume before the interview. Only after passing the preliminary screening will he be qualified to participate in the initial interview hosted by the human resources department and even the professional interview hosted by the leader of the hiring department. interview. If some companies clearly stipulate in black and white that they will not recruit students with &quot;double bachelor&#39;s degrees&quot; or are suspected of academic discrimination, if master&#39;s and doctoral graduates with &quot;double bachelor&#39;s degrees&quot; can pass the resume screening, in this sense, 985 As a stepping stone, colleges and universities have already been used in the preliminary screening stage. The stepping stone is just a stepping stone. Next, it depends on whether the job seeker has real ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, it should be noted that there is no need for society to over-amplify the halo blessing of the so-called &quot;first degree&quot;. Today, there are so many students graduating from 985 with undergraduate degrees. In the face of the severe employment situation, some Ph.D.s from Peking University have gone to compete for urban management personnel, and some have Ph.D.s from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine to work as school doctors in middle schools. Undergraduate program 985 really does not have as dazzling aura and powerful blessing as some people imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, objectively speaking, students from undergraduate 985 colleges generally have some advantages in the job market compared to non-985 colleges. This itself also has a reasonable side. If this advantage does not exist, then the motivation for students to work hard to get into a good university may not exist, and there will be no difference between a good university and an average university. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, on the surface, students have gained some advantages with the blessing of diplomas from 985 colleges, but the actual logic is the other way around: the ranking of college entrance examination scores and the distinction between prestigious schools and non-prestigious schools are Ranking of students’ intelligence and abilities. In this sense, it is generally the outstanding students who make the 985 colleges and universities successful, not the other way around. Therefore, the 985 diploma has an important signaling function and constitutes an important reference for employers to screen resumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are people with high scores and low abilities, and there are also people with low scores and high abilities; there are people who make mistakes in the college entrance examination, and there are also people who perform exceptionally well in the college entrance examination. However, firstly, it depends on whether it is a high probability or a small probability; secondly, In the end, everyone has to accept the test of the market and the employer. It depends on the real talent and hard work, whether it is a mule or a horse drawn out for a walk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enterprises are profit-making organizations, and they will ultimately look at whether the candidates’ abilities and talents match the company’s employment needs, and whether they can create higher value for the company. The HR and employing departments may take a high look at job seekers with 985 undergraduate degrees, but that’s all. Next, it depends on whether the job seekers’ performance in the interview meets their expectations for talents. Especially in free competition industries, companies have no incentive to leave more capable non-985 undergraduate job seekers and instead use incompetent 985 undergraduate job seekers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there are two people, one has a non-985 degree + 985 graduate school, and the other has a 985 degree + 985 graduate school, and the company does not admit the former but admits the latter, does it become &quot;first degree discrimination&quot;? I&#39;m afraid not so. Job seekers and employers are two-way choices. Reaching a consensus respects the rights of both parties and improves market efficiency. By extension, if job seekers themselves are very capable, but they want to go to a high-paying unit but not to a low-wage unit, does this constitute discrimination against the latter? Even if it is, it is efficiency discrimination and should be justified. Just as when people get married, they would rather find someone with good family conditions than someone with poor conditions. This cannot be said to be discrimination against the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, under the severe employment situation, the key to giving students more and better job opportunities is to inspire entrepreneurs’ confidence and expectations for the future, so that they dare to invest real money Pay attention to expand investment and create more and better jobs. This requires respecting entrepreneurs&#39; autonomy in business operations and employment, and not denying the right of enterprises to &quot;select the best&quot; at every turn and weakening entrepreneurs&#39; motivation and confidence in investing and making bets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If companies are not allowed to show their recruitment preferences, there are only two consequences: First, companies hide their preferences in the short term but write them down in their hearts. This is nothing more than making job seekers do more useless work, which is detrimental to job hunting. Is it really good? Second, in the long run, companies will feel that the business environment and conceptual environment are not good, and they will be more cautious in investing and making bets.

(Southern Weekend reporter Liu Yixian/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Interview with Yang Niuhua’s abduction case (for details, see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com /content/253854&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: she abducted 11 children and even sold her own son&lt;/a>;&quot;), this was the first time I got close to parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the morning of July 14, 2023, Yu Huaying, a human trafficker who abducted Yang Niuhua, was tried at the Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province. Outside the court, people looking for relatives stood outside. Parents. Most of them wore white shirts with photos of their babies printed on them, and held missing persons signs with yellow characters on a red background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Looking for his son Li Xianfang&quot;, &quot;Looking for his sons An Xu and An Biao&quot;, &quot;Marshmallow dad looking for his daughter Chen Yangmei&quot;... Each missing person sign is marked with The child’s date of birth, time of loss, physical characteristics at the time of loss, etc. Behind the sign, there were mostly sad faces, as if their facial features were drooped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While waiting, some parents looking for relatives were also doing live broadcasts, introducing netizens to the progress of the trial and what was going on outside the court, interspersed with &lt;span>;&lt; /span>;Tell how your child was lost, where you went to find your child, and how you got here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I greeted several of the parents, informed the reporter of my identity, and recorded an interview video nearby. After that, as soon as I raised my cell phone to record the video, the parents next to me immediately came up to me, walked around holding the missing persons sign, and occasionally chatted. They know how to &quot;grab traffic&quot; and show their face at any possible opportunity to increase their exposure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This eagerness became more obvious after Yang Niuhua appeared. Parents looking for relatives swarmed up almost in a swarm, surrounding them from front to back, holding signs next to each other. Several times, Yang Niuhua was submerged in the family-seeking signs, and reporters could not find her at all. In the chaos, some parents thrust their missing persons tags into Yang Niuhua&#39;s hands, while others hung a backpack with missing family information on her body. Yang Niuhua understood the mood of these parents looking for relatives and did not refuse. These parents travel around all year round and appear in various hot scenes, striving to let their children see themselves and see that &quot;Mom and Dad are always looking for you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of the day when the trial ended, I knocked on the door of Yang Niuhua’s room, but I was surprised to find that the room was crowded with parents looking for relatives, on the beds and chairs. , the floor, and every corner were filled with people. They are all waiting in line to go to Yang Niuhua&#39;s live broadcast room to introduce their search for relatives. After Yang Niuhua successfully searched for relatives online in 2021, she attracted a lot of attention and accumulated more than 300,000 fans on the short video platform. On important days like court hearings, she is also willing to use her traffic to allow parents to go to the live broadcast room to spread information about finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I sat down next to an aunt in her 50s and watched the live broadcast of people coming and going in the room. It was still mid-summer in July, and this aunt was wearing a long-sleeved pullover with her child’s information printed on it, and several pieces of clothing underneath. After some conversation, she said that she was from the Buyi ethnic group in Guizhou and was born with a disability in her left foot, making it difficult for her to walk long distances. But her husband was ill and bedridden, so she had no choice but to go out alone to find the child. As she spoke, she took off her left boot, revealing that the foot was deformed and looked unbearable. It’s hard to imagine how she followed the family search team to various places in Fujian and Guizhou these days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is another &quot;marshmallow dad&quot; who impressed me deeply. His daughter was born in 2003 and disappeared in Kunming, Yunnan when she was 3 years old. When Yang Niuhua was being interviewed after the trial, he stood behind Yang Niuhua and suddenly cried uncontrollably. The sound got louder and louder, and finally he squatted on the ground and cried bitterly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For many years, &quot;Marshmallow Daddy&quot; has been doing business in a minivan, selling marshmallows while looking for children, while his wife sells balloons at home to support her life. On the homepage of &quot;Marshmallow Daddy&quot;&#39;s video account, he has been to multiple recognition sites where his family search was successful. The village supermarket in Rongjiang, Guizhou was a hot spot those days. He rushed to the village supermarket to look for his children. In order to save money, the four parents who were looking for relatives cooked their own meals along the way, setting up stoves and shelves in the open air to cook. The four of them spent more than 20 yuan a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Finding relatives is difficult, and parents searching for relatives hate human traffickers. But they have different views on adoptive families. Some people support the same crime of buying and selling and believe that the person responsible for supporting the family should be held accountable. But more parents will emphasize that they just want to see their children, and they do not ask the children to return to their biological families, nor do they hold them responsible for supporting the family. A very important reason is that many abducted children are afraid of hurting the feelings of their adoptive parents and are unwilling to take the initiative to find relatives, which will increase the difficulty of finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Yu Huaying&#39;s child abduction case, there are still several abducted children who are unwilling to formally recognize their relatives. They are trapped in complex family relationships and do not know what to do. There are also abducted children who have recognized their parents and are not close to their parents. The parent-child relationship is empty and it is not clear where to build it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the family search live broadcast room, parents called on their children who had doubts about their parentage to go to the public security bureau to collect blood and enter it into the family search database, so that one day they can successfully identify their relatives. , &quot;If you want to come back, come back. If you don&#39;t want to come back, you can stay and support your family.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;This sentence may be full of pain and pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I wish them an early reunion with their loved ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[睡眠保单规模有多大？如何常态化唤醒？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259165]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Sleep policies are being required to be cleared within a time limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration recently issued a special notice to clean up “sleep policies” in personal insurance within a time limit. According to the notice, for &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot; generated between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2023, special cleanup work will last for one year starting from October 2023. According to research conducted by researchers at the New Financial Research Center of Southern Weekend, various life insurance companies have begun to look for “owners” of “sleep policies”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there sleep insurance policies in China? How will the rights and interests of policyholders be guaranteed? What is the overseas experience in dealing with sleep policies? After studying overseas experience, researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Financial Research Center believe that the cleanup of sleep policies cannot only rely on irregular supervision by regulatory agencies, but should establish an easy-to-check national system, and insurance companies should proactively disclose the status of sleep policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; a “sleep policy”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is a &quot;sleep policy&quot;? Wang Xiangnan, deputy director of the Insurance and Social Security Research Office of the Institute of Finance, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told a researcher at the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center that &quot;sleep insurance policy&quot; is not clearly defined. It generally refers to an insurance accident or an insurance contract that has expired but has not yet received compensation or Insurance benefits are paid upon maturity, and policies in which the validity of the insurance contract is suspended or terminated but the cash value has not yet been collected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that a similar concept abroad is &quot;unclaimed life insurance&quot;. Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) specifically refers to the situation where the insured dies and the beneficiary fails to apply for insurance compensation. According to the U.S. government website, the United States combines unclaimed insurance income and unpaid wages, pensions, tax refunds, fund income, bond income, etc. into unclaimed funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In layman&#39;s terms, the &quot;sleeping policies&quot; that the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau requires to be cleaned up within a time limit this time are the policy owners who &quot;lost contact&quot; resulting in the policy being &quot;not claimed but not claimed&quot; and eventually being &quot;shelved&quot; by the insurance company. &quot;Insurance policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Sleep Policy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why did it come about&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why did sleep insurance policies come into being? A partner at Beijing Datong Insurance Sales Company told researchers at the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center that there are many reasons why policy owners “lost contact”. For example, in some families, the elders bought an annuity without notifying their families, and before they could receive it, the elders passed away. This will result in no one applying for a claim; some consumers have purchased insurance, but due to changing contact information, interruption of payment, etc., the policy has expired, and they have forgotten about it and did not return the cash; many families do not keep and manage the insurance policies properly. , family members are unaware of each other’s policy holdings. It is generally difficult for insurance companies to process such policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also learned that orphan policies are also one of the reasons for the creation of sleep policies. &lt;span>;Orphan&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Insurance&lt;/span>; only refers to &lt;span>;policies&lt;/span>; where no one has taken the initiative to provide follow-up services due to the resignation of the original marketing staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the reasons for domestic sleep insurance policies, foreign sleep insurance policies are also mostly caused by the &quot;loss of contact&quot; of policyholders for various reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For policyholders, &quot;sleep policy&quot; means a &quot;sleep fund&quot; or an &quot;insurance window period.&quot; The former corresponds to the situation where the insured has matured survival benefits and maturity benefits that have not been collected; while the latter occurs when the policy is suspended due to &quot;loss of contact&quot; and arrears. This means that the insurance company has the right to terminate the insurance contract. Based on this, this special cleanup operation organized by the State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration can not only revitalize the &quot;idle funds&quot; sleeping in society, but also safeguard the rights and interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How big are sleep policies&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The regulatory agency specifically issued a notice to clean up &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot; within a time limit. This means that the &quot;sleep policy&quot; cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How big is the &quot;sleep policy&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from Southern Weekend’s New Financial Research Center found that, so far, regulatory authorities have not released nationwide statistics. One data that can be referenced is that in August 2014, the former China Insurance Regulatory Commission issued a notice that “all personal insurance issued after June 10, 1999 and effective as of 24:00 on June 30, 2014, with a payment period of more than one year shall be invalid.” &quot;Policies&quot; carried out a special cleanup, and a total of 18.5793 million lapsed personal insurance policies were found, with a cash value of 35.083 billion yuan. The &quot;lapsed personal insurance policies&quot; targeted by this special cleanup operation specifically refer to policies whose contract validity is suspended due to interruption of insurance payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sleep policy&quot; includes more than just &quot;life insurance lapse policy&quot;. It can be seen from this that the amount involved in sleep insurance policies should also be larger. Data from various places can serve as examples. Data disclosed by the Anhui Insurance Association shows that as of June 30, 2023, the number of unpaid survival insurance policies that Anhui personal insurance companies should receive is 77,900, involving an amount of 920 million yuan; according to China Banking and Insurance News, in 2022 In 2020, 40 personal insurance companies in Zhejiang carried out the &quot;Looking for Insurance Survival Benefit Recipients&quot; activity. As of December 31, 2020, Zhejiang (excluding Ningbo) had a total of 121,300 expired personal insurance policies with an amount of 779 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from different insurance companies also show that sleep insurance is no small matter. Ping An Pension Insurance Zhejiang Branch recovered 140 million yuan in &quot;maturity survival funds&quot; for customers from April to August 2022. Xinhua Life official said that from 2021 to the present, Xinhua Insurance Zhejiang Branch has carried out activities to find survival allowance recipients. By visiting village committees and communities, seeking to find &quot;lost&quot; customers from bill-issuing banks, police stations, household registration centers, etc., a total of We recovered 2,193 &quot;lost&quot; customers, assisted them in the collection procedures, and paid 90.46 million yuan in survival benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Financial reports are not disclosed separately&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How motivated are insurance companies to clean up sleep policies? Is the &quot;sleep money&quot; lying on the account a windfall for insurance companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center checked the financial reports of listed insurance companies and found that each company did not disclose this separately. This means that companies treat this as a normal insurance policy in their financial reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior official from a listed insurance company confirmed in a survey by a researcher from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center that from the insurance business side, insurance companies do not distinguish between &quot;sleep policies&quot; and &quot;sleep policies&quot; in their financial statements. Normal policy. &quot;Sleep insurance policies&quot; follow the same accounting standards as other insurance policies. For example, premium income is included in asset accounts, and insurance liability reserves are included in the &quot;withdrawal of insurance liability reserves&quot; account based on actuarially determined amounts. The reserve withdrawal ratio has many rules according to the type of insurance and reserve type, and the conditions of each insurance company are different. Coupled with factors such as long coverage periods and diverse policy statuses, “sleep policy” cleanup is a complex undertaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A partner at another insurance sales company even said that insurance companies may not have the incentive to clean up sleep policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to wake up the &quot;sleep policy&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to apply for a wake-up sleep policy overseas? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Securities Times reported in May 2020 that no one claims millions of dollars in life insurance rights every year in the United States. In 2023, the website of the Association of British Insurers quoted sources as conservatively estimating that forgotten and unclaimed insurance policies across the UK are expected to involve a total of 200 million pounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that in the United States, consumers can either log in to the National Association of Insurance Regulators (NAIC) system to inquire, or they can find third-party agencies to help with inquiries. According to the American Family Life Insurance Company (Aflac) website, different states in the United States have different legal requirements for unclaimed insurance policies. In many cases, beneficiary retroactive policies have no time limit, and once a beneficiary submits the policy, the insurance company takes a few weeks to a month to process and pay out. In addition to receiving insurance benefits, beneficiaries can also receive part of the interest income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in order to cooperate with the cleanup of &quot;sleep insurance policies&quot;, the State Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau also guided relevant agencies to research and establish a unified &quot;sleep insurance policy&quot; information inquiry platform for consumers to inquire independently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center believe that the cleanup of sleep insurance policies cannot only rely on irregular supervision by regulatory agencies. In addition to establishing a national unified policy query system as soon as possible, regulatory authorities and industry associations should require insurance companies Put reminders for policyholders at the forefront. At the same time, insurance companies should use financial technology to enable the tracking of sleep policies, and even use big data systems to check all policies once a year to achieve normalized wake-ups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新任中国足协主席宋凯：不能再出台“奇葩”政策]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259155]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the 22nd, the new Chinese Football Association Chairman Song Kai came to Weifang, Shandong to watch the second China Youth Football League Men’s U15 finals , and held discussions with youth training and media representatives. This was his first public appearance as chairman of the Football Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the work ideas of the new Chinese Football Association, Song Kai said that Chinese football must make up its mind to follow the &quot;Long March Road&quot; in the future, regard youth training as a top priority, and also improve China&#39;s football through greater opening up. football competitiveness and ensuring that the policies of the Chinese Football Association are reasonable and stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/4c31a52c7e5b9847bbfb84f41cf49701.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/4c31a52c7e5b9847bbfb84f41cf49701.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255015&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chinese Football Association Chairman Song Kai (middle) and Chinese Football Association Vice Chairman Yuan Yongqing (right) and Xu Jiren at a media symposium&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Make youth training a top priority Come and catch us.”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first stop after taking office was to inspect youth competitions. The message Song Kai wanted to convey was very clear: “If we want to revitalize football, we must first focus on youth training. In the future, the Chinese Football Association will make youth training a top priority. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai said that on the one hand, high-level coaches should be encouraged to engage in youth training. &quot;Poor competitive performance first shows that training is not good. We do not have good coaches for youth training, and the salary of youth training coaches is indeed very different from that of professional teams. This is a real problem that needs to be gradually changed. The Chinese Football Association must strive to adopt policy regulations and Orientation, guiding the best coaches to focus on youth training.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, a high-level and stable youth competition system must be established. &quot;When they are 12 years old, Chinese players are at the same level as Japanese and Korean players, but by the age of 16, the gap is huge. This is mainly due to the gap in the competition system. Only by participating in more high-level competitions can players continue to grow. The problem with our competition system is that it is unstable , the youth competition system must remain stable and reasonable improvements can be made, but the overall framework must remain unchanged.&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c238d83b720e76683a63f3053a1db926.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c238d83b720e76683a63f3053a1db926.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255014&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(File picture) Young players playing on the court. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Mi&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about what kind of youth training model Chinese football should adopt, Song Kai said: &quot;Currently, Chinese football youth training mainly includes professional clubs, professional sports teams, social institutions and campus football. Waiting for different routes, the Chinese Football Association must first consolidate its base areas and defend its basic market. It is unrealistic for Chinese football to completely return to the sports team model, but the policy guidance of the National Games can be used to increase the enthusiasm of provinces and cities and increase their commitment to football. support,&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the basis of insisting on practicing internal skills, Song Kai believes that the development of youth training also requires the help of external forces. &quot;With the help of external forces, including inviting in, going out and naturalizing players, this can all be discussed. There is a gap between our understanding of youth training and that of developed countries in football, so we must learn with an open mind. The internationalization of youth training is very important. According to statistics, China is now There are 137 registered foreign teachers. In the future, we will continue to improve the internationalization of youth training coaches. Youth leagues can also consider relaxing nationality restrictions and increasing exchange opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/1f2957ee55bb560399fe419d8ecd75e9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;725&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/23/1f2957ee55bb560399fe419d8ecd75e9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255016&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 8, East AFC U15 Men&#39;s Football Championship, the Chinese team celebrated their victory at the award ceremony.

Song Kai said: &quot;The U15 players do give us some hope. By the 2034 World Cup, they will be in their prime. We must do a good job in this age group. All parties have suggested applying for the World Youth Championship and the World Youth Championship. The Chinese Football Association is currently considering it, and we are also discussing this matter with FIFA.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Chinese football will not work if it does not open up&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In his inaugural speech on the 16th, Song Kaiti To topics such as &quot;more openness&quot; and &quot;connecting with the AFC and relaxing restrictions on foreign aid&quot;. At this media symposium, Song Kai explained that he hopes to force Chinese football to improve its competitiveness through wider opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai believes that Chinese football has been in a relatively closed environment for a long time, and players lack competition. &quot;Many industries have proven that only with full competition in an open market can low-cost and high-quality products be produced. Now the AFC is relaxing restrictions on foreign aid. The Saudi League plans to increase the number of foreign aid quotas for each team to 10. Others Everything is opening up, and Chinese football cannot do without opening up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The long march of Chinese football requires players to walk together. How to let the players go on the long march? Education alone is not enough, but competition and a high elimination rate are also required . By expanding opening up, we will force Chinese players to improve their level in competition.&quot; Song Kai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/2f5472dd47520d8bf451e2f807ca9892.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/2f5472dd47520d8bf451e2f807ca9892.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255017&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For wider opening up This may lead to domestic players not being able to play football, and thus affecting the national team. Song Kai said frankly: &quot;Many national leagues, including Spain, relaxed their foreign aid policies, which caused great controversy in the country at the time. In the process of expanding the opening up of Chinese football, , there will definitely be pain, and the Chinese Football Association must remain determined. If domestic players cannot play in the Chinese Super League, they can go to lower-level leagues. The policy can only be more open and cannot go back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Kai At the same time, he said that the Chinese Football Association must move at a steady pace in expanding its opening up. &quot;We must not rush to introduce policies. We must use one year for all parties to fully discuss, think things over clearly, and then implement them step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The Chinese Football Association cannot introduce any more &#39;weird&#39; policies. Policy&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Song Kai said frankly that many policies of the Chinese Football Association were previously formulated haphazardly, which caused harm to the development of Chinese football. &quot;The Chinese Football Association can no longer introduce &#39;weird&#39; policies like the &#39;National Team League&#39; and &#39;U23 Player Policy&#39; in the future.

In fact, Zhang There is no such relationship with the woman (Xu), but the person who has a male-female relationship with Xu is precisely the person who shot and posted the video, Meng. The married man Meng had a relationship with the unmarried woman Xu during the relationship. Because of an emotional dispute, he created a related video through grafting and malicious editing and published it on a certain platform, in order to &quot;retaliate&quot; against the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng released a video containing false information and insulted and slandered others, which is obviously an illegal act that blatantly infringes on the reputation rights of others. If this is regarded as a report, then it is undoubtedly a malicious and false accusation. . The matter is far from that simple. The investigation showed that although Zhang and Xu, who both worked in the high-tech development zone, did not have an improper relationship between men and women as mentioned in the &quot;report video&quot;, they had the problem of accepting corporate banquets in violation of regulations. It is this situation that has caused differences of opinion among netizens who have been paying attention to the incident. Some netizens believe that although Zhang and Xu have other problems, &quot;one code to one code&quot; cannot change the illegal fact that Meng has violated the reputation rights of others. Other netizens believe that although the &quot;report&quot; of the video publisher Meng was untrue, it uncovered other problems. If Meng is held accountable, potential whistleblowers like this will be discouraged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This debate actually contains a rather profound social moral issue, that is, the encouragement of &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; and &quot;low-cost reporting&quot; will really help to form a clean and upright society. Environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Pan-moral criticism&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pan-moral criticism&quot; is a very popular criticism method in the Internet era. Critics often moralize all personal grievances and social phenomena and use &quot;public opinion&quot; to moralize them. &quot;In the name of &quot;justice&quot;, they gain the moral high ground and condescendingly carry out absolute moral criticism of the target of attack. Critics often use &quot;group labels&quot; to project a certain stereotype of the public on the specific parties involved in the incident, deliberately disrupting the public&#39;s judgment of the basic facts of the incident, and then leading the public to attack the parties in order to achieve the moral integrity of the parties. &quot;social death&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Precisely because &quot;pan-moral criticism&quot; can often occupy the moral high ground in the name of public opinion, after successfully arousing public sentiment, the critic himself obtains a certain kind of &quot;moral golden body&quot;, even if he himself Even if there are major moral flaws, they can often be exempted from questioning and accountability under the banner of &quot;justice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在前述事件中，视频发布者孟某显然利用“领导”“官员”等身份标签对当事人许某和张某进行了“标注”，进而引导公众将“糜烂贪腐”这一印象投射到许某和张某身上，扰乱了公众对事实本身“张某和许某是否存在不正当男女关系”的关注和分辨，最终达到使张某和许某“身败名裂”的目的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以说，孟某自导自演的这一出“曝光”和“举报”的闹剧是标准的“泛道德批判”，孟某自身存在道德问题，却又敢于肆无忌惮地虚构事实，对他人进行“泛道德批判”，就是认为自己一旦占据“正义”高地，就拥有了对他人进行单方面泛道德批判而自身不受任何道德质疑的特权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;道德感是一种社会意识形态，体现了公众对社会公平正义的追求，道德批判的目的在于在道德层面上褒美贬丑，惩恶扬善，进而推动对社会道德风尚的提升。然而“泛道德批判”则不然，道德败坏者站在“正义”的高地上抨击他人道德沦丧的怪相和闹剧比比皆是。 “泛道德批判”不但不能助推社会道德风尚的提升，反而使得拉大旗作虎皮的投机小人得以横行网络，不但造成舆论监督失焦，还形成“以无德治有德”的社会道德退步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可以毫不客气地说，“泛道德批判”是“道德批判”的异化与畸变。因此一个社会中，如果公众普遍热衷于“泛道德批判”不能自拔，则不仅不能令社会道德趋于进步，反而导致社会道德的退步和崩塌。而认为孟某非正义的行为歪打正着产生了“正义”的结果，因此不该受罚，或应该从轻处罚的网友，实际上也在潜移默化中受到了孟某“泛道德批判”的圈套的影响，而不自觉地接受了这样一种异化的网络道德观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;低成本举报&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;除了“泛道德批判”外，“网友发视频举报女子多次陪领导喝酒醉卧街头”这一事件中存在另一个问题：我们的社会是否接受“视频曝光”这种低成本的“举报”方式，这种“举报”方式如果成立，是否应当和其他举报途径一样，需要举报者承担举报内容不实而产生的相应责任和后果？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;界定“视频曝光”行为是否符合“举报”定义的难点在于，它并不像传统的举报方式那样，是举报人—受理机构之间点对点的单向传递关系。而是往往以“泛道德批判”的开局在网络平台发酵成为舆情之后，倒逼相关部门进行调查。最终回应问题的，往往并不是传统的信访和纪检监察机制，而是舆情处置机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这导致了一系列的问题。首先，因为这种“举报”方式并非传统渠道，因此也很难受到种种规定的约束和限制，即使产生了法律后果，也往往是因“发布不实信息扰乱社会公共秩序”而受到惩处，而其“诬告”的行为则难以得到追究，这使得种种避重就轻、九真一假小作文、小视频得以以“擦边球”的方式大钻制度漏洞，败坏社会风气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，这种利用舆情处置机制的“倒逼式举报”在有关部门调查前，就提前对当事人进行了道德审判，形成了无形的舆论压力对调查进行干扰，一旦调查结果与道德审判的结果不一致，极易引起公众对调查部门的质疑和攻讦，损害相关部门的公信力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，一旦别有用心者发现这种举报方式比传统的渠道更为“有效”，那么“先把事情闹大自然有人出来管”的心态必然泛滥，先将各种鸡毛蒜皮的生活琐事和个人恩怨上升到道德层面，再发布炒作形成网络舆情，进而倒逼相关部门出面“解决”问题的现象必然越来越多，大量的社会资源被迫投入无穷无尽无意义的调查中，本身就是一种对社会巨大的内耗。孟某的诬告最终“歪打正着”只是一个偶然，我们对社会公平正义孜孜不倦的追求，决不能依赖于网络诬告者的“歪打正着”。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2023年10月20日，国家金融监管总局人身保险监管工作相关负责人刘昇称，监管部门将一以贯之地抓好“报行合一”工作；坚持抓早、抓小、抓典型，持续不断严监管、强问责，整治行业乱象，切实维护保险消费者合法权益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前的8月22日，国家金融监督管理总局人身险部向各人身险公司下发《关于规范银行代理渠道保险产品的通知》（以下简称《通知》），要求各险企在产品备案时，应在产品精算报告中明确说明费用假设、费用结构，并列示佣金上限；各险企应据实列支向银行支付的佣金费率，佣金等实际费用应与备案材料保持一致，即“报行合一”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《通知》下发之前，上海保险行业协会已发布行业自律公约。紧随《通知》之后，广东等地保险行业协会也发布银保业务自律公约。各地自律公约均剑指银保渠道手续费高企和无序竞争等顽疾，严禁开展扰乱银保市场秩序的恶性价格竞争、商业贿赂等违法违规行为。承诺不通过其他渠道及方式变相增加银保业务手续费，坚决杜绝银保小账。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在监管的高压之下，银行保险手续费下调已势在必行。但银行保险业务为何一直存在大账高企、小账不断的行业痼疾？似乎一直越禁越盛。早于2019年8月27日，银保监会在《商业银行代理保险业务管理办法》中已明文规定商业银行“不得以任何方式向保险公司及其人员收取、索要协议约定以外的任何利益”。此轮高压之下，银行保险渠道的乱象会从此终结吗？困扰险企的银行保险费率差损会自此转为费差益吗？国际上银行保险如何结盟？有哪些值得借鉴之处？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员梳理国内外银行保险发展史，并采用横向对比研究方法发现，“大小账问题”根源在于保险与银行松散的合作方式所造成的利润分配机制失衡。在这种合作模式下，银行因获取单边利润的驱动，整体业务陷入增量不增效的困境。南方周末新金融研究中心研究员还以投保人身份走访和暗访不同银行网点发现，银保销售人员的专业度有待提升。只有当银行和银行员工对销售手续费的重视让渡于专业度时，银行合作才将进入新阶段。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“大小账”顽疾&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;银行保险是指主要由银行代售保险的业务模式。它与个人代理、团险等构成保险公司的主要销售渠道。银行保险是寿险公司的核心业务，更是很多中小公司的龙头业务。为了抢夺保费，&amp;nbsp;很多中小险企业一直存在高企的大账和各种形式的小账，不少大型公司被动卷入价格战。这就是行业所称的“大小账”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何谓“大小账”？ “大账”即保险公司与银行书面合同约定的手续费，为银行明面上的代理销售保险业务收入；“小账”则是保险公司私下给银行工作人员的销售激励，形式多样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在2019年，一家股份制银行行长在内部会议上谈及从严治理违规违纪行为时说，他最不能容忍的一件事，就是员工收取保险公司的回扣。事实上，监管机构也多次整肃过小账问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早于2019年8月27日，银保监会在《商业银行代理保险业务管理办法》已明文规定商业银行“不得以任何方式向保险公司及其人员收取、索要协议约定以外的任何利益”。数年来，整顿持续，但未见大成效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/OuOgJkoLFPDWFMaDwkIxlbWLwDEYesUm9fthHglI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1509&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/OuOgJkoLFPDWFMaDwkIxlbWLwDEYesUm9fthHglI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255032&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（梁淑怡/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“大账高企，小账不绝”何以成为顽疾？从表面上看，“大小账”问题是因为银行银保合作中因拥有庞大的渠道和雄厚的客户资源而处于强势地位，但根源在于银、保双方短期、松散的合作模式下利益分配机制不合理所致。银行与保险作为独立的主体，两者间没有平等合作的基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;银行强势地位成因复杂，但在以银行为主导的金融市场格局下并不必然导致“大小账”问题。比如在银保业务发源地欧洲，法国和意大利等国家银保业务不仅占比高，而且贡献大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，这与我国银保合作模式有关。除了银行系保险公司和部分巨头险企之外，绝大多数银行和保险公司的合作模式是“多对多”的分销代理模式，即银行与保险公司签订分销协议，银行通过代理保险公司销售保险产品赚取手续费及佣金收入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这种模式下，经营理念的确定、银保产品的开发和保险理赔等均由保险公司承担，银保双方仅基于营销渠道和客户资源等渠道层面因素展开浅层次合作。从契约理论角度看，本质上就是一种简单的委托代理关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;具体而言，在银行外部，保险公司作为委托人，银行作为代理人，二者通过签订合作协议界定彼此的权利义务与利益分配方式。合同的主要激励机制表现为银行从代理银保业务中赚取手续费，而保险人通过让渡一部分利益换来保费收入的快速扩张，于是银行与保险公司之间形成了第一重委托-代理关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在银行内部，销售任务按总行-支行-网点的顺序层层分配，产品最终由各网点的银保专员直接出售，而按照《关于进一步加强商业银行代理保险业务合规销售与风险管理的通知》规定，商业银行不得允许保险公司人员派驻银行网点。因此，保险公司相关人员仅能以巡点方式监督并协助银保销售，银行与其员工之间基于银保产品销售又形成了第二重委托代理关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是乎，下沉渠道的销售力度在很多程度上决定了保费多寡。更因为两重委托代理关系的存在，双方存在目标冲突。具体表现为，银行倾向于销售高佣金率、条款和利益演示简单的趸交或短期期交类的保险产品。至于客户和产品的适配性，代理方并不特别关注。而缴费期限长、保障功能全面的期缴险种，却是保险公司希望销售的险种，因其内涵价值高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，保险公司对银行渠道竞争激烈。 2019年颁布的《商业银行代理保险业务管理办法》（下称“办法”)规定，商业银行每个网点在同一会计年度内只能与不超过3家保险公司开展保险代理业务合作，即“1+3”模式。银行下沉渠道的优劣与配置，成为各保险公司抢夺的重点。因此，《办法》在一定程度上加剧了保险公司对银行优质渠道竞争的白热化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在产品严重同质化的情况下，大账小账成为另类竞争利器。刘昇对此评价称，近些年，人身保险业同质化竞争严重，保险公司费用管理普遍较为粗放，导致实际费用超出了产品报备时的水平，出现“报行不一”的情况。费用高企不仅扰乱了市场秩序，也是虚假费用、虚假投保、虚假退保等问题的根源，更是滋生“代理黑产”的土壤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;银保渠道费用虚高到什么程度？刘昇透露，截至10月20日，绝大多数开展银保业务的银行已与保险公司按照“报行合一”的要求重新签约。初步估算，银保渠道的佣金费率较之前平均水平下降了约30%左右。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“大小账”竞争的结果之一即市场份额分散。据国联证券统计显示，从人身险公司的银保渠道保费规模来看，银保渠道保费排名前十的公司市占率由2017年的59.9%降至2021年的52.1%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各种原因交织之下，银保渠道形成“费用高、价值低”的现状，银保渠道也是投保人投诉较多的渠道之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为，“大小账”问题产生是历史和现实交织，是以往保险行业粗放式发展的产物。近年来，保险业支持经济社会发展受到高度重视，监管部门在多个重点领域推动深化改革，既有综合制度建设，又涉及公司治理、偿付能力、资金运用和消费者权益保护等核心领域。 《通知》释放出改革信号，将在一定程度上抑制行业“大小账”问题。但能否彻底根治“大账高企小账不绝”的顽疾，仍有赖于行业自律、银保双方深化合作和健全长效激励机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;变革&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;窗口期&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;临管机构为何在此时加码整肃银保业务？南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为，新形势下保险行业发生重大变化，此时是改革窗口期。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从保险行业而言，代理人队伍持续缩减，人身险行业原保费收入增速低位徘徊。 2022年，人身险行业继续承压，进入深度调整期。当年，寿险原保费收入2.45万亿元，同比增幅仅为4%，占人身险保费比例为71.6%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/Ted4LW6uHu6upX9Pr6OsFDZHhV2Uc5wiKBxoBr6h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1509&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/Ted4LW6uHu6upX9Pr6OsFDZHhV2Uc5wiKBxoBr6h.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;从消费行为看，保险消费已从“买不买”转为“好不好”。 《2022年中国互联网保险消费者洞察报告》显示，80后为主的31-40岁消费者保险花费更多，其中75%的家庭年度保险花费超5000元。可见，年轻消费者对于保险认知及付费意愿大幅提升。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从经营角度看，部分中小保险公司产品定价策略较为激进，部分产品存在长险短做的风险。同时，在长期利率下行和公司投资收益率下滑的背景下，具备锁定长期利率功能的增额终身寿险将令保险公司面临利差损风险。中诚信国际数据显示，2022年，保险行业投资收益率降至3.8%，较2021年下降0.6个百分点，明显低于行业近十年投资收益率平均水平5.3%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当前，寿险版“降息”已经落地。监管明确进行窗口指导，2023年7月底前，人身险新产品预定利率要完成调整。在短期应对利差损之后，费差损如何解决便显得日益迫切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;银保渠道改革即是缓解费差损的关键一招。此时渠道整肃具备了什么条件？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员统计并对比发现，截至2022年末，中国平安、中国人寿、中国太保和新华保险的合计代理人数量为159万人，低于2010年的164万人。个人代理渠道提效改革持续未见明显成效。与此同时，2020年以来，国内主要上市保险公司均在积极发力银保渠道、推进“新银保”战略转型，并出台了一系列举措以加强与银行的合作深度，以此寄望实现规模和价值增长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/YNoRagCWoyIZy6owM3Nsbl1ehNwhFJkW3z4NSEkC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;824&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/YNoRagCWoyIZy6owM3Nsbl1ehNwhFJkW3z4NSEkC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;这同时说明最能为寿险公司带来高内涵价值保单的代理人渠道目前还在持续调整中。而中小保险公司基本无力培养规模化的代理人队伍。换言之，银保渠道重要性增强，更突出改革的必要性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;银行同样面临业绩压力。在息差收缩、理财产品破净和信托产品稀少的形势下，代理保险业务成为业绩亮点。以招商银行为例，2022年招商银行基金代销业务收入同比下降46.4%，占非利息收入的比重也从2015年最高值13.0%降至6.6%，而保险代销收入已连续两年保持50%左右的正增长，且占非利息收入的比重也大幅提升至11.8%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/G9GBKprgogUlHMExIlVxAUdWI5O1QjROYAJ7tms1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;974&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/G9GBKprgogUlHMExIlVxAUdWI5O1QjROYAJ7tms1.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为，从保险公司盈利模式看，“三差益”中，死差益、费差益占比相对较小。 《通知》旨在规范销售费用，防范不正当竞争行为，是多维度、系统化规范保险销售行为的重要举措之一。继《通知》之后，国家金融监管总局近日发布的《保险销售行为管理办法》将自2024年3月1日起实施。 《办法》与此前保险行业协会发布的《保险销售从业人员销售能力资质分级体系建设规划》相呼应，旨于引导保险公司建立与客户需求相匹配的产品分级和渠道分级制度。多项举措合力，此轮银保渠道整肃效果值得期待。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;海外银保&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;紧密&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;型&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;合作&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;银行保险已在境外存在六十多年，有何值得借鉴之处？南方周末新金融研究中心研究员查证发现，关于银行保险起源有两种说法：一是上世纪60年代的英国；二是上世纪70年代的法国。但英法两国银保业务发展却相差甚远。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;德勤2023年发布的《新银保时代：价值化的启行》显示，法国、意大利和西班牙银保渠道在全部保费中的占比分别为64%、74%和60%。在亚洲国家中，韩国占比50%、印度尼西亚占比48%、新加坡占比30%、印度占比25%。英国银保业务发展缓慢，主要依赖保险经纪人渠道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在各国合作模式演变中，四种银保业务合作模式，即协议代理、战略联盟、资本合作和金融集团，被证明相当成功。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;中国香港银行保险同样实行混业经营，大型银行自建保险公司实现银保协同。中国台湾亦是如此。银行保险多以金融控股公司的模式开展。其保险产品销售途径主要有以金融控股公司方式进行共同营销和由金融机构进行战略联盟即业务合作推广两种形式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;境外经验表明，银行保险的发展历程是银行与保险公司共同挖掘消费者需求的历程。选择银保合作之路并提供满足消费者多方面需求的银保产品是银行与保险公司的共同选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从发展经历看，全球银行保险业经历了银行保险、保险银行和全能金融的三阶段。它们本质上是银行与保险公司在产品研发、销售渠道、组织形式和经营战略诸多方面的交叉渗透、相互整合、互为补充和共同发展，即银行与保险的混业经营。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但不同国家和地区银行保险发展模式不尽相同。换言之，不存在一种普遍适用的银行保险发展模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为，我国银行保险起步相对较晚，但发展迅速。 《保险年鉴》数据显示，2010年中国银保渠道保费收入占寿险保费收入比例达到50%，为历史最高。但银保双方合作一直停留在销售协议模式上，银行与保险之间的合作关系较为松散。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种模式存在明显缺点。第一，银保合作只限于销售层面，在共同开发产品方面缺乏动力；第二，银行代理保险产品只为了获取代理手续费，双方的合作具有短期性和不稳定性。第三，短期财务目标驱动下，双方缺乏培养银行保险专业人才的积极性，导致银行保险服务水平不高，误导销售问题频发。因此，我国银行保险合作模式有待于进一步深化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;探索新型银保合作方式&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何建立良性互赢的银行保险生态？境外银行保险发展经验显示，金融法律环境和组织合作形式至关重要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，银行业和保险业已在国家金融监管总局统一监管之内，两个行业的监管协同会更顺畅。与此同时，银行庞大的渠道和雄厚的客户资源，是银行保险获客的极佳渠道。此外，经过多年市场教育，人们普遍具有保险意识。银行客户天然具有理财意识，已从“买不买”转变为“买哪一家产品”的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，对于保险公司和银行而言，银保渠道获客成本优势将长期存在，依然是各保险公司尤其是中小保险公司主渠道，且是银行中收业务中不可轻视的领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何构建银行保险新型合作方式？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为，从境外经验看，四种模式各有千秋。现阶段可以适度推动发展深层次的银保合作模式。有条件者，可进行更高层次尝试。我国银行保险发展模式由销售协议模式向战略联盟模式转变。在银保未来合作中，以下几点应着力落实：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一、在经营理念上，银保双方应彻底转变规模至上的粗放式经营，从“销售为中心”真正转向“以客户为中心”。这有利于银保双方达成共识，转向长期经营目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二、在合作方式上，推动银保合作的转型升级。一方面，通过银行与保险公司之间战略结盟”、“资本融合”等方式”，重构银保双方利益分配的约束机制，增强保险人在银行保险合作中的“话语权”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在法律法规方面，建议进一步优化相关法律法规。客观而言，“1+3”模式下，银行与保险之间协作经营关系并不稳定，增加了双方之间的协调成本，加剧了双方的不平等。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“之前有工作人员通知我说，我是开幕式的内场火炬手，但我并不知道自己是第几棒。”直到在新闻中看到了开幕式总导演沙晓岚透露主火炬的点燃方式，徐佳玲才意识到，一直在与智能仿生手磨合的自己将承担最后一棒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当时就觉得这么重要的任务给到我，自己非常荣幸。”徐佳玲说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/397cd0ba6f42ec45937985f88916b756.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;开幕式上看起来极具科技感的智能仿生手，其实还经历过外观设计的改进。 “一开始，我们给徐佳玲做了一个肤色版的手和接受腔，为了使得整体视觉呈现更有科技感，团队给她更换了深空灰的手以及碳纤维材质的接受腔，她也表示非常喜欢。”浙江强脑科技智能仿生手工程师团队透露。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我这个假肢非常酷炫！”徐佳玲的语气中透露着开心和自豪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fdebe0f9d70f3c09452d5e3a338293e6.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;教练认为徐佳玲可能是练游泳的料子，再加上当地残联的推荐，徐佳玲在家乡宁波训练了6年，顺利进入了浙江省残疾人游泳队，又随国家队出征2016年里约残奥会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/07a4a3c6953404a1d8d8bc098f0726b7.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;“在里约拿到金牌的时候，可能一路太顺风顺水，当时感觉站上领奖台也不是太难的事情，东京的时候一次都没能登上领奖台，还是会有失落，但是也是有所预料，因为那时候确实状态不太好。”徐佳玲说，“现在的心态更多的是好好训练，然后顺其自然。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不仅是开朗乐观，徐佳玲还常常在交谈中展现出超越年龄的成熟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早在里约残奥会时，时年14岁的徐佳玲就在采访中说：“我觉得我的生活很精彩，一点不比身体健全的同龄人差。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;除了耀眼的比赛成绩，徐佳玲在有限的假期里也喜欢出去旅行，再加上随队在海外训练、比赛，让她在世界各地都留下了宝贵的回忆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐佳玲目前还是北京体育大学“冠军班”的一名学生，她的专业是运动训练学。 “能重回学校还是蛮开心的。”过去近十年大部分时间都在进行游泳训练的徐佳玲说，“在大学读书既能学到知识，又可以更加了解自己从事的专业，我觉得这样的机会很好。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;随着科技的发展，越来越多像智能仿生手这样的设备、装备帮助残障人士弥补了身体的缺憾，点燃了逐梦的信念。但在徐佳玲看来，“平等”二字，对于残障群体来讲，或许与科技的辅助同样重要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我个人觉得，不希望大家用一种怜悯的、想落泪的心态去看待我们。我们能够站在亚残运会的赛场上，和任何运动员都一样，是努力训练的结果。可能我们训练是会比较辛苦，一开始会比较艰难，但我们还是希望大家能用平常心来对待我们。”徐佳玲说。 &lt;/p>;
