No one can write about both Darwin&#39;s theory and the ancient inexhaustible theme of love. &quot;So brilliantly.&quot; Philip Henschel, a reporter from &quot;The Paris Review&quot; who once interviewed Byatt, recalled, &quot;Few writers have such strong intellectual curiosity; except for her, perhaps no one can view spiritual life so decisively.

Byatt was born Ann Antonia Susan Drabble was born in Sheffield, England in 1936. Her father was a judge and her mother taught Victorian poetry. Byatt graduated from the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. He taught English literature at University College London in 1972. He resigned from his teaching position in 1983 to focus on writing. In the same year, he became a member of the Royal Society of Literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt is the eldest daughter in the family. Her parents and three younger siblings are also Cambridge graduates. &quot;I was lucky in Cambridge. A university English degree often makes people discouraged from writing. Graduating the degree greatly suppressed my desire to write and made me feel embarrassed. But at the same time, it greatly strengthened my desire to write. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/DOKvCJtmvmkSaQNItA7o6YMTBOWPfG8k5ZkQ6iQI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/DOKvCJtmvmkSaQNItA7o6YMTBOWPfG8k5ZkQ6iQI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Possession&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the publication of the novel &quot;Possession&quot;, Byatt&#39;s reputation was once shrouded in the shadow of his sister Margaret De La, who is also a writer. Under the aura of Boole, Byatt once admitted in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Let&#39;s put it bluntly: the response to my first few books was all confused...No one paid attention to what I was doing...She wrote I wrote a lot, and I wrote fast. In the long run, it had a positive effect on me. I didn’t have the anxiety most writers have about repercussions, I just had this simple fear of being thought of as someone’s sister.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In his 1967 novel The Game, Byatt tells the story of a pair of competing sisters (just two years earlier, Drabble had published a novel on a similar theme). Byatt explained that the inspiration for &quot;The Game&quot; came from a board game that her friend&#39;s sister used to play with imaginary fragments, &quot;much like Henry James&#39;s game of climbing stairs to find fragments of information.&quot; The novel is also a reference to Brown. &quot;I found the Brontë sisters&#39; solitaire imagination to be extremely terrifying.&quot; &quot;The Game&quot; also points to people&#39;s creativity in childhood. According to Byatt&#39;s recollection, when she was a child, she wrote about men in disguise sneaking into Adventures in a girls&#39; school, but &quot;most of those exercises were burned before I left boarding school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1958, Byatt married British economist Ian Byatt (first husband, divorced in 1969), and the two lived in Durham, a city in northeastern England. It is a place where the legacy of the Middle Ages still exists. In that era, if you were a woman, they would take away the benefits they gave you for getting married, but if you were a man, they would increase it. So, there I lost my benefits, and from some hidden In a sense, I am secretly happy about it, because I actually want to be a writer rather than a scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt gave birth to two children after marriage, during which she gave birth to her first child. The manuscript of &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot; that had been put in the drawer was taken out and &quot;rewritten over and over again in a slow and unpleasant way...At the same time, one or the other baby was placed in a small chair on the desk and rocked gently with one hand. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Byatt published her first novel &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot;. In her own words, &quot;a novel about a young woman at a university who wants to write a novel.&quot; In this debut novel, Byatt writes about a girl trying to escape from her controlling father. Tense family relationships and women&#39;s independent growth have since become important issues in many of her works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“I don’t want to belong to any group...I don’t like a spiritual guru, someone who asks you to follow or worship him. I like someone who asks you to think for yourself.”&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Is he &quot;possessing&quot; her, or is she &quot;possessing&quot; him&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Possession&quot; was conceived by me for 15 years. I gave up UCL for 11 years I wrote it in two months after I started teaching. It&#39;s the only novel I&#39;ve ever written that was generally coherent, with no one getting sick, no disasters, no awards, no book promotions. It had a terrible energy, and from the first sentence to the last, the whole book was in my mind.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to Byatt, &quot;early writing&quot; means Works before &quot;Possession&quot;. In 1990, when this work became a best-seller and won the Booker Prize, Byatt finally &quot;occupied&quot; an important position in the literary world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The creation of Possession began with the title of the book. I was sitting in the old-fashioned round table reading room of the British Museum, watching the great Coleridge scholar Catherine Coburn in the circular catalog area Walking around, round and round. I suddenly realized that her whole life was dedicated to this dead poet. I thought: Did he &#39;possess&#39; her, or did she &#39;possess&#39; him? Then I thought, This could be written as a novel, about the &#39;possession&#39; relationship between the living and the dead. It would be a fascinating story of possession.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Possession&quot; revolves around two contemporary people. The scholar&#39;s research unfolds: a pretentious young academic and a reserved feminist. While tracing the letters exchanged between Victorian poets, the two unearthed a secret love affair of that era. Falling in love in the process...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The word &#39;possession&#39; also has a very direct interest level that can be discussed: who &#39;possess&#39; the manuscript of a dead writer? Moreover, &#39;possession&#39; also applied to sexual relations. At that time , I was studying the letters of Browning and his wife, and I thought of two pairs of lovers, one modern and the other ancient - the Victorians, and having them embody &#39;possession&#39; in these senses.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The publication of &quot;Possession&quot; (full title &quot;Possession: A Romance&quot;) heralds the emergence of a &quot;new Byatt&quot;. She has great narrative talent, and the novel is full of humorous satire on the academic circle. , like a suspenseful detective story, or a touching (as its subtitle suggests) romantic legend. &quot;I originally planned to write an experimental novel, about literary theory and an ambitious biographical text... What changed everything was my reading experience of Eco&#39;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; and its ironic medieval detective story... The secret I found in it is: a great story that can put whatever you need to put in it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the text of &quot;Possession&quot;, Byatt also boldly inserts herself Poetry imitating the style of Victorian poetry. &quot;The novel required real poetry in form, but I don&#39;t write poetry. My editor at the time said: Don&#39;t be ridiculous, write it yourself! So, I went home and wrote a Victorian poem about spiders... I have always been fascinated by the poetry of Tennyson and Browning. I read it as a child because my mother was a Browning expert. Their rhymes sang in my head, and those Victorian verses just clicked in my novel. came out of nowhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time Byatt completed Possession, publishers on both sides of the Atlantic were deeply troubled and almost sceptical. &quot;They begged me to cut out those poems and writings about the Victorian era. The only American publisher brave enough to accept it reminded me: &#39;You ruin all the suspense with these cumbersome words.&#39; Early in the morning, I cried. . Later, the novel won the Booker Prize, to everyone&#39;s surprise (including myself), it became a bestseller, and people wrote essays using my imaginary poet. &quot;Possession&quot; was translated into thirty Multiple languages. I owe Eco a huge debt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;259392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matisse&#39;s story&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Still Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Byatt once said in an exclusive interview with the New York Times: &quot;I am not an academic who accidentally wrote a novel. In fact, I happen to be a moderately academic novelist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt&#39;s early literary creations were modeled after George Eliot and Iris Murdoch. Like the former, she regards novels as an ideal art form because &quot;you can absorb the whole world from them&quot;; influenced by the latter, she tries to portray characters who are entangled and struggling with various ideas; at the same time, following the example of her two predecessors, she admires Utter writes dense, detailed novels that are challenging to read even for her smart, patient fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The difficulty lies in the fact that sentences like this can be seen everywhere: a dense collection of unknown knowledge and the author&#39;s delicate and rigorous subjective feelings; specialized terms in the fields of classics, mythology and art are randomly picked up... ...long sentences contain alternating long and short clauses...familiar words have long-abandoned meanings or obscure meanings.&quot; Yang Xiangrong, the translator of Byatt&#39;s works, once &quot;complained&quot; that the translation of &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot; was difficult, But I was impressed, &quot;When I read it for the second time, I gradually fell in love with the complex and regular language style, the unremitting capture of subtleties, and the almost aristocratic style of writing in which the writer never creates simple sentences.

I suddenly realized that I had experienced a certain period. History.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt set the background of &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot; in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne. In the very short time span from rehearsal, performance to completion of a historical drama, Bo The three children of the Te family have undergone fundamental changes. The eldest daughter Stephanie got married and had a child, the 18-year-old second daughter Frederica lost her virginity, and the youngest son Marcus was deceived and became insane... They all experienced dangerous growth. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the novel, Byatt begins with &quot;National Portrait Gallery: 1968&quot;, &quot;I experienced the early 1950s. I lived in the 1960s, and I don&#39;t regard the 1960s as A time for a revolution, but as a time when I can look back on the history in which I lived... What is personal is not political, although the participants in politics are individuals. Politics is not personal at all.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In 1972, Byatt&#39;s son Charles, who was just over 11 years old, died suddenly in a car accident on his way to school. After losing her beloved son, she experienced landslides and ice cracks in her life. She wrote a sentence at the end of the prologue of the novel. A woman whose son was seriously injured in the collision said, &quot;That woman used to be a good teacher, but not anymore. She used to have many friends, but now she doesn&#39;t have them. She used to have a lovable body, but now she doesn&#39;t. She was scared and angry.

The English title of the novel &quot;Still Life&quot; is interpreted literally - &quot;still life&quot; - that is, death.

The so-called still life painting is synonymous with natural death.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have already conceived it. Stephanie&#39;s death in 1961. I thought I was going to write a series of novels in which I would make that death a central awareness, so that readers would feel the pain of a real death, as you did, rather than having to deal with a real death. A fictional death. Every two or three months I get a letter from a reader saying, how dare you do this to me. I sit down and cry all night long.

In the novel&#39;s acknowledgments, Byatt records exchanges with scholars in different fields: snails and genetics, physiology and cognition, the possibilities of television, the ethnology of birds, religious culture, etc. Together with her heroines, she explores new worlds beyond literature and art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/9dAAI9mIPjzGJqN11hUrf64NO8ee2Xg70zTnOaGk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;435&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/9dAAI9mIPjzGJqN11hUrf64NO8ee2Xg70zTnOaGk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tower of Babel&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I read an article that asked:&#39; Is there no support for rationality? &#39;I guess I&#39;m a rationalist.

It pissed me off.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt admitted that when she was 30, she had I feel scared because &quot;spring comes carelessly, and I will grow old and die&quot;, &quot;But now that I have reached such an age, this fact makes me more gratified: even if I die, spring will continue to come... still There are rocks and trees...

Is such low-quality competition really conducive to the long-term development of domestic jewelry companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259328&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Robbing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many consumers who don’t know much about gold brands have inevitably encountered such confusion: Why do so many gold companies have the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;? For example, Chow Tai Fook, Chow Sang Sang, Chow Tai Sang, Saturday Fook, Chow Jin Sang, Chow Pak Fook, Chow Fu Sang... In fact, the founders of many of them are not named &quot;Chow&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook is a well-known old brand. As early as 1929, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s founder Zhou Zhiyuan founded the first &quot;Chow Tai Fook Gold Store&quot; on Hongde Road, Guangzhou, mainly selling traditional gold jewelry. In the 1930s, due to the current situation, Zhou Zhiyuan moved Chow Tai Fook Bank from Guangzhou to Macau, and later opened a branch in Hong Kong. In 2011, Chow Tai Fook was listed in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Sang Sang is also an old brand, and the founder is also named Zhou. In 1934, Shunde native Zhou Fangpu founded Jinhang in Guangzhou. From the 1930s to the 1940s, Chow Sang Sang had opened many branches in Hong Kong and Macao. Chow Sang Sang was listed in 1973. It was the first listed gold and jewelry company in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang was established much later than Chow Tai Fook and Chow Sang Sang. It opened its first counter in Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing in 1999 and was listed on the Shenzhen Main Board in 2017. The founder of Zhou Dasheng, Zhou Zongwen, is from Fuqing, Fujian Province, but his surname is indeed &quot;Zhou&quot;, so there is nothing wrong with naming the gold bank Zhou Dasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Saturday Fu&#39;s surname is &quot;Zhou&quot;, which has caused a lot of controversy. In 2004, Li Weipeng and Chen Chuangjin jointly invested in the establishment of Saturday Fortune. In 2005, Chen Chuangjin transferred 50% of the equity held by Li Weipeng to Li Weizhu, Li Weipeng&#39;s brother. In other words, the founder and current head of Saturday Fortune is named &quot;Li&quot;. The name of Luk Fook will also cause consumers to confuse it with &quot;Luk Fook Jewelry&quot;. Lukfook Jewelry was established in Hong Kong in 1991 and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1997. It is more senior than Lukfook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some jewelry brands named &quot;Zhou&quot; that appeared after 2000 did not have founders named Zhou. For example, the founders of Zhou Jinsheng are surnamed Li, the founders of Zhou Baifu are surnamed Ye, and the founders of Zhou Fusheng are surnamed Zheng... The founders of these brands must be well aware of whether there is a motive for &quot;taking advantage of&quot; the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rush to surname &quot;Zhou&quot; reflects a dilemma of domestic jewelry brands: There is still a lack of domestic jewelry brands that are truly out of the circle, and consumers fail to understand some of the problems. Some brands generate real loyalty. Gold banks look similar, and consumers don’t care that much. This gives those who “fake” the brand an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259329&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Seize for the sinking market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are they competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;, China&#39;s major gold banks are also competing for the market. This time, the employees of Zhou Taisheng and Lao Fengxiang fought over soliciting business, which is a microcosm of the current situation of jewelry brands competing for the sinking market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Whether it is Lao Fengxiang, China Gold, or a group of gold banks named &quot;Zhou&quot;, they have opened stores in the sinking market. Some netizens posted that their hometown is a small county, but “seven or eight gold stores have opened on one street.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook&#39;s first quarter financial report of this year shows that in the first quarter, Chow Tai Fook opened 248 new retail points in the mainland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang&#39;s financial report shows that as of the first quarter of 2023, the number of Chow Tai Sang&#39;s terminal stores has increased by a net of 133 stores compared with the end of the same period last year, and by a net increase of 21 stores from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China Gold&#39;s 2023 first quarter financial report shows that China Gold added 21 direct-operated stores and 325 franchise stores in the first quarter; Chow Sang Sang also predicted in the financial report , the group will have a net increase of approximately 100 branches in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these branches are in third- and fourth-tier cities. For example, in 2022, more than half of Chow Tai Fook&#39;s new stores will be located in sinking markets, and the proportion of retail value in third-tier, fourth-tier and other cities has reached one-third. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why we target the sinking market is that on the one hand, the gold and jewelry market in first- and second-tier cities has gradually become saturated, and there is no shortage of gold banks and gold stores. Expand market share and begin to extend to lower-tier markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, in addition to investment and self-wear, a very critical part of the consumer demand for jewelry is wedding demand. In small counties, there are customary requirements for &quot;three golds&quot; (gold necklaces, gold rings, gold earrings) or &quot;hardwares&quot; (gold bracelets and gold headdresses are added to the &quot;three golds&quot;) for weddings. Gold consumption of 10,000 yuan is &quot;standard&quot; in many places. This is a big cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the sinking of gold brands has also brought new problems. The first thing to bear the brunt is brand management. Many new stores are franchise stores of the brand. The management level of the franchisees varies. Once a problem occurs, it becomes a brand problem and has an impact on the brand image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is even more embarrassing is that for consumers in the sinking market, whether you are the senior Lao Fengxiang, Chow Tai Fook, the much younger Chow Tai Seng, or the local There is no fundamental difference between some &quot;no-name&quot; gold banks. Consumers &quot;buy whichever one is cheaper&quot;. Anyway, they are all gold, so whoever you buy is not buying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, the &quot;business war&quot; of gold banks in the sinking market sometimes involves simply and crudely grabbing customers, which may lead to conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Need to work hard on craftsmanship and brand management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter Whether they are competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; or the outrageous conflicts caused by low-quality competition, they have jointly exposed the common dilemma of domestic gold brands: the brand premium is not high, consumers&#39; brand loyalty is not high, and competition is still in the &quot;reckless&quot; stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Precisely because the brand premium is not high, the profit margins of domestic gold brands are not high. No matter how the gold price outside rises, buying gold at a gold bank only adds a labor fee to the gold price. According to industry analysis, the retail gross profit margin of gold is 10%-20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for profit margins, they are even lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, Lao Fengxiang&#39;s first quarter financial report for 2023 shows that during the reporting period, the company achieved total operating income of 24.558 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company of 716 million yuan, and a profit margin of 2.9%; China Gold’s operating income in the first quarter of 2023 was 16.139 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company was 300 million yuan, and the profit margin was 1.86%...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In comparison , some foreign luxury jewelry brands, such as Tiffany, Bulgari, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, have enviable retail gross profit margins, which can reach 50%-60%. The materials used are obviously ordinary materials that are cheaper than gold, but the price is eye-popping, and consumers still flock to it. Labeling consumers as &quot;foolish people with too much money&quot; is just the self-comfort of those who are lagging behind. Domestic gold brands need to face the gap head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Where do these luxury brands “win”? On the one hand, luxury brand craftsmanship and innovation have elements of originality and originality. For example, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels&#39; &quot;Four-Leaf Clover&quot; series has become a hit because of its classics. Domestic gold brands have also been exploring craftsmanship in recent years. For example, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s &quot;ancient gold&quot; is very popular among young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, following the trend in China is still too serious. Nowadays, almost every mainstream gold brand has an ancient gold series, and the distinction between brands is even worse. Disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The other is the continuous cultivation of brand image. Nowadays, many gold brands co-brand with brands that young people like, such as Harry Potter and Zootopia. This is of course one way, but the co-branding itself relies more on the power of other brands and cannot be converted into the value of its own brand. . Consumers will buy co-branded models, but they will not become loyal users of gold brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the final analysis, to enhance brand power, we must avoid short-sightedness, avoid eagerness for quick success, avoid following the trend, be calm, sit back, and work hard on craftsmanship. Enhance the artistry and sense of nobility of the brand, making it difficult for other brands to copy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Otherwise, if you blindly follow the trend, blindly expand the market and open franchises, it may seem that you have a large market share, but in fact, you will still earn money through hard work. fee. In the end, no matter how fierce the &quot;fight&quot; is, consumers will still buy the cheaper one - and your &quot;fight&quot; is in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[儿童医院人满为患，国家卫健委回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261135]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In view of the recent increase in the number of outpatient and emergency visits in hospitals and the increase in the number of children infected with respiratory diseases in some places, the National Health Commission In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on November 23, the relevant responsible comrades of the Health Committee answered some questions that the public, especially families of children, are concerned about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Question:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Recently, many local children’s hospitals have been overcrowded, and the National Health Commission has taken measures What measures are in place to provide relief? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Answer:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Recently, we have continued to pay attention to the diagnosis and treatment of vulnerable groups in children during the period of high incidence of infectious diseases, and guided all localities to strengthen overall planning and implement hierarchical diagnosis and treatment. system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Question:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some community hospitals have recently opened examinations for children services, but some parents are worried that community hospitals have insufficient diagnostic and treatment capabilities and may delay their children’s condition.

After looking at the collection of the library, I couldn’t help but wonder, just for the Chinese local chronicles, which library in China has so many original local chronicles from the early Qing Dynasty, where you can read them by hand, take photos for free, and each set of rare books has been specially protected. Protected and carefully collected, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Harvard&#39;s many libraries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Zhao Kui said that some of Harvard University’s chronicles were purchased by Yenching University when it was running a school in China in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, some were purchased from Japanese collectors after Japan’s defeat, and many were purchased by Chinese collectors. The income is directly donated by the family, which is the accumulated income of hundreds of years and generations of research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the amount of information, Harvard University’s openness is worth promoting in China. Foreigners who intend to visit the Harvard University Library can enter the library with valid documents after applying for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China&#39;s relevant laws and policies, public libraries must be open to the public free of charge. However, school libraries do not have this obligation. In 2017, the second draft of the Public Library Law was reviewed, and Article 47 stipulated: “The state encourages school libraries, libraries of scientific research institutions, and other types of libraries to be open to the public.” Article 48 of the Public Library Law that was finally implemented stipulates: &quot;The state supports school libraries, scientific research institution libraries and other types of libraries to be open to the public.&quot; From encouragement to support, opening school libraries to the public On the issue of openness, the attitude has become weaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that libraries in universities and scientific research institutions serve specific teachers and students, and students also pay fees to go to university. Therefore, libraries in universities and scientific research institutions should put the interests of teachers and students first. In the first place, there is no obligation to the public. From the perspective of resources and capabilities, school libraries have limited space. Now many university libraries are overcrowded and it is difficult to find a library. University libraries are unable to assume the responsibility of opening to the outside world. Opening up to the outside world will worsen the experience of teachers and students in schools. After it is opened to the outside world, even if there is access through ID cards, citizen cards, etc., it cannot be strictly managed like subway security inspections. There are great dangers and hidden dangers, which is not conducive to protecting students. In addition, there will be management issues, such as the problem of non-return after lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, these reasons are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, although students pay tuition fees, the running costs of the university cannot be covered by tuition fees. China&#39;s universities and scientific research institutions are all supported by state funding, including libraries, and state funding comes from taxes paid by each citizen. University libraries are also public libraries to some extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public&#39;s demand for the library is mainly for borrowing, which will not put too much pressure on the venue. In terms of management, the credit system is now very developed and can fully undertake the management of university libraries opening to the outside world. In addition to ID cards, citizen cards, and financial credit systems, social credit systems such as Zhima Fen are now very efficient. Not only can you borrow power banks and shared bicycles without a deposit, you can even rent a car without a deposit. These values ​​are more expensive than books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for security issues, borrowing itself is a screening demand. Those who have this demand are people with some education. Even if it is open, it will not be like a teahouse or bar, and the demand will not skyrocket and the pressure will not be Not big. Of course, there are always more risks when there are more people, but this risk is no higher than college students taking the subway or walking on the street, so the so-called safety issues are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is another very important reason why universities and research institutions do not open their libraries, that is, they can monopolize scarce information and academic resources, thereby gaining advantages in publishing papers and producing results. But obviously, academic libraries supported by public finance should not become exclusive academic resources. Someone said on Weibo that he went to the National Library and wanted to read the only copy of &quot;The Book of Fishing&quot; from the Ming Dynasty. He only saw it after asking for help. He was not allowed to take pictures. It took him three days to enter it on the computer and spent more than 500 yuan on the remaining part. Copying, and you also need to sign a &quot;no publication&quot; guarantee before you can read it. The original copies of the Ming Dynasty have long lost their copyright. The library should be responsible for disseminating knowledge, but it regards this as an exclusive resource. This phenomenon is more serious in universities and research institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The libraries of universities and research institutions are more professional than public libraries and have more comprehensive subject materials. If they are only used by one family, it will cause waste. If they are open to the public, they can exert greater value and make more people use it. Many people benefit, and it is also conducive to academic competition and innovation. On the other hand, university libraries are independent, which will lead to duplication of construction and is not conducive to the efficient use of resources. Opening up university libraries and sharing resources is conducive to the differentiation of university libraries into professional directions, which is also a good thing for universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which was nominated for Best Picture at the 70th Academy Awards together with &quot;Titanic&quot;, tells the story of the growth of a talented boy. In the film, a Harvard college student laughs at the male protagonist, and the male protagonist counterattacks: &quot;The education you spent fifteen thousand dollars on, I can get in a public library for only one and a half dollars.&quot; Open libraries are conducive to education. Fairness and fair opportunities allow more people who have not entered universities or scientific research institutions to easily obtain academic materials and promote the development of China&#39;s science, technology, and cultural knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2017, the Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Sports jointly issued the &quot;Implementation Opinions on Promoting the Opening of School Sports Venues to the Society&quot;, which aims to effectively alleviate the growing sports and fitness needs of young people and the general public. The contradiction between sports venues and insufficient supply of resources promotes the prosperity and development of national fitness. Objectively speaking, the operation of sports venues is a zero-sum game with little flexibility and an either-or for users. But the library is different. If it is just for borrowing, opening it to the public will have little impact on students and researchers. Therefore, since university stadiums can &quot;promote opening to the public&quot;, then there is no reason for university libraries to be closed and refused to be open to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The library is a public service with strong externalities. It can popularize knowledge, help innovation, and drive the country&#39;s technological and economic progress and social development. The more borrowings there are, the stronger the role of the library. It is a great thing for the country and individuals for libraries to operate at a higher intensity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the state should promote, encourage and even require libraries in universities and research institutions to be open to the public. Nowadays, libraries have a lot of electronic materials, which are open to the public. They do not occupy library space and do not put a lot of pressure on the network. Electronic materials in colleges and universities are open to the public, and this can be done immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这对错置的父女，治愈又温情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261059]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;There is a new movie recently.

He is the one who needs to be taken care of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This contrary narration method makes the film full of a childishness that pretends to be mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/f150d9df5aa87d07e290d3bffcacb8f1.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/f150d9df5aa87d07e290d3bffcacb8f1.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259125&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In our traditional understanding, fathers are often figures of silent giving. For example, in Zhu Ziqing&#39;s novel, the father left a deep shadow after turning over the tracks to buy oranges for his son; for example, the father played by Zhang Yi in the currently released &quot;Priceless Treasure&quot; is very willing to protect and pay for his adopted daughter, even if he faces jail, he still has to protect his daughter&#39;s safety. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A father from this perspective is always like a mountain, extending his hands when his children need them, and becoming a beacon when their children move forward. Likewise, as children, they should also go Understand their hardship and be grateful for their efforts. &lt;/span>;This is a profound expression of father&#39;s love, and also contains a spiritual expectation of parents for their children, hoping that they will be considerate and filial in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, &quot;Occasional Echoes&quot; misplaced the maturity of the little girl and her father in an exaggerated way, causing the father to confess that he was not sensible and did not know how to take care of him as soon as he appeared. child. The daughter, on the other hand, cleans the house the way her mother did when she was alive, so that every place in the house always looks like it did when her mother was alive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this contrary misplacement, the movie&lt;/span>; rarely restores the world of a child. There is the joy that only belongs to children here. She dances cutely downstairs to please the neighbors, rolls around on the grass with her friends, thinks she can steal other people&#39;s bicycles seamlessly, and thinks she is confident in bargaining with unscrupulous car dealers. This is a child who forces himself to mature and begins to explore the grand world, full of vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the film generously acknowledges that our parents can also be outrageous.

Selling tofu bread in a bun shop may indeed violate the regulations, but it does not necessarily require a huge penalty. Is there a more humane way? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the China Quality News Network, a subsidiary of China Quality Newspaper and Periodicals, which is in charge of the State Administration of Municipal Supervision, an administrative penalty published on the official website of the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau recently showed that the &quot;Beijing Wannan Wenxin Baozi Shop&quot; will be closed in 2022. From April 23 to July 27, 2023, &quot;1,169 orders of tofu nao (salty) were sold on a food delivery platform, priced at 6 yuan/order, with a value of 7,014 yuan.&quot; The Chaoyang District Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that the bun shop sells hot food beyond the scope of its licensed business items and violates Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Measures for the Investigation and Punishment of Illegal Activities on Online Food Safety and the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Food Safety in Online Catering Services 》Article 4 stipulates that he shall be fined 15,000 yuan according to law; his illegal income of 7,014 yuan shall be confiscated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undoubtedly surprising that the bun shop cannot sell tofu pudding. As a result, the penalty quickly attracted a lot of attention on social media. Many netizens made fun of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The clause quoted in the administrative penalty decision stipulates that food operators shall not operate beyond the scope of the food business license. But why is it beyond the business scope of a bun shop to sell tofu? This really leaves a lot of people scratching their heads. According to the Chaoyang District Municipal Supervision Bureau, selling tofu curd is exceeding the permitted scope of selling hot food, but aren’t steamed buns a hot food? Since you can sell steamed buns, it means you have a hot food business license, so why can&#39;t you sell tofu puffs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public administrative penalty information does not provide any further explanation. Then we can only look up more information. Judging from the industrial and commercial registration information, the business license of this bun shop was registered in 2018, and its business scope includes catering services and food sales. According to the Food Safety Law, food-related business activities require a food business license. Then I checked its food business license information and found that its licensed business item is &quot;manufacture and sales of hot food (limited to staple food products)&quot;. The &quot;restricted to staple food products&quot; in the brackets is probably the reason why this bun shop was fined. Although they are all hot foods, steamed buns are a staple food, so their production and sale are allowed, while tofu curd is not considered a staple food, so they cannot be sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, the punishment imposed by the Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau cannot be said to be illegal. However, its rationality is still questionable. First of all, why is the scope of the food business license of this bun shop so narrow? According to the &quot;Food Business License Management Measures&quot; formulated by the former State Food and Drug Administration, the food business license items applied for by catering service operators are divided into hot food production and sales, cold food food production and sales, raw food food production and sales, and cakes. Production and sales of food, homemade drinks and other types of food. Except for the specific varieties approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which should be clearly marked for the production and sale of other types of food, other categories do not need to be specially labeled. So why is the food business license of this bun shop marked as limited to staple food products? If regulations do not stipulate that different business licenses apply to staple food and non-staple hot food, is the license originally issued by the Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau suspected of not being administered in accordance with the law and improperly restricting the business scope of the business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be noted that information from the official website of the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau shows that the food business license of Wannan Wenxin Baozi Shop was issued on October 17, 2023. The penalty decision for operating beyond the scope was made on November 13. The illegal facts in the penalty decision show that Baozipu has been selling tofu nao on the takeout website since April 2022. So, when this bun shop applied for a food business license in 2023, why did it only apply for the production and sale of &quot;staple food&quot; hot food? Knowing that in addition to steamed buns, their store also sells tofu puffs, and that there is no need to apply separately for hot food business licenses for staple food and non-staple food, the store deliberately only applied for a manufacturing and sales license for &quot;staple food&quot; to limit its business scope and Excluding the tofu pudding that you are already selling, are you digging a hole for yourself? Were you misled when you applied for a food business license? Have the staff of the competent department fulfilled their duty of explanation? Is it even possible that when applying for a license, they deliberately misled them to only apply for a staple food license, and then investigated and punished them for selling non-staple food beyond the scope? Considering that he was investigated and fined less than a month after applying for the license, such a timing coincidence can easily lead to other suspicions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if there are no problems with the above process, imposing such a heavy penalty violates the basic principle of administrative punishment that the penalty should be commensurate with the offense. The Administrative Penalty Law clearly stipulates that if the violation is minor and corrected in a timely manner without causing harmful consequences, administrative penalties will not be imposed. Baozi and tofu are both hot foods, and regulations do not make any special distinction between the safety supervision of the two. The sale of tofu in the bun shop has not caused any food safety consequences. Even if there is any violation of law, the circumstances are very minor, and it can be given a warning and ordered to make corrections. At the beginning, more than 7,000 &quot;illegal gains&quot; were confiscated and fined 15,000 yuan. A total of more than 20,000 yuan. How long does it take for a bun shop to make money back? At a time when it is difficult to make a living in a small business, imposing such heavy penalties on small businessmen will of course arouse strong dissatisfaction among the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for small mistakes to be punished heavily. In 2021, a vegetable shop owner in Yulin, Shaanxi Province was fined 66,000 yuan by the market supervision department for selling 5 kilograms of substandard celery. After being exposed by the State Council Supervision Bureau, the deputy director of the city&#39;s Municipal Supervision Bureau admitted that the punishment was too severe and was not proportionate. A CCTV report found that among the more than 50 penalties imposed on small and micro market entities by the city&#39;s Municipal Supervision Bureau since 2021, 21 cases were fined more than 50,000 yuan, and the case value was only tens or hundreds of yuan. The Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau in Beijing imposed a heavy fine on Baozi Shop, which is comparable to the case in Yulin. Is this kind of supervision for supervision or for fines? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Food safety supervision is of course very important, but supervision cannot be for the sake of supervision, let alone supervision for the sake of fines. Under the current economic situation, providing good services to small and micro market entities and creating a good market environment should be the primary responsibility of regulatory authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“阿根廷特朗普”米莱：他承诺去做的和他将会去做的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261100]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/VYQXzpdI0T4ZMuFEFaFT7g8Rc2qZzVWbsN7BPZzu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/VYQXzpdI0T4ZMuFEFaFT7g8Rc2qZzV WbsN7BPZzu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259316&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, the candidate of the Argentine far-right electoral alliance &quot;Freedom Forward Party&quot; Milai greeted the people at a polling station in the capital Buenos Aires &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local On October 22, the results of the second round of the Argentine presidential election were announced.

Not only that, massive public expenditures, deteriorating social security, and the prevalence of nepotism known as &quot;political casteization&quot; have become the targets of public outrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was against this background that Milais, who appeared with an alternative image of &quot;wild hair and a big mouth&quot;, entered the political arena as an &quot;amateur internet celebrity gunner&quot; and shouted out a series of remarks that seemed shocking but were actually The alternative political platform of &quot;Directed Demolition&quot;: Abolish the central bank and the local currency and switch to the US dollar, which is intended to cater to the public&#39;s distrust of the local currency and central bank accumulated due to long-term inflation and local currency establishment, and the public&#39;s belief that &quot;strong medicine may be able to eradicate inflation and &quot;Wealth shrinkage&quot; is expected; the abolition of more than half of the ministries and commissions is intended to cater to public dissatisfaction with nepotism and bureaucracy; the withdrawal from the &quot;BRIC&quot;, the freeze of large-scale engineering projects, and the privatization of public service enterprises and educational institutions such as schools, radio and television facilities, and electricity ization is intended to cater to the public’s strong desire to reduce public expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for other &quot;alternative propositions&quot;, they are mostly put forward to highlight their &quot;core values&quot; or attract core supporters, such as advocating anti-abortion and anti-contraception, opposing energy conservation and emission reduction, and drastically cutting social welfare and Medical privatization, etc., are all in line with its &quot;basic color&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At one point, he also proposed that &quot;everyone has a gun&quot; and even allowed his die-hard supporters to insult the current Pope Francis, who is also an Argentinian. This was also his &quot;true performance.&quot; As for the drug liberalization policy, which is very different from the &quot;Trump replicas&quot; of most other countries, it was &quot;condescendingly&quot; proposed to cater to the tastes of some low-level people in Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most analysts point out that although the majority of the Argentine public may not really believe that Millais can &quot;cure all diseases&quot;, given the negative impact of left-wing Peronism in the past Having won 10 out of 13 general elections, the left wing has already overdrafted the trust and patience of voters, while the traditional right wing has failed to reverse the situation in the last two elections. Therefore, &quot;since other methods don&#39;t work, we might as well try strong medicine.&quot; This kind of &quot;maybe it might work&quot; thinking quickly became popular, and allowed Millay, who had participated in a &quot;copycat&quot; Rolling Stones band and was familiar with the way of pop success, to win the presidency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts pointed out that after Millais suddenly emerged in the primary election, the government used a propaganda machine to &quot;demonize&quot; him in a panic, which was counterproductive. Some works intended to arouse public panic about Milley&#39;s administration (such as claiming that Milley&#39;s public spending cuts will cause the Buenos Aires metro ticket to rise to 1,100 pesos, while the current price is only 56 pesos) have actually done the government a disservice because The public can easily associate this with the soaring prices, and be led away by Milley&#39;s propaganda that &quot;the government spends money indiscriminately like this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some local observers pointed out that Millais carefully created the image of a &quot;political outsider&quot; and successfully attracted a large number of grassroots votes under the banner of &quot;understanding the sufferings of the people&quot; and &quot;opposing nepotism&quot;, but his The image of &quot;grassroots spokesperson&quot; is carefully created by a group of the richest people in Argentina: billionaire Eduardo Eurnekian is one of Millay&#39;s most important supporters, and the media network &quot;A24&quot; he controls is Millay&#39;s The main shaper and promoter of successful political public relations images, and successfully &quot;killed&quot; the mediocre public media in a series of dazzling combinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The right-wing’s decisive choice after the first round is a tactical key: Patricia Bullrich, also a far-right but “relatively less right” candidate, won the primary election as “ The slogan &quot;Anti-high crime rate&quot; competed with Millais&#39;s snipe and clam, and won 23.81% of the votes in the first round, ranking third after Massa and Millais. After the first round, Milley decisively stopped his criticism of Burridge, who quickly announced his support for Milley after weighing the pros and cons. In fact, Milley&#39;s vote share in the second round (55.7%) was the same as in the first round. The combined votes of Millais and Burridge (53.90%) were about the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cdRisNIh3HwbGLwcb0IvcmMiztRxeqzryQU7RPLV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cdRisNIh3HwbGLwcb0IvcmMiztRxeqzryQU7RPLV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, Massa, candidate of Argentina&#39;s center-left ruling coalition Fatherland, gave a speech after voting at a polling station in Tigre, Buenos Aires Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Civil and military officials and the &quot;prime minister in black&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Because of the political party to which Milai belongs It is too small and the core team is not large. It is generally believed that he will widely absorb other larger right-wing parties that belong to the &quot;Common Change Alliance&quot;, especially political veterans who obey the orders of former President Mauricio Macri to join the cabinet or join the staff. However, core cabinet members will still try to arrange confidants and like-minded people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among them, the foreign minister has been identified as Diana Mondino, who co-founded the &quot;Free Progress Party&quot; with him. She and Milai were both &quot;Argentine Olympic team members&quot;; she was convicted of helping Argentina in 1996. Mariano Cuno Libarona, a celebrity lawyer and TV commentator who became famous after winning a drug-related lawsuit, will become the new attorney general. This celebrity who is well-versed in &quot;Internet celebrity economics&quot; is in the election campaign In the process, he came up with many clever ideas for Mi Lai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His vice-presidential partner Victoria Villarruel is a controversial figure: she has a high profile and considerable appeal in the right-wing camp, but because she was born in the former military government He comes from a family of military officials, and has been controversial for his public advocacy of &quot;rehabilitating&quot; important members of the military government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;prime minister in black&quot; who does not hold public office, but may have a significant impact on the new government&#39;s strategy and policy direction, in addition to the aforementioned billionaire Ernekian and others, he calls him Sister Karina Milei, who is known as &quot;My Moses&quot; and is called &quot;the one who has the greatest influence on Milei&quot; by insiders, is also a figure that cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Promises that will be fulfilled, will not be fulfilled and may not be fulfilled&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stay away from the &#39;BRIC&#39;&quot;, cut public spending and freeze large projects, it seems that Milai will come to power at present campaign promises that will definitely be fulfilled in the future, because these promises have a broader voter base and are interlocking (for example, the former government actively sought to join the &quot;BRICS&quot; in order to launch more large-scale project financing), which is also the reason for the left-wing and former government core platform and least popular policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Privatizing public media&quot; will also be launched as soon as possible, not only because too many public officials are the focus of social dissatisfaction (Millay once slammed &quot;6.2 million people in the private sector&quot; on a radio show Argentinian employees working in companies have to support 20 million public servants&quot;, which won a round of applause), and also because of the &quot;witch-hunting frenzy&quot; and &quot;targeted smear campaign&quot; against Milley after the primary election, fearing that Milley would lose his job if he came to power. Public media employees were in high spirits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/ve41ebVCsbEYGL3fC3aemeeKyqzo5G3aO3NoKHhh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/ve41ebVCsbEYGL3fC3aemeeKyqzo5G3aO3NoKHhh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259315&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 16, 2023, in Cordoba, Argentina, Milai (middle), candidate of the far-right electoral alliance &quot;Freedom Forward Party&quot;, attended a campaign rally&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some campaign promises will be fulfilled, but most of them will be &quot;discounted&quot;: ministries and commissions will definitely be reduced, but it is not expected to be as previously announced Shutting down more than half of the ministries and central banks is not only overkill, but as a smaller ruling party, it is also not conducive to arranging the personnel of allies based on merit; the &quot;alienation&quot; of countries such as Brazil and China will continue, but it will not go too far: Chapter 2 Before the second round of voting, he had low-key stated that he &quot;will abide by the contracts he has signed with Chinese companies.&quot; Many analysts pointed out that his &quot;National Olympics&quot; economic and financial strategy relies heavily on overseas financing. However, in the United States, whether the Democratic or Republican Party is in charge, (Interestingly, Trump, whom Milai admired and congratulated on his election, was an American politician who openly opposed continuing to provide financing facilities to Argentina). It was a mess. Relations with China, an important source of international investment, may not be of any benefit to Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, he once publicly threatened to visit the United States and Israel as soon as possible after being elected, and pay homage to many Jewish leaders (he once declared that he would convert to Judaism), but he has obviously lowered his tone recently because of the latest democratic reforms. Polls show that mainstream public opinion in Argentina is very interested in the U.S. dollar, but has little interest in having the country get too close to Israel, especially in having its president &quot;Judaized.&quot; Therefore, the visit is likely to take place, but it is not expected to be &quot;excessive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Promises that are almost certain to be unfulfilled include bashing the Pope (apologized before the second round of voting), &quot;guns for all&quot; (publicly abandoned after the first round of voting due to reverse polls), privatization of health care decentralization and large-scale cuts in public welfare (which has been significantly retracted after the strong reversal in the polls), as well as &quot;ceding the Falklands to the United Kingdom&quot; - most allies in his campaign coalition are openly opposed to it, and his vice presidential candidate Villarreal endorses it. Several Falklands War veteran organizations reacted fiercely to this, and public opinion feedback was not ideal. He has rarely mentioned it recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It remains to be seen whether or to what extent some of the promises are fulfilled, the most prominent being &quot;abandoning the local currency and switching to the U.S. dollar.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that given that Argentina’s local currency has long been discredited at home and abroad, and that Argentine companies and ordinary people have actually begun to switch to the U.S. dollar, the resistance to “currency dollarization” is not as great as imagined. , coupled with public complaints about &quot;the government creating inflation and poverty through money printing,&quot; this move is also expected to gain popularity in a short period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But most analysts, such as William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics and Thierry Larose, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich, believe that the situation is It’s not that simple: Argentina is the third largest economy in Latin America. Giving up its local currency and switching to the U.S. dollar means giving up control of its own fiscal and financial policies, “financial colonization” of the country, and letting the Federal Reserve control the lifeline of Argentina’s economy. Once the economic situation is further affected, Due to setbacks, public sentiment can easily reverse in the Latin American environment, thus putting the initiator of this policy into a desperate situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, because Argentina’s international credit rating is so bad, it is still unknown whether the Federal Reserve, which has tended to “America first” in recent years, is willing to accept the offer. They also pointed out that &quot;currency dollarization&quot; may be able to control inflation, but it cannot solve Argentina&#39;s financial difficulties, and the latter is the root of Argentina&#39;s economic and financial difficulties. In fact, in his victory speech, Milley did avoid slogans such as &quot;dollarization of currency&quot; and &quot;closing the central bank&quot; that he had repeatedly shouted before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also unknown whether the privatization of public services and large state-owned enterprises will be fully implemented, because refusing to fulfill promises will certainly offend many voters and continue to bear a heavy financial burden, but complete &quot;smashing&quot; will definitely cause In the violent social turmoil, it is difficult to decide how to choose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is recognized that there are two things that are not among the campaign promises but will definitely be done:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is to try international debt restructuring again. The reason why it will be done is because it is impossible not to do it. The reason why they did not make a big deal out of it is because the left wingers were doing the same thing when they were in power;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to carry out legal liquidation of dignitaries of the current government after taking office, such as the first lady and vice president who were criticized by the public. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is likely to be taken to court or even sent to prison after leaving office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many analysts believe that given that Milley’s party only accounts for 10% of the seats in the Argentine Senate and only 5% of the seats in the House of Representatives, the Alliance for Common Change is still a minority in parliament, and Milais is still a minority in parliament. Lai himself is also very inactive in parliament (it is said that he only participated in co-signing one law draft during his tenure as a member), and many of his too radical and controversial campaign promises will face varying degrees of &quot;discounting and dumping&quot; in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 09:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
