In a financial industry that affects the entire industry, what should be special about its benchmark? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to highlight the commonality of financial benchmarks, the research team of Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center has spent 9 months to optimize the indicator system and adjust the evaluation objects of the &quot;Golden Benchmark - China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot; , data update, in-depth research and external expert jury scoring and other tasks. The rankings on the list are about to come out. &quot;Golden Benchmark - China&#39;s New Finance Competitiveness List&quot; and &quot;China&#39;s New Finance Development Trend Report 2023&quot; will be officially released at the &quot;New Finance Conference&quot; held in Beijing on December 8, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to determine the evaluation objects? Why does it take so long to make the evaluation list? Who are the members of the external expert jury? Compared with various financial industry lists on the market, what is unique about the &quot;Golden Benchmark - China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center partially revealed this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Focus on the “main force”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The “Golden Benchmark—China’s New Financial Competitiveness List” will be divided into eight sub-lists and the overall list. The evaluation targets for this list are the main forces in China’s financial industry. Which financial institutions are the main players? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believes that leading institutions in the field of commercial banks, commercial insurance companies and public funds are the main force of China&#39;s financial industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the first edition of &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot; released from July to September, what adjustments are there to this list? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time changes. Regarding the field of commercial banks, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center included a total of 20 commercial banks including 6 major state-owned banks, 9 joint-stock banks and 5 city commercial banks based on the list of domestic systemically important banks released by the People&#39;s Bank of China in September 2023. Evaluation scope. Therefore, compared with the first version of the &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness Ranking&quot; released in July, one commercial bank was added to the evaluation list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the commercial insurance field, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center included the top eight life insurance companies in terms of business scale in the evaluation. Compared with the previously released first version of the &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot;, a large unlisted life insurance company has been added to the evaluation list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of public funds and fund sales, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center focused on evaluating the top 32 public fund institutions and 18 third-party fund sales institutions in terms of asset management scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, the list evaluation covers a total of 79 financial institutions, which is very representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Covering&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Eight&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Major areas&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Which business areas of financial institutions are the core considerations for the list evaluation? category? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the strategic business sectors of commercial banks, life insurance companies, fund companies and fund sales companies and business areas closely related to the public, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center combines wealth management, green finance, digital finance, data Eight areas including security, life insurance efficiency improvement, credit card quality and efficiency, risk control compliance and investment education quality are the core considerations for the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in order to more objectively reflect the dynamic development of the financial industry, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center further comprehensively optimized the wealth management list, green finance list, digital finance list, data security list, life insurance efficiency improvement list and The indicator system and the corresponding weights of each indicator in the six sub-lists of the Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List are designed to make the indicator system and related weights more reasonable and scientific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time shifting is also easy. The Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center will conduct a large-scale update of the list data based on the content disclosed in the 2023 interim reports of various financial institutions, supplemented by other relevant data. The previously released first version of the &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness Ranking&quot; uses the 2022 annual report data and related data information of each financial institution as the evaluation benchmark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has implemented a downgrade process for data disclosed by most financial institutions but not by individual financial institutions to reflect the importance of financial institutions in fully disclosing relevant information. of encouragement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend’s New Financial Research Center will also release the 2023 “Financial Compliance Ranking” based on Southern Weekend’s self-developed “Shepherd-Financial Compliance Cloud Platform”. Among them, &quot;Sheepdog-Financial Compliance Cloud Platform&quot; has fully included the administrative penalty big data publicly released by the People&#39;s Bank of China, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and has successfully implemented the standardized operation of the database. Due to intelligent and manual double verification, the platform is already the most complete, accurate and powerful compliance database in the financial field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to encourage emerging talents and advocate innovation, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center has also set up three annual awards, including New Financial Figures and New Financial Innovation Cases, and openly accepts applications&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Three-dimensional&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot; internal and external&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;review&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;How to reserve seats for various financial institutions? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quantitative and qualitative index evaluation system is still the core weight of this list, but it is not the entire weight. The total quantitative and qualitative weight accounts for 70%. Therefore, in various scientific and authoritative indicators, real and transparent data &quot;speaks&quot; for the scores of each financial institution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center’s in-depth research on the above-mentioned financial institutions will constitute another weight. Researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Finance Research Center have been conducting surveys for more than a month to understand the latest and most in-depth developments of various financial institutions through questionnaire surveys, telephone surveys, online conference surveys, and field surveys. The results of this survey will account for 15% of the evaluation weight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also specially invited 7 key experts in the financial field. They use their own long-term research results to score the evaluation objects by their real names, and the weight is 15% of the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;three-dimensional&quot; evaluation method, which combines digital research and internal and external evaluation, will enhance the authority and value of the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Who are the expert&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;evaluators&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;members of the jury?&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to further highlight the objectivity, authority and impartiality of this list, and to fully consider the professionalism of the subdivisions involved in the above list, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center specially invited experts from the corresponding industries. 7 authoritative experts and scholars form an external judging panel. They will exercise their evaluation rights independently and in real names, and the evaluation weight will account for 15% of the list weight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who are the members of the external expert jury? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are Guo Tianyong, Hao Yansu, Yin Zhentao, Zhang Wei, Zheng Zunxin, Li Xiulan and Yao Zeyu.

There is no shortage of ancient poetry and text on these posters. Among them, the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; appears quite frequently: &quot;I am lazy to write new poems with frozen pens, and the wine is warm in the cold furnace. When I am drunk, I look at the white ink flowers and the moon, and I wonder if the village in front is full of snow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems, The situation described in this poem is indeed suitable for the beginning of winter. While retweeting the poetry copy, major official accounts also did not forget to add the poet&#39;s famous name: Li Bai. Perhaps because of these reasons, in recent years, every Beginning of Winter, this poem always &quot;stands out&quot; among other poems and has become a frequent visitor to the Beginning of Winter solar term promotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as early as 2016, some Weibo netizens published a post revealing that the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; was not written by Li Bai, but a forgery. On November 7, 2018, the netizen posted on Weibo and wrote: &quot;I have been refuting rumors for three consecutive years, but I still can&#39;t withstand the official big V being so tough... becoming the most powerful official disseminator of &#39;Li Bai&#39;s &quot;Li Dong&quot; fake poem.&quot; Until the Beginning of Winter in 2023, when this netizen posted, he would still include the rumor-refuting entry &quot;Li Bai&#39;s fake poem on the Beginning of Winter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Yu Xianhao, a professor at the School of Liberal Arts at Nanjing Normal University and an expert on Li Bai, also called the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; a forgery in an interview with the &quot;Yangtze Evening News&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this fake poem by Li Bai is not an isolated case. In 2020, Chen Shangjun, a professor of the Chinese Department of Fudan University, gave an example in an interview with Southern People Weekly. The most famous pseudo-poem in Tang poetry is &quot;Qingming&quot;, which is said to be written by Du Mu. He believes that this poem was not written by Du Mu, but by Du Mu. It was written in the Song Dynasty. In the interview, he also cited the statistical results of Japanese scholar Takeo Hiraoka, saying that although the Qing Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot; contains 49,403 poems, there are many fake poems in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/dk0EbDGV3e4H0ZBVkrZBMmNZpZsgyZQV66yC4eH2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/dk0EbDGV3e4H0ZBVkrZBMmNZpZsgyZQV66yC4eH2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257741&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In August 2023, in Beijing, Li Bai’s humanoid robot appeared at the 2023 World Robot Conference. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, where does the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; come from? How are these pseudo-poems produced? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“It suddenly appeared, which is very suspicious”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an ancient poetry lover who graduated from the Chinese Department, Xu Rongyu has been reading poetry as early as four or five years ago. While paying attention to the phenomenon of pseudo-poetry, she noticed that the poem &quot;Lidong&quot; was actually even earlier. However, at that time, because she had long been accustomed to Li Bai&#39;s many fake poems, she did not think of researching them specifically. It was not until 2022 that many readers and fans asked her some questions about pseudo-poetry, and she wrote a special research article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, the most direct way to check whether a poem is a forgery is to examine the circulation process of the poem - in which book did it first appear? Has it been tampered with by later generations during its circulation? Is the text you see today the original appearance? These are important questions. &quot;For ancient works to spread, they must have a carrier.&quot; Xu Rongyu told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The existing ancient books database provides great convenience. Xu Rongyu first searched for the poem &quot;Lidong&quot; in &quot;Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot; and various existing collections of Li Bai&#39;s poems, but found no results. She turned her attention to the database of modern publications and found that some more rigorous books would include the sources of the poems. Some of them mentioned that the poem &quot;Lidong&quot; came from the &quot;Tang Poetry and Painting Book&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Tang Poems and Paintings&quot; is a printmaking collection of poetry, calligraphy and painting compiled and published by Huang Fengchi during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. In &quot;Tang Poetry and Painting Book&quot;, the so-called poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; is actually called &quot;Winter Scenery&quot;, and the content of the third line of the poem is also slightly different. The &quot;Winter Scene&quot; version is &quot;Drunk and watching the white plum blossoms and the moonlight&quot;, while the &quot;Beijing of Winter&quot; version is &quot;Drunk and watching the whitening of the ink flowers and the moonlight&quot; - Xu Rongyu feels that although the latter looks very elegant on the surface, if you look closely at the &quot;moonlight whitening&quot;, You will find it difficult to explain the image of &quot;white flowers and moon&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Tang Poems and Paintings&quot;, in addition to &quot;Winter Scene&quot;, there are also &quot;Spring Scene&quot;, &quot;Summer Scene&quot; and &quot;Autumn Scene&quot;. These four six-character poems are all falsely attributed to Li Bai. After more detailed research, Xu Rongyu discovered that there were rhyming errors in &quot;Xia Scene&quot;, while &quot;Autumn Scene&quot; had allusions that &quot;travelled&quot;, that is, the allusions used in the poem were decades later than when Li Bai was alive. year, this proves from the side that these poems were not written by Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Moreover) This poem has no carrier or record from the Tang Dynasty when Li Bai lived to the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, and this poem has never appeared. Then in &quot;Tang Poetry and Painting Book&quot; , it suddenly appeared, which is very suspicious.&quot; Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the media in 2018, Yu Xianhao also mentioned that there were many editions of Li Bai&#39;s poetry collection before the Ming Dynasty. There are 998 poems by Li Bai, and none of the many anthologies and engravings handed down since then include six-character poems. In 1908, the Frenchman Pelliot discovered a Tang manuscript in Dunhuang, in which the Tang Dynasty&#39;s Selected Tang Poems included many poems by Li Bai, none of which were six-character poems. After more than 800 years, so many six-character poems suddenly appeared. It is very likely that booksellers fabricated them in order to sell books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In fact, many of the works in &quot;Tang Poems and Paintings&quot; are forgeries, including those of many well-known Tang Dynasty poets such as Du Mu. They may have been made by (booksellers) by asking some people to make money, because those The poet is well-known and has high traffic. (This bookseller) is a bit like today&#39;s gunmen.&quot; Xu Rongyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She introduced that the commercial economy of the Ming Dynasty was relatively developed, and the book engraving industry was also very developed. Engraved book printing was one of the hardest hit areas for forgery at that time. &quot;Many of the (forgeries) we see now were created by booksellers at that time in order to make profits and attract traffic. (Those celebrities) were big IPs.&quot; Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The ancients have always liked to ask others to write things&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Shangjun once said in a media interview that the main source of about a thousand Li Bai&#39;s poems currently available to the public is It is a collection of Li Bai&#39;s own essays, various poetry selections from the Tang and Song Dynasties, as well as various history books, notes, poems, books, local chronicles, etc. &quot;Some poems are 100% Li Bai&#39;s, and some poems have only a 1% chance of being Li Bai&#39;s. There are at least dozens of pseudo-poems in Li Bai&#39;s name, and each situation is different.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gave an example of &quot;Puppet Poetry&quot; written by Li Bai: &quot;Carving wood and pulling silk to make an old man, chicken skin and white hair are the same as the real one. After a while, nothing happened, and it still seemed like a dream in life. in.&quot; In &quot;Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot;, this poem appears simultaneously under the names of Li Bai, Tang Xuanzong and Liang Kun. Among them, the title of the poem under Liang Kun&#39;s name is &quot;Old Man Ying Wood&quot;. It is now generally believed that he is the author of this poem. This poem is indeed a Tang poem, but it was not written by Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Li Bai, there are also many fake works under the names of famous poets such as Su Shi and Xin Qiji. Lin Shan, who was born in the 1980s, is also a lover of ancient poetry and has been creating in this field for about ten years. Since 2022, he has successively conducted research on thirty pseudo-poems that have been widely circulated on the Internet, including the works of famous poets such as Xin Qiji. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lin Shan’s view, forgery has a foundation in the history of literature: “The ancients have always liked to ask others to write things for various reasons. Some do not want to leave their own names, and some do. My own thoughts, but I didn’t dare to say them at the time, so I asked the ancients to write them. As for the fake poems, such as forging Li Bai, it may be just to seek fame. Although I am not famous, others mistakenly think that it is really Li Bai’s work, and I feel sad in my heart. It will be very cool. There are also cases like the Ming Dynasty where people deliberately forged (to make money).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the means of forgery, Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters that a relatively common The situation is to piece it all together, such as taking apart the sentences of the couplet and putting them together with other sentences to form a poem. Another option is direct forgery. For example, someone may want to engrave a forged book of Li Bai&#39;s works. Then he may directly ask a scholar to create the book and put it under Li Bai&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two are also relatively typical means that lead to the emergence of many forgeries. As for some cases of false recognition, for example, the poet&#39;s name was mistakenly read when copying, and it has been passed down since the mistake was written; or in some movies, poems that were actually written by screenwriters were mistakenly thought to be really written by a certain poet during the dissemination process. , may also lead to forgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For ordinary readers who do not know much about ancient poetry, it is actually very difficult to identify and verify forgeries. &quot;Ordinary readers basically can&#39;t tell it apart, unless you have some knowledge of meter. But if the ancients compiled it, it&#39;s useless if you have knowledge of meter, because the ancients were all good at writing poetry, so it would be easy for them to forge it. &quot;Lin Shan told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, he feels that if some metrical knowledge can be disseminated to students in the compulsory education stage, such as the fact that flat and oblique characters cannot overlap, it will also be helpful, at least for some &quot;particularly outrageous&quot; students. Most people can spot the forgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Rongyu also believes that it is difficult to identify fakes. “In fact, the biggest reason for the popularity of fakes is (there are problems in the communication link). People with very high influence may not necessarily have professional identification capabilities. Then you can pass the test; but people like us who can identify some things and write some popular science articles do not have such great influence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she feels that it is still important to have a questioning spirit, at least It&#39;s possible to be closer to the truth. &quot;I think the main thing is to have a sense of questioning: If you think something is wrong, go check it out. If you search on the Internet, you may find some people&#39;s doubts, and you can get closer to the truth.

The 39-year-old CEO has always kept a low profile and rarely appears in the spotlight. The last time he appeared in the public eye was Douyu&#39;s 2023 second quarter results conference call held on August 14. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu (DOYU.&amp;nbsp;Nasdaq), which was born in 2014, has survived the brutal fighting in the early days of China’s game live broadcast industry. It once ranked among the top two players in the industry with its ferocious playing style and Huya, which entered the game earlier than it. male. In 2019, Douyu ushered in a bright moment, following Huya to become a listed company on the US stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past two years, large comprehensive short and medium video platforms such as Bilibili, Kuaishou, and Douyin have accelerated their attacks, and the game live broadcast track has become increasingly popular. Douyu has also experienced the loss of anchors, weak performance, frequent scandals, etc., and its prospects are not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 25, 2023, Douyu received a compliance warning from the Nasdaq Listing Qualification Department, stating that its closing price had been lower than US$1/share for 30 consecutive trading days and did not meet the compliance requirements. Nasdaq&#39;s minimum share price requirements. Douyu must maintain the closing price of its stock at no less than $1 per share for at least ten consecutive trading days within 180 days, or before April 22, 2024, in order to return to compliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Echoing Douyu’s unpredictable prospects, there is also the whereabouts of CEO Chen Shaojie. Douyu told Southern Weekend reporters that Douyu has no official response to this news and the company is currently operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, Douyu closed at US$0.82 per share, a decrease of 1.19%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;A person who likes adventure and licks blood&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1984, Chen Shaojie was born in Jinan, Shandong. Looking at his life experience: addicted to games, majoring in computer science, dropping out of college, and starting a business continuously, Chen Shaojie has gathered many characteristics of the trendsetters in the Internet era and successfully turned his hobby into a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Shaojie himself once said bluntly in a Douyu live broadcast that he had a high school degree and dropped out of college after one year. He believes that spending four years studying does not necessarily mean a deep understanding of the Internet. Comparing the Three Kingdoms, he said that one&#39;s origin is not the most important. &quot;Liu Bei originally sold straw mats, Guan Yu sold dates, and Zhang Fei slaughtered pigs. As their respective With their growth, they have become the most awesome generals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2009, Chen Shaojie and his partner Zhang Wenming sold their first entrepreneurial project, the &quot;Master&quot; battle game platform, to Shanda Games, and Chen became the general manager of Shanda Winger Wuhan Company. The function of the leader is to realize online battles in stand-alone games. Geek Park once reported that Leader is a successful product. One year after it was launched, it has registered a total of 450,000 people and has more than 200,000 daily active users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, Chen Shaojie, who made his first pot of gold, acquired the two-dimensional video website AcFun (referred to as Station A) for about 4 million yuan, and launched the &quot;Shengfang Broadcasting&quot; live broadcast channel. In January 2014, Chen Shaojie independent &quot;Shengbangshu&quot; into a game live broadcast platform with barrage function - &quot;Douyu TV&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following years, China’s game live broadcast industry entered an explosive period. In May 2014, Zhanqi Live, backed by the state-owned enterprise Zheshu Culture (600633.SH), was launched. In November of that year, YY spun off its game live streaming business and established Huya Live. In 2015, Longzhu Live and Wang Sicong’s Panda TV were established. In 2016, NetEase and Tencent successively launched CC Live and Penguin Esports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu has been the darling of capital since its appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qichacha shows that Aofei Entertainment (002292.SZ) made an angel round investment of RMB 20 million in Douyu just after its establishment in 2014. In the same year, Sequoia Capital invested another US$20 million in Series A financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2016, Douyu’s Series B financing was led by Tencent, which invested RMB 400 million, followed by Nanshan Capital and Tianyu Digital (002354.SZ), with the total investment scale reaching US$100 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Series C financing five months later, Phoenix Capital and Tencent led the investment, with participation from many institutions. Douyu finally raised 1.5 billion yuan. Before going public in 2019, Douyu received financing every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu, who is backed by financing, plays fiercely, which is also related to Chen Shaojie’s personal character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been media reports that Douyu insiders evaluated Chen Shaojie as &quot;a person who likes taking risks and licks blood at the edge of a knife.&quot; Douyu once poached six anchors from the industry within a month, with a total fee of more than 60 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Feng, founder of YY Game Live, once wrote an article analyzing why Douyu was able to overtake Huya in its early stages. “A big reason for the rise of Douyu is that we spent huge sums of money to sign the top anchors in YY and the industry from the beginning.” Before Douyu, YY game live broadcasts could be relatively controlled by controlling traffic and income distribution. Live anchor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, game anchors are different from entertainment anchors. The former has external effects, does not rely on live broadcast platforms, and has other opportunities to become Internet celebrities (such as e-sports events, Youku game channels, Weibo etc.), has the ability to bring its own fans, and can also bring fans to migrate, so YY Game Live has not signed a contract with the head anchor. This gave Douyu an opportunity to directly use the signing fee instead of the share to obtain top anchors, which became the core reason why Douyu could overtake Huya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the game live streaming industry went through a period of consolidation after a big wave, forming a &quot;fish-tooth confrontation&quot; pattern in the first echelon, with Douyu and Huya taking most of the game live streaming market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The problem of profitability is difficult to solve&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On July 17, 2019, Douyu was listed on Nasdaq at an issue price of US$11.5 per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But its stock price only experienced a short period of sustained growth during the epidemic. On February 16, 2021, Douyu once reached an intraday high of US$20.54 per share, and then plummeted to less than US$1 per share now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering 2021, Douyu’s quarterly revenue, except for the fourth quarter of that year, has been negative growth. According to its 2022 financial report, Douyu’s revenue growth relies heavily on paying users and revenue per paying user. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Douyu is losing users. Wind data shows that in the second quarter of 2023, the number of quarterly paying users of Douyu was 4 million, a year-on-year decrease of 39.39%. The number of monthly active users was 50.3 million, a year-on-year decrease of 9.69%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu’s current revenue still mainly comes from live broadcasts and advertising, and its attractiveness to advertisers continues to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2020 to 2022, Douyu’s live broadcast revenue was 8.8522 billion yuan, 8.5966 billion yuan and 6.7973 billion yuan, accounting for 92.2%, 93.8% and 95.6% of the total revenue in the same period respectively. Douyu&#39;s advertising sales revenue was 645.2 million yuan, 464.9 million yuan and 190.3 million yuan, accounting for 6.7%, 5.1% and 2.7% of the total revenue in the same period respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although revenue continues to decline, it will be profitable for two consecutive quarters in 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, Douyu’s net profit was 6.8 million yuan, and the net loss in the same period of 2022 was 38.8 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Douyu’s turnaround from losses to profits is the result of cost reduction and efficiency increase.” Ding Daoshi, a senior Internet observer, told Southern Weekend reporters that he does not think this is a healthy way to make money, but Expressing understanding, &quot;This is also a helpless strategy in extraordinary times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second quarter of 2023, Douyu’s expenses were 196 million yuan, a decrease of 42% from 340 million yuan in the same period last year. Among them, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 48% compared with the same period last year, research and development expenses decreased by 30.2%, and general and administrative expenses decreased by 48.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sluggish performance of Douyu is due to the impact of short video platforms on traditional live broadcast platforms on the one hand, and the impact of leading video platforms such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Kuaishou on the gaming field on the other hand. Strong preemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, Station B spent 800 million yuan to defeat domestic live broadcast platforms such as Kuaishou, Douyu, and Huya, and won the exclusive live broadcast of the League of Legends (LOL) Global Finals (S Competition) in China for three years. copyright. In July of the same year, Kuaishou launched the “Million Game Creator Support Plan” and frequently held various competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the unfavorable situation, in July 2020, Tencent tried to lead the merger of Douyu and Huya, but was later stopped by the regulatory agency on antitrust grounds in accordance with the law. As of March 31, 2023, Tencent held 46.7% of Huya’s shares and 37.7% of Douyu’s shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Game industry analyst Zhang Shule told Southern Weekend reporters that although Douyu and Huya are survivors of the game live broadcast melee, the failure of the merger means that both have lost an opportunity to integrate resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Douyu and Huya continue to experience brain drain. In August 2023, Xuxu Baobao, the head anchor who had been live broadcasting on Douyu for 5 years, announced that he would switch to Douyin. In March before this, Huya outdoor anchor Mu Yingying also joined Douyin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Anchors are like migratory birds, they go wherever it’s warm.” Zhang Shule said that anchors have no loyalty to the platform and are now jealous of selling products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ding Daoshi’s view, Douyu and Huya have few moats. In their early years, they relied on the Tencent system and related popular e-sports live broadcasts to rise. In recent years, Bilibili, Douyin, Kuaishou, and even video accounts can also conduct game live broadcasts. “There are so many people sharing the cake, but the growth rate of the cake is obviously not synchronized.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that in this context, traditional e-sports live broadcast platforms represented by Douyu and Huya are in these A year-on-year decline is inevitable and the downward trend will continue. They are all looking for new growth paths outside of games, such as sports live broadcasts, but the results will take time to be verified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shule said bluntly that the overall revenue scenario of Douyu game live broadcasts and short videos is single. Facing the attack of other pan-entertainment platforms, Douyu lacks more effective checks and balances besides relying on Tencent. &quot;The biggest pain point is Profitability is still a problem.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that Douyu’s only moat is Tencent, one of the three giant domestic game companies (the other two are NetEase and MiHoYo). Tencent has a huge control over the field of e-sports, and can use IP licensing and e-sports event licensing to reserve some private space for Douyu. However, opponents can still look for game and e-sports cooperation outside the Tencent system, so the moat is not wide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shule said that the plight of Douyu and Huya is almost the same, but now under the arrangement of Tencent, the two companies cannot merge and try and make mistakes at different times in order to find a way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his opinion, Douyu’s gaming attributes are too strong, and the user portraits in the outdoor, appearance, and two-dimensional areas highly overlap with the gaming area. The real possible direction for Douyu to get out of trouble may be to combine new profit models in e-sports events that are also difficult to make profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Ten Thousands of People Gather to Gamble”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a leading game live broadcast platform, Douyu has frequently received negative news about pornography, vulgarity, and alleged gambling in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2020, the official blog of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League published an article saying that the live broadcast room of Douyu anchor &quot;彡彡九屋&quot; (hereinafter referred to as 339) is suspected of hosting tens of thousands of people for gambling, and the daily turnover can reach several million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2021, the official blog of China Youth Network’s short video stated that the Douyu anchor “Changsha Village Death Squadron” is the “biggest casino in Douyu” and a lottery suspected of gathering gambling will be opened at 10 o’clock every night. , thus forming the public codename &quot;Ten Points Economic Lessons&quot;. In 2020, its turnover was as high as 177 million yuan, and its daily turnover was as high as 13 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, &quot;彡彡九Outdoor&quot; will be characterized as gambling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sichuan Legal News, 339 member Fu Moulong and three other people &quot;tried to turn their bicycles into motorcycles&quot; through &quot;one card application for 50,000 yuan to take home&quot; between March 2017 and September 2020. &quot;A large number of inflammatory words such as &quot;Encourage live broadcast room viewers to participate in the lottery, and push lottery time and amount information to other people who did not participate in the live broadcast through platforms, WeChat groups, etc., resulting in a large number of people entering the live broadcast room during the live lottery period and paying.&quot; Apply for a card&quot;, swipe virtual gifts, etc. to participate in the lottery. After the draw, winning cash will be distributed to the winners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to the time of their arrest, Fu Moulong and others had organized a total of 4,267 draws (times), with more than 4.42 million people participating, and gambling funds of nearly 120 million yuan. After trial, the Dujiangyan Court held that the actions of the three people constituted the crime of opening a casino, and they were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from six to three years, and were also fined. This case is also the first gambling case involving a live broadcast platform in the country supervised and handled by the Ministry of Public Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2021, Qian Xiaojia, the first brother of the former Douyu outdoor anchor, revealed in an interview that although gambling-related activities in 339 and other live broadcast rooms are not officially held by Douyu, the platform is not unaware of it. There will even be internal guidance. In the second half of 2019, Qian Xiaojia was banned by Douyu for violating regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China&#39;s WeChat public account &quot;CyberChina&quot; released the national cyberspace administrative law enforcement and supervision situation in the first quarter of 2023, stating that it will continue to promote the &quot;Qingming&quot; series of special actions , resolutely investigate and deal with all kinds of online illegal activities in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It mentioned that Internet platforms such as Baidu, Sina Weibo, Douyu, and Douban failed to fulfill their main responsibilities and failed to manage the information released by their users, resulting in obscenity, feudal superstition, and solicitation of prostitution. Regarding the spread of harmful information on the Internet such as prostitution, gambling, and loan sharking, the Cyberspace Administration of China instructs the local Cyberspace Administration to conduct interviews, order rectifications, and carry out punitive measures in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 8, &quot;CyberChina&quot; issued another article stating that in response to serious ecological problems such as pornography and vulgarity on the Douyu platform, the Cyberspace Administration of China directed the Cyberspace Administration of Hubei Province to send a working group to station Douyu platform launched a one-month centralized rectification supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Shule’s view, China’s live broadcast craze originated from game live broadcasts, but game live broadcasts failed to break the barriers of consumption scenarios and failed to become the leader in the trend. It was not until the emergence of live broadcasts to bring goods that A new situation has opened up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The current game live broadcast platform is also looking for its own &#39;live broadcast delivery&#39;, but through crazy trial and error, many problems have arisen.&quot; Zhang Shule said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[100万？300万？想不上班到底要存多少钱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260278]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen in Jiangxi shared his story. She and her husband spent 7 years saving 1 million yuan. After part of it was used to buy a house, the remaining 500,000 yuan was deposited in the bank. Now the monthly living costs can be covered by interest alone. She also shared a series of ways to save money, such as cooking at home for many years, not drinking coffee outside, only buying discounted clothes, taking her children to sunbathe instead of taking interest classes, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the authenticity of this experience has not been verified, in February this year, a Shanghai couple did decide to &quot;retire&quot; with a deposit of 3 million yuan. This news sparked widespread discussion at the time. Just recently, Professor Chen Bingzheng from the Department of Finance at the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University was interviewed by CCTV Finance. He mentioned that “a survey found that over 70% of those born after 90 start to think about pension issues.” He said that it is too late to start thinking about pension issues at the age of 35.

Recently, in an interview with Guangdong Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;Financial Eyes&quot;, Dong Mingzhu responded publicly to the matter for the first time: Internet celebrities do not judge people&#39;s quality, and it is illegal for people to advertise outside Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dong Mingzhu said Meng Yutong’s part-time job accepting advertisements was illegal” was once a hot search topic. According to a report by the Shanghai Securities News on May 16, the reason for Meng Yutong&#39;s resignation was that he &quot;often missed work to participate in business activities and take on private work&quot; during his time at the company. After the company talked to him, he still carried out related activities without improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, Meng Yutong did receive advertisements on social media platforms. In the short videos on his Xiaohongshu account, he appeared many times selling clothing, beauty products, electronic products and household goods. In the &quot;Good Things Pocket&quot; column, there are 65 notes included, none of which have anything to do with Gree Electric products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally thought that the rights and wrongs of this incident were very clear. However, many netizens believe that the contract Meng Yutong signed with Gree is a labor contract, not an endorsement contract. The time outside the eight hours is her own. Of course, she has the right to control how much she earns through endorsements and part-time advertising. Money is a reflection of her ability. This has also led to some discussions: Is it appropriate for the company to restrict employees from doing side jobs? If the income from your main job is not as good as your side job, will you leave your job? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this point of view and these discussions? First of all, it must be said unequivocally that it is not appropriate to use Meng Yutong&#39;s case to demonstrate the rationality of employees taking part-time jobs or doing side jobs outside of their own jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Yutong did graduate from a prestigious university, has a sweet appearance, and has good looks, but these qualities are not sufficient or necessary conditions to become an Internet celebrity. There are a lot of people with these qualities, but only a few lucky ones are successful. The track for Internet celebrities is very crowded and very winding. If someone says that Meng Yutong’s ability to become an Internet celebrity depends entirely or mainly on his personal abilities, that is undoubtedly not objective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that Meng Yutong became an Internet celebrity mainly due to Dong Mingzhu’s efforts on top of his buildable personal qualities. Dong Mingzhu made her his secretary, and announced that he would train her to be his successor and take her to various occasions. Through the event, many hot searches and topics were created, bringing her countless traffic. Dong Mingzhu is working hard to make her the first person to bring goods to Gree live broadcast. In this sense, Meng Yutong, who has become an Internet celebrity, is an asset of Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Dong Mingzhu and Gree are obviously old-school, hoping that gentlemen&#39;s agreement and personal consciousness will have sufficient behavioral constraints on Meng Yutong, rather than &quot;first Before the company invests resources in an individual, it ensures and locks in potential future earnings, and limits and eliminates the risk of breach of trust of a sparrow that turns into a phoenix and then soars into the sky and escapes control. That is, the contract stipulates the rights and obligations of both parties and improves the The cost of breach of trust should be taken into account before you can safely invest in betting and package marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when it was discovered that Meng Yutong was using the Internet celebrity identity created by the company to do private work, Dong Mingzhu and Gree did not immediately send a clear and strong signal saying &quot;this is not acceptable&quot;, but The reason is that there was no timely intervention or the intensity of the intervention was not enough. The mentality may be that the matter can be solved quietly internally, through reasoning and persuasion, so as to prevent the matter from turning into a negative incident or scandal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if Meng Yutong had been given a clear choice the first time he did private work, either to stop and hand over the proceeds from his private work, or to leave, the problem might have been solved long ago. When Meng Yutong took on more and more private jobs and his income outside of work became higher and higher, it became difficult for him to stop. At a certain stage, Dong Mingzhu could no longer tolerate it and had to resolve it through a final showdown, which brought us to the scene in May this year. Therefore, if there is something wrong with Dong Mingzhu and Gree, it is that they made the above two mistakes one after another. But this does not disprove that it is in line with professional ethics for Meng Yutong to use the Internet celebrity status created by the company to do private work and make big money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there is no simple answer to whether employees can work part-time or do side jobs outside of their regular jobs, and it needs to be analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it depends on whether there are express provisions on this in the labor contract or other types of contracts signed with the company or organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, units within the system generally have some clear restrictions on employees&#39; part-time work, and will regularly conduct inspections on employees in this regard, allowing employees to declare on their own. Of course you can lie or conceal the situation, but if your employer finds out, you will inevitably be punished or even lose your job. In addition, well-regulated companies generally prohibit employees from receiving remuneration from competitors, suppliers or customers. This not only potentially harms the company&#39;s interests, but may also lead to criminal investigation in serious cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it depends on the nature of your part-time job or side job, and whether there is any conflict of interest with your work in the unit and the business of the unit. You are a salesperson and have accumulated a lot of customer resources. At a certain stage, if you set up a business and go it alone, the company may not be able to do anything to you. However, if you secretly set up a business with a similar nature to the company while receiving a salary from the company, A company that imports customer resources into its own company is undoubtedly against professional ethics, and the company may not let it go if it finds out. Or if you are a technical R&amp;D person and sell the code you wrote in the company to a competing company or other companies, or take work from a competing company, this will also damage the company&#39;s rights and interests and seriously violate professional ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, &quot;Besides the eight-hour working time, it is all your own time, you can do whatever you want.&quot; This statement must be at least restricted by the above two rules. In the final analysis, it means respecting the contract and Observe professional ethics. As long as it does not violate the contract and company regulations, does not harm the company&#39;s rights and interests, has no conflict of interest with the company, and does not affect the main job, generally speaking, the company has no objection to individuals doing side jobs and part-time jobs to increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 20:25:58 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[桐子故事丨峡河西流去]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260210]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;701&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tongzi flowers bloom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Xiahe to Luanzhuang, we have to cross three ridges.

It is where the Santiao Ridge originates and the Yitiao Ridge begins. Going further south is the Funiu Mountains and then enters Nanyang. Why it is called Santiaoling instead of Sandaoling or something else is not clear. Indeed, the word &quot;Tiao&quot; is a bit strange, as if it is a ridge rather than a mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The side of Santiao Ridge near Luanzhuang is a ten-mile downhill slope. At the bottom of the slope is the Bada River. After crossing the river and going five miles eastward, you will reach Luanzhuang Town. Luanzhuang Town has been the capital of Luanzhuang since the Republic of China, the so-called economic, cultural, transportation and power center. The ancient town that was more than a hundred years old now has no trace of the past. Instead, there are concrete buildings rising from the ground on both sides of the Luanzhuang River, which is sometimes dirty and sometimes clear. Everything sold on the street is modern. For example, household appliances used for heating in winter are electric braziers instead of charcoal. Even the dogs running on the street have many fashionable hair styles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the side of the ten-mile downhill road, there are all tung trees. Of course, that was a scene more than thirty years ago. Nowadays, it is all pine trees and arrowgrass. The pine trees are overbearing and the arrowgrass is not a fuel-efficient lamp. With them, there is no one else. There are only a few tung trees here and there, and the old-fashioned people have nowhere to stand. In today&#39;s spring and summer, the mountains are green and interspersed with wild flowers of strange colors. Walking through this place gives people the excitement and satisfaction of returning home in rich clothes. In winter, half of the mountains are green and half are withered and yellow, like a failed oil painting. The economy of small places is not good. Traffic management personnel hide in those curves, use the terrain and vegetation to catch illegal motorcycles, and fine them to generate revenue. They catch them accurately. Unless there is an urgent matter, people rarely ride there. If you want to go there, you will choose morning or evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than thirty years ago, I was a junior high school student in Luanzhuang Town. At that time, most of my classmates didn&#39;t like studying very much, and it seemed that going to school was just to complete tasks to pass the time of their youth. In comparison, I love studying more, but compared with those brain-burning words and numbers, I still love things that have nothing to do with grades, such as tung seeds, from tung flower to tung seeds, I love them all. No matter what, it just feels good. I feel that they are mine and I am theirs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers bloom in March. At this time, many flowers have finished. The peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, pear blossoms and begonia flowers have all disappeared, but more summer flowers have not yet arrived. The day is already very warm. At this time, it suddenly gets cold, and there may even be snow. When the temperature becomes warm again, the tung flowers will bloom. The adults said that the tung flowers are still frozen by the cold wind. The tung flower is neither beautiful nor ugly, neither big nor small, but its aroma is different, it is a delicate fragrance, and the smell is very similar to its color and shape: white petals inlaid with light red ones. Each flower and branch is similar, like twin sisters. The tung flower blooms on one slope, so vast and dense that no one else can be seen. From a distance, the flowers on a slope look like chatty words that no one can talk about. Unlike other flowers, there are red, green and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many children at that time. If they all rushed to school together, there would be a long queue from front to back. The front is in the Tung Blossom Array, and the back is still on the other side of the ridge. The front is across the Bada River, and the back is still in the Flower Array. Everyone who goes to school carries a net bag, and the white buns, black buns and mixed-noodle buns in the pockets are clearly visible. Girls love vanity. They cover the buns with a layer of newspapers so that they can only see the prosperous scene of the motherland but not the buns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers have one use: treating burns. At the mouth of the Bascha River, there was an old Taoist priest who had returned to secular life. He was very old, bent over, and his beard and hair were all white. He often goes to the mountains to collect fallen tung flowers. The fallen tung flowers were spread all over the ground, as dense as tree heads. The strange thing was that there was no decrease in the trees, as if they were growing while falling. He carries a woven bag and collects a bag of fallen flowers. I don’t know what he did with it when he took it back. He mixed it with other ingredients, mixed it into a paste, put it in large and small bottles, and applied it on the injured person’s burns. I don’t know which year the old Taoist priest died, and the prescription for treating burns was taken away with him. He had no children, and no one passed him on. Besides, he couldn&#39;t make a living by treating burns. There weren&#39;t many burns all year round. He doesn&#39;t rely on this for a living either. If you get burnt, you have to go to the hospital and spend a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months after the tung flower bloomed, the tung seeds came out. They were all green and tender, but they were actually too hard to be broken open. The boys were throwing it at each other and hitting a bag on their heads. If you smash it open with a stone, you will find that the tung seeds are white and plump and crowded together. They are very fragrant when chewed in your mouth. They are more delicious than walnut kernels, but after a while, you will have a headache and nausea. The shell of the tung seeds removed and dried in the sun is a good material for making fires, which is perfect for burning the kang in winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school cafeteria only has one kind of rice, corn grits soup and porridge made from corn grits over high and slow fire. It only has breakfast and lunch. In the evening, you can only eat your own steamed buns or cook them until dawn. The food for dinner is very important. It must have oil and water, but most of them don’t have oil and water. It’s okay to have no oil and water. There are some varieties, but there are few varieties. It’s just a bucket of garlic juice mixed with sauerkraut, and the amount is limited, so it must be distributed reasonably. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a lacquer tree in front of Jinsuo&#39;s house. It is more than three feet tall and as thick as a hug. Such a large lacquer tree is rare. In summer, it blocks the sky and the sun, but in autumn, the lacquer seeds can be broken down to boil a large pot of lacquer seed oil. Lacquer seed oil is also a kind of edible oil, and can also be used to light lamps. On the way to send the deceased, a burning lantern can be lit. But the tree is too old, half prosperous and half withered, and half of the tree trunk is rotten. One summer, after a rain, a large mushroom grew on the dry side of the tree. It was red and yellow in color, like a flaming cloud falling from the western sky. The sumac mushroom is one of the finest tree mushrooms. It is tender and delicious and can be served on banquets. Jinsuo and I broke it off and filled a basin full of it, but he had no oil at home and couldn&#39;t find it after searching through the cabinets and corners. I said, if there is a way, go get the tung seeds to refine the oil. We went up to Santiao Ridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to refine oil from tung seeds. We picked a basket of tung fruits, smashed them open, dug out the tung seeds, crushed them with a garlic mortar, boiled them in a pot, removed the residue, and made a bowl of oil. I heard adults say that no matter what kind of oil it is, as long as it contains poison, it will be fine. When the tung seeds are boiled in a pot, the water vapor is boiled away and the smoke is released, which is considered to be poisonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We had vomiting and diarrhea all night. Jinsuo’s father gave us washing powder and water, and he stopped only the next day. Fortunately, I didn’t eat much that day and put in less oil. We didn&#39;t go to school for three days. We were both in the third grade of junior high school that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years later, Jinsuo went to college and I went to the mines, and our fates parted ways from then on. I don’t have his phone number, and he doesn’t have any contact channels with me. After his parents died, we knew nothing about each other. The only thing we vaguely knew was that he went to Europe after not working for a few years, married a wife, and settled down in a foreign country. Become your hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only remaining tung trees on Santiao Ridge will bloom a few branches in some years. The scattered tung flowers are hidden among the green bushes, which are more beautiful than the large stretches of tung flowers and do not look lonely at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;二&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tung fruit usually matures in mid-to-late October. The fruit changes from green to light red, and finally turns to dark brown, and it is ready for harvest. The pedicle of the tung fruit is very strong and closely connected to the branches. Unlike walnuts and chestnuts, which are easy to knock off, harvesting the tung fruits is a very slow and hard work. If the branches are not high, it is best for women and children to pick them by hand. Fast. The men climbed up the tree, beat it with bamboo poles, and beat the tree branches into hairless ghosts. There were always a few tung fruits that remained motionless, and in the end they had no choice but to leave them for the next year. Tongzi&#39;s body was heavy, and transportation was also a laborious task. A good laborer had to carry a basket, and he was hunched over and panting due to the exertion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of hammers is very wide. Almost any work related to breaking can be solved by pounding. The most effective way to produce tung rice is to thoroughly dry the tung fruits and pour them into a wormwood pit and pound them. This work is usually done by women and children. The cleaned rice is white and tender, like suet. We children were caught in the middle and busy, and when others were not prepared, we threw a pill in our mouths, and the adults picked it out, and vomited all over the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the oil squeezed from tung seeds. The process of pressing tung oil is similar to that of peanut oil. When I was a child, I had a good deed and a monkey spirit. I participated in the oil extraction work of adults many times. I don’t remember the tedious details. I only remember the transparency and purity of tung oil. There is no corresponding reference for the light yellow color, so I can’t describe it. , using one thing to describe and explain another thing, this ancient and omnipotent language method completely fails in the face of tung oil. The squeezed tung oil was put in pots and bowls, and outsiders came to buy it. Although they couldn&#39;t sell it for much, they made money from the oil, salt, sauce and vinegar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the best paint for furniture, and Master Lin is the best painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, a carpenter is also a painter, and a painter is also a carpenter. It is rare that a family hires a carpenter, and then hires a painter after finishing the furniture. A carpenter does not necessarily have to be talented, but he must be versatile. Otherwise, he would not be able to compete with hundreds of others. There is only Master Lin, who only knows how to paint. He knows nothing about the carpenter&#39;s work, but because his craftsmanship is so good, even if he has a unique skill, he still has no worries about making a living. eat. Because his craftsmanship is so good, his peers often lose their way out, making people both admire and hate them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin is not a local either. Some say he is from Henan, some say he is from Hubei, and some say he is from Sichuan. If he does not say it himself, others will just guess. People&#39;s basis is his accent, but for people who have been away for a long time, eating in all directions and enjoying the scenery in all directions, the local accent has long since disappeared, leaving behind a mixed accent. Master Lin was forty years old when he came to Xiahe. His craftsmanship was not learned in Xiahe, but brought from afar. He became a master as soon as he arrived. He himself said that it was a family tradition, and naturally everyone believed this statement. Most good craftsmanship comes from family traditions. Forty-year-old Master Lin arrived in Xiahe and married a woman at the age of forty-one, which naturally benefited from his good craftsmanship. The woman is seventeen or eighteen years younger than him, and she is still a girl. Her name is Liu Lanhua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua’s father is a mat craftsman and has been weaving reed mats all her life. When you go out to weave, you also weave at home. People who need it come to buy it or exchange it with it. Liu Xijiang&#39;s career as a mat craftsman consists of two methods, half of which is home-based work, and the other half of which is a family workshop. When Liu Xijiang got old, he didn&#39;t go out anymore. He kept a reed garden on the mountain behind his house. It was five or six acres, and it was enough for people with a radius of dozens of miles. Craftsman Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life and has saved some money. He is considered a wealthy family in the surrounding area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, people were too poor to afford coffins. When most people died, they were rolled into the earth with a reed mat. Naturally, the reed mat was made by craftsman Liu Xi. The craftsman Liu Xishan weaved from east to west mountains, weaving from day to night. Half of the mats weaved were used to dry food and half were used to roll people. Later, people&#39;s lives became more relaxed, and some people began to use coffin boards. Of course, reed mats were not absent from the burial. Later, everyone switched to coffin boards, and there was no such thing as reed mats. There are stars and moon, and at this time, someone begins to paint the coffin to make the deceased sleep more peacefully and longer underground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Carpenter Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life, and saw countless people being swept away by what he weaved with his own hands, but from the bottom of his heart, he did not approve of the way of sweeping people to their graves. He felt that it was really a waste of human life. . Similarly, he also hated the way people later painted coffins with chemical paint bought from the street. Not only was it not antiseptic, but how could the smell make people feel peaceful? In short, people are too busy in this life and have never had a good night&#39;s sleep. When they leave and enter another world, they must sleep more peacefully and more solidly. Liu Xijiang&#39;s greatest ideal is to have a tung oil coffin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin helped him realize this ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the whole village, young and old, witnessed the great and spectacular process of tung oil changing from raw oil to mature oil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin built a waist-high earthen stove in the yard of Liu Xijiang’s house. He set up a large iron pot on the stove and burned it with oak firewood. The smooth and clean stones are put into the pot and stir-fried. After the stones are hot, raw tung oil is poured in. There must be some care about how much to pour. Master Lin just pours it without saying anything. Then the pot swelled, and as the temperature rose higher and higher, the water vapor in the tung oil gradually evaporated. There was a fragrance in the air, and the fragrance was overwhelming, covering the whole yard like a big blanket. But the fragrance was something that no one had ever smelled before. It was so strong and unrestrained that I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was good or bad. At this time, everyone saw oily flowers blooming from the tung oil in the pot. Master Lin quickly added a shovelful of powdery stuff. After a while, a layer of white foam appeared on the surface of the tung oil, and thick yellow smoke came out. Master Lin directed a young man to stir vigorously with a wooden stick, and the foam quickly combined with the tung oil. At this time, the color of the smoke changed from yellow to black, and the thick smoke rose straight into the sky and gradually dissipated. Master Lin used a wooden stick to pick out a strand of tung oil, dripped it on the stone, dipped his fingers in the tung oil and stretched it upwards, pulling out a long filament. Master Lin ordered people to quickly put out the fire under the pot and shouted: It&#39;s done! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people watching were curious, nervous, and confused, as if they were in a dream. I feel that Master Lin is really amazing. I just realized that tung oil can be boiled into something good. In the past, I always sold the tung oil raw, which is a pity. Several years later, when boiling tung oil was no longer a unique skill, everyone realized that the powdery things were soil powder and camphor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cypress coffin board, which has been brushed three times with mature tung oil from the outside to the inside, is like a multi-sided mirror, reflecting the strange and curious faces of a group of people, the sun in the sky and the wandering clouds. . To prove the efficacy of tung oil, Master Lin poured a bucket of water into the coffin. When he poured it in, the bucket was full, and when he scooped it out, the bucket was full, no more, no less. Liu Xijiang said that this stupid tung oil could protect one&#39;s body for a thousand years! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Master Lin and Liu Lanhua had a daughter named Lin Ping&#39;er. Liu Lanhua has a good figure and two nice buttocks, which are like a ball of cotton. She can be as plump as she wants. It doesn&#39;t matter how many children she has, but she doesn&#39;t dare to have children. The policy is tight and she can&#39;t afford the fine. The year Master Lin left, Lin Ping&#39;er was thirteen years old and still in junior high school. After all, Liu Lanhua and Master Lin have been husband and wife for fourteen years. Liu Lanhua was really reluctant to leave Master Lin. On the day of the burial, it was raining, and Liu Lanhua was soaked from head to toe. Some said it was rain, some said it was tears, but it was both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything counts. Master Lin has lived in Xiahe for fourteen years, and his career as a tung oil craftsman has lasted fourteen years. It is neither long nor short, but the tung oil he has used and the furniture he has painted, I don&#39;t know how to measure it clearly. The craftsmanship he passed down and the industry he promoted intentionally or unintentionally came to an abrupt end five years after he left. According to the new economic development requirements and the transformation of rural industries, the superiors required that tung trees be abandoned and pine trees be planted instead. An industry or an industry finally withered and died with the changes of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day a year, Master Lin sent Lin Pinger to school. The school was in the town. He picked her up on Saturday and sent her to school on Sunday. He rides a big car, with his schoolbag and dry food bag hanging on the front of the car, and his daughter on the back seat of the car. Three ridges below the car, Tongzi flowers are blooming, flowers on the road, flowers outside the road, the head is connected to the tail, the tail is connected to the head, people and cars are passing through the flowers, the sky is above the head, the fragrance of the flowers in the nostrils is really exciting So happy. Master Lin thought, this year will be a good harvest again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The car arrived at Erdaopan, where there was a spring with clear water gurgling sweetly and sweetly all year round. People, birds, and small animals come and go here to drink water and rest. Because the pool is at a low level, people need to kneel down and stretch their necks to drink the water. There is a legend that there is a fish spirit in the spring. It has been worshiped by people for a long time and has achieved enlightenment. Sometimes it comes out at night to clean the dirt in the pool, so that the spring will always be pure and pure, but no one has ever seen it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin was a little hungry. He divided a cake in half, half for himself and half for his daughter, and ate it with spring water. When he took the second bite, he felt that the cake was stuck in his throat, unable to go up or down. He picked up a handful of water and poured it down, but it didn&#39;t work. He knew what was going on. He remembered that his mother was in the same situation. She was stuck like this for several years and then left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coffin that Master Lin asked the craftsmen to build for him was a Paulownia wood coffin. The Paulownia wood is soft and does not rot, but the advantage is that it takes no effort to obtain. A row of big trees grows beside the yard. , using local materials. Liu Lanhua said, it&#39;s still early, let the tree grow for a few more years. Master Lin said, it’s getting late and you have to prepare morning and evening. Liu Lanhua said, prepare a bite for me too. Master Lin said, it&#39;s still early for you, let the tree grow for a few more years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The spectacular scene of Master Lin boiling tung oil for himself was exactly the same as the scene when he boiled tung oil for the first time in Liu Xijiang’s yard fourteen years ago. There were many onlookers and many who helped. Although this technology is no longer a secret at this time. When the firewood at the bottom of the pot was finally removed, Liu Lanhua was a little panicked and punched a hole in the bottom of the pot, and the boiled tung oil poured down. Although everyone tried hard to save it, only one third of the shiny good stuff was saved. , the missing part turned into a burst of fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin’s coffin board was halfway painted and he ran out of tung oil. He had to go to the street to buy a bucket of foreign paint to finish the other half. Master Lin sighed and said, this is fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years after Master Lin left, one day, Liu Lanhua received a letter with an unknown address and unknown sender. The recipient&#39;s name was Lin Yide. Liu Lanhua didn&#39;t recognize the middle character in the name, so she asked her daughter Lin Ping&#39;er. Lin Ping&#39;er was in high school at this time and there were no characters she didn&#39;t recognize. She said that character was pronounced &quot;yì&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua initially thought that the sender had written the address and name wrong, and wanted to return it. Her husband&#39;s name was Lin Jianye, and she had never heard of this strange name. The rural postman said that there was nothing wrong, the postal code was correct. Besides, who knew where to return it and to whom? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua opened the letter and read it. After finishing speaking, she realized that the sender had not sent the wrong address and recipient. After she finished reading the letter, she quietly wiped away tears, then threw the letter into the pot hole and burned it. The burned letter did not turn into ashes, but kept the shape of the paper. It floated out of the stove hole, flew out of the yard, and was in the air. Floating. Liu Lanhua said in her heart, just let it go. I have read it, and you have read it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ping&#39;er came out of the room with a piece of clothing and asked what it was written on. Liu Lanhua said that there was nothing written. Someone sent the letter to the wrong place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[东西方贵族是如何消亡的？从贵族到精英是身份政治的式微]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260200]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Lucy Challenger, a blogger who claims to be a &quot;British etiquette expert&quot;, posted a video on TikTok, Teach netizens how to eat rice with a knife and fork in formal occasions. She believes that in a Western environment, one should not eat rice with hands, spoons or chopsticks, but should push the rice to the top of the back of the fork with a table knife and then put it elegantly into the mouth, which can appear more educated and graceful. This &quot;aristocratic&quot; video triggered all kinds of ridicule and ridicule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese people also like to emphasize the concept of nobility, such as nobility in houses, cars, and clothing brands... Even a few days ago, I even saw the &quot;nobility&quot; in latex paint in building materials stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They say they are aristocrats, but in fact they are mostly consumption paranoia. The social group of aristocrats has died, or is close to death, in both Eastern and Western societies. It is also an interesting historical review journey to have a general understanding of the birth, development, decline, and demise of aristocrats in Eastern and Western societies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In ancient Eastern and Western societies, aristocrats were born almost at the same time in the early stages of civilization. The development can be roughly divided into three major historical stages: classical aristocracy, ancient aristocracy, and modern aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aristocracy began in the Western Zhou Dynasty and Spring and Autumn Period in the East, and emerged in the Republic of Ancient Rome in the West. Because they arose in the early days of agricultural society, the classical nobility in the East and West all originated from large landowners. In the Spring and Autumn Period in the East, princes were nobles, and the feudal system was an ancient system of large land ownership. Dining with bells and dishes, wine pools and meat forests are the lifestyles of nobles that distinguish them from common people. The titles of duke, marquis, uncle, son, and male divided the nobility hierarchy, including the &quot;scholar&quot; class attached to the nobility, and constituted the ruling order of ancient oriental agricultural society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, in ancient Greek society, which was slightly earlier than ancient Rome, the aristocracy was not very powerful. Due to the lack of large contiguous areas of land in the Balkans, ancient Greece developed an early democratic system that reflected the demands of the wealthy business class in the city-states for an equal distribution of power. Rome owned a large amount of land in its conquered areas, such as North Africa and Spain, so it produced a large number of landed aristocrats. They were a strong foundation supporting the Roman Empire and shared power in the Senate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of classicism, the aristocrats of the East and West not only monopolized a large amount of land and wealth, but also monopolized culture, knowledge, and art, producing and consuming amazing cultural and artistic achievements of that era: Ancient Greece and Roman sculpture and architectural art, as well as the elegance and praise in the Eastern &quot;Chu Ci&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 4th and 5th centuries AD were a watershed era in the changes of human civilization: the classical civilizations in the East and West (Eastern Han Dynasty and Western Rome) were defeated by the northern barbarians, and human civilization entered a period of darkness that lasted for hundreds of years. Era (or &quot;Middle Ages&quot;). The classical nobility died out in this era, and instead, the second round of &quot;ancient nobility&quot; (medieval nobility) emerged in both the East and the West. Moreover, in this era, both the East and the West produced military lord aristocrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, after the Germanic tribes conquered the Western Roman Empire, they divided territories and enfeoffed feudal lords, resulting in a large number of barbarian military nobles. These medieval nobles were rough, unpretentious, and simple... almost all of them They are illiterate. They only emphasize the spirit of martial arts. They compete with each other on whose arms are thicker, stronger, and have longer swords. If nothing happens, they compete on horseback. European military aristocrats regarded reading and writing as shameful and unmanly. The writing needs at the administrative level were almost entirely borne by priests and attendants. As a result, Christianity monopolized the ideology, culture and art of medieval Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East at the same time, the gentry (similar to aristocrats) in the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties were divided: the southern gentry, because of their &quot;dress and clothes&quot;, had higher cultural and artistic accomplishments, and were known as elegant and weak. The northern aristocracy has a considerable part of the Hu people&#39;s ancestry, and their cultural and artistic standards are low, but their military force value is high. This supported the &quot;Guanlong military aristocracy&quot; of the Sui and Tang dynasties. In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, the northern aristocratic army conquered the southern gentry, and China entered the second era of great unification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unification promoted economic and social development, and culture and art also flourished. Although the cultural level of the northern aristocrats was low, they were still improving. Their huge wealth was enough to support and consume great masters such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Wu Daozi, Yan Liben, and Li Guinian. The prosperity of the Tang Dynasty created the peak era of national culture and art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of culture and art seems to inevitably lead to weak, hedonistic, decadent and even decadent lifestyles, both in the East and the West. In the East, the &quot;Huang Chao Uprising&quot; at the end of the Tang Dynasty completely ended the aristocratic era in China. To put it simply, all the nobles were killed, and &quot;the bones of the public officials were trampled on in the streets.&quot; Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been no aristocrats in China. It has entered the era of common people and landlords. The emperor and his relatives are also representatives of the common people and landlords. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France is similar. From after the &quot;Hundred Years&#39; War&quot; to before the &quot;Great Revolution&quot;, the French aristocrats were prosperous, extravagant and luxurious. They lived a paradise-like life on earth for hundreds of years and created astonishing world-class culture and art. At the same time, it burned up the national wealth and led to the social and economic collapse of France. In the end, the entire modern French aristocratic group was almost ended on the guillotine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Germany and England are the Anglo-Saxon branches of the Germanic ethnic group, and their medieval martial ethics lasted relatively long. The tradition of military aristocracy of these two ethnic groups even lasted until the middle of the 20th century. Until the two world wars, machine guns, cannons, tanks, bombers... ended a large number of British and German military aristocrats on the battlefield, and the modern aristocracy in Europe finally declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Kingsman: The Secret Service&quot; vividly tells this historical process: As a large number of military nobles died on the battlefield, the vast aristocratic wealth became ownerless property, CEOs (not Boss) promoted the modern transformation of European society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, the rise of the elite class is no longer the aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobility is identity politics and hereditary. The elite emphasizes non-identity politics, ability first, self-strength, and survival of the fittest. According to our ancient saying, &quot;Excellence in learning leads to officialdom.&quot; However, it is not enough to study well. You must also be good at doing things, obey laws and regulations, and be socially responsible. The elites of modern society: Most of them come from the civilian class, such as Elon Musk. Before he became successful, he also paved the floor in his garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern elite politics does not monopolize power like aristocratic politics, but breaks class solidification and opens up channels for individual advancement and dimensionality reduction, which is of great significance for preventing social rigidity and corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Musk, the world’s richest man with hundreds of billions of dollars, has some unscrupulous sons. If we cannot effectively inherit, pioneer, and enterprising, we will fall back into mediocrity and will not be able to enjoy the hereditary privileges of the nobility. This is the modern elite system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that everyone can cheer up and make progress as much as possible, produce as many elites as possible to promote social progress, realize self-worth, and have fewer aristocratic dreams. That concept has been eliminated by history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南方周末6件作品获广东新闻奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260282]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 17:29:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 8, organized by the Guangdong Journalists Association, The selection results of the 2022 Guangdong News Award and the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>; Golden Bell Award sponsored by the Guangdong Press Society have been announced. 381 works won the 2022 Guangdong News Awards, including 49 first prizes, 122 second prizes, and 210 third prizes. 10 comrades won the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>;, and 1 comrade won the 15th Guangdong Province News Golden Bell Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Six works of Southern Weekend Newspaper won the Guangdong News Award.

&lt;p>;On October 30, 2023, the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; held its premiere in Beijing. The film is directed by Japanese director Yojiro Takita and stars Zhang Guoli and Han Geng. This is the first time that Yojiro Takita has directed a Chinese-language film, adapted from Xin You&#39;s novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;. In the story, the Liu family has been making ice crystal cakes for generations, and it was passed down to the eighth generation Liu Jiansan. His father Liu Tingshen was still unwilling to reveal the secret recipe, and the two gradually became estranged. It wasn&#39;t until his father passed away that the secret recipe and the secrets accompanying it finally surfaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was finalized as early as 2018. After several twists and turns, the finalized poster was finally released recently, and it was officially announced that it will be released nationwide on November 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first film by Yojiro Takita to encounter setbacks. The highlight of his career, &quot;The Embalmer,&quot; was released after a year&#39;s delay after filming was completed. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; is adapted from &quot;The Diary of a Coffin Bearer&quot; written by Shinmon Aoki. The author compiled his many years of experience into a book. In the world narrated by the coffin bearer, the deceased and the undertaker completed the passing of human life from generation to generation at a certain moment during the funeral ceremony. The movie starts from this and unfolds a sad and melancholy story around the protagonist who performs rituals for the deceased&#39;s body. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and swept the Japan Film Academy Awards - a total of 13 nominations and 8 wins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro recalled that the protagonist of the movie dealt with corpses every day, and the Japanese were not willing to accept it, let alone face death. The subject of the film thus became taboo. No company was willing to release it for fear of not selling well. In 2008, &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won awards at China&#39;s Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival and Canada&#39;s Montreal Film Festival. The news spread back to Japan, and the film was only released in theaters (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;September 13, 2008&lt;/span>;) became popular and topped the box office. During the Oscar awards season, although the box office had declined and dropped out of the rankings, it returned to the top of the box office once the news of the award was announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Takita Yojiro&#39;s most famous work was &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 2001, starring Nomura Mansai and Hideaki Ito; and &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 1986, starring Yuya Uchida, Yumi Aso, and Takeshi Kitano. No Funny Magazine. The former is adapted from the &quot;Onmyoji&quot; series of novels by Dream Pillow Tapir, which tells the story of Abe Seimei, an onmyoji with superb magic skills in Japan&#39;s Heian period, who used his wisdom to exorcise ghosts and gods and solve difficult problems. The latter vividly reproduced many real events that occurred in Japan in 1985, revealing the dark side of society and condemning the media for its failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the publication of the transformational work &quot;Don&#39;t Funny Magazine&quot;, Takita Yojiro was once known as a &quot;pink movie&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; refers to a large number of Famous for movies that feature nudity&lt;/span>;). On December 4, 1955, Yojiro Takita was born in Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. In 1973, after graduating from Takaoka Commercial High School, he went to Tokyo to pursue his dream. At the age of 20, he joined Lion Film Production Company as an assistant director. In 1981, he directed his debut film &quot;Crazy Female Teacher&quot;. In the next five years, he filmed 21 pink movies mainly in the &quot;Crazy Train&quot; series. Although this type of film uses female nudity and male-female sex as gimmicks, its themes are diverse, including serious dramas, light comedies, and even suspense dramas. The whimsy and fun of Takita&#39;s works earned him the nickname &quot;Pink Movie Genius&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At that time, the sun was setting in the Japanese film industry, and audiences rarely went to the movies. Some people watched pink movies, but the market demanded that filming be completed quickly at a very low cost. Many people wanted to make movies but had nowhere to go. Those who could go joined the ranks. There are too many people in the world who are determined to make movies, and I am one of them.&quot; Takita Yojiro recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he worked 15 hours a day and was bored with 35mm film all day long. When he was young, Takita Yojiro often went to the cinema with his family, and movies would be shown in the school gymnasium. He would often watch and think, &quot;Isn&#39;t this movie about me?&quot; But he didn&#39;t know what it would be like to actually make a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256532&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Embalmer&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Even such a person who is full of anxiety and uncertain future I am willing to invest alone in the world. I believe that only those who are exposed to this world and discover something about themselves after going through hardships can survive.&quot; Yojiro Takita said, &quot;There are no rules to follow in anything. At that time, living in this world , can’t see dreams, and feels that having dreams is a luxury. All he can do is work hard to complete the things in front of him.&quot; He remembered the words of a senior director he knew well - he hoped that he would be entangled in film and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Being surrounded by film, I deeply understand the meaning of film and movies. As well as editing, I understand the importance of frame by frame. In these senses, the era of pink movies is My origin. Although it was very painful at the time, there were many happy partners. We cried together, laughed together, and drank together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro once described his works as &quot;Kintaro candy&quot;. Kintaro candy is a candy that Japanese children use on the Seven-Five-Three Festival (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Similar to Children&#39;s Day, celebrating the growth of children aged 3, 5, and 7 years old&lt;/span>;) The edible candies come in a variety of patterns, and are &quot;long, sweet candies&quot; that need to be cut off bit by bit to eat. No matter where this candy is cut, the cross-section pattern is the same, only the outermost layer is different in color. He believes that although his works have various themes, when you really cut them apart, they are all the same movies. In his conversation with Takita Yojiro, the writer Zhian summarized this similar core as: about how ordinary people can prove themselves and realize their own value through an action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also during that conversation that Yojiro Takita looked back on his career and lamented that he had always carefully selected job offers and rejected many works. Now he is more concerned about &quot;Why are you looking for me? What is the reason for choosing me to be the director?&quot; If there are consistent answers to the two questions, he will happily accept it. The next piece &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot; is the result of this thinking. This is a Chinese movie, with all Chinese actors, and he wanted to do something fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As a director, I need to run around and be busy, but at the same time, I am also observing myself objectively. For example, sitting here for an interview, there is actually someone I am standing on high, looking down at. I am thinking about myself. In my head, on the one hand, there is this objective consciousness of always reflecting on myself, and on the other hand, I am rushing forward like a wild boar, running straight towards the goal.&quot; said Yojiro Takita. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for filming, his wife did not say to him, &quot;Come back after making a good movie.&quot; Instead, she told him: &quot;Don&#39;t get angry in front of everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Movie Good or bad, people don&#39;t care.&quot; Takita Yojiro said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2019, we had the opportunity to watch an early version of the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; and interviewed Yojiro Takita. In the interview, he talked about his motivation for making Chinese movies and his understanding of the film. Views on traditional disorder, the film’s response to changes in the times and people’s hearts, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256533&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Onmyoji&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is a dialogue with Yojiro Takita:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A story about reconciliation and rebirth&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Just listened to the staff After reading the novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;, you felt that the story was actually a bit Japanese. What parts of it touched you and made you decide to film it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The family structure of China and Japan is very similar. The father is the backbone of the entire family, so daily life, father-son relationship, Cultural inheritance will also have many similarities. The original setting is a story that happened in a small town in China. This story can be copied to the Japanese countryside. This made me feel very familiar, and it was one of the motivations for me to try to make this film. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal favorite is that the father has been keeping secrets and sticking to himself, and his intentions were only felt by his son after he passed away. This misunderstanding, sadness, and ultimate mutual recognition is what captures my heart the most. In other words, this is a story about reconciliation and rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Like the novel, you still use the son&#39;s perspective to construct the story Why did you choose this perspective on the relationship between father and son? And why make such a movie in modern times? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was still thinking about this issue until yesterday. In fact, as we grow older, people’s way of thinking will become more and more fixed. and limitations, the scope of action may become narrower and narrower. The world of young people is more interesting, they have many expectations for life, there are incompleteness and immaturity, and the collision of various elements will lead to the development of the story. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this also depends on the background of the times and career settings. Japan has many old shops that have been inherited from generation to generation, and there are also many stories about craftsmen. The world of traditional crafts is a world where seniors and juniors fight, because values ​​​​are different from the times, and it is inevitable for juniors to want to surpass their seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wonder if it is the same in China. Therefore, this story is set before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The economy is growing rapidly, people&#39;s economic activities are becoming more and more important to the world, and in order to successfully integrate into the modern world, the traditional world is gradually losing order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of these? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think this is not a good thing from the perspective of changes in values ​​and the changes that follow. Everything is digital now and you want fast results. People always think that when they do something, the result is there and they can get there quickly. But traditional craftsman-style things are just the opposite. Through accumulation, various techniques are passed on, and ways of thinking and feelings are refined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, this 6cm×6cm camera (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;points at the photojournalist’s medium format film camera&lt;/span >;), it has existed a long time ago, 40 years ago, it is very rare, and it is still in use. There must be something in it that you want to stick to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan held the Olympic Games in 1964, which was very similar to China. It developed rapidly after that. It’s just that the speed of development was “additive” at that time, but now it feels like “multiplicative”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You graduated from high school a few years after the Japan Olympics. There are reports that you were faced with two directions at that time, whether to find a job directly or continue studying. So did you feel confused in the accelerating social environment? What was your state at that time, and why did you go to Tokyo? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because I didn’t pass the college entrance examination, it doesn’t matter if I tell you. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;laugh&lt;/span>;) I was very confused, and for the first time I realized, what have I been doing for so many years? I&#39;m very lonely. Like Jian San (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Jian San, the male protagonist of &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;&lt;/span>;), I also grew up in a small place, so I just wanted to stop staying there and go to Tokyo.

It was only after I entered this industry that I found it interesting. Everyone has always believed that the world of entertainment and movies, including singing, is the domain of a few or special people. About half a year to a year later, I discovered that this was not the case. Whether it was lighting or photography, they were actually just people who were passionate about something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, can I also make this thing?

Many people enter the film industry with aspirations, but once they arrive on set, they feel a lot of physical and interpersonal fatigue. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film industry has been in recession for a long time, with little funding, low income, no future, and hard work.

After the bubble economy burst, many major events occurred in Japan, such as the Great Hanshin Earthquake. So, for a while, people who were very driven became insubstantial.

The fellow pointed forward with his hand. Yang Ping asked again: &quot;Are there any paintings on the walls in the temple?&quot; Yang Ping&#39;s Shanxi dialect is a bit different from that of his fellow villagers, but it does not hinder their communication. He had to travel to every corner of Shanxi. Without such a language advantage, Yang Ping really couldn&#39;t take pictures of the &quot;paintings&quot; in the temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people talk about Shanxi murals, they always think of the exquisite Song and Yuan murals such as Yanshan Temple and Yongle Palace. However, many people don’t know that Shanxi villages, hidden among the mountains and rivers, preserve a large number of village temple murals. Compared with the protection, research and admiration that the murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties enjoyed, the murals in the village temples seem a bit lonely. They are generally relics from the Qing Dynasty. &quot;These Qing Dynasty murals are not even &#39;village protection&#39;, not to mention &#39;national security&#39;,&quot; Yang Ping said. They quietly serve as the background for the village god statues and are also a touch of interest in the lives of the villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the mural on the east wall of a temple in Nancao Village, Shuocheng District, Shuozhou City, Shanxi Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping has been photographing Shanxi murals for more than ten years. Like many enthusiasts who started taking pictures of murals, Yang Ping also took pictures of Song and Yuan murals at the beginning. After taking more pictures, she found that there were more murals hidden in small temples in the mountains and deserts in Shanxi. &quot;Many people took photos of the &#39;Provincial Protection&#39; That&#39;s all, but I&#39;m different, I want to go to the village,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping was the editor-in-chief of a travel magazine in her early years. After the magazine ceased publication, she focused entirely on murals and painted sculptures in Shanxi. Over the years, she has photographed more than 400 murals in Shanxi, of which more than 300 were from the Ming and Qing dynasties. &quot;I know about another 20 to 30 murals that I haven&#39;t photographed yet.&quot; &quot;See You Under the Painted Walls of the High Hall—Exploring the Ancient Mural Paintings in Rural Villages of Shanxi, China&quot; is her new book published in 2023. It contains 21 exquisite village temple murals, mostly from the late Qing Dynasty, many of which she discovered for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you open this little book, you will be greeted by an artistic temperament that is completely different from the ancient and grandiose murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. The bright colors, the images of gods full of life, and the small and compact compositions, It all shows that this is an aesthetic taste that comes from the grassroots of the folk. Yang Ping wrote 21 short stories for these 21 murals. Most of them were about her chats with the villagers, family stories, and old rural news. They were written in a relaxed and interesting way. However, in the interview, Yang Ping talked more about the behind-the-scenes of the shooting. The joys and sorrows, as well as her worries about the rural murals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The culture left over from each era reflects that era. Rural murals are not just a presentation of art, but also contain a lot of historical information. The implication of this book is actually beyond the murals. &quot;Yang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Almost all the films brought back were scrapped”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping’s hometown is Jincheng, Shanxi, which is famous for its ancient buildings. In 2003, Yang Ping spent 360,000 yuan of his own money to start photographing ancient buildings in Jincheng. After taking many photos of buildings, she gradually became interested in the murals inside the buildings. Although she now runs to the village all day long and looks disgraced, she said that she actually loves dressing up. She used to work in fashion travel magazines and liked beautiful clothes. She first fell in love with murals because of their beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Yang Ping got an opportunity to photograph murals and painted sculptures across Shanxi. At that time, she only knew about the murals that were on the cultural relics list. As for how many murals there were in Shanxi, she didn&#39;t know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having no experience in photographing murals at the beginning, Yang Ping cast a wide net in Shanxi: there were eleven prefecture-level administrative districts in Shanxi, and each administrative district sent a photography team with at least three people in each team, led by a photographer. Led by a well-known photographer, plus a light and a driver, they plan to take carpet-like photos of murals and painted sculptures throughout Shanxi. It was a huge project, expensive, but the results were disappointing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Almost all the films I brought back were scrapped.&quot; Yang Ping recalled his &quot;recklessness&quot; at that time and smiled unconsciously. The photographers hired by Yang Ping back then were all &quot;big names&quot; in the industry. &quot;They have their own understanding of how to take good-looking photos. If you say it looks like this, they think that will look good. And many of them don&#39;t look good.&quot;就不拍。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是忠实地记录与“拍得好看”是两回事。要忠实地记录一铺壁画的全貌和其中的每个细节，每张照片的像素就要足够大，这就需要对一铺壁画进行分区拍摄。然而印制到书本上的壁画至少需要有一幅是完整的，这就又要保证每部分拍回来的照片都是可拼合的，也就意味着拍摄同一铺壁画的不同部分，其拍摄角度、像素、光线、曝光度，都要做到尽量一致。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;还有些三四米高的壁画，如果梯子不够高，摄影角度的变化就会造成画面的畸变，也是“合不了”。 “一看这个图片不行，回来培训，又去拍，还不行，就买很多书给大家看……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次不成功的地毯式拍摄让杨平赔了很多钱，十一支摄影队的仪器、差旅、人工，全打了水漂。到后来，她意识到，不是摄影队越多就效率越高，掌握拍摄的准则才是最关键的。她把摄影队缩小到了两支，其中一支就由她自己来拍。面对一铺壁画，要形成比较标准的拍摄流程：大小的梯子必须要有，对墙壁进行分区的红外线仪也要有，镜头是标准的蔡司50，还要有一个手持的小相机，“很多塑像离壁画很近，手要伸进去拍”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拍村里的壁画，除了这些一般的设备之外，铁锹和鸡毛掸子也是必备的，后者用来拂去壁画上的灰尘，前者则是修路的工具，“通往村里的是土路，用得上”。有一次到吕梁的一个村子，路况糟糕，摄影师用铁锹铲了一个多小时，才铲出一条“路”来。最后三百米，实在是没办法，只能大小器材都扛着走进村。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“三十年前题记还在”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;走进杨平的工作室，首先看见的就是一整排山西寺观壁画的图册。 《岩山寺》《开化寺》《公主寺》……这些在壁画史上赫赫有名的寺观，杨平都相应做了极为精细的图册。这些图册是她十几年来拍摄壁画的成果之一。在她之前，当然也有人拍过它们，也出过很多图册，但她想要做的是把每个细节都拍清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像这本《岩山寺》就拍了三年，2013、2014、2015年，陆陆续续拍，每次都要补拍，出版的时候发现某块不够清晰，就重新拍。”杨平说。岩山寺的金代壁画被誉为壁上的《清明上河图》，人物繁多，细节丰富，浓郁的生活气息就隐藏在画面细节之中。杨平的要求是画面上每个人物的身份、每个佛道故事的典故，乃至对首饰名物的辨认，不仅要有清晰的图像，还要附有学术文字的解释。所以她做的图册比前人要厚很多，八开本的一大本《岩山寺》厚达三百多页。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到2013年冬天，像岩山寺、开化寺这样的“国保”“省保”，差不多都被她拍完了，杨平开始系统地拍摄村庙里的壁画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一开始，对于村庙壁画，杨平只是路过的时候顺手拍，但拍得多了，她慢慢意识到，村里的明清壁画，比起宋元壁画，自有它的价值，完全值得再去搜罗一遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;山西古村落里，民间信仰的庙宇有着很多常见的神祇，关帝庙、娘娘庙（三霄娘娘）、龙王庙、马王庙、东岳庙，它们可能会单独出现，也可能会“组团”出现——即在一个庙中分布于不同的配殿里。龙王保佑风调雨顺、娘娘保佑生育平安、关帝则保佑教育子女忠孝节义。 “生娃、教育、农业，都是老百姓的真实需求。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;山西某村庙北壁龙王母右侧的女官、两位四值使者和风婆（从右至左）。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一次，一尊庙里的东岳神挡住了去路。那个庙的主殿两壁都是精美的彩塑，殿中央却立着一尊不知道年代的彩塑，藏身在一个小小的木阁里，据说是后世的村民们给加上去的。杨平要拍两旁的彩塑，镜头却总是被这尊东岳神彩塑给遮挡，摄影师们去拍了五次，拍回来总是不好看。无奈之下，第六次拍摄时她和村里人商量：“能不能先把这尊神请到殿外？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旧时，这尊东岳神每年都要抬出来游街，近些年，这个仪式已经渐渐消逝，但村里老人还是担心，像这样不合常规地抬出来，会造成不祥。 “他们担心会引起暴雨。”杨平说。几十年没动过的木胎泥塑，移动稍有不慎，表面很可能就会碎裂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好不容易说服了村民，具体要怎么搬，杨平自己心里也没有底。几个人正围着神像急得团团转的时候，村里的一位老人站了出来，只见他拿着一根粗麻绳，用一种从来没见过的打结方式，快速将神像捆得四平八稳，四个人一抬，上下不会倾斜，左右也不会侧翻。 “要是没有这位老人的帮忙，我们真拍不到这样好看的照片。”杨平指着图册上的这页彩塑说。拍完后，东岳神被重新安放了回去，当然，村里也没有下起暴雨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时间在流逝，壁画和彩塑也随着时间在改变。很多壁画和杨平最初看到它们的时候已经完全不一样了。 “我知道的一堂宋代壁画，三十年前题记还在，现在某些题记已经模糊了。”而一些无人关注的清代壁画，已经再也看不到了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》里提到的罗圈堡村是其中幸运的一个。当时，当地文物局听从了杨平的建议，把村庙修缮一新，壁画也重新做了拼合。 2021年杨平回访的时候，罗圈堡的壁画都还完好。但是像罗圈堡这样的例子实在太少了。作为文物大省，山西要用到钱的文物非常多，村庙里的壁画，似乎还排不上号。 “山西文物部门经常开玩笑说，让他们开两家银行，可能也不够。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;到底要不要将村庙壁画出版，公之于众，杨平曾经犹豫过很久。 2016年，他们在太原附近的一个村子拍摄，摄影师被当地村民给撵走了。杨平非常理解老百姓的“警惕”：“文物贩子实在是太多了。”村庙里的壁画，一般连文保点都不是，官方的保护体系鞭长莫及，它们虽躲在深山，却躲不过文物贩子的“勤奋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某种意义上来说，杨平就是在和文物贩子赛跑，“你完全想象不到他们有多&#39;勤奋&#39;，十年前我去的山沟里，文物贩子都走过。”杨平的朋友圈本来是完全开放的，自己看到了什么、拍到了什么，都会发在朋友圈，但不会发具体地址。有一次，一位朋友从外省追了过来，和她打听，“杨老师，你朋友圈里的东西，能不能给我一个地址？”杨平随即警惕了起来，对那位朋友说：“我手里的东西，你一个石头也不能拿走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是在这本《高堂粉墙烛下见》里，很多村庙却写了详细的地址。杨平说，这也是她思考了很久之后的无奈之举。一方面，把它们隐藏得再好，可能也逃不过文物贩子的搜索，而且就算文物贩子没有找到，书中多数村庙都已经半坍塌了，这样隐藏下去，等待它们的命运也是逐渐湮灭。 “不如公开它们的状况，引起全社会的重视，唤起村民的保护意识。”杨平明确知道一个英国的银行家家里，收藏有一铺清代的壁画，“我们的研究者目前也大多关心更高古的宋元壁画，清代壁画无人关心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋晓丽是杨平这本书的读者，2023年9月，她沿着书中的路线，走访了书中的几个村庄。她发现，很多村民的保护意识，确实比杨平拍摄时提高了不少。比如在瓦窑头村的龙王庙，“村民们有了保护意识，他们用厚厚的塑料布遮挡着壁画，我们拍摄完毕后又原样子给挡上，这是令人欣慰的发现。”宋晓丽告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，也有不幸的例子。书中提到的北曹村壁画，有非常生动的“龙王行雨图”。 “北曹村的龙王庙修缮一新，庙前立了文保碑，但是龙王殿里东西壁的龙王行雨图丢失了，文保部门将两幅喷绘的展示图分别悬挂于东西两壁。”宋晓丽说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》卖得很好，有一点出乎杨平的意料。相对于她的整个出版计划来说，这本小书只展现了她工作的小小侧面。 “你做了这么多事情，没有人知道你在干什么，它老不冒火花，不冒泡。突然在这本书上红了。”书里的彩图，对于那些已经湮灭的壁画来说，是珍贵的记录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨平最花心力的一套大书，是即将出版的《山西寺观艺术全集》，“全集”包括《山西寺观彩塑全集》（十卷）和《山西寺观壁画全集》（二十卷），共三十卷。她多年来拍摄的所有彩塑和壁画，都会收录进去，这是真正第一种尽可能完整地收录山西壁画彩塑艺术的出版物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《全集》的受众是专业的研究者，《高堂粉墙烛下见》的受众则是普通读者，杨平希望这本小书可以成为一个支点，撬动一点公众的认知。 “其实我有一个发心，文化不仅要吸引文化人，还要吸引更多的普通人，文化应该要滋养人的。我们现在的文化只滋养了一小批人，这是不够的。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;
