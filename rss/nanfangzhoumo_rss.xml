The mission of the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regulatory agencies have always regarded protecting the security of personal financial information as an important regulatory task. From September 15 to October 15, 2023, the State Administration of Financial Supervision, the People&#39;s Bank of China and other relevant ministries and commissions are jointly carrying out the &quot;Financial Consumer Rights Protection Education and Publicity Month&quot; activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2021, the People&#39;s Bank of China has issued the &quot;Financial Data Security &amp;nbsp;Data Life Cycle Security Specifications&quot; (JR/T 0223-2021). This &quot;Specification&quot; combines the characteristics of financial data to sort out the security principles, protection requirements, organizational guarantee requirements and information system operation and maintenance guarantee requirements of financial data life cycle, and establish financial data covering the entire cycle of data collection, transmission, storage, use, deletion and destruction. Security management framework. Among them, the protection of personal financial information has become an important part of the security management of financial data life cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, the data security of financial institutions is like an indestructible golden shield, and the strength of the golden shield reflects the strength of financial institutions in protecting data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to objectively evaluate the data security level of various financial institutions, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center set up eight secondary indicators from four dimensions, and assigned different weights to the sub-items according to the importance of each indicator. . Under this indicator system, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center selected the &quot;Data Security List&quot; based on the information related to eight secondary indicators disclosed in the 2022 annual reports, 2022 ESG reports or social responsibility reports of 26 financial institutions. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given that the data security standards of various financial institutions are quite strict and no serious incidents have occurred, this list only reflects the strategic attention and execution capabilities of financial institutions to data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Four dimensions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Eight sub-indicators&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Data Security Ranking&quot; evaluation The indicator system is divided into four dimensions: organizational construction, institutional processes, technical tools and effectiveness. At the same time, we subdivided the above four dimensions into eight secondary indicators. The following is a detailed description of the relevant indicator system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/jKH2o2u2BWOHs3WZgtu2brTExaaYzLlkJcXIONcM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251050&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Organizational Building&lt;/strong>;Yes Refers to the organizational structure of financial institutions in terms of data security. The evaluation team of Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center considers the number of relevant responsible departments disclosed by financial institutions. This indicator reflects the importance financial institutions attach to data security and information protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;System process&lt;/strong>; refers to the degree of standardization of the process of building a data security system by financial institutions. This indicator is mainly comprehensively considered through two secondary indicators: the number of its own relevant systems and the number of supplier management-related normative documents. The degree of standardization of the process is an important indicator to consider whether the construction of the data security system of a financial institution is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Supplier management&lt;/strong>; refers to the process by which financial institutions conduct effective risk identification and assessment of external partners (IT service providers, cloud service platforms, etc.). Vendors have access to sensitive data from financial institutions. Security vulnerabilities and irregularities in vendor behavior can result in information or data security incidents for financial institutions. Therefore, financial institutions conduct rating reviews of suppliers every year. However, most financial institutions currently only focus on the performance of suppliers in terms of environmental protection and social responsibility. In order to strengthen the importance that financial institutions attach to the management of suppliers&#39; data security, the evaluation team of the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has disclosed the performance of financial institutions. The number of documents on the supplier management system is also taken into consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Technical tools&lt;/strong>; are the core part of the network security system. This first-level indicator directly reflects the financial institution&#39;s ability to protect data and privacy and the effectiveness and reliability of data security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this first-level indicator, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center evaluation team set three secondary indicators: the number of relevant patents, the number of relevant systems, and the number of certification systems. Among them, the number of relevant patents refers to the number of patents containing words such as data security, information security, vulnerability and attack in the patent summaries applied for by the financial institution under evaluation that year. The number of relevant systems is based on the number of platforms and systems mentioned in the annual report of the financial institution under evaluation. The number of certification systems comes from the number of certifications published in the annual reports of the financial institutions under evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, during the evaluation process, researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center found that some banks did not disclose the secondary indicator data for this evaluation. Therefore, in order to reduce information asymmetry, financial institutions that do not publish a certain indicator will have the lowest score for that indicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Effectiveness&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Indicator&lt;/strong>; is the only qualitative indicator in this list, consisting of the number of security incidents (minus points) and awards (plus points). Among them, the award indicators are assigned different levels of points according to the level and number of awards. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Overall ranking&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;ICBC&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;tops the list&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt; strong>;The number of Ping An’s patents is second only to ICBC&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/1Q2N7rJ470IscYbRe50roxJWnSj6t4V2zkk1E7n4.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1214&quot; height=&quot;2132&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/1Q2N7rJ470IscYbRe50roxJWnSj6t4V2zkk1E7n4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 251053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of financial institutions shows that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ranks first, followed by Bank of China, China Life and Agricultural Bank of China in the second tier. Among joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank and China Everbright Bank performed well. Among them, China Everbright Bank was better in terms of relevant systems and the number of certifications obtained, while Industrial Bank received the award for disclosing detailed data security and privacy protection work in its annual report. More points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of patents, state-owned banks are stronger, and the number of patents of state-owned banks is generally higher than that of joint-stock banks and insurance companies. However, it is worth noting that the number of related patents of Ping An of China, 119, is only lower than that of ICBC, 259. Looking only at this secondary indicator, Ping An ranks second in the entire list. This is because Ping An has both banking and insurance businesses. Compared with financial institutions in a single industry, Ping An&#39;s data is more diverse and complex, and its requirements for ensuring data security are also higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive quantitative indicators, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China rank among the top three state-owned banks, with total quantitative indicator scores all exceeding 400 points. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranks last with a quantitative indicator score of 196 points, and is the only institution on this list with a total quantitative indicator score of less than 200 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of comprehensive qualitative indicators, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Life Insurance and Bank of Communications ranked among the top three, with scores greater than 150 points. Among them, ICBC ranks first, mainly because the awards it has received are all national-level and it has been selected as a pilot demonstration unit in multiple fields of data security. China Life and Bank of Communications follow closely behind with multiple awards at different levels in terms of qualitative indicators. In addition, Pacific Insurance, China Merchants Bank, PICC and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank did not disclose awards in their 2022 annual reports, resulting in scores of 0 for their qualitative indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the different nature of banking and insurance businesses, the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center evaluation team split the overall list into two sub-lists: the data security list of banking financial institutions and the data security list of insurance financial institutions. The list is designed to more objectively present the data security competitiveness of financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Bank list: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;While the pursuit is underway&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;there are leaders in each echelon&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/gUNn9FWoESsYi8bMLgbU2GEpU9xiJJEfU6gkbE38.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The data security list of banking financial institutions shows that, Among the six major state-owned banks, the three major state-owned banks, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, rank in the top three. Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank ranked seventh and eighth. The above five state-owned banks are all ranked in the top ten. The Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last with a score of 125.65 points, a gap of 223.93 points from the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Postal Savings Bank’s poor performance in data security may be related to its low level of digital construction. In the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks, AIA ranks last among insurance companies&quot;>;Digital Finance List: ICBC ranks first among banks First, AIA ranked last among insurance companies, Postal Savings Bank of China ranked last among the six major state-owned banks with a score of 431.62. Therefore, the Postal Savings Bank still needs to work hard on digital financial construction and data security system construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the joint-stock banks, Industrial Bank, Ping An Bank and China Everbright Bank surpassed the two major state-owned banks, Bank of Communications and China Construction Bank, with 238.36 points, 237.24 points and 233.94 points respectively, relying on their advantages in technical tool indicators to rank among Top six. However, the performance of China Guangfa Bank, Hua Xia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in terms of data security is not as good as that of some city commercial banks. These three banks are all ranked after the tenth, and are interspersed among the rankings of city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;City commercial banks are subject to factors such as geography, business volume and scale, and their overall scores are lower than those of state-owned banks and joint-stock banks. But there are also some who perform better. Taking Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Beijing as examples, these two city commercial banks surpassed China Guangfa Bank and Hua Xia Bank, two joint-stock banks, with 185.48 and 172.67 points respectively. From the perspective of qualitative indicators, the results of these two city commercial banks are relatively outstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Insurance ranking: China Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;award&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;won&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong >;&lt;strong>;Ping An patents dominate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;968&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/6E0HX8QJdDA3nDV7hrRH1nhVTesqboNb52zTv5Vt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251051&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; Looking at the data security rankings of financial institutions in the insurance industry, China Life and Ping An of China rank first and second due to their advantages in the number of awards and patents respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the insurance industry, China Life has built the industry&#39;s first safe, green and elastic hybrid cloud. This distributed hybrid cloud won the special prize of the second &quot;Financial Innovation Achievement Award&quot; of the Capital Financial Innovation Incentive Project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of the number of data security-related patents, except for Ping An of China, which received 119 patents due to its business nature of both banking and insurance, the number of data security-related patents disclosed by other insurance institutions did not exceed 5 indivual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunshine Insurance ranks low in various index scores in terms of data security, resulting in a total score at the bottom. It is also the only financial institution with a score below 150 in the data security list of financial institutions in the insurance industry. Similar to the Postal Savings Bank, Sunshine Insurance ranked first in the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256025&quot; title=&quot;Digital Financial List: ICBC ranked first among banks, AIA ranked last among insurance companies&quot;>; Digital finance list: ICBC ranks first among banks, and AIA ranks last among insurance companies. It ranks second from last in the digital finance list of insurance financial institutions. Regardless of digital finance or data security, there is still a certain distance between Sunshine Insurance and other financial institutions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the score is related to the small amount of data disclosed by Sunshine Insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the digital finance and data security construction of lower-ranked banking financial institutions and insurance financial institutions are not perfect enough. Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believe that these companies urgently need to improve their strategic considerations for digital transformation and pay attention to building and improving data security systems while improving the level of digital finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also called on financial institutions to disclose relevant data and information as much as possible to make it more transparent to enhance customer trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Assistant researcher Zou Huan, Liang Chenghao and Yang Chaoqun also contributed)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[ATACMS对乌克兰意味着什么？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256761]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/n5CMyGKnUQVVAef0mY1dPG61CXHPI9TyzeJvUxcd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/n5CMyGKnUQVVAef0mY1dPG61CXHPI9T yzeJvUxcd. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250520&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) data picture&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, a U.S. official told the media that the Biden administration is considering supplying long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to Ukraine. Another official also confirmed to the media that the supply of this missile is &quot;on the table&quot; and may be included in the upcoming security assistance plan. However, the official also said that no decision has been made yet and that it may take several months for Ukraine to receive the missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Ukrainian President Zelensky publicly declared: &quot;Ukraine needs long-range missiles to deprive the occupiers of the opportunity to use missiles to destroy Ukrainian cities far away from the front line.&quot; The Ukrainian military will ATACMS missiles are regarded as the top priority weapons and equipment to be obtained, even higher than F-16 fighter jets. Before launching a counteroffensive in July 2023, Zelensky even stated: &quot;Without long-range weapons, it will not only be difficult to perform offensive missions, but also difficult to conduct defense.&quot; In short, after tireless pressure, Ukraine seems to be about to get the weapons they want. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what is so powerful about this missile that Ukraine is so obsessed with? Why does Ukraine think this is the key to its victory? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ATACMS is a tactical ballistic missile manufactured by Lockheed Martin of the United States. It is also the only ballistic missile currently equipped by the U.S. Army. The development of this missile began in 1980 and is used to attack important targets such as logistics and reserve positions behind enemy lines. The ATACMS missile is equipped with a solid propellant engine, has a range of up to 300 kilometers, and a terminal speed of up to three times the speed of sound. It can be launched from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS, both of which are already equipped. Ukrainian army and performed well in actual combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the Ukrainians, the great role of ATACMS is to extend the range of the Seamass rocket launcher that had previously shined in the battle, and its power has also increased. This missile can carry a penetrating high-explosive warhead weighing more than 230 kilograms and is used to destroy strong fortresses with a circumferential error of only 9 meters. This heavy-duty high-explosive warhead is not only extremely lethal to Russian fortresses, but it can also be equipped with a submunition warhead to destroy targets such as airport radar stations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the key issue is that the range of this missile is far enough. If ATACMS is obtained, the Ukrainian army can directly strike Russian military targets in the Crimea area from the current front, and even directly attack them. Crimean Bridge, and Russia’s air defense system was not sure of intercepting it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ukrainian army has previously obtained long-range precision-guided weapons such as Storm Shadow with a range of nearly 300 kilometers. Although the effect is good in actual combat, it has not been used many times. The main reasons are the following three problems: First of all, Britain and France, the donor countries for missiles such as Storm Shadow, do not have much equipment themselves, so the quantity they can provide to Ukraine is also quite limited; secondly, such missiles can currently only be mounted on modified Su-24 fighter-bombers. However, Ukraine&#39;s air force has suffered heavy losses after more than a year of fighting. The number it can dispatch is limited, and it also needs to be careful about interception by Russian fighter planes. Therefore, it can only hide dozens of kilometers behind its own front lines, which also reduces the range of missiles. shortening; another technical problem is that air-launched missiles often have higher requirements for reconnaissance of the target area. For example, the missile needs to inject a three-dimensional image of the target building so that it can hit a more precise vulnerable location, which is also more effective for pre-attack reconnaissance. High requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, ATACMS can avoid the above problems. First of all, the US military has equipped more than 2,000 of this missile, and other allies also have more than 1,000 in stock. The United States is planning to phase out this missile and switch to a missile with a longer range. Once the United States relents on its long-range replacement model, the amount of supply to Ukraine will be considerable, which will also help the United States update its army&#39;s long-range missile weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Ukraine already has dozens of Haimas and M270 systems that can launch ATACMS in service, and land-based launch platforms are easier to conceal and can fire closer to the battle line. As long as the number of missiles is in place, the frequency of attacks will increase. can be greatly improved. In addition, the reconnaissance business before the launch of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles will also become relatively simple. You only need to know the geographical coordinates of the target to launch it. If this missile is deployed in large numbers, it will be difficult for the Russian navy and air force to gain a foothold in the Crimean Peninsula, because these high-value targets will be attacked with high frequency and difficult to defend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the United States provides ATACMS, it will have a chain effect. Ukraine has repeatedly requested Germany to provide Taurus air-launched cruise missiles with a range of nearly 500 kilometers. This missile has a range of more than 500 kilometers and is more powerful than Storm Shadow. for safety. Another advantage of the Taurus is that it uses a two-stage tandem warhead, which can penetrate the outer wall of the fortification and explode inside, with an intelligent killing effect. Germany had been quite hesitant to provide this weapon because it was unwilling to bear all the pressure from Russia. If the United States is willing to provide ATACMS missiles, Germany should also release Taurus, which will undoubtedly increase Ukraine&#39;s long-range attack capabilities. It can be seen that the changes brought about by ATACMS may be far more than its own fatal lethality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩子余华英一审被判死刑，曾拐卖儿童11名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256906]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 11:03:18&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 18, the Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court publicly sentenced the defendant Yu Huaying to one count of child abduction and trafficking. case.

Leaving the breasts exposed. After September 1st, the woman involved continued to post multiple videos describing her injuries and treatment, which aroused widespread concern among netizens. On September 6th, she also accused the police in a video of unfair enforcement of the law and rudely &quot;called her crazy&quot;. Ferments quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as all parties expressed their opinions, the jigsaw puzzle of the truth of the incident was slowly being completed: it was obviously the woman involved who &quot;bited&quot; and caused minor injuries to the other person, but she used the attitude of the evildoer to complain first to mobilize public opinion She went on the offensive, accusing the other party of bullying and beating her; the woman involved not only refused to mediate, but even fabricated the fact that the police &quot;forced her to accept mediation&quot;, spread rumors that the police enforced the law unfairly, and attempted to use public opinion pressure to force all parties to make concessions. During this period, certain media outlets also added fuel to the flames and acted as advocates for the woman involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police records show that the neighbor couple lives on the 9th floor, and the woman in question lives on the 14th floor. At about 18:00 on August 26, a neighbor couple took the elevator home from the first floor. When the elevator reached the first floor, the woman in question entered the elevator holding an adult Samoyed dog. The neighbor&#39;s wife asked the woman to pull the dog away out of fear, and the two got into an argument. After the couple got out of the elevator on the 9th floor, the woman chased them out of the elevator, and the couple got into a fight in the corridor. The neighbor&#39;s wife called the police twice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police also told the media that the neighbor’s wife had scratches on her limbs and waist, and a small amount of hair was torn off; the husband had bite marks and bruises on the back of his left hand and left forearm, and scratches on his right arm; the woman involved There were pinch marks on his neck, scratches on his face, and a small amount of hair torn out. The case was classified as a fight that night, and the police conducted mediation on the spot. The woman involved had accepted the mediation, but two days later she released a video stating that she did not recognize the mediation results. The public security agency immediately opened the case for investigation in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the police said was, &quot;If you keep acting like this (in Zigong dialect, it means stubborn, extreme, and accepting death), we will not mediate.&quot; They did not say the harsh words &quot;if you do not mediate, you will be detained.&quot; ; Judging from the video in the elevator, the two parties only communicated verbally in the elevator and had no physical contact. It was not until the couple arrived at their own floor and left the elevator that the woman in question chased them out of the elevator, and a physical conflict broke out between the two parties. As a result, the woman involved is not even suspected of &quot;defensive provocation&quot; or active provocation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The testimonies of both parties showed that the husband did not take action, but was bitten by the woman involved, and the injuries were assessed as minor injuries; both the wife and the woman involved were also injured, but the woman involved refused to have their injuries assessed. , and hit the neighbor&#39;s wife with his mobile phone at the mediation scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The neighbor’s wife also said in an interview that because she was afraid of dogs, and she had just given birth to a child, she was worried that the hair would stick to her hair and cause adverse reactions in the child, so she asked the other party to keep the dog away. A quarrel ensued, leading to a fight in the corridor outside the elevator. On September 10, the Zigong High-tech Zone Police responded that from the afternoon to the evening of the 9th, the police had once again conducted a comprehensive inquiry and investigation on all parties involved, and would handle the case in accordance with the law after the inquiry and investigation are completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the evolution of this case, the woman involved can be called a &quot;spin doctor&quot;. Her series of manipulation techniques amplified public opinion and turned an originally simple interpersonal dispute into a scandal. It became a widely publicized public event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question keenly selected several &quot;traffic codes&quot;: she complained about the police leading to the public opinion impression of &quot;police and mud&quot;; she cried about &quot;being refused to bring a dog into the elevator&quot;, hyped up and called &quot;dog lovers&quot; &quot;Support; in the end, she also created her own image as a &quot;vulnerable group&quot;. It seems that a woman with her cute Samoyed dog was bullied by the other party&#39;s overwhelming numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sequence of events is clear enough. The woman in question bit the neighbor&#39;s husband to a minor injury and at the same time fought with the neighbor&#39;s wife, which is in line with the first situation mediated by the Public Security Bureau, that is, a &quot;dispute between relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the wounds and scars on the hand of the neighbor’s husband met the standard of “minor injury”. Minor injuries refer to minor damage or temporary dysfunction caused by local tissue and organ structures of the human body. This injury standard does not seem serious, but it still requires corresponding legal consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 43 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that anyone who beats others or intentionally injures others shall be detained for not less than 5 days but not more than 10 days, and shall be fined not less than 200 yuan but not more than 500 yuan. ; If the circumstances are relatively minor, he shall be detained for not more than 5 days or fined not more than 500 yuan. Article 17 of the &quot;Interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Personal Injury Compensation Cases&quot; also stipulates that the personal injury suffered by the victim and the resulting expenses include medical expenses, lost work expenses, nursing expenses, transportation expenses, accommodation expenses, and hospital meals. The person obligated to compensate shall compensate for economic losses such as subsidies and necessary nutrition fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the woman involved is unwilling to accept mediation, she needs to bear administrative liability and civil liability for &quot;minor injuries&quot;. Although the neighbor&#39;s wife was also responsible for the assault, the woman involved refused to have her injuries examined. Secondly, even if the neighbor&#39;s wife was administratively detained for this, her status as a nursing mother would exempt her from punishment. Therefore, the police&#39;s mediation suggestion was actually a more beneficial result for the woman involved. However, she refused to do so and even tried to devour the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, faced with the legitimate fear of a nursing mother, the woman involved, as a dog owner, should be kind to the dog owner, soothe the other person&#39;s emotions, and respect other people&#39;s living space. However, she did the opposite. , and trying to manipulate public opinion is indeed regrettable. Not only that, the woman involved refused to have her injuries assessed or to mediate, which actually pushed herself into an unfavorable litigation situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ironically, although there were pets in this case, a &quot;human biting&quot; situation eventually occurred. The woman in question bit her neighbor&#39;s husband and showed indifference to the rights of nursing mothers. In addition to administrative and civil responsibilities, the woman involved is also suspected of defamation and even rumors and frame-up. This is an illegal and criminal act that the public security organs should continue to seriously investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“普洱景迈山古茶林文化景观”，申遗成功]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256894]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;17th&lt;/p>;

I was walking on the streets of Hefei when I suddenly heard a loud noise behind me. When I looked back, I was shocked out of my mind. A piece of concrete and ceramic tile mixture the size of a washbasin fell from a building more than ten stories high and hit me about two meters behind me. The debris from the impact splashed on my pants. I was so frightened that I turned pale. I really felt that life was so fragile and that I was so close to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later I talked about this distress in my circle of friends and social media, and I was thankful for my good luck. Unexpectedly, netizens have talked about nearly ten people who have encountered similar situations! It turns out that falling objects from heights are not an occasional phenomenon, but a frequent social problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following months, four more incidents of falling objects from high altitudes occurred in my circle of relatives and friends. Two of them happened in the community where my sister lives (which was delivered in 2007): both times, weathered and peeling pieces fell from the top of the building. Once, the mortar hit the seat of the electric motorcycle, but no serious damage was caused; the other time was more serious. It was serious, the roof of the car was damaged, and the property management paid 3,000 yuan in compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Supreme Court&#39;s 2020 &quot;Trends and Characteristics of Cases of Falling Objects Injuring People from Height&quot; report shows that civil cases of falling objects from heights are increasing year by year, and nearly 30% cause casualties. Xu Jianfeng, director of the Supreme People&#39;s Court Information Center, said: 18.16% of cases involved fatalities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professional legal practitioners introduced more detailed and specific technical details of cases of falling objects from high altitude:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of the earth’s gravity, high-altitude objects have huge potential energy and fall close to the ground. At this time, it is converted into kinetic energy. At this time, the speed is fast and the momentum is large. When hitting the human body, the human body will receive a large impulse and force. A 30-gram egg dropped from the 4th floor can break a person&#39;s head; if dropped from the 18th floor, it can break a person&#39;s skull. Even lighter cigarette butts, fruit cores, cans... falling from high altitudes are likely to cause casualties once they hit the human body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 60% of criminal cases caused by falling objects occur in residential areas. They are closely related to the people, are related to personal safety and social stability, and cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Qingdun Data&quot;: From 2014 to 2020, more than 1,450 high-altitude parabolic cases were concluded by courts across the country, showing an overall rapid growth trend. Among them, in 2020 alone, 451 cases were concluded. These are only the cases concluded by the courts. Many of the cases are minor and the cases where the parties have gone through mediation or reconciliation are not included in the calculation. According to incomplete statistics, there are actually more than 1,000 cases of high-altitude parabolic objects occurring in my country per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are four main reasons for high-altitude throwing cases: those who throw objects for convenience and casually account for the most, accounting for 55.1%; crimes of passion caused by quarrels and disputes account for 29.7%; malicious venting accounts for 13.2%; Laziness accounts for 2% of the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above four types are classified as criminal cases of man-made thrown objects. In addition, falling objects from heights are also caused by the aging of buildings: the cement and ceramic tiles on the exterior walls of buildings have been damaged by wind, sun, and damage for many years. Rain... peel off and fall off after weathering. For example, the author was in danger and the vehicle in my sister&#39;s neighborhood was damaged by falling objects, which were all caused by the aging of the building exterior walls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Friends in the construction industry said that most of my country&#39;s high-rise buildings were built rapidly during the &quot;explosive development of real estate&quot; in the past 25 years or so, and it took a quarter of a century to go through four centuries of Western development. The development history of architecture. Many buildings are built quickly and in a hurry to meet the schedule. Of course, the quality of slow work and meticulous work cannot be achieved, and there are many potential hidden dangers. After more than 20 years of exposure to wind, sun, and rain, many buildings lacked maintenance, and problems gradually began to appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Communicate with friends in the construction and property fields and learn about some ways to reduce the risk of falling objects caused by aging buildings. For example: not only should problems such as illegal construction and illegal renovation be dealt with, but also structures such as &quot;parapets&quot; on the top of old high-rise buildings should be demolished; exterior wall tiles can also be transformed into exterior wall paint, so that even if there are paint chips and wall dust falling off , it is not as lethal as the concrete and ceramic tile mixture falling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, in traditional markets in southern cities such as Guangzhou, there were long corridors extending above the storefronts along the street and connecting them to one another. In the past, it was mainly used to shade the sun and rain, and to facilitate attracting customers and doing business. However, this kind of building structure has inadvertently become a buffer for falling objects from high altitude, reducing the casualty rate in accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of falling objects from heights deserves attention and cannot be solved solely by legislation, judiciary, publicity and education. If you wait until after a casualty accident occurs before trying and making compensation, this kind of hindsight will not only fail to solve the problem, but will actually increase social instability. It’s the old saying: As long as your thinking doesn’t slip, there are always more solutions than difficulties. Combined with the current reconstruction of old cities, there are always ways to deal with the problem of falling objects from heights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[新研究发现熬夜比早起更易导致糖尿病]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256896]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 23:00:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Those who consider themselves &quot;night owls&quot; may need to pay attention.

Glaucoma caused blindness in his right eye. Not only was he unable to draw, but he also had great difficulties in socializing, so he faded out of social activities.

At the age of 19, when he first tried his hand at crying with a comic pen, Ding Wei had not received professional training, but he was able to outline precise images with smooth simple pens. For example, in the comic &quot;Members of the Autonomous Bureau&#39;s Moneyism&quot;, Ding used an exaggerated technique to draw a giant magnifying glass filled with coins in front of a member&#39;s belly, using the &quot;clear vision of an The hypocritical appearance of devoting oneself to local autonomy only to seek power and personal gain satirizes &quot;the election of autonomous bureau members inside and outside the city is full of strange phenomena.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Ju has been fond of painting here and there since he was a child, and his neighbors praise him as a &quot;child prodigy&quot; who can &quot;paint gods like gods and ghosts like ghosts.&quot; His father died young, and as the eldest son, Ding Wei shouldered the heavy responsibility of supporting the family. When he was 13 years old, he left Fengjing Town and went to Shanghai alone to join his relatives. When he entered the old Beimen Changtai Pawn Shop as an apprentice, he still fell in love with art. Not long after he submitted and published cartoons for &quot;Picture Daily&quot;, Ding Ju entered the Chinese and Western painting correspondence school founded by Zhou Xiang (1871-1933).

Although it only published one issue, it was one of the earliest comic publications in China. In August of this year, the supplement &quot;Free Talk&quot; of &quot;Shenbao&quot; was launched. According to Ding Ju&#39;s recollection: &quot;My debut illustration was &quot;Free Talk&quot; which was first published in Shenbao when it was edited by Mr. Wang Dugen. At that time, there were not many cartoonists, only deceased friends. Brother Shen Bochen can be called the authority.&quot; He has written many articles in memory of his friend Shen Bochen, &quot;I admit that he is an unprecedented success in our country through his caricatures, and he is the only one I have ever admired throughout my life. Not only he The thought has profound connotations, and the harmonious beauty of the structure and lines makes people intoxicated and admired.&quot; What impressed Ding Wei the most was an illustration of Shen Bochen&#39;s &quot;involving a huge disaster&quot;, &quot;The picture is of a house where pigs are being slaughtered, A German drove a group of pigs into this pig-slaughtering house. The pigs were part of the Allied Powers. Therefore, they greatly aroused the anger of the British and Americans... It was intolerable that such an unnatural act happened within the scope of his concession. ? This caused great disturbances and almost caused major international negotiations...

As the &quot;visual director&quot; of literary and artistic publications such as &quot;Game Magazine&quot; and &quot;Saturday&quot;, Ding Wei has contributed a series of cover paintings and illustrations with great aesthetic interest. In the early years of the Republic of China, he and his colleagues in the art and literary circles jointly created an urban reading culture of leisure, entertainment, and fashion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1914, Chen Xiaodie wrote a poem for the &quot;Two Parts of Spring&quot; painted by Ding Kui, and once expressed emotion: &quot;When reading Mu Qin&#39;s paintings, there are often poems, but I regret that my pen cannot express the meaning.&quot; At that time, he was painting covers for magazines, and Ding Wei&#39;s works were the most common. In 1916, when Zhang Guangyu, who was 9 years younger, met Ding Xu, &quot;Old Ding was already quite successful and famous in Shanghai.&quot; This was Zhang Guangyu&#39;s feeling, and it was also Ding Xu&#39;s true status in society at that time. Ten years later, Ding Ju, Zhang Guangyu, Zhang Zhengyu, Ye Qianyu, Lu Shaofei and others established China&#39;s first comic society &quot;Cartoon Club&quot;. As the first generation of cartoonists in China, these pioneers opened up a new situation for satirical and comic cartoons. The publication &quot;Shanghai Comics&quot; they founded nourished and promoted the younger generations, ushering in the golden age of cartoon art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 1923, Ding Wei was spotted by a &quot;headhunter&quot; because of his superb painting skills, and joined the British American Tobacco Company to engage in advertising painting creation. As a senior figure in China&#39;s advertising industry, Ding Wei frankly admitted that &quot;artists have no freedom&quot; when they submit to business. &quot;The most painful thing is that not only are manufacturers&#39; advertising hosts very subjective, but most of them lack artistic accomplishment, and it is impossible to understand the author&#39;s ideas. He is often picky and picky and suggests unreasonable revision requirements. A work that was not bad at first was fragmented beyond recognition, making people laugh and cry.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The calendar card that is still talked about today was once the commercial art of the Republic of China. Among them, Ding Ju is also one of the earliest painters of calendar painting. Wang Zengqi once said: Ding Ku&#39;s paintings, &quot;The brushwork is somewhere between traditional Chinese painting and comics. There seems to be no such paintings now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/13/uJo6jBBwRRNE2T9rP3NaFGBZrrz9sVN1Nq8EbyX0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;403&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/13/uJo6jBBwRRNE2T9rP3NaFGBZrrz9sVN1Nq8EbyX0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250577&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Inner page of &quot;One Hundred Beautiful Pictures of the Style of the Republic of China&quot;, Ding Wei, 1918, published by China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Publishing House&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Provost of the Academy of Fine Arts&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was riding with Ding Jun in the car. Ding Jun looked around and saw young girls staring at each other. He stared blankly for a moment. I ridiculed him for being rude. Ding Jun said with a smile, &quot;How can I be so lustful? I&#39;m looking for painting materials.&quot; According to Wang Dugen&#39;s slightly ironic account, Ding Wei once &quot;stared&quot; on the bus without hesitation. Women, however, only want to accumulate &quot;painting materials&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years of the Republic of China, &quot;Hundred Beauty Pictures&quot;, which combined paintings of ladies and fashion, became popular. The young Ding&#39;s fame is closely related to the many volumes of beautiful pictures he drew. In August 1916, the Chinese Studies Bookstore launched &quot;Ding Wei&#39;s Hundred Beautiful Pictures&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Volume 1&lt;/span>;). Due to the good response, it was published in February 1917 The second volume was published in the same month, and Ding Kui became famous in one fell swoop; in March of the same year, the Chinese Library released four volumes of &quot;Ode to One Hundred Beautiful Pictures in Ancient and Modern Times&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; span>;), the ancient costume volume was written by Qiu Shounian, with a total of 100 pictures in the upper and lower volumes, and the fashion volume was drawn by Ding Wei, with a total of 50 pictures in the upper and lower volumes; in April 1918, the Shanghai Communications Library published &quot;Ding Wei&#39;s Hundred Beauty Pictures&quot; set&quot;. It can be said that Ding Wei&#39;s beautiful pictures and the &quot;cover girl&quot; he drew for &quot;Saturday&quot; were once all the rage and led the fashion of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In Ding Xue&#39;s hundreds of beautiful pictures, there are ladies, small family biyu, fashionable girls, and graceful village girls. They wear shorts and trousers, braids and buns, fashionable and pleasant, and the furnishings of their rooms are also beautiful. It is full of popular atmosphere.&quot; Xu Tinghua wrote in &quot;Ding Cong&#39;s Dad: Ding Chou&quot;: &quot;In the era of the west wind spreading eastward, new ideas affected the lives of the younger generation, and they also affected Ding Chou. The women in the painting ride horses, skate, go outing, sketch, sketch, play the violin, dance ballroom, drive, and chat on the phone. They are all modern and reflect the advanced aesthetic consciousness of new women and painters at that time. The women are all beautiful and energetic. Exuberant, a new style of life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Zheng pointed out that painting a hundred beautiful pictures at that time not only tested the artist&#39;s sensitivity to reality, but also gave the artist an opportunity to show off his talents. &quot;Through this style, he (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ding Wei&lt;/span>;) used exquisite pen and ink to shape the reality and imagination of women in the early Republic of China, which was in the ascendant to help citizens’ visual consumption.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the autumn of 1913, Ding Ju was invited to join the Shanghai Academy of Graphic Arts (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later It was renamed Shanghai Fine Arts College&lt;/span>;) and served as the dean. Due to her growing reputation for painting, in addition to teaching at Shanghai Fine Arts College, she was later hired as an art teacher by China Women&#39;s School, Tongji University and Yanmos Girls&#39; School. At that time, female education was gradually accepted by the world. As a teacher in a girls&#39; school, Ding Ju gained the convenience of &quot;getting painting materials&quot;. After mastering photography technology, he also took the opportunity to focus on &quot;Beauty&quot; and take pictures of girls. He once said that photographing &quot;girls from all schools is my duty.&quot; The photos taken by Ding Wei that remain today not only show the scenes of girls attending classes in coeducational art schools at that time, but also capture the style of girls in church girls’ schools at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/ezEQieOi1lxt1oBnrP9SQ64Ad1Zq802HYfm6f5bx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;555&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/ezEQieOi1lxt1oBnrP9SQ64Ad1Zq802HYfm6f5bx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250574&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ding Wei (second from left) and Zhang Guangyu (third from left), 1922, 22.5cm×40cm, courtesy of Zhang Guangyu Art Documentation Center&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About Women Ding Wei also wrote about the old stories of teaching in the school. &quot;Song Ziwen&#39;s wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, is also a student of Yan Mo&#39;s family... She always likes to dress up... She also wears heavy makeup and colorful clothes. Once, Shoujuan, Yunqian and I were watching a movie at the &#39;Odion&#39; on North Sichuan Road. When the show was over, Yun Gu suddenly noticed a very beautiful girl in the crowd in front of us. She encouraged us: &quot;Why don&#39;t you come forward and feast your eyes on it?&quot; At this time, I saw clearly that it was our student Zhang Leyi and said: &quot; Don&#39;t do anything nonsense. Those are our students. What&#39;s the point of being a teacher if they behave like this?&quot; All the niches took a breath. Such jokes were common in the past, because at that time, I was in charge of several schools. , there are also many male and female students, so in the playground, they often don’t even dare to look at them. They don’t claim to be gentlemen, but they are actually seeking their own politics in their position. They have to do this because of their status.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In terms of art education, Ding Wei also made outstanding contributions. He was the first provost of Shanghai Art College, the &quot;source of emerging art&quot;. The principal of the school was Liu Haisu, an &quot;art traitor&quot; who dared to &quot;fight&quot; with the warlord Sun Chuanfang over mannequins. Ding Ju recalled this fellow junior He said, &quot;He was extremely self-confident and refused to follow what others said. He focused on creation in his works throughout his life. However, in the early days, his calligraphy and painting were not unique and his boldness was indeed great. The world ignored the criticism and praise. He goes his own way, whether it is foreign or Chinese painting, a brute force can be observed in his paintings. His career achievements also depend on his unrelenting hard work. If you have a personality like mine, which is pragmatic and step-by-step, I’m afraid a hundred of them can’t compare to one of him.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with many famous artists in Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, Ding Wei’s influence has not been discovered before. From 1913 to 1918 when he was the dean and then teaching until 1928, he successively served as a teacher in the Western Painting Department, the Technical Normal Department, the Correspondence Department and the Pattern Department. He taught plaster models, copying, sketching, figures, watercolors, pencil drawings, and patterns. Production, advertising graphics and other courses... Despite the numerous achievements in teaching, Ding Wei is modest and self-deprecating: &quot;I have never even stepped into kindergarten, let alone graduated from high school or university, but I am so shameless that I am a teacher in the south, not only in ordinary schools.&quot; , and even as a professor in universities and vocational schools, although the drawing class seems to be an exception, the criticism of &#39;daring&#39; can never be escaped.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;daring&quot; Ding Wei is in the United States During his tenure as a full-time teacher, he indeed made many pioneering achievements: in 1914, he, Zhang Yuguang, Xu Yongqing, Liu Haisu, etc. launched the Zhenqing Calligraphy and Painting Society and published the &quot;Zhenqing Calligraphy and Painting Collection&quot; as a model teaching material; in 1919, he, Jiang Xiaoyu, Liu Yanong, etc. , Zhang Chenbo, Yang Qingqing, Chen Xiaojiang and others established the art group &quot;Tianma Club&quot;. By 1928, the &quot;Tianma Club&quot; held a total of 9 exhibitions, including Chinese paintings, foreign paintings, sculptures, photography and other styles, creating a trend of Chinese art exhibitions. Almost all the famous painters of that era had participated in the &quot;Tianma Club&quot; art exhibition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of sketching instead of copying in Western painting teaching has gone through a long &quot;struggle&quot;, especially on the issue of human body sketching. Ding Ju once argued in his &quot;Essays on Paintings&quot;: &quot;The painter is most qualified. The interesting thing is the sketching of the human body. Regardless of oil painting or sketching, I feel that there are infinite mysteries. Some people say that this is just because you are doing the painting with bad intentions. When you see the naked model, you probably have an incredible feeling. , so I feel that it is more interesting. I said God knows, this kind of interest is caused by the mystery of the various line structures on the human body, and the strange concave and convex contours. No curve in the world can be compared to the human body. Special. Only those who paint know this... To learn about climate changes, you must practice outdoor sketching; to learn the changes in outline and color, you must practice human body sketching.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Learning from the Master. Ding Xue from Zhou Xiang received copying teaching in his early years. While teaching at the School of Fine Arts, he was inspired by Chen Baoyi to develop his knowledge and practice of life drawing. &quot;In the beginning, those who studied Western painting in China were mostly copying, but it was not enough for training. Chen Baoyi advocated sketching as the basic practice... At that time, many teachers did not know how to teach, and I was just one of them. , I was extremely worried beforehand, fearing that I would make future scholars laugh, but he comforted me and taught me not to worry...taught me some important rules in sketching.&quot; According to Ding Ju&#39;s recollection, the studio he built by Chen Baoyi was returned to him. The practice of body photography has provided convenience. &quot;Once Qi Foqing and I found a beauty and wanted to take a nude model. We didn&#39;t have a suitable location for a while, so we took a car to Jiangwan and practiced it at Ji&#39;s Studio. The result was that the light was soft and beautiful for any ordinary photography. It’s beyond the reach of the museum.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Ding Wei was not the central figure in the nude model controversy at the American College, until his later years, he firmly believed that hiring nude models for sketching was a pioneering work of the College of Art. In addition, Ding Wei admitted that he had been obsessed with collecting &quot;nudity photos of men and women from all over the world, both male and female, or singles.&quot; When the collection was at its largest, &quot;there were more than a thousand kinds, and most of them were secret scenes taken by Westerners... There were not many domestically produced ones, and the good ones were There are very few of them, and a single person can still watch them for a while. There are more than ten kinds of Japanese exaggerated pictures, and there are nearly a dozen of them made by famous Western hands. The lines are beautiful and the composition is strange.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/IniMb9aN2l0r5LTI4fxcD6BkFTnDRpn0qlf2UX6s.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;666&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/IniMb9aN2l0r5LTI4fxcD6BkFTnDRpn0qlf2UX6s.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250576&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; Friends celebrated his birthday at Cangzhou Hotel. More than a hundred celebrities from the art world attended. &quot;Friends and friends joined in very enthusiastically, which shows that he is well-known in the art world and is very popular.&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Italics , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Lily&quot;&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1925, Ding Wei and his family moved to No. 31 Tianxiang Lane, Baylor Road (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today’s Lane 847, Huangpi South Road&lt;/span>;), according to Ding Cong’s recollection: Ye Qianyu lived on the second floor of the alley across the street, Lu Zhixiang lived downstairs, Tewei lived in the back, and Zhang Guangyu lived No. 19. The Ding family is relatively spacious, with the living room on the first floor, Ding Ju and his wife living on the second floor, and the eldest son Ding Cong living on the third floor. For a time, this place became a base camp for talented people: Zhang Guangyu, Ye Qianyu, Lu Shaofei, Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, Nie Er... Every weekend and holiday, talented people from all walks of life come in and out, talk and gossip. , and even &quot;eat and drink&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Miaozi, who later became a frequent visitor, once recorded the first time he walked into Ding&#39;s house in 1932: &quot;It was about a Saturday night, and a lot of movie and drama stars of the time were spread out in the living room and downstairs. In the room of uncle Ding&#39;s family on the second floor, there were three, three, five and five, everyone was enjoying themselves. Some of them called Ding Xue and Mrs. Ding to be their &quot;fake father&quot; and &quot;fake mother&quot;. Because they were unexpected to see so many people at once. Celebrity, I was a little blushing and my heart was beating. I met Uncle Ding’s uncle in a hurry, so I hurriedly hid in Ding Cong’s cabin on the third floor.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gW2gRmYMiXvdHeU5xjwA5lHuuRwCsbrkyVvj8cp7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gW2gRmYMiXvdHeU5xjwA5lHuuRwCsbrkyVvj8cp7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250571&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Cong, who was still a middle school student at the time, often sat among these celebrities and listened to their chatter and laughter. Nie Er came to Ding&#39;s house. The young Ding Cong once pestered Nie Er into his upstairs &quot;pavilion&quot; and told him horror stories. &quot;Once Nie Er was drunk, he walked to the patio and climbed along the wall. Go to the attic and sleep.&quot; The big stars of the Mingyue Song and Dance Club would always come to Ding&#39;s house in groups to play when they had free time. According to Ding Ju&#39;s memory, &quot;(Xue) Lingxian was the most jumping among them, and she took the initiative in most of the tricks. At that time, her child Yiyi (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ding Cong&lt;/span>;) was about the same age as them, so Lingxian often ate Yiyi tofu and said, &quot;As a child, Bai Zi (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Bai Hong&lt;/span>;) is assigned to Xiao Ding, and I will be the matchmaker. (Wang) Renmei, (Li) Lili, and Hu Jiamen To reconcile the situation, Yiyi was very angry. When he saw them coming, he often avoided the table. Sometimes the pavilion where he lived alone was occupied by them, so he had to not go in.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Bai Hong, etc. After becoming famous, they were followed by Zhou Xuan, who was still in the stage of career development. When Zhou Xuan was a trainee at Mingyue Club when she was twelve or thirteen years old, Ding Xuan had known her and cared for her. Zhou Xuan and &quot;Mr. Old Ding&quot; had a very close relationship, and they exchanged letters and gave photos frequently. However, in the later narratives about Zhou Xuan, Ding Xia rarely spoke up. Ding Xia said: &quot;I also had such doubts. I once asked about my grandmother and Father. My grandmother completely regarded Zhou Xuan as a child and felt that she should not leave the family; my father said that my grandfather also favored Yan Hua (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zhou Xuan in this matter Ex-husband&lt;/span>;). At that time, public opinion was almost on Zhou Xuan&#39;s side, and she was even regarded as the &#39;runaway Nora&#39;. My grandfather had always stayed away from right and wrong. Since public opinion was swayed to one side, he was unwilling to join in the fun and avoided those Tabloid reporter. After Yan Hua remarried, he stopped mentioning the old stories. When he was young, his grandfather was also considered a new-school literati, advocating that women should enter society and liberate themselves. However, in the 1930s and 1940s, he felt that he seemed to be a little behind the times. , he believes that women should pursue career development, but also put family first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the newly published &quot;Memoirs of Forty Years in the Art Circle&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: In Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Collection Edition&lt;/span>;)&quot;, Ding Xia added 12 letters between Ding Wei and Zhou Xuan. &quot;Most of Zhou Xuan&#39;s letters to my grandfather were not dated. The two dated letters were written when she returned to Shanghai for medical treatment in 1957. In the letter, Zhou Xuan also stated that she would visit her grandfather after she recovered. My grandfather was naturally very happy and told several friends about the incident. However, he did not expect that just over two months after the last letter was written, Zhou Xuan died suddenly, which is really sad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Among the photos collected by his family, there are many signed photos of celebrities, as well as photos of people from all walks of life taken by him. The gentle-tempered Ding Wei is well-known in the industry as a &quot;nice gentleman&quot;. When interacting with friends, he often takes photos of the men and women around him because he carries a camera with him and has a great sense of service. Ding Ju, who is both a photographer and a fan of Peking Opera, has been close to a number of famous actresses and has left many photos of great documentary value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/40Wyy9aJbc0G6KeGFZkM5dKsIzJW7og5Qmvu9Gso.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;729&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/40Wyy9aJbc0G6KeGFZkM5dKsIzJW7og5Qmvu9Gso.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250569&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; (Xun) Huisheng didn’t recognize me when he was born (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;ding&lt;/span>;). Sha Youtian taught him how to read square characters every day and also copied them. Copybook, considered his talent and intelligence, actually advanced very quickly, and later he even learned to paint.&quot; Ding Wei took a photo of this &quot;illiterate famous lady&quot; leaning on a rockery with his head bent and reading diligently, &quot; One of the greatest advantages of Huisheng is that he is willing to receive advice from others. After every time he comes off the stage, he always asks everyone present whether there are any shortcomings on stage today or what needs to be improved. We always tell him truthfully and he will correct it next time. , he was one of the four famous Dandans, and it was not a coincidence at first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Wei became a photography enthusiast and was influenced by his friend Lang Jingshan. When Lang Jingshan was working part-time in the advertising department of &quot;Shenbao&quot;, Ding Ju noticed his high-end camera. &quot;The mirror case was not brand new, but it was of a good brand, and it was a four-inch large reflector.&quot; However, &quot;it was extremely heavy.&quot; &quot;, Ding Wei teased Lang Jingshan, &quot;No matter where he goes, he always carries this reflector like a chamber pot box with him, never leaving it for a moment. With his warm tone, it really makes people laugh. We got it for him. He was nicknamed &quot;living in a chamber pot box.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Wei, who is &quot;an excellent photographer throughout his life,&quot; sometimes stood in front of the camera to &quot;pose&quot;, and he was quite playful. In 1924, &quot;Half Moon&quot; published a photo of Zhou Shojuan and Ding Ju. Both appeared in women&#39;s clothing. Above it was a portrait of Zhou Shojuan in women&#39;s clothing when he was 14 years old, titled &quot;Shoujuan Makeup&quot;, with a description next to it: &quot;The so-called Prince Wenyan. Qianying (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Photographed fifteen years ago&lt;/span>;)&quot;. Ding Wei once took over the chore of drawing illustrations for novels because of this &quot;lovely friend&quot;, &quot;I remember once, I drew the illustrations of &quot;Ten Zhangs of Beijing Dust&quot; and &quot;The Record of Leftover Pink and Residual Fat&quot; for Shoujuan&#39;s &quot;Half Moon&quot;. Zhang is a bather in a bathhouse. They are all naked. There must be no mistakes in the drawings of each person&#39;s body... One picture shows a woman sitting on a low stool and sitting on a copper bed, cutting the nails of a young man... The composition It was difficult to arrange. I said to Shojuan, you have made me suffer. It is more difficult to draw these two illustrations than to draw ten colorful covers... Isn’t it unfair?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Ju and Zhou Shojuan’s friendship It is true that the two had known each other for more than 50 years from the time of &quot;Shen Shen·Free Talk&quot; to when Zhou was 70 years old. In 1964, when Ding Wei was dying, it coincided with the 70th birthdays of Zhou Shoujuan, Zheng Yimei and Tao Lengyue. A group of old friends celebrated their birthdays at the time-honored Xinya Restaurant in Shanghai and took a group photo after dinner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is a serious and even a bit dull photo, which may be related to people&#39;s aging mood and current situation. Among the 22 people taking a photo together, most of them were very healthy people in Shanghai at that time. There are many intellectuals, and Ping Yanya, Cheng Xiaoqing, Lu Danan and Yan Duhe are all over seventy years old.&quot; Gu Zheng believed that this group photo was of &quot;extraordinary significance&quot; and made people think deeply about &quot;the heavy fate of individuals in the great era&quot; - four years later, in 1968, Zhou Shoujuan committed suicide by throwing himself into a well in Suzhou. Another year later, Ding Wei died of illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Reference: &quot;Mu Qin&#39;s Career: Ding Wei and 20th Century Modern Art and Culture&quot; &quot;Forty Years of Art Memoirs (1902-1945)&quot;, etc.; Acknowledgments: Liu Haisu Art Museum, Gu Zheng, Ding Xia, Hu Yue, Zhao Shuping, etc.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[见闪电掠空，但不觉人生一场空——松尾芭蕉“奥之细道”行迹（三）丨最深之水]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256729]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/15/3VWPjX64PlaoZOYuyeFFEZdsA4MtTJgtN0KXPBwN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/3VWPjX64PlaoZOYuyeFFEZdsA4M tTJgtN0KXPBwN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250844&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The autumn scenery of Jiyama Temple along Matsuo Basho&#39;s &quot;Oku no Hosho&quot; tour. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Continue walking north. Get on the train from Nishinasuno Station, go to Nasushiobara Station, transfer to the Shinkansen to Koriyama, transfer to the main line and get off at Inaashiro Station. In a very small station, a huge public service announcement is very conspicuous on the glass of the station door. On it is a big picture of a sweet girl, and below it is written, &quot;Check everything one by one to be careful of candles.&quot; In Japanese, the small fire candle is called &quot;火の心&quot;, which is interesting. Waiting for the bus at the station entrance, get off at the Katada stop and arrive at the shore of Inaashiro Lake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lake Inaashiro is the fourth largest lake in Japan. It is located in the center of Fukushima Prefecture and has transparent and clear water. The beauty of the four seasons of Bandai Mountain is reflected in it, like a sky mirror, so it is also called Tianjing Lake. From Jiantian Station on the roadside (there is just a road sign on the side of the road) to the lake, there is a straight small dirt road. On both sides of the road are harvested yellow-brown winter fields, and at the end of the road is a row of undulating crimson fields. The red tree, above the tree, was a vast sky covered with gray and white clouds. Although there was no actual sound, a loud rumbling sound suddenly rose in my heart. How could he just walk over like this? He must be running away! So he ran over like crazy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The business card of Lake Inaashiro is Hideyo Noguchi. Hideyo Noguchi, the man printed on the 1,000 yen note, is a world-famous bacteriologist who has made outstanding research achievements in serology, polio, rabies, syphilis, etc., which have benefited all mankind. In 1876, Hideyo Noguchi was born into a poor peasant family on the shores of Lake Inaashiro at the foot of Mount Bandai. He was a poor student who worked extremely hard. After studying at the Medical College in Tokyo, he went to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States for further study and research, and made significant achievements. In 1928, Noguchi Hideyo died of the yellow fever epidemic while researching yellow fever in Ghana, Africa. At that time, the United States took his body back to New York for burial. In Lake Inaashiro, his hometown built the Noguchi Hideyo Museum for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We did not visit the Noguchi Hideyo Museum, but as of this writing, we cannot avoid the local business card. We didn&#39;t have much time at the time, and we had to return to the station to continue our journey north, so we strolled around the deserted lake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We stayed at a hot spring hotel in Tendo City, Yamagata Prefecture at night. There is a big black cat lying on the cabinet at the front desk of the hotel. The clerk said that it is the hotel&#39;s signature and the owner. Tendo is the home and production base of shogi. The status of shogi is equivalent to that of Chinese chess, but it is not clear how to play it. I have watched the Japanese movie &quot;Holy Youth&quot;, which is a biopic about the seriously ill genius shogi player Murayama Sei. There are many scenes of chess and competitions in the film, which are quite arduous. At Tendo&#39;s hotel, I got a souvenir from the store, a small red shogi piece, which can be used as a key chain. When I got it and looked at it carefully, I suddenly thought: Does Chinese chess have a production base? In which city? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Return to the trip. We entered Yamagata Prefecture to visit Tateishiji Temple (mountain temple), which is an important relic of the Oku no Hosōdo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the morning, take the bus from Tendo Station to Yamagata Station, store your suitcases here, then continue to get on the bus, get off at Sandera Station, and start climbing the mountain. Lishi Temple, also known as Mountain Temple, was opened as the Taoist temple of Tiantai Sect in 860 by Master Cijue, an eminent monk of Tiantai Sect. The mountain here is steep and there are many strange rocks. After climbing all the way up, there are 870 stone steps from the mountain gate to the inner courtyard. This shrine is long and arduous and quite a tiring journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basho wrote in &quot;Oku no Hosōdo&quot; &quot;Thirty Standing Stone Temple&quot;, &quot;... When we got there, it was still dark, so we first settled down in the monk&#39;s room at the bottom of the mountain, and then went up the mountain. Went to pay homage to the monk hall. Along the way, we saw layers of dangerous rocks and boulders, lush old pines and cypresses, and the old earth and rocks were covered with moss, making it slippery and difficult to walk on. Many temples built on the top of the rocks were all The door was closed, and there was silence. Sometimes we crept on the edge of the cliff, sometimes we crawled on the giant rocks, visited the Buddhist temple, and looked at the surrounding scenery. As the saying goes, the beautiful scenery is lonely, quiet and peaceful, and I feel that my heart has become clear and transparent. &quot;It&#39;s over.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way to the entrance, Basho&#39;s famous sentence written here is engraved on the cliff, &quot;The sound of the cicadas in the rock of leisure&quot; (Want to know how quiet it is? The cicadas chirp deep into the rock). Out of breath, I reached a small flat land in the mountains. On top of stacks of rocks, there was a bronze seated statue of Master Basho and his disciple Zeng Liang resting in the mountains. Basho was wearing a turban and straw sandals, sitting on a tree root, tilting his head slightly and looking into the distance. There was a small cloth bag hanging on his chest, presumably containing paper and pens. Zeng Liang is sitting not far away, wearing a bald monk&#39;s robes, holding a wooden stick in his right hand and a bamboo hat in his left hand. In the chapter &quot;Six Days of Light&quot; in &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot;, Basho specifically writes about Zeng Liang&#39;s change of clothes. When they were in Shenchuan, Zeng Liang and Basho lived next to each other, chopping firewood, boiling water, and doing daily housework for the teacher. When the two decided to travel to Austria together, before leaving, Zeng Liang shaved his head and put on black monk robes. When the two of them walked to the Black-Faced Mountain, Zeng Liang recited a sentence, &quot;The black-haired people shaved off early, and unexpectedly encountered the Black-Faded Mountain. It&#39;s time to change clothes in spring and summer.&quot; Bajiao commented, &quot;The word &#39;change&#39; in it , is not just a simple phrase, but also contains his determination to change his identity and insist on traveling far away. It is sonorous, powerful and meaningful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/15/0LwQbypWyYAFroR2L7GaeWOOhazUMdJB3IvUpv51.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/15/0LwQbypWyYAFroR2L7GaeWOOhazUMdJB3IvUpv51.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250845&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matsuo Basho and Kawai Soryo on the way to the mountain temple bronze seated statue. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three of us each found a rock and sat with Basho Zengliang to rest for a while. The mountain breeze is strong and cool. If you stop for a while, the sweat will stop all over your body. There is a branch of miscellaneous trees behind the banana, and the scattered red leaves are shining like gems in the sun. In the distance is the green mountain scenery, and the green and transparent leaves in the backlight are like new green in early spring. This place and this scene should be the same as what Basho and Zeng Liang saw 330 years ago. Think carefully about the integration of time and space, and you will suddenly feel lucky for three lifetimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, keep walking. Basho&#39;s footsteps are ahead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Oku no Hosōdo&quot;, Mount Haguro in Yamagata Prefecture is a highlight and must be visited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late autumn of 2019, which coincided with the first year of Reiwa, Japan’s new Emperor Naruhito ascended the throne. Haguro Mountain, where an important shrine is located, started from the Suishin Gate. There were many congratulatory posters on the approach to the shrine. . These congratulatory posters are not available in the street market. Along the way from Tokyo, from the market point of view, there was very little content related to the new emperor&#39;s enthronement. This shows that the changes in the Japanese royal family have little immersion and impact on people&#39;s daily life, let alone frequent changes. of the Japanese cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haguro Mountain is one of the three mountains of Dewa. The three mountains, Mount Haguro, Mount Yudono, and Mount Tsuki, are special sacred places in Japanese mountain belief. Among the three mountains, only Mount Haguro, which is 414 meters above sea level, can be climbed all year round. Mount Getsuki and Mount Yudono are 1,984 meters and 1,504 meters above sea level respectively. Both have closed seasons. The former is from early autumn to early summer, and the latter is in autumn. In spring, ordinary people cannot go. Mount Yudono is considered to be the final place of spiritual practice in the Dewa Sanzan. Its shrine cannot be called by its name, and photography is prohibited, making it very mysterious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/uZBi7vFjm2QSjlgdagUQ0M1lsHJxg3YWpkU8EMz4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/uZBi7vFjm2QSjlgdagUQ0M1lsHJxg3YWpkU8EMz4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250846&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The mountain trail in Mount Haguro. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basho and his disciple Zeng Liang arrived at the Dewa Three Mountains in mid-summer in July, and visited all three mountains. . The two masters and apprentices climbed to the Moon Mountain. After reaching a certain altitude, they entered the snow. They were in a trance. &quot;... They entered the cloud pass where the sun and moon travel. Their breath stopped and their bodies froze. Finally, when they reached the top of the mountain, the sun The moon is out.&quot; Along the way to Yueshan Mountain, Basho wrote a diary of his journey, but did not write a haiku. After that, he climbed to Tangdian Mountain, &quot;...and sat on a stone to take a nap. I saw a cherry tree, about three feet high, with half-open buds and hidden flowers. In the snow, spring is not forgotten; the late cherry blossoms are as special as the fragrance of plum blossoms in summer.&quot; The most beautiful scenery of Yudian Mountain should be at the shrine on the top of the mountain. Basho said, &quot;The details of the mountain are forbidden to be disclosed to outsiders, so Stop writing and not record.&quot; During the trip to Tangdian Mountain, Basho still did not write any haiku. Only at Mount Haguro, Basho lamented the beauty of the climb and recited, &quot;It&#39;s rare to find something special. The mountain breeze carries the fragrance of snow and the southern valley is scented.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We climbed Mount Haguro. The route is to climb from Suishenmen at the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, and then take a car down the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various shrines along the mountain road. There is Sanzan Shrine on the top of the mountain. When believers worship here, it is equivalent to worshiping all three mountains. I looked at the map and saw that there were dozens of shrines scattered throughout Mount Haguro. Among them is Hayamazhi Shrine, which we passed by while climbing. In my opinion, this shrine is quite appropriate for Mount Haguro, where trees and leaves are the focus of attention. &quot;It&#39;s awe-inspiring, the green leaves are intertwined, and the sun shines brightly.&quot; Basho wrote this haiku about Nikko in &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot;. It is particularly suitable to put it on the scenery we saw along the way to Mount Haguro. Climbing the long and steep mountain road, dripping with sweat and out of breath, I occasionally stopped to look up and saw the bright autumn sunshine blowing in the wind between the leaves. Although I did not feel the &quot;snow fragrance&quot; that Basho mentioned, it was indeed fascinating. , tiredness is completely out of the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early autumn, mid-autumn and late autumn are quite vague concepts. In terms of time, this trip to Northeast Japan is already in the mid-autumn season, but what I saw along the way was clearly the scenery of early autumn. We entered Tohoku from Tokyo. During our short stay in Tokyo, there was still heat in the air. In Tohoku, where the latitude is high, the red leaves and yellow leaves are already a little bit scattered, while in areas outside Tohoku, such as Tokyo and Kyoto, the red leaves are still green. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this greenness is very subtle, it is the greenness that is about to leave, without any lingering flavor. In other words, the departure heel has already stood on tiptoe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The color of leaves has countless levels in a frame. The rotten leaf color is a very rich color system among the traditional Japanese colors. During the Heian period, there was a saying of the &quot;forty-eight rotten leaf colors&quot;. The color of fallen leaves refers to the color of fallen leaves. I understand that the state of fallen leaves should be when the leaves have just fallen off the branches, not after they have fallen to the ground. Among the colors of rotten leaves, the color name &quot;green rotten leaves&quot; refers specifically to the green color that still retains the breath of summer. A very Zen statement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the long mountain trail of Mount Haguro, there are fallen leaves the color of decayed green leaves everywhere. In the sunshine, those leaves that are about to fall or change color are like the new green in early spring, tender and bright. Along the way, there are traces of Basho, monuments, statues, and the &quot;Basho Tomb&quot;, which is one of the many in Japan... I took out the &quot;Oku no Homichi&quot; I brought with me and took a photo with Basho to thank him for his kind blessing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new green of early spring has a unique color term called moeki color, which has been used since the Heian period. The moe wood color is a fresh and bright green with a breath as thin as cicada wings. It is said that this color is often used in the armor of young samurai. This scene is described in &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, where a teenage samurai appears lightly wearing moegi-colored armor. It&#39;s hard to imagine how the texture of the armor could be harmonized with a color as delicate as bright green. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There seems to be no difference between the green rotten wood color in early autumn and the cute wood color in early spring from the color matching post, at least I can&#39;t see any difference. The difference lies in the breath, in the relationship between these delicate greens and the wind, rain, and sky. The autumn sky is high and distant, and the depth of field is the deepest and most indifferent among the four seasons. It is silent and reticent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The color of green and decaying leaves has been with us since the beginning of this trip. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book written by Nagasawa Yoko, a traditional Japanese color expert, she regards hagi cakes as the representative food of green leaf color. Hagi, also known as Lespedeza, is one of the seven grasses of autumn. Hagi mochi is a Japanese autumn seasonal food, which is a glutinous rice dumpling filled with bean paste that is common in Japan. If you want to emphasize the occasion, you will add a flowering lespedeza pattern. The red flowers and green leaves are all light and hazy. The soft colors and soft taste are combined into one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a song in &quot;Man&#39;yoshu&quot; that says: &quot;There has been a time like this; Junshang asked, have the Lespedeza flowers bloomed?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trip we set off from Fukagawa, Tokyo. At that time, while looking into the courtyard of Bashoan&#39;s former site, I saw the flowering Lespedeza for the first time. The seated bronze statue of Basho faces the Sumida River. The autumn clouds are low to the horizon, the branches of Lespedeza are trembling in the wind, and the red flowers are swaying. Lespedeza is a simple shrub plant, and its branch and flower shapes are not stunning at all, but its light and contented little playfulness makes people very happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since there are hagi mochi in autumn, there are also corresponding seasonal foods in spring, which are rice cakes and oriole mochi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One March, when I was on a spring trip to Japan, I was in a restaurant. The shopkeeper served me a dessert, a diamond-shaped rice cake divided into three layers, one pink and one pink. It&#39;s white and the first layer is green. I always like this kind of simple snack, not too sweet, and I ate it happily. Later, when I read the book, I realized, oh, what I eat is water chestnut pancake. This water chestnut cake really has a very important meaning. The orthodox lozenge cake has three colors, peach represents peach blossoms, white represents lingering snow, and green represents spring buds. It is a typical spring snack and an important food for the Peach Blossom Festival in March. March 3rd is Hina Festival, also called Peach Blossom Festival or Girl&#39;s Day, which is derived from China&#39;s Shangsi Festival. During this festival, families with daughters will set up a doll stand in their home, with three, five, seven or nine layers, with figures in ancient costumes placed on each layer from bottom to top in descending order. Doll. The special foods on this day are clam chowder, chirashi sushi, dried mochi and water chestnut cakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called warbler cake is a glutinous rice ball wrapped with fillings and sprinkled with bean flour called warbler powder made from green beans. The traditional color represented by Oriole mochi is Oriole, which is the color of the feathers of an oriole. The tree warbler, also called the primula, has a thrilling call in early spring. There is a haiku in the corner of Basho&#39;s disciple&#39;s room, which says, &quot;The oriole hangs upside down on the branch and makes its first cry.&quot; The color of the oriole I understand is matte yellow-green. This color name was born in the Edo period. Common people in the Edo period were prohibited from wearing bright and bright clothes, so matte orioles were very popular because of their subtle charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know why, but I think it’s more appropriate for glutinous rice dumplings to be green. In small supermarkets in Japan, there are various kinds of glutinous rice dumplings called &quot;Daifuku&quot;. The one I often buy is called &quot;Cao Daifuku&quot;. The light green glutinous rice dumplings are wrapped in light green bean flour and filled with bean paste. &quot;Sodaifuku&quot; is very cheap, about 100 yen each, but if it is served at a formal banquet in the spring, it will be worth a lot of money, and its name will also change, becoming &quot;Obama mochi&quot;. Maybe some people will laugh at me for thinking that the &quot;Cao Dafu&quot; in the supermarket is the same thing as Orioles cake. Maybe there are some differences between the two, but for me, who has dull taste buds, they are the same thing. I ate the last dessert at a spring Michelin-level kaiseki meal, a small green glutinous rice pancake. It was delicious. I thought happily, oh, it’s Sodaifuku. Then I looked at the menu at hand and it said: &quot;Warbler Cake&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From autumn to spring, spring and autumn flow. In spring and autumn, people are accustomed to skipping summer and winter, but these two seasons, which have no direct intersection, are used as synonyms for the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Basho&#39;s &quot;Oku no Hosho&quot;, the first haiku is in &quot;Departure&quot;, &quot;Spring is about to pass, and it is useless to teach birds to sing gracefully and fish to have tears in their eyes.&quot; The last haiku is in &quot;Departure&quot;. In &quot;Ogaki&quot;, &quot;Meat in a clam shell, seeing two things separated, autumn is about to go.&quot; It starts with &quot;spring goes&quot; and ends with &quot;autumn goes&quot;, and the first sentence of the prologue part of &quot;Oku no Hosomido&quot; Yes, &quot;The sun and moon are passers-by for hundreds of generations, and the years are also travelers.&quot; It is nothing more than two words, years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You will get tired of singing any song after a long time, but for the songs of the four seasons, generations of passers-by, travelers coming and going for thousands of years, no matter how you sing, there is never enough. Although all the songs will disappear, Basho said, &quot;Precious people see lightning flying across the sky, but they don&#39;t realize that their lives are in vain.&quot; This very powerful haiku is a sentence of summer. I have always believed that summer is the most powerful season. In other seasons, my mood is flickering up and down, and I am not at ease, which is hard to say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
