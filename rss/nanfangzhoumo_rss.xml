At the same time, new research has found that the simplest way to prevent the early onset or younger onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is to have a good night&#39;s sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 2023, Jia Jianping’s team at Xuanwu Hospital reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease that a patient developed memory impairment at the age of 17 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 19. (AD) patients. This is the youngest patient to date. The patient suffered from memory loss, frequently lost personal belongings, could not remember whether he had eaten or not, and was ultimately unable to complete his studies and had to drop out of high school. Previously, patients younger than 30 years old have been reported, with the youngest age of onset being 21 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of diagnosis and treatment of the patient, the research team found that the patient&#39;s main symptom was memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. Combined with the Wechsler Memory Scale and Auditory Word Learning Test assessment, the patient&#39;s main symptoms were memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. A diagnosis was made. However, the patient had no family history of hereditary disease and could not find other causes of memory impairment such as genetics, infections, and systemic diseases. After whole-genome sequencing, it was found that the patient did not carry any risk or pathogenic gene mutations, ruling out the possibility of familial Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Therefore, its pathogenesis requires further study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Alzheimer’s disease is not exclusive to the elderly, but young people can also get it. Currently, there are at least 50 million dementia patients worldwide, and it is expected that the number will reach 152 million by 2050, of which about 60%-70% are Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research on Alzheimer&#39;s disease has long been classified. The disease has a youthful form, but this is not an independent disease. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is classified according to the age at onset. A standard and a title. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is divided into early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease (also known as young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease) and late-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease refers to Alzheimer&#39;s disease that occurs in adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and those younger than 35 are called very early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Age statistics of Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients in various countries around the world show that the average age of onset of the disease is 51 years old. Young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease accounts for 4%-6% of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. However, most cases of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease develop between the ages of 45 and 65. Statistics in the United States show that the mortality rate of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease among those aged 40-64 is 24.2%. Now, the 19-year-old patient diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China belongs to the ultra-early form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Insight Report on the Needs of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Patients&quot; released by the National Health Commission on September 20, 2023 pointed out that there are currently about 15.07 million dementia patients in China aged 60 and above, among which Alzheimer&#39;s patients There are 9.83 million patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it is expected that by 2050, the number of Alzheimer&#39;s patients will exceed 40 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the prevalence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease continues to rise in China, this disease, which mainly affects people over 60 years old, has shown a new characteristic in China. The incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is increasing among young people in China. . Reported statistics show that the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is 2.5% for those under 40 years old; 4.1% for 40-49 year olds; 14.7% for 50-59 year olds; 28.9% for 60-69 year olds; and 70-79 year olds. 33.2%; 16.6% for those aged 80 and above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the high-risk group of the disease is 60-79 years old, accounting for 62.1%. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is said to have early onset when it occurs under the age of 60. In China, 21.3% of patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease are under the age of 60. Compared with the international incidence rate of 5%-10% in this age group, China&#39;s early-onset incidence rate has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is China or the United Nations standards, people under 50 years old are middle-aged and young people. China&#39;s &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of the Elderly&quot; collectively refers to citizens over 60 years old as the elderly. However, according to the classification of life by the United Nations and World Health Organization in 2020, there are 5 stages. Minors: 0 to 17 years old; young people: 18 to 65 years old; middle-aged people: 66 to 79 years old; elderly: 80 to 99 years old; longevity elderly: over 100 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If according to the new standards of the United Nations, all 18-65 years old are young people, then half of the patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China may be young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many factors that contribute to the development of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but taking one simple preventative approach can reduce the incidence and number of people affected by the disease. Some previous studies have found a link between napping and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. A long-term follow-up survey of the leisure activities and sleep conditions of more than 20,000 elderly people found that those who have the habit of napping have about a 37% lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease than those who do not take naps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this was only a study of older adults. A recent study on young and middle-aged people found that as long as they have good deep sleep, they can effectively prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, especially the younger generation of the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Framingham Heart Institute, the University of Texas and other centers in the United States have just published the results of a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (&amp;nbsp;JAMA) showing that deep sleep helps To slow down brain aging, every 1% decrease in deep sleep per year is associated with a 27% increase in the risk of dementia, suggesting that maintaining deep sleep time can prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this study, researchers used data from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began in 1948 with 5,209 adults in Framingham and has continued for more than seventy years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the study, researchers analyzed 346 participants from the Framingham Heart Study cohort who were in their thirties when they originally entered the study (1995-1998). A standard young man. Study participants completed two nocturnal sleep studies measuring polysomnography (PSG) between 1995-1998 and 2001-2003, with an average interval of 5 years between studies. The researchers recorded the participants&#39; Alzheimer&#39;s disease status over the next 17 years and analyzed the relationship between deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Study participants&#39; average percentage of deep sleep at baseline was 18.1%, and participants&#39; deep sleep time decreased between the two nightly sleep studies, suggesting that deep sleep increases with age. reduce. During the 17 years of follow-up, 52 patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease were diagnosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After adjusting for other influencing factors, the researchers found that each 1% decrease in deep sleep per year was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of all-cause Alzheimer&#39;s disease and a 32% increase in the risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. % related. The study also found that in the presence of a genetic risk for Alzheimer&#39;s disease (APOE4 allele), the decrease in deep sleep accelerates with age, but changes in brain volume do not affect deep sleep time. This means that Alzheimer&#39;s disease can be effectively prevented if people maintain a normal amount of deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that deep sleep is essential for the brain to remove metabolic waste, including the main proteins that accumulate in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein. At the same time, as we age, there will be less and less deep sleep, which may lead to a continued weakening of lymphoid fluid clearance, increase the risk of Aβ and Tau protein formation, and lead to neurodegenerative diseases or Alzheimer&#39;s disease . At the same time, insufficient deep sleep is also associated with the development of vascular risk factors and may lead to dementia through the accumulation of cerebrovascular disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this study does not reveal the exact cause-and-effect relationship between insufficient deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, maintaining deep sleep time is a simple way to prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it can be done at a young age. You should have and maintain good deep sleep when you are young, because the time of deep sleep is different for different ages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is also called golden sleep. It is the stage when people sleep the deepest and most soundly. At this time, they cannot hear any noise outside and it is difficult to be awakened by others. During deep sleep, the human body has a powerful body repair function, and the effect of relieving fatigue is also most obvious. For young people aged 20-30, deep sleep accounts for 20%-25% of their sleep time every night, while for elderly people aged 70-80, deep sleep accounts for only 5%-7% of their total sleep time every night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is related to the duration of sleep, which is another manifestation of quantity and quality. When an average person sleeps less than 6 hours a night, deep sleep will be reduced. Moreover, if you want to have better and more time of deep sleep, you must first fall asleep before 23:00. 23:00 to 3:00 the next morning is the best time to enter deep sleep. Once you miss it, no matter how long you sleep afterwards, you will It&#39;s hard to make up for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, even a very short nap, 1-3 pm is the optimal rest time, which can enhance the brain&#39;s memory processing ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the information age, in order to reduce and prevent the early onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, it is best not to stay up late and maintain normal and better deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[69个案例，多个政府部门被立案调查背后：反垄断的硬骨头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting in March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a nationwide campaign to curb administrative abuses Powers, special actions to eliminate law enforcement that restricts competition.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On April 7, 2023, the Urban Management Bureau of Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province was placed under investigation for reasons related to the operating rights of shared bicycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau will conduct a public bidding for the shared electric bicycle operating rights project in the main urban area of ​​the county. In the end, two companies obtained the operating rights, and the Urban Management Bureau signed contracts with these two companies, limiting a total of 1,500 vehicles to be put into operation for a period of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After investigation by the Jiangxi Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, it is believed that the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau limited the number of shared electric vehicles in the main urban area through public bidding without any legal and regulatory basis. Operating enterprises excludes or restricts other business entities with qualified qualifications and service capabilities from entering this market, hindering fair market competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was found to have abused administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. This behavior is also called administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing, director of the Competition Law Research Center of Nankai University, explained that administrative monopoly is an administrative monopoly that directly or indirectly interferes with market competition to protect or support certain entities by abusing administrative power. specific operators or commodities to maximize the interests of themselves or others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 is the 15th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law. The &quot;Regulations on Preventing the Abuse of Administrative Power to Eliminate or Restrict Competition&quot; have also been revised. Starting from April 15, 2023 Effective from today. Since March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a nationwide special campaign to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement. From June 2022 to January 2023, a total of 5 batches and 63 administrative monopoly cases were announced. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a special anti-monopoly law enforcement action in the field of people&#39;s livelihood. The two batches of typical cases currently announced include 6 administrative monopoly cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the behavior of the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was reported as a typical case of anti-administrative monopoly. At present, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau has made rectifications, canceled the contract, and issued an announcement to fully open the shared electric vehicle market in the main urban area of ​​the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;With &quot;good intentions&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 2023 On the 18th, relevant staff from the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that they had canceled the bidding. The Harbin Urban Management Bureau, which was put under investigation for the same reason, stated that the shared bicycle bidding business has been handed over to the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in 69 cases, a total of 69 administrative agencies were punished. Generally speaking, the cases involved are mainly concentrated in the fields of people&#39;s livelihood such as urban management, medical care, education, and construction. Chen Bing explained that industry supervision in these fields has obvious characteristics, and administrative agencies can directly allocate resources during the management process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from the typical cases published, the motivations of the units involved are different, and some administrative monopoly behaviors even occur out of &quot;good intentions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2022, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau of Xiangshan County, Ningbo City issued a recommended list of housing safety appraisal institutions, requiring those who carry out housing safety appraisal business in Xiangshan County to obtain the municipal certification After filing the certificate with the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, you should register with the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. In October 2022, the Zhejiang Provincial Market Supervision Bureau determined that this behavior constituted the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that their original intention was to facilitate the masses, “They always ask questions like this when they come to do business. ——We don’t know which housing safety agencies to look for for appraisal, so we put the list of nearly 20 registered agencies on the official account of the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned staff emphasized that house safety appraisal is a bottom-line issue. They need to comprehensively analyze the qualifications, capabilities, and creditworthiness of all appraisal agencies before making it public. Therefore, they A directory of housing safety appraisal agencies registered in Ningbo City will be formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the investigation, the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau has withdrawn the recommended list. However, this staff member believes that if there are only one or two houses, it may be a monopoly. However, their recommended list includes more than a dozen housing safety appraisal agencies from Ningbo and Hangzhou, and &quot;there is none in Xiangshan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, some administrative agencies are not aware that the documents issued constitute an administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2017, the Finance Bureau of Pingluo County, Ningxia designated an insurance company as the underwriting unit for traffic accident insurance for various administrative institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the relevant departments of the Pingluo County Finance Bureau said that because the document was released for so long, the drafter of the document and the person responsible for its preparation and issuance are no longer in the bureau. They had not noticed this document before. It was not until March 2023, when the Market Supervision Bureau came to investigate, that they found the document and invalidated the relevant provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When it comes to the implementation of the document, the person in charge said that it also depends on the budget of each unit. Some units are implementing it, while others have not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin, director of the Competition Law and Policy Research Center of Wuhan University, believes that administrative agencies lack the concept of fair competition in the policy formulation process and often only think about bidding and investment. Introducing investment to stimulate the economy while ignoring the need to maintain the bottom line of fair competition in the market can easily lead to the emergence of administrative monopolies. &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; sp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Antitrust and Anti-Corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Among the reported administrative monopoly cases, the common handling methods are to abrogate the execution of the original documents, terminate the bidding work or cancel the contract, and submit a rectification report. There are also cases where the market supervision and administration administration issues administrative proposals to the local people&#39;s government, and a few supervisors Personnel and those directly responsible were punished, often involving corruption such as power-for-money transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In April 2021, the Chenzhou City Education Bureau of Hunan Province identified 4 school uniform production and supply manufacturers through bidding, and divided the urban area into 4 areas, limiting each area. Regional schools can only purchase uniforms from designated manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When investigating in August 2021, the Hunan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau believed that the above behavior deprived the school and the parent committee of the right to make independent choices. As a result, the bidding process was terminated in September 2021. (The special action in 2022 announced 5 batches of 63 typical cases, 23 of which were filed for investigation in 2021.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 18, 2023, A staff member of the Chenzhou City Education Bureau office said that the technical equipment department, a secondary organization under the Education Bureau, is responsible for the primary and secondary school uniform business. Due to disciplinary violations in the public bidding process for the qualification of primary and secondary school uniform manufacturers, this organization was suspended midway. The Administration for Market Regulation called a halt, and the Commission for Discipline Inspection subsequently intervened in the investigation, and the person in charge of the agency was also punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Chenzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection pointed out that from 2013 to 2022, Li Junhong took advantage of his position as deputy director and director of the Technical Equipment Department of the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau to facilitate others. Undertaken primary and secondary schools uniform business, school laboratories, facilities and equipment and installation service procurement and other projects to provide assistance, illegally receiving other people&#39;s property totaling 2.448 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, Li Junhong was expelled from the party and dismissed from public office. Suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being punished, the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau took rectification measures. The above-mentioned staff stated that the Education Bureau, together with the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and the Municipal Supervision Bureau, issued a notice on further standardizing the management of primary and secondary school uniforms on September 15, 2021, emphasizing that all documents and materials for the selection and purchase of school uniforms should be archived by the school. School uniforms Procurement contracts must be filed with the competent education department, and transactions shall not be interfered with by violating market principles or by fixing trademarks or other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, a monopoly case involving the Health Bureau of Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province is also worthy of attention. At the end of October 2021, relevant companies in the county jointly reported that the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed an agreement with a company to issue mandatory target tasks for drug procurement by county-affiliated public medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An investigation by the Hunan Market Supervision Bureau found that Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed a cooperation agreement with Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., requiring all public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to A certain proportion of the purchase volume of medicines, consumables, equipment, etc. is provided to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., and the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau also issues quotas in the form of documents to public medical institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The agreement also stipulates that from July 2021 to the end of 2022, the total purchase quota from public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd. is 1.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the person in charge of the Essential Drugs Unit of Shuangfeng County Health Bureau who is responsible for drug procurement and asked about the whole story. The other party said, &quot;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, antitrust is often closely related to anti-corruption. Some companies rack their brains to maintain relationships with officials with decision-making power, waiting for the time to mature. , they will require the other party to formulate rules to protect their interests, such as granting exclusive business rights, or giving opportunities in policy preferences, incentives and subsidies, and bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This also means that some market entities will also push administrative agencies to abuse administrative power.&quot; Sun Jin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The harm of administrative monopoly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to the economy Sexual monopoly and administrative monopoly rarely come into public view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing believes that on the one hand, there are indeed fewer cases of administrative monopoly than economic monopoly cases; on the other hand, administrative monopoly is mainly ordered to correct and punished by superior authorities. The focus is on punishing supervisors or other responsible personnel in accordance with the law, and the punishment information does not belong to the content that must be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;But administrative monopoly is more harmful than economic monopoly.&quot; Chen Bing explained that administrative monopoly sets unreasonable entry barriers, causing market Fragmentation and misallocation of resources prevent other operators from making full use of their own advantages to participate in competition. In the long run, this will reduce the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of all enterprises in the market, and at the same time reduce the total social welfare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin believes that for anti-monopoly law enforcement agencies, anti-economic monopoly is mainly a technical issue, and it is not difficult to judge whether it has substantially hindered fair market competition. Not big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He emphasized that the hard nut of anti-monopoly is actually administrative monopoly. At present, abuse of power still occurs from time to time, and it is still very serious in some areas. In addition, in administrative monopolies, there is a large amount of interest transfer, and some companies gain unfair competitive advantages, suppress small and medium-sized enterprises, and compete for their profit opportunities. This is contrary to common prosperity, high-quality development, and the construction of a unified national market. Anti-administrative monopoly has always been the top priority of anti-monopoly work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that on August 1, 2022, the first day the new Anti-Monopoly Law came into effect, Gan Lin, Director of the State Anti-Monopoly Bureau, published an article in the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; The signed article mentioned that &quot;we must insist on equal emphasis on preventing market monopoly and breaking administrative monopoly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the 2023 National Market Supervision System Anti-Monopoly Work Conference, anti-administrative monopoly is also the focus of the 2023 work goals, including strengthening the supply of fair competition review systems , studying and drafting the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations (Draft)&quot;, etc. At present, the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations&quot; have been publicly solicited for opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the 15 years since the Anti-Monopoly Law was implemented, the fair competition review mechanism has been an important part of the anti-administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2016, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System in the Construction of the Market System&quot;, emphasizing standardizing government behavior and establishing a fair competition review system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A landmark node is that the State Administration for Market Regulation was officially listed in April 2018 and began to assume unified anti-monopoly law enforcement responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, the Anti-Monopoly Law was revised for the first time after its promulgation. The chapter involving anti-administrative monopoly added a fair competition review system. &quot;This is equivalent to controlling the situation from the source and reducing the impact of policies formulated by administrative agencies on market competition,&quot; Chen Bing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Breaking down regional barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant regulations and policies are constantly evolving While improving, anti-administrative monopoly law enforcement has also been continuously strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The special anti-administrative monopoly action in 2022 is not the first time. From September 2019 to January 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out special actions nationwide to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement, focusing on transportation, construction, medicine, official seal engraving, bidding and government procurement5 an area where there are many illegal activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the special operation, the market supervision department investigated more than 50 cases in the above five fields and verified more than 80 case clues. However, no typical cases were announced to the public at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the State Administration for Market Regulation has published an annual report on antitrust enforcement every year since its establishment. The report shows that from 2019 to 2022, law enforcement agencies investigated a total of 354 cases of abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition, and concluded 198 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the numbers of such cases investigated from 2019 to 2021 were 84, 98, and 80 respectively, and the numbers settled were 12, 67, and 46 respectively. The State Administration for Market Regulation launched a special law enforcement action on the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition in 2022, investigating a total of 92 cases and settling 73 cases. The number of settlements increased by 59% compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In contrast, in the eleven years from 2008 to 2018, antitrust law enforcement agencies investigated and dealt with a total of 223 such cases, with an average of approximately 20 cases; and in the four years from 2019 to 2022, the average was 88 cases per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fair competition review system is also constantly being implemented and promoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the fair competition review system achieved full coverage of the national, provincial, municipal, and county governments. As of the end of 2020, a total of 857,000 newly issued policies had been reviewed across the country, and more than 4,100 policy measures that violated review standards were discovered and corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022 alone, various regions and departments will review 163,700 newly issued policies and measures, clean up 452,000 existing policies and measures of various types, and abolish, revise, and correct There are more than 20,000 policies and measures to eliminate or restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, these policy documents that may affect fair competition in the market have not been issued because they have not passed the fair competition review, or previously issued documents have been abolished because they have not passed the review. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, the anti-administrative monopoly work has a long way to go, and there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to break down local protection and regional barriers, thoroughly clean up policies and practices that hinder market access and the free circulation of commodity factors, and reduce institutional Transaction costs are the key to breaking down barriers that restrict economic circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, it is necessary to continuously regulate the interference of administrative power in market competition, &quot;especially in the fields of bidding, government procurement, public utilities and other fields, to prevent designated transactions , discriminatory conditions and other unfair behaviors, allowing local governments to effectively form an integrated competition protection mechanism of &#39;pre-examination + in-process and post-event supervision&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, consciousness and concepts are the core issues. He believes that antitrust laws need to be popularized among government officials so that they can make scientific, reasonable and legal decisions based on the provisions of antitrust laws and fair competition review systems. “Consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises also need to be mobilized to supervise the government, and all parties can work together to promote An ecology of fair competition.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[跨国药企扎堆进博会，多款创新药首秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260172]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被传收购碧桂园？中国平安回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260182]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 09:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 8, foreign media reported the news of Ping An’s acquisition of Country Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257517&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ping An issued a statement saying that the company has noticed a news report published by Reuters about the company being required by relevant government departments/institutions to acquire Country Garden Holdings Co., Ltd. and inherit its debts.

On the morning of October 21, 2023, local time in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation watched the Shaolin Kungfu report performance of Bolivian Shaolin disciples and interacted on the spot. While in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation also visited the South American Shaolin Cultural Center, Bolivia Baoen Temple and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, a video on Weibo of a young black monk practicing Shaolin Kung Fu also sparked heated discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the young monk boxing in the video black, but the master is also black. This is a branch of the Shaolin Temple in Africa. Some people say that this is the flowering of Chinese culture within the wall and the loss of culture; the Shaolin Temple is becoming more and more international, making people feel that it has lost its original flavor. This view is of course wrong, and someone has refuted it very well: once it is exported, it will be lost, and if it is not exported, it will be criticized as cultural weakness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shaolin Temple has been engaged in systematic cultural dissemination, forming many practice platforms that influence and disseminate Shaolin Kungfu and its culture, and building a global dissemination mechanism centered on Shaolin culture at home and abroad. It has had a huge social impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2001, Shaolin layman &quot;foreign disciple&quot; Deller opened the Shaolin Cultural Center in Berlin, Germany. This was the first overseas branch directly authorized to cooperate with the Shaolin Temple. Currently, there are nearly 200 overseas Shaolin cultural centers distributed around the world. According to data from relevant institutions, there are no less than 60 million people practicing Shaolin Kung Fu around the world; there are hundreds of Shaolin cultural institutions in more than 100 countries and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was established in Vienna; in 2004, the California House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution and established in law March 21 of each year as &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot;. In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was announced in Vienna, Austria; in 2011, the &quot;Shaolin North American Federation&quot; was established in Los Angeles, the United States. In 2014, the 10th anniversary of the establishment of &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot; in California, the then US President Obama said in his congratulatory message: &quot;Shaolin culture can provide us with spiritual space and help us cultivate a strong sense of social responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shaolin Temple recruits foreign disciples and even goes out to build temples and Kung Fu training classes, which can not only promote Buddhism, but also Shaolin Kung Fu and spread Chinese culture. Shaolin Temple is the place where Patriarch Bodhidharma stayed the longest after he came to China. It is known as the ancestral palace of Zen Buddhism. Zen Buddhism absorbs a large amount of ideological content from Confucianism and Taoism, turning foreign Buddhism into a Chinese Buddhism that corresponds to China&#39;s specific social and historical conditions and ideological and cultural background. Therefore, Zen Buddhism has realized the transformation from the Sinicization of Buddhism to Sinicized Buddhism and is rich in profound Chinese cultural elements. Shaolin Kung Fu and Shaolin Temple have gone global, and Chinese culture has also expanded its influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although black young monks and black abbots seem to be inconsistent, it is just because they are not used to it. It should be pointed out that the process of cultural export, success and acceptance cannot remain unchanged. It will also change and alienate according to local social, cultural, technological, economic, moral, conceptual and other factors, forming new ones to some extent. culture. We must maintain a tolerant attitude toward such changes and mutations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the influence of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is growing, and many countries and regions have designated the Chinese New Year as a legal holiday. There will be a holiday on this day, and national and regional leaders will extend holiday greetings to those celebrating the Spring Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the international context, the Chinese New Year is often written as: Chinese new year. &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot; is translated as &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot;, indicating that this New Year comes from the Chinese calendar. However, with the growing influence of the Spring Festival, there is now a trend to translate the Spring Festival into &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;. Lunar means &quot;moon&quot; and can be understood as &quot;lunar calendar&quot;. Nowadays, many people use it this way. US officials use &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; when issuing New Year greetings. United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also used &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; in his New Year greeting video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that this is an attempt to de-Sinicize the Spring Festival and steal a Chinese festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don’t have to look at it this way. This is the normal state of cultural export. The Romans originally used the Egyptian lunar calendar. In 46 BC, Roman commander Julius Caesar decided to recompile the Julian Calendar based on the Egyptian solar calendar. In 325 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine established the Julian calendar as the Christian calendar. By the 6th century AD, Christians regarded the day when Jesus, the founder of Christian legends, was born more than 500 years ago as the first year of AD. Before the 16th century, most Western countries adopted the Julian calendar. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII, with the assistance of the Neapolitan astronomer and physicist Giraldi and the German mathematician and Jesuit Clavius, corrected the Julian calendar promulgated in 46 BC. Errors formed the Gregorian calendar commonly used in our modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Revolution of 1911, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China legislated to use the Gregorian calendar from January 1, 1912, and designated January 1 of the Gregorian calendar as the &quot;New Year&quot;. This is now recognized around the world as the starting point of the new year. However, now everyone in the world can only say &quot;Happy New Year&quot; but not &quot;Happy Roman New Year&quot;. This is not stealing a holiday from the Romans or Christians, but a normal process of cultural export. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many countries in Asia also celebrate the Lunar New Year, such as South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.如果站在他们的角度，也许不愿带上有“中国的”这种明显地域化的名称，所以他们就会用“Happy Lunar New Year”来表达“春节快乐”，这就如同中国人不会说“罗马新年快乐”一样，但又有什么关系呢？这一历法就是从中国传出去的。传统时代朝贡体系之下，中国的皇朝会颁历法，让周边属国“奉正朔”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，不管是非洲黑人少林寺弟子，还是被称为“农历新年”，都是真真切切的文化输出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这又是一起“开门杀”案件。南方周末记者搜索相关裁判文书网发现，近年来，“开门杀”事故高频出现。中国交通运输协会法律工作委员会秘书长代现峰认为，随着私家车和非机动车辆的大幅度增长，大众普遍缺乏对“开门杀”危害的认知，导致这类事故频发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;代现峰告诉南方周末记者，开门杀主要分为两种类型：一种是司机本人开车门，与非机动车辆相撞，此时司机负全责；另一种是乘客开车门，与非机动车辆相撞，一般乘客会与司机构成共同侵权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后一种情况又可细分出不同的事故类型，最终赔偿责任也会不同。常见的两种情形是：司机与乘客存在运营关系，例如出租车、网约车等载客行为；司机与乘客系朋友或亲戚关系，不存在运营关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;开门杀&#39;是交通事故中的一个热点话题，杀伤力很强，其责任认定也一直都有争议。”常年代理交通事故案件的资深律师周波补充，目前中国各地的交管部门在认定“开门杀”事故责任时，尚缺乏统一的认定标准。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;网约车平台承担什么责任&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2020年11月3日18点，正值下班时间，39岁的张赫在非机动车道骑电动车回家路上，与一辆刚刚推开车门的网约车相撞，导致张赫重伤，昏迷不醒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事发上海市松江区中山二路。相关判决书显示，网约车司机夏某林完成一单出行任务后，临时停车未将车辆紧靠道路右侧，且未提醒乘客方某昕观察后方道路来车情况，方某昕打开右侧车门，导致了张赫受伤的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我老公现在连老爸、老妈和儿子的名字都不记得，他自己的名字也不记得了。”张赫妻子告诉南方周末记者，张赫原本是家里的顶梁柱，因为这场车祸导致颅脑损伤构成十级残疾，治疗至今未愈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经上海市公安局松江分局交通警察支队认定，司机夏某林承担事故主要责任，乘客方某昕承担次要责任，张赫无责。后法院判决，司机、乘客二人构成共同侵权。其中，司机的赔偿比例为70%，赔偿82万元；乘客的赔偿比例为30%，35万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“交通部门会先出一份事故责任认定书，认定司机与乘客的主次责任。之后法庭在审判时会根据该责任认定书判决。”代现峰告诉南方周末记者，交通部门出具的责任认定书，不会将司机与乘客的责任明确到具体的比例划分，至于最终法庭如何划分主次要责任比例，属于人民法院行使裁量权的范围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，上述案件的判决书显示，夏某林使用私家车实际并不具备营运车辆相关保险，其网约车平台滴滴出行公司未尽到应有的审核职责；且滴滴作为平台和夏某林共同分享收益，承担风险，保障运营安全，都算是乘客的承运人。所以滴滴依法应对伤者遭受的损失与司机夏某林承担连带责任，共同赔偿82万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不论这辆网约车有没有营运车辆相关资质，司机接单都算是执行职务行为。可能司机并不是滴滴的员工，但在法律上只要有执行工作任务的行为，平台就有责任。”代现峰说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《网络预约出租汽车经营服务管理暂行办法》第十六条规定：“网约车平台公司承担承运人责任，应当保证运营安全，保障乘客合法权益。”中国民法典也有相关规定，要求网约车平台承担司机与乘客之间运输合同项下承运人的责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就意味着，在面向广大消费者时，运输合同项下，原属司机的承运人职责及赔偿义务，很大程度上可能由网约车平台承担。同理，出租车司机与出租车公司也是如此。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果乘客推开车门导致“车门杀”，但司机已经尽到提醒义务，还需要承担责任吗？代现峰告诉南方周末记者：“除非乘客故意，否则司机依然需要承担一定的事故责任，司机背后有平台或保险公司，其赔偿能力更强，让受害人依法拿到赔偿才是法律的实质公平。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但并非所有情形都要机动车车主担责。周波向南方周末记者补充，如果车辆合规停靠在路边打开车门，因非机动车辆逆行或其它自身原因导致“开门杀”伤亡事故，交管部门也可能会认定非机动车承担主要甚至全部责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;保险应认车，还是认人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;周波告诉南方周末记者，在乘客导致的“开门杀”案件中，备受争议的环节主要有两个：一个是前端的交管部门如何认定司机与乘客的主次责任；另一个是车辆投保的保险公司，是否应该代乘客赔偿？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“最关键的环节是前端责任认定，什么情况下乘客应该承担责任，怎么划分主次责任，以及什么情况下不需要乘客承担责任。”周波告诉南方周末记者，交管部门责任认定的方式和标准目前尚不统一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年，在周波代理的“开门杀”案件中，各地交警认定标准不一，这也直接影响了最终庭审判决。例如，同为乘客开门，有的交警认为乘客和司机是一体的，同为侵权人；也有交警认定司机应负全责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，一份2020年公开的判决书显示，广西罗城县发生一起“开门杀”事故后，当地交警部门就案涉事故出具的《道路交通事故认定书》认定，乘客在开关车门时妨碍其他车辆通行，承担本次交通事故的全部责任，司机无责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;代现峰介绍，一般情况下，法庭的判决结果会与交通部门出具的事故责任认定书相符，除非有其它相反的直接证据足以推翻责任认定书。“一方面，从专业角度讲，法官不比交警更擅长处理交通事故；另一方面，国家机关出具的证据证明力比其它一般证据证明力要高。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果司机负全责，反而不会有太大争议，因为最后由保险公司赔钱。但如果定了乘客承担责任，就存在争议了。”周波介绍，当乘客被认定担责时，主要争议点就会变成：车辆投保的保险公司该不该承担乘客的责任？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者查询多份裁判文书发现，当司机与主动开门的乘客不存在营运关系，而是亲戚或朋友时，多位司机会主张自己负全责。其原因在于，司机作为车主，均有购买交强险或商业三者险，保险公司可以代其赔偿。也正因如此，在该类“开门杀”案件中，保险公司与案件侵权人之间的官司层出不穷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月，北京市丰台区发生一起“开门杀”事故，车主张某艳与推开车门的乘客马某双系朋友关系。经丰台交通支队丰北大队处理认定，该案中车主和乘客负事故同等责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在法庭上，车主张某艳辩称自己未尽提醒义务，应负全责。乘客马某双亦提出，没有车辆就没有自己下车的行为，保险公司应认准投保的车辆，而非细究导致车辆发生事故的人。保险公司则辩称，公司只承担投保车主张某艳的应赔金额，即按50%的比例赔偿，且不认可张某艳承担全责。其称：“根据保险法，张某艳违反诚信原则，主动加重自己的责任，导致我司可能发生过多的赔偿，我司保留追究其二人保险诈骗的权利。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终法院判决，保险公司应当基于车主与乘客的连带赔偿责任，对伤者的各项损失在保险责任范围内承担赔偿责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者发现，此类“开门杀”案件中，最终由保险公司代乘客赔偿的判决诸多。在前述罗城县的“开门杀”案件中，虽然法院判决乘客负全责，但最终对伤者的赔偿由涉案车辆投保的保险公司代赔。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保险公司一般都会抗辩。他们认为保险赔偿是针对投保的车主，一旦开车的人不是车主，都不应该赔偿。但这个答辩意见只能说有一定道理，法院常常不采纳。”周波称，目前，保险合同本身关于这方面的免责条款本不明确，不同的人会有不同理解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，已有部分网约车平台和出租车公司要求乘客开右边车门上下车，作为预防“开门杀”的一种措施。代现峰认为，有必要针对学员加强“开门杀”的相关教育宣传：“我认为在考驾照时，&#39;开门杀&#39;也应当作为重点内容培训。我们汽车起步前和停车后都会要求看反光镜，但没有直接针对&#39;开门杀&#39;进行培训。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

Most foreign bank mortgage loans have fixed interest rates. Why is it different? What is its background? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Most foreign mortgage interest rates are fixed interest rates, while our country’s mortgage loans have quasi-floating interest rates, that is, they are not completely floating. There is an essential difference between the two. In the past, after the central bank adjusted interest rates, existing mortgage interest rates were not adjusted immediately, and were often adjusted accordingly the following year. In other words, the central bank can adjust the interest rate multiple times within a year, but the borrower&#39;s mortgage interest rate remains basically unchanged within a year and can only start to adjust on January 1 of the following year. Therefore, it is not a fully floating interest rate but a quasi-floating interest rate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the development of the banking system, the primary purpose of various policies was to make banks grow and grow, and to reduce bank capital operation risks. The choice of a floating rate form stems from banking tradition. Fixed-rate mortgages are lower risk for the borrower but higher risk for the bank. In the past two years, some reforms have been made to mortgage interest rates. Borrowers can choose fixed interest rates or floating interest rates. However, existing housing loans still account for the majority. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We also found through research that the balance of domestic housing mortgage loans is huge, but Mortgage asset securitization (MBS) has developed slowly since its inception in 2006. In the first half of 2023, there will be zero issuance of RMBS. This is also very different from the mortgage business in developed countries. Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four reasons for the slow progress of domestic mortgage asset securitization. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, mortgage asset securitization is an imported product.美国的MBS等房贷证券化工具，上个世纪70年代已经发达了。 China&#39;s housing loan market developed relatively late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, domestic mortgage asset securitization started in 2006, just as the U.S. real estate bubble began to burst. The following year, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis triggered a chain reaction of MBS defaults and credit derivatives such as CDO and CDS, which eventually led to the 2008 global financial crisis. The external crisis requires us to re-understand the pros and cons of mortgage securitization. For regulatory agencies, a more cautious approach has been chosen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, mortgage asset securitization is a financial derivative. China has always been cautious about the development of financial derivatives because derivatives are highly leveraged and risky. Domestic laws on futures and derivatives were promulgated many years after the subprime mortgage crisis broke out, and did not include credit derivatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, over the past 20 years, my country’s commercial housing market has experienced a process of development and regulation of relaxation-tightening-relaxation-retightening-relaxation again. Maintain strict control over the financing of the real estate market through asset management products such as credit and trust to prevent the real estate market from overheating. Mortgage asset securitization is an important means of real estate financing and will also be strictly controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think it is possible to accelerate the implementation of asset securitization to activate the market? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Activating the real estate market through MBS is an option. my country&#39;s real estate credit market is an issue and hold model. If mortgage assets are securitized, banks can package the mortgages and sell them through securitization, and brokers can then distribute them to institutional investors including funds. The final investor may be an individual or a business. Mortgage risk is thus dispersed.银行也因此获得更多流动性。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mortgage asset securitization is a double-edged sword. Because it has high leverage, if there is any disturbance or unfavorable situation, the impact it will have will be huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, mortgage securitization is indeed a direction. However, I believe that the risks are relatively high, the supporting systems and regulatory measures are still weak, and it should not develop too fast. Especially in the current situation where risk prevention is the keynote, it is even more unsuitable to launch. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Need to shift to intensive&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;development&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Under the counter-cyclical situation, the profits of the banking industry generally increased slightly and even the profits of individual banks dropped sharply, and the provision coverage ratio and capital adequacy ratio both declined. The 2023 interim reports of various banks revealed this group signal. However, under the current capital market conditions, refinancing on the stock market is difficult to achieve. How do you think banks can replenish core capital at this stage? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Commercial banks can replenish their first-tier core capital by issuing common shares, increasing capital from existing shareholders, or issuing additional shares. In addition, endogenous funds are also important channels. Such as retained profits, other comprehensive income and risk reserves, etc. This is to make &quot;blood&quot; by oneself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listed banks are the &quot;outstanding elements&quot; among banks. There are more than 4,000 small and medium-sized banks that cannot replenish capital through the stock market and can only increase capital through targeted capital increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks mainly issue subordinated bonds, preferred stocks and perpetual bonds to supplement secondary capital. However, the threshold for issuance of perpetual bonds and subordinated bonds is relatively high, and not all thousands of small and medium-sized banks are eligible. In addition, the issuance of special bonds by local governments is also an important means to supplement the capital of small and medium-sized banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You just mentioned that endogenous funds are also very important. How do most banks get rid of the predicament of becoming increasingly dependent on external financing as they develop? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the past few decades, the scale of the banking industry has expanded rapidly and interest rates have been earned. In recent years, both the return on assets and the return on capital have been declining, and companies can only &quot;win&quot; by relying on scale. Large scale, low efficiency, and rapid capital consumption. If you cannot support the rapid expansion of asset scale by relying on your own &quot;blood production&quot;, you must rely on more external financing to replenish capital. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To completely get rid of this predicament, banks need to conduct refined operations on existing assets and earn more profits with the same asset scale, rather than simply increasing absolute profits by increasing scale. Extensive way. The core is to shift from the current extensive development model that emphasizes scale to an intensive development model that emphasizes efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, interest rate spreads have fallen to historic lows, and the financial sustainability of bank operations is in doubt. When the current scale remains unchanged or even continues to decline, banks must find ways to be more refined and detailed, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, especially to reduce management fees and other costs. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of fund utilization. For example, adjust the direction of loan investment, make more efforts in the financial market, and do more financial market business. In addition, efforts need to be made to improve risk control levels and reduce bad debt costs and risk losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now digital finance has become the transformation path for banks, and it is also the only way to achieve inclusive finance. You also had similar views in the &quot;2023 China Banking Industry Ranking Top 200 Research Report&quot; published by &quot;Tsinghua Financial Review&quot;. You also believe that when financial institutions build underlying business logic in accordance with the genetic requirements of the Internet, they need to break the internal data barriers of the institution and make comprehensive adjustments to the working mechanism. In this process, banks are bound to be exposed to many risks. What do you think is the underlying business logic of banks’ Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The core of bank digital transformation lies in data connectivity. At the same time, the organizational structure and top-level design must be reconstructed according to Internet thinking. There will be many challenges and risks involved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there are many obstacles in data connection. A bank is a behemoth that involves many businesses, institutions, personnel, and outlets, and the phenomenon of data islands is serious. This is especially true for large banks, where it is difficult to integrate data between head offices and branches, between various departments of the head office, and even between departments within the same department. In addition to breaking through internal data barriers and breaking down information islands, it is also necessary to achieve safe and standardized connections with external data such as government data, corporate data, alternative Internet data, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always held the view that the banks of the future will be technology companies with banking licenses. It requires data, scenarios, and technology, that is, &quot;no data, no finance&quot;, &quot;no scenario, no finance&quot;, &quot;no technology, no finance&quot;. This is the Trinity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, in order to open up external data, banks need to build some scenarios themselves and have the ability to continuously generate new data. Therefore, establishing the scene is particularly important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banks need to pay attention to this matter from the top-level design and reconstruct the business logic structure and organizational structure that are different from traditional banks in the past. The difficulty is that traditional genes may eat away at Internet genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the traditional business of banks is still strong - the Internet business is still &quot;Sesame&quot;, and the traditional business is still &quot;Watermelon&quot;. However, in the future, the Internet business will grow into a &quot;watermelon&quot; and the traditional business will gradually shrink into a &quot;sesame&quot;. Due to operating pressure, traditional businesses still have to pay attention. &quot;Sesame&quot; cannot become &quot;watermelon&quot; overnight. It requires a process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform must not only prevent some new businesses from being cannibalized by traditional businesses, but also prevent traditional businesses from simply being moved online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the recruitment situation this autumn, most bank IT R&amp;D positions Hiring is down. This may be related to the rise of large model technology. Some banks’ fintech strategies are shifting from building their own intelligent customer service systems to cooperating with external technology platforms. What do you think of this phenomenon? Will outsourcing financial technology business bring greater risks to banks? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Outsourcing has advantages and risks, and different organizations should have different choices. Large and medium-sized banks should maintain their core technologies and avoid relying on outsourcing institutions; while small and medium-sized banks can consider outsourcing part of their business or cooperate with other platform companies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on external institutions can quickly solve the bank&#39;s current problems. In the long run, over-reliance on outsourcing institutions and platforms and loss of opportunities to develop internal skills is the biggest risk, followed by the risk of data security. The reason is that relying on outsourcing makes it difficult for banks to establish solid core technical capabilities over time. This is particularly important for large banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the long run, banks, especially large banks, will still have to build their own systems. Core competitiveness cannot be shaped through outsourcing. It is a long-term solution for large banks to improve their internal capabilities. For some small banks, they can choose to outsource most of their businesses to build their core competitiveness in other aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Test the equity market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Establish a high-level &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;investment research team&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Yes Important matters&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The bank’s financial management subsidiary is testing the waters of equity financial management The product is 3 years old, but generally performs poorly.

What do you think of this phenomenon? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After the new regulations on asset management, the development model of bank financial management has undergone fundamental changes.

It is difficult for wealth management subsidiaries to cooperate with fund companies under the parent bank because competition between the two outweighs cooperation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the incentive mechanism and salary levels of financial management subsidiaries are a major shortcoming. Subject to salary distribution constraints, the salary levels of wealth management subsidiaries of major state-owned banks are significantly lower than those of public funds. This is a great constraint on building a high-level investment research team. A breakthrough is needed in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[串标围标在工程建设等领域多发；招标方设租寻租不容忽视丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260146]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate released a number of typical cases on the official website of punishing the crime of collusive bidding in accordance with the law. The relevant person in charge of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate said that in recent years, problems in the bidding process have become prominent. In many fields such as engineering construction and equipment procurement, illegal and criminal cases such as collusion in bidding, bribery, and bribery have occurred frequently, causing hidden dangers to project quality and safety management and seriously disrupting Market Order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tendering is a procurement method used in some large-scale projects. In theory, tendering is a means to promote competition, especially public tendering. From the perspective of a tenderer, let your procurement needs reach more potential suppliers and promote competition among them as much as possible so that you can buy the best goods, services, etc. with the least money. For bidders, through public bidding channels, they can learn more about business opportunities, participate in competition, and win business through strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, national regulations stipulate that some specific projects must identify suppliers through public bidding. For example, the Government Procurement Law stipulates that government procurement projects of goods and services above a certain amount (the specific amount is uniformly stipulated by the provincial level, and many provinces set it as more than 2 million yuan) must be publicly tendered. Relevant construction law rules stipulate that if the estimated price of a single construction contract for housing construction and municipal infrastructure projects is more than 2 million yuan, or the total project investment is more than 30 million yuan, bidding must be conducted, all of which use state-owned funds or state-owned funds. Those holding a controlling or dominant position must invite public bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if multiple bidders or even tenderers collude with each other and collude in bidding, the bidding will become a cover to hide the public and fail to achieve the purpose of bidding. For example, in a typical case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate this time, an information technology project of a certain unit was openly tendered to the public. Two companies colluded in the bidding. As a result, the winning bid price of the project was more than 35 million yuan, which was far higher than the actual cost. Such a result has caused serious losses to the bidding unit. In addition, collusive bidding by multiple suppliers will also affect market competition. Some bidders even bribe bid evaluation committee members to give their bids high marks in order to win the bid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases of bid-rigging, the tenderer may not know about it, but the bidders collude with each other to raise the price and obtain more benefits. However, there are also many cases of bid-rigging. The staff of the bidding unit are not only informed, but they may even actively collude with the bidders to raise the price, or give the project to a designated bidder to benefit themselves. As for other companies participating in the bidding, they only &quot;accompany the bidding&quot; to meet the requirement of multiple suppliers participating in the bidding. In fact, the contents of their bid documents are worse than those of the designated bidders, and it is impossible to win the bid. They appear just to cooperate in acting and get a little &quot;accompanying fee&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is undoubtedly rent-seeking, bribery and bribery. If the bidding unit is a state-owned enterprise or even a government agency or public institution, it will be suspected of bribery by public officials. Even if the bidding unit is a private enterprise, collusion in bidding will also constitute crimes such as job embezzlement and bribery of non-state personnel. The bidder paid bribes. The corruption behind this rent-seeking is quite astonishing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Zhejiang Daily&quot; once reported that Zhu Zhixiang, the former chairman of Shaoxing Urban Investment Group, as the main person in charge of the bidding unit, colluded with others and the bidders during the bidding process of relevant projects. , the total winning bid amount of the bidders reached more than 4.42 billion yuan. In April 2023, Zhu Zhixiang was sentenced to eleven years and six months in the first instance for bribery and bid collusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in some fields, bid-rigging and collusion have formed a complete industrial chain. Some practitioners do not have relevant qualifications themselves, so they &quot;affiliate&quot; with qualified units. The affiliated units charge a certain percentage of the winning bid amount as a &quot;management fee&quot; and share the profits from the winning bid. There are also professional scalpers and engineering brokers who specialize in bid-rigging. They have great powers, and some may be related to the tendering party, and some can even obtain the contact information of bid evaluation experts in time and bribe them. There are also &quot;hackers&quot; who can invade the bid evaluation expert database and provide them with expert lists and contact information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang police once uncovered a company with only nine employees and no construction team, but it repeatedly won bids for large engineering projects. In just two years, it participated in a total of 338 bids for engineering projects. The investigation found that this is a professional bid-rigging gang. After winning the bid, they illegally sell the project and profit from it. These engineering projects are stripped down and subcontracted at many levels. Not only will the project cost increase, but the quality of the project will also be difficult to guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the latest criminal prosecution standards formulated by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security in 2022, collusion in bidding, the winning amount of the bid is more than 4 million yuan, the illegal income is more than 200,000 yuan, or threats, deception, bribery By using other means, colluding in bidding multiple times, etc., they are all suspected of committing the crime of colluding in bidding, and a case should be filed and prosecuted.尤其对于涉及招标方内部人员的招标寻租和腐败，更要严厉打击，以维护公正的市场秩序。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[允许博士生分流转为硕士，你支持吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260095]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
