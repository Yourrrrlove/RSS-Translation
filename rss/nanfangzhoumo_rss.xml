He said: &quot;Learning in rural areas I understand that English is difficult, but if you put it through for a while, you will get through it, right? Maybe your oral expression is not that good, but you can do it if you have the ability to recognize words.&quot; This statement is quite pertinent to some of the popular opinions in the market. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be stated that whether a subject is useful to an individual&#39;s daily life cannot be used as a criterion for whether to enter a school for students to study. When it comes to the usefulness of daily life, how useful are physics, chemistry, history, and geography? It is enough to be able to calculate accounts and write in the third grade of primary school. Comparatively speaking, with the improvement of public education and the expansion of international exchanges, English has become more and more closely integrated with daily life: English is used when looking up certain knowledge and technologies, reading product manuals, and traveling abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wikipedia information shows that as of March 25, 2020, W3Techs predicts that among the percentage of languages ​​used by the top one million Internet websites, English accounts for 59.3%. Chinese is 1.3%. Being more familiar with English is very useful for a person to increase his knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a national level, to a large extent, Chinese people learn foreign languages ​​to learn advanced foreign technologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any teaching is a pyramid-shaped screening system. China has a huge sports school system, which begins to discover and transport talents for sports from the elementary school level. This is the basis for Chinese athletes to win trophies in various competitions. Similarly, only if everyone starts learning addition and subtraction from the first grade, and then learns Newton&#39;s three laws in junior middle school, conservation of momentum, and the law of conservation of mechanical energy in high school, then there will be one in a hundred thousand or one in a million Mathematical Olympiad champions and Nobel laureates. Winner of the Bell Prize in Physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is true for English. Only by starting to learn it in elementary school and taking English exams in college can we select the most cutting-edge people who are proficient in English and can engage in various researches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that you should learn English wherever necessary. Top talents can just learn English well. However, in elementary school, middle school and high school, no one could predict what would happen later. If the school system gives a signal that English is not important, and the college entrance examination succumbs to this trend and reduces the proportion of English, it will inevitably affect high school students’ attitude and enthusiasm for English learning. If high school students generally have poor English foundation, it will inevitably affect the overall English level of undergraduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some schools, some subjects for undergraduate students are taught in English, which is conducive to improving students&#39; professional English level and thus helping to keep up with the international advanced level. For example, if a Chinese scholar publishes an academic paper in a foreign journal, the most common language is English. During the publication process, foreign peer experts review the manuscript and give their opinions. Publication is a kind of recognition. This will help Chinese scholars in this field develop in the right technical direction. In fact, this is a process of technological diffusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if students generally have poor English after graduating from high school, English teaching will not be possible, and the possibility of publishing English papers abroad will become smaller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, technology diffusion does not only occur at the &quot;high level&quot; such as publishing papers and participating in international seminars. Technology diffusion and exchanges occur in all fields and levels of production. In many cases, such as The scenes we imagine are more down-to-earth and ordinary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, generative AI has become popular. The United States is leading in this area, and China is also accelerating to catch up. If you want to use foreign generative AI, you need language skills from network settings, registration, writing prompts, and learning skills. For example, when it comes to AI-generated images and videos, a graphics, home decoration, and poster designer who is proficient in English can do it faster than a designer who lacks language skills. The latter will not even come into contact with this new thing because the language is too difficult. This can give the former a lead of half a year, a year, or even a few years, which will win customers and eventually the advantage will be solidified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, if a small business owner who makes handicrafts can frequently visit foreign technology exchange websites, he will be able to discover many wonderful ideas. Sometimes technology diffusion is just a matter of &quot;taking a look.&quot; However, if he does not have a basic knowledge of English, he will not go to these websites at all. He has neither the ability to find these websites nor the consciousness to do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A very important reason why some people advocate learning less English or lowering English scores is that they think English is unfair to rural children. However, the paper &quot;Research on the LDFA Method and Its Application in Project Function Difference Analysis&quot;, based on the data of the National Education Examination Center, used a completely random sampling method to extract the English test scores of 2,500 people, and found that urban and rural areas have higher college entrance examination English scores. There is no significant difference, even in rural areas it is 0.45 points higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is unexpected, but it is reasonable. In fact, many studies have found that there is no need for English, especially test-oriented English. Language learning is nothing more than reading more, listening more, and memorizing more. Practice makes perfect. In the era of widespread smartphones, the cost of an English-speaking environment is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, no matter from the perspective of the meaning of individual life, the progress of national technology, or the fairness of urban and rural education, English learning should not be underestimated, so that our children can be exposed to and discover the larger world. It can broaden your horizons and improve your knowledge and skills in professional fields when you grow up. This will remain true at least for quite some time to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[专访编剧芦苇：好的电影都有社会意义]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257491]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 11/17/4KPKFBskeYDrgulnOVPH0EoLBcUkSvZLTvnf5oxp.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1460&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/4KPKFBskeYDrgulnOVPH0EoLBcUkSvZLTvnf5oxp . jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot;, etc. written by Lu Wei The film won awards at international film festivals such as Cannes and Berlin.

His daily contact is only through the phone. Over the years, he has become accustomed to I write with pen and paper and write one movie script a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-October 2022, he said goodbye to his relatives and friends in Xi&#39;an and took a flight to the United States via Guangzhou. In addition to visiting his son whom he had not seen for a long time, during this trip, he also had to collect information for the next script. &quot;One advantage of writing scripts in the United States is that it is quiet and no one disturbs me. Unlike here, for example, if there is an event, you can&#39;t go even if you don&#39;t go. They are all acquaintances and friends. If you don&#39;t go, people will feel presumptuous, and it is easy to give people a A misunderstanding occurred.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/E4P7jDSbckucwFf3kCK8HXCBhPw9w7CHhycwgDTD.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1415&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/E4P7jDSbckucwFf3kCK8HXCBhPw9w7CHhycwgDTD.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lu Wei poses with Zhang Yimou, Lu Le, and Zhao Jiping (from left to right). As screenwriters, directors, cameramen, and musicians, the four of them are top-notch actors in the industry. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among China&#39;s professional screenwriters, there are few who have the same connection with three generations of film history as Lu Wei The directors have all worked together and witnessed the ups and downs of Chinese cinema over the past four decades. In 1988, his first work as a screenwriter, &quot;The Price of Madness,&quot; became the box office champion of the year. Since then, a series of works such as &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot; have won awards at international film festivals such as Cannes and Berlin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before his departure, his study was a little messy. The walls and table were covered with large and small paintings and photographs. There was a note nailed to the wooden board against the wall, written in Lu Wei&#39;s handwriting: &quot;Make up your mind to write &quot;The Legend of the Seven Stars of the Swordsman&quot;! This is a key battle to fulfill your long-cherished wish. Go all out and never give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The multinational big-budget movie &quot;Wolf Totem&quot; released in 2015 After that, Lu Wei spent more of his creative energy on low-cost films, which gradually made him move away from the center of capital. In his view, movies have no big or small size, only good or bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is no retirement in the job of a screenwriter. Now I only write what I like and don&#39;t consider anything else.&quot; He told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Although the remuneration for small-cost films is low, it is not about money. Problem, the advantage is that there is no burden, and there is great freedom of choice. The level of attention is not a matter for me to consider, I only care about my script.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/RVm6I0pKoRHCUk9vemwHCwLUjTSDvhQkrC9ER3HY.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1402&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/22/11/17/RVm6I0pKoRHCUk9vemwHCwLUjTSDvhQkrC9ER3HY.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215552&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1995, Lu Wei and Jiang Wen (right ) during the filming of &quot;Song of Qin&quot; in Xi&#39;an. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Wei&#39;s latest screenwriter&#39;s Tibetan story &quot;Lausang Family Affair&quot; has not yet been released. I have finished writing a new martial arts-themed script &quot;The Legend of the Seven Stars of the Swordsman&quot;, and then I want to put the story of &quot;Barefoot Doctor&quot; Sun Lizhe on the screen to reflect the past of the &quot;educated youth&quot; generation. &quot;Sun Lizhe went to the countryside in northern Shaanxi from Beijing and saved many people by learning medical skills. Since it is difficult to see a doctor now, I wrote about Sun Lizhe as a way to look up to him. I hope that all Chinese doctors can become people like Sun Lizhe. The Chinese people will be blessed.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to his creations, Lu Wei’s public statements are also eye-catching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Chinese cinema, Lu Wei and his friend Wang Tianbing held a dialogue titled &quot;When will Chinese cinema grow up?&quot; and sharply criticized films including Zhang Yimou, Chinese directors including Jia Zhangke and Lou Ye think they don&#39;t know how to write stories and their themes are confusing. He was an outspoken critic of &quot;The Promise&quot; and parted ways with his old friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Lu Chuan&#39;s &quot;Nanjing!&quot; Nanjing! &quot;The King&#39;s Feast&quot; was severely criticized by Lu Wei. However, in 2013, when he attended the press conference of Lu Wei&#39;s new book &quot;Secrets of Film Screenwriters&quot;, he said: &quot;I was very confident at one time. I wrote the script according to the logic of commercial feature films and shot it.&quot; At that time, I was thinking about subversion. Fortunately, I met Lu Wei at the crossroads of my life. After having an in-depth chat with him, I felt that I was wrong at the time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/Ta0G4w0jM7lD47dWQsZBKrodMftFgHM2giAEsMzj.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/11/17/Ta0G4w0jM7lD47dWQsZBKrodMftFgHM2giAEsMzj.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215553&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; won gold After receiving the Palme d&#39;Or, director Chen Kaige (left) took a photo with Lu Wei. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/11/17/wxqP5AVXWMVEdnvQZH5Y4aipKbgEDI9rLDT4KG9a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1281&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11 /17/wxqP5AVXWMVEdnvQZH5Y4aipKbgEDI9rLDT4KG9a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215551&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1992, Lu Wei and Gong Li (right) in &quot;Farewell&quot; Ji&quot; studio. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luwei is greatly influenced by Hollywood movies and values ​​the watchability and social significance of movies. , has been working as a screenwriter for more than 30 years. He talks about the &quot;genre&quot; of movies more than the &quot;art&quot; of movies, and believes that there are no secrets to screenwriting. In the recently published book &quot;Film Screenwriters Have No Secrets&quot;, Lu Wei disclosed for the first time the detailed inside story of writing the script of &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. What surprised some fans is that this film is currently the only film to win the &quot;Palme d&#39;Or&quot; award at the Cannes Film Festival. Lu Wei&#39;s requirements for the scripts of Chinese-language films are that they must be &quot;typified&quot; and the stories must be good-looking, reasonable, and true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said: &quot;The title of the first book talks about the &#39;secrets&#39; of film screenwriters. I don&#39;t like it. I think there are no secrets for film screenwriters, they are just rules. The new book published this time I I just want to tell everyone this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, Southern Weekend reporters interviewed Lu Wei in Xi&#39;an. At that time, the most important &quot;National Day&quot; prime period of the year did not achieve the expected results. In terms of box office results, the Chinese mainland film market has rarely experienced a severe &quot;film shortage&quot; with only five new films being released in the entire month, and only three new films scheduled for release in November. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked about his views on new Chinese movies, he said: &quot;There are not many Chinese movie scripts that are qualified. Some movies are obviously script-problems. They require a lot of investment and effort, but the foundation is not good.&quot; Okay. The script is the foundation of the movie. If this foundation is not solid, the movie will definitely not be exciting.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I finished college in a movie theater&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You used to study art. You first entered Xi&#39;an Film Studio as an art artist. How did you later transform into a film screenwriter? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the beginning, I did not prepare to be a screenwriter in my life plan and ideals. Later I came into contact with movies and also worked in film art. One day I suddenly realized that script writing is also a kind of plastic art, which is connected with fine art. I used to paint with colors, but now I paint with words. The principle is the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was completely by chance that I entered Xiying Film Factory. When I was recruiting workers, I was told that there was such a company that was recruiting people, but the job type was probably a cook. Although I was not willing to be a cook, I thought this unit was good and related to art. I didn’t know anything about movies at that time, but I just thought I could get in touch with art, so I joined. I thought to myself that even if I was a cook, I would still have a chance in this unit. As a result, I didn’t even work as a cook for a day. People knew that I could draw. After seeing my paintings, they said, “No problem, you can become an artist.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To do film art, it is inevitable to have to deal with it. to a movie script, because the content of the script determines the content of your work. If you do a lot of art, you will be able to see the problems in the script, how the script should be written, and how to write it is interesting. At that time, there was a so-called youth film crew. All the creative staff, including art and photography, would meet together to discuss the scripts. I often gave comments to some scripts. Later, I made many comments, and sometimes the director used them to provoke me. Fa said, &quot;Then you write and say that this is not good and that is not good, then you can do it yourself.&quot; So I really did it myself. They also felt that the script that was written was better than the original one. This also gave me confidence that the original script could be written. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first work for which you were signed as a screenwriter was &quot;The Price of Madness&quot; directed by Zhou Xiaowen &quot;Well, this film was a sensation at the time and was the box office champion in 1988. But this is not the first time you have participated in screenwriting work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first one was &quot;They Are Young&quot;, but it failed. Wu Tianming was the director at the time, and he knew that I could write scripts. , pay more attention to me. Later I wrote &quot;The Last Madness&quot;, and that movie was somewhat well-received. It sold for a lot of money. Then I wrote &quot;The Price of Madness&quot;. At this time, I signed my name as the screenwriter. Wu Tianming was very supportive of me. I said, &quot;If you want to be a screenwriter, I will transfer you to the literature department. If you want to be a director, I will transfer you to the directing team. You can tell me what you want to do and I will support you.&quot; After hearing this, I felt that the director of the factory was treating me so favorably. I was very grateful to him, and I said I&#39;d better write a script. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you choose the screenwriter and director? Screenwriter, what&#39;s the difference between the two? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I know a lot about screenwriters, but I don’t know about directors. I think the screenwriter is the designer and the director is the construction engineer. It often happens that the engineer can&#39;t understand the designer&#39;s creativity, so he will change your drawings to what he wants, so the final product may be different from what the designer imagined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been a director and made a film called &quot;The Long Road to Xixia&quot;. I won the Golden Rooster Award for Best Director&#39;s Debut that year and also won several international awards. But I don’t think I’m a good director, and my directing business is not good. My nature is not suitable for being a director, and I really don&#39;t like to direct people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, with the progress of the film industry, the importance of screenwriters has Sexuality has gradually come to the fore. In addition to screenwriting majors offered in colleges and universities, screenwriting classes have also begun to appear in society. When you were young, there were few dedicated places to learn screenwriting. How did you improve yourself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just watching movies. Movies are different from other things. For science and engineering knowledge, it is best to receive systematic training. Movies are a very intuitive art. You can learn it by watching movies. Through analysis and research, you can become an expert. There is no need to learn. Not to mention attending a film college, I didn’t even have a complete education. I went to the countryside to work as a farmer in a mountain village in Baoji in the second grade of junior high school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am lucky because my father works in the People&#39;s Building in Xi&#39;an, which is a reception unit. He is the captain of the automobile team and is responsible for receiving some foreign experts and senior cadres. , so I had the opportunity to watch some foreign movies very early on, such as &quot;Quiet Don&quot;, &quot;Nights of Kabylia&quot;, and &quot;The Bicycle Thieves&quot;... In fact, the cinemas in the 1950s and 1960s were relatively abundant. Yes, it was not until the mid-1960s, when the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; was about to begin, that films began to be &quot;one size fits all&quot;. It was not until the late period of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; that some North Korean films began to come in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was making movies, it was still very difficult to watch movies. It gradually improved after 1980, when some foreign movies gradually came in, and it became easier to learn movies at that time. In addition to the convenience of working in the West Film Studio where you can watch some movies, Beijing has begun to hold events such as American Film Week and Spanish Film Week. At that time, a ticket cost about 25 cents, but it didn’t matter that you couldn’t buy it. I could only buy black market tickets, and some movie tickets could be sold for ten yuan. The salary at that time was very low, only thirty-six yuan, but I still wanted to see what I really wanted to see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many movies that impressed me deeply, such as &quot;General Patton&quot;, &quot;The Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, etc. At that time, I had to take a train from Xi&#39;an to Beijing, and there was no I had extra money to stay in a hotel, so I settled in a friend&#39;s house, and then bought black market tickets every day. &quot;Dark Horse&quot; directed by Ballard is about the friendship between a child and a black horse. I liked it very much and watched it five times in one go. At that time, watching movies was mainly about learning the look of the movie, writing down my thoughts, and building an understanding of the composition of the movie. I completed my college studies in the cinema. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reading is equally important in your career. In this special era, you You participated in a book club. What was the atmosphere like at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1973, we started to organize a reading group, which can be regarded as a reading club. There are more than ten like-minded friends. The conditions for joining That means you have to have a certain level of education and be interested in theory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have no organizational form and no name. We just conduct a learning exchange in the name of a gathering of friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We read theoretical books, such as &quot;Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism&quot; by Ai Siqi. We used it as an outline, discussed it chapter by chapter, and then summarized everyone&#39;s opinions on it. Use your insights. This book was an orthodox book at the time, and there was no danger in studying from it. After the &quot;September 13 Incident&quot;, the central government advocated the study of theory and designated several Marxist-Leninist classics, which we have all systematically read, such as the introduction to &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot; and &quot;Ludwig &quot;Feuerbach and the End of German Classical Philosophy&quot; and &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;. In fact, at that time we had already begun to have our own thinking about the social situation and felt that some changes were about to happen. We just didn&#39;t know where this change would lead, so we thought Relying on reading to figure out some problems is our motivation for learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At that time, you were trying to clarify some confusions about your future. How is it judged? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I just know that I have hobbies and think that I must work hard to achieve my pursuit, but I don’t have any idea how to achieve it. I was studying and studying art at the same time. In order to find books, I also went to the libraries of various universities to steal books. I was discovered later and was detained at the police station for three days. Fortunately, we were lucky. The director was very kind to me. I always felt that the kid who stole the books was because I love reading and asked me to write a promise and go home. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were in an era of information poverty, an era of extreme blockade, with no information at all.

Do you mainly watch American movies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It exists in all countries, but it is undeniable that Hollywood has the greatest influence around the world, and American movies are a good learning object. Because their film composition is the clearest. This may also be a characteristic of Americans, who are relatively simple and direct. After studying, it comes to actual combat. Writing scripts means writing one after another, constantly moving towards new goals. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have repeatedly emphasized that &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; should be written Genre film, does this have anything to do with its huge investment? When you talked about this movie in your book, you also emphasized that the script is for directors and investors, and the simpler the better. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Screenwriters have to create based on cost, and this must be the case, because I am a professional, and the investment in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is It was a huge sum of money at the time, and I felt that it couldn&#39;t be turned into a purely artistic film. I remember when I first started writing the script, Wu Tianming told me how much a certain play would cost and not to overwrite it. Later, Peter Chan asked me to adapt Ha Jin&#39;s &quot;Waiting&quot;. My first question was how much to invest. This is a habit of mine. Later, he said there was no limit, so I started writing. Although the story is a small story, my The background is a big scene. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is also adapted from a novel. In this book, you and Wang Tianbing analyzed the differences between the novel and the script, and you still think that the original novel is second-rate. Why do you think so? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think this is a classic novel, just a common romance novel. Chen Kaige once came to me In a letter, he talked about his wish for us to read the text of the novel again. The original author later published a new version of the novel based on the movie. Even so, the movie and the novel are still different in many places. The ending is very different, and many characters are newly added by us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou in the novel We finally met in Hong Kong, but your ending was that Cheng Dieyi committed suicide. Why did you change it that way? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This may be related to the experiences of many Peking Opera artists. I hope that every detail and scene in the movie &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; Provenance. For example, the character Yuan Siye, when he was shot at the end in the movie, he walked towards the execution ground with dramatic steps. That was the real story of the execution of a &quot;drama tyrant&quot; named Gao in Wuhan. The scene in which Cheng Dieyi was criticized comes from the past when people from the literary and art circles paraded through the Imperial Academy in Beijing during the Cultural Revolution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How long did you prepare for this script? Are you satisfied with the finished film? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It didn’t take long to write. It was mainly research, which took more than a year. For research, I had to travel everywhere, including the reference room of the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre, the Opera Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Arts, the library of Peking University, and the Beijing Library (now the National Library). I rented a room in a hotel next to the library. I went to the library every night and took a notebook to copy information. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie was shot very well in the end. The regret is that some details can still be refined and some academic research can be done. There are also some performances that can be better, such as the old eunuch’s final performance. , I also felt that it was too pretentious and my understanding of this character was wrong. Of course, this cannot shake the final quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/fGe3gz4vjqub2b1rDUyKYLAlZKu7kmPmqkiwPewU.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1450&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/fGe3gz4vjqub2b1rDUyKYLAlZKu7kmPmqkiwPewU.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215559&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lu Wei (first from left), Ge You (middle) and veteran artists on the set of &quot;Alive&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Alive&quot; is adapted from Yu Hua&#39;s masterpiece.

When I wrote &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, my spirit was free, and I felt in my heart that it should be based on mine, and the novel was wrong; but when adapting &quot;Alive&quot;, I wanted to try not to touch the novel as much as possible, but of course I still had to touch it. , after all, they are two carriers. For example, in the novel &quot;Alive&quot;, Fugui&#39;s son died by drawing blood. In reality, this is too rare. There is a problem with the audience&#39;s acceptance. The writing is a bit cruel and beyond our life experience, so I changed it to a car accident. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the ending, &quot;Alive&quot; finally gave People hope that it is not as cruel as the original work, and seems to be more tender than &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This movie is about family life. The style is a little different, but the quality of the two is the same. I should have written &quot;Alive&quot; shortly after I finished writing &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. The origin is that I previously collaborated with Zhang Yimou on a film about Shaanxi shadow puppetry, and he also went to pick up the location. Later, he saw &quot;Alive&quot; and told me to do this first. I also liked this novel, so I agreed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I made a documentary about old Shaanxi artists performing shadow puppetry. Zhang Yimou liked it very much and found it particularly charming. He watched the film at my house and was very excited. He stayed at my house that night. , we chatted all night and said that we must put shadow puppetry on the screen, and then we put this element into &quot;Alive&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let him become a living person&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Do you think that period was considered a better time for Chinese films? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Of course, the policy is relatively loose, and the filmmakers also have a very fighting spirit. Everyone was willing to unite and make a good movie. At that time, personal demands seemed to be gone, and they just wanted to make a good movie. The desire for fame and fortune is relatively weak, and the movie has not begun to be marketed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the filming of &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; was completed, Chen Kaige asked me to go to Beijing, so I went. He said that he had set up a company. I&#39;m a little skeptical about this, because when you set up a company, your motives are not necessarily so pure, and you have pressure, unlike in the system. I said something that maybe he didn’t understand. I said, “I don’t think so if you run a company. I think you’ll be hurt.” In fact, I meant that doing art wouldn’t be so pure in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I am willing to continue to cooperate with him after that. He was going to shoot &quot;Feng Yue&quot; and asked me to be the screenwriter. When I saw that it was about the &quot;Demolition of the White Party&quot; in Shanghai, I decided to do it. I went to Shanghai to do research and wanted to find out what was going on. After I went to the Shanghai Research Institute of Literature and History to read the information, I found that there was no &quot;explosion of the White Party&quot; in history, so I was unwilling to write this script. Only if I believe it can I write a script. If I don&#39;t believe it, I can&#39;t write it. After I talked to Chen Kaige, he asked me if I could fictionalize it, and I said I couldn&#39;t do that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, I persuaded him at the time that &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; had been successful. Could we make a movie with a small investment but that we really wanted to make? But he still made &quot;Feng Yue&quot;, although It was basically the original cast of Farewell My Concubine, but it was a box office failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have also criticized the fifth generation directors for not being able to write scripts, right? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I mean they are not very good at telling stories. They are relatively unfamiliar with drama. What they study in school are all works of art and they admire It is also a work of art, and no effort has been made to the plot. The film school seems not to pay much attention to the plot, emphasizing the artist&#39;s style and the artist&#39;s personality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many directors have made masterpieces, but later The works are becoming more and more disappointing. What do you think of this problem?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is normal. For example, athletes may create creative works when they are in good condition. World records, when the state is not good, that is, at an average level, they also have to face failure and the result of being eliminated. Filmmakers are the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You and many directors will have disagreements. , such as &quot;Red Cliff&quot; and &quot;White Deer Plain&quot;, what is the reason behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am not unhappy with John Woo. He and the producer approached me to write a red cliff story. Later, he didn&#39;t use the script I wrote. He used his lover&#39;s script, and I published my version as a book. The main reason is that my understanding of &quot;Red Cliff&quot; is different from his. I think Red Cliff is a battlefield and a struggle, while he thinks the theme is peace. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had a very unpleasant quarrel with the director while filming &quot;White Deer Plain&quot;. He did not understand the theme of &quot;White Deer Plain&quot; and thought it was the relationship between man and land. But I think this book is about the father. The struggle with Zi is a conflict between two generations. What&#39;s more, his focus is not on movies, so some people say that this version of &quot;White Deer Plain&quot; is &quot;The Biography of Tian Xiao&#39;e&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are there any scripts that you have written but have not yet been filmed? Do you feel regretful? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; I just finished writing a script about the history of the Hetao area. It is a story about a swordsman from the Qing Dynasty, called &quot;The Legend of the Seven Stars of the Swordsman&quot; . I have always had a special liking for martial arts films, and I also like Hetao folk songs. I just wanted to make a martial arts film with singing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你对新片一直保持关注，之前也经常点评一些新电影，你对最近上映的国产片有何看法？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;芦苇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;拍上海的《爱情神话》还是不错的，但也有它的问题。比如三个女性角色都太漂亮，不像是市井之辈，一看就是电影（人物）；还有男主角的形象有问题，是个老好人，太概念化了，有点简单。以我对老好人的理解来说，他们可不那么简单。这些削弱了这部电影的戏剧力，但是这个故事很好。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在塑造电影人物的时候，如何让角色更加令人信服？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;芦苇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;你要理解他，把人物放到一个生活的场景里面去。不要概念化，不要简单化，不要扁平化，让他成为一个活着的人，一个有情感、有灵魂、有情感诉求的人。我们拍英雄人物的时候往往会有误区，英雄人物都是有七情六欲的。真善美，只有真才能善，才能美，一些电影老是让人不信服，就是不真，这类电影不能找马屁精来拍。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;这几年主旋律电影再度成为一种重要的电影现象，你会写主旋律电影吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;芦苇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会啊，我写过两个。有史以来最伟大的电影里，也有主旋律，就是爱森斯坦的《战舰波将金号》，这是苏维埃主旋律，后来被视为蒙太奇理论的集大成之作。我一直不服气，其实我父母都是老八路解放军，我认为主旋律是可以拍好的，我自己写的两部可惜没有拍，将来有机会我还是想拍。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;近来的电影里，你似乎很看好《我不是药神》，原因是什么呢？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;芦苇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;它有深远的社会意义，看病难是全社会的共同心声，刚好这个电影把这个问题揭示出来了，所以我觉得它有社会意义。从艺术的角度，这部电影还可以继续推敲，但这部电影有不凡的意义。好的电影，比如《乌鸦与麻雀》《小城之春》都有深远的社会意义。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天成奇峡：云蒸霞蔚的“世外密境”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257605]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“失去对身边美好的感知”：社交媒体还是我们自己的问题？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258048]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, Yan Fei, a professor of sociology at Tsinghua University, said: Social media brings people far away, but we But I lost my perception of the beauty around me. This remark triggered a lot of discussion, with both praise and criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One criticism says that experts from the pan-humanistic society tend to fall into reflection on &quot;new technologies&quot; and &quot;new trends&quot;, giving people a sense of criticizing for the sake of criticizing. However, this does not mean that Yan Fei’s statement has no value. Whether it inspires resonance or triggers refutation, it shows that it has touched many people and must be right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What exactly has social media brought to us? Is it empowering us, allowing us to better control our lives, helping us contact and discover the larger world, and achieving better selves? Or is it going too far and consuming us, and we are being included and swallowed, becoming this &quot;superorganism&quot; &quot;Human flesh input and output terminal, everyone produces fragments, and is fed fragments? The answer may be different for everyone. Different views on a technology can reveal its different aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a positive perspective, social media has indeed reduced the cost of communication. You can establish links with strangers in distant places without leaving home and just inputting and clicking a few times, sharing your opinions with each other and getting timely feedback; Moreover, in the online world, everyone can take off the mask they wear in real life and reveal their true self without worrying too much about offending others with their honesty. Some people will unite into a community based on common knowledge background, values ​​or hobbies, find an ecological niche that suits them, and find the meaning of survival. For those who feel lonely and out of tune with the people around them offline, it is also a kind of happiness to find that &quot;I am not alone&quot; online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, with the deepening popularity of mobile Internet and smartphones, more and more freelancers can work from home or even anywhere, especially for knowledge workers. For these people, social media is already an infrastructure for doing work, or a productivity tool. Others’ criticism and reflection on social media are just clouds and noise to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, barring a massive catastrophe, it is impossible for us to return to the state of things before social media for long. In this sense, all criticisms and reflections on social media are irrational and fleeting, while those that are reasonable can at best promote the improvement of social media. Of course, each of us is free to choose, and can independently decide the frequency and type of social media use, and the appropriate proportion and time of online and offline life. Therefore, we cannot treat our mental weakness and disability as Blame it on social media or something else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this general premise, we may admit that Yan Fei’s statement sees a problem. Of course, what appears to be social media’s problem is actually our own problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A netizen said, &quot;I feel very close to my heart&quot;. He said that he likes to watch the dusk of vegetation and other things captured in the video, but he doesn&#39;t want to see it in real life. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course life that is staged or filtered is not real life. You have a choice. You can put down your phone and go for a hike to watch the sunrise or watch the sunset on your balcony. Connect with the real world and real people and feel the beauty around you. You can also keep your phone in your hand. The algorithm will continuously push content to you based on your needs and desires, keeping you high until you feel dizzy, exhausted, and left with a sense of consumption and emptiness afterwards. Of course, you can also use your phone sparingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, you want to accompany your children to enhance the understanding and relationship between parents and children, or go outdoors with family and friends on weekends to enjoy a quiet time. But if you pick up your mobile phone, turn into a heroic fighter on social media, and scold Fang Qiu, then you may have really ignored the people around you who need care and &quot;lost the perception of the beauty around you.&quot; But as long as you step away, social media is just a dead thing to you, and a responsible person will not shirk his responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen retorted: If there is beauty around us, do we still have time to use social media? Don’t we all just want to get rid of the chicken feathers around us and find our fantasy world through social media? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Properly withdrawing from real life, relaxing and letting yourself go is harmless and beneficial. The way of civility and martial arts is to relax. However, escaping from real life is not advisable. You cannot live a failed life in the real world and become a great hero in the virtual world. Those who &quot;abandon treatment&quot; in the real world will find it difficult to &quot;resurrect with full health&quot; in the virtual world. If the virtual world becomes an anesthetic for you to escape from real life, it will only amplify and intensify your failures in real life. Every time you log off the Internet and return to reality, you will face endless spiritual emptiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Needless to say, real life means daily necessities, responsibilities and pressure. We can take a break from stress, but eventually we have to face it. It is better to face it sooner rather than later. The vast majority of parents cannot support you for a lifetime, and the idea of ​​&quot;full-time children&quot; is just self-deception. A person&#39;s growth, a person&#39;s spiritual growth into a qualified adult, fundamentally lies in stimulating one&#39;s inner motivation and courage, using one&#39;s natural talents and acquired abilities, claiming one&#39;s own responsibilities, and doing one&#39;s own business. If you take it up, the reward is the unparalleled sense of accomplishment when you accomplish something, and a mentally stronger self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the vast majority of people who need to fight in the real world, social media should be an adjuvant and snack, not an anesthetic and a meal. From the perspective of receiving effective information, social media should not be fully committed to delivery. Some social media have reached the pinnacle of deliberately creating &quot;information cocoons&quot;. For the same news event or hot post, the comment areas for men and women can be completely different to accurately cater to your thoughts, or to be precise.

Photo provided by interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case of 18 people who were convicted of privately building a pontoon that once attracted widespread attention has made new progress. On September 27, 2023, the Baicheng Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Jilin Province made a retrial decision, believing that the original judgment was indeed erroneous in the application of law and met the conditions for retrial, and decided to bring the case to Baicheng Intermediate People&#39;s Court for trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The criminal verdict of the Taonan City People&#39;s Court shows that from 2005 to 2018, Huang Deyi and others secretly traveled along the Taoer River from Zhenlin Village, Wafang Town, Taonan City to Ping&#39;an Village, Ping&#39;an Town, Taobei District, Baicheng City. Build a hull pontoon bridge, intercept passing vehicles and collect bridge tolls. The toll is 5 yuan for a small car and 10 yuan for a large car, totaling 52,950 yuan. For the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, Huang Deyi was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years. Another 17 relatives were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one year to three months in prison, all with suspended sentences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A legal person close to the case told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;According to our country&#39;s judicial practice, the court is very cautious in initiating retrials and usually undergoes very strict review.&quot; The legal person analyzed that correcting the original judgment There are two possibilities, one is not guilty, the other is a reduced sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Retrial decision letter.

Respondents provided&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Whether it is a forced request&quot; or the focus of the retrial&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The original judgment was indeed wrong in applying the law&quot; mentioned in the retrial decision, analyzed by the above-mentioned legal experts , according to the judicial interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, to constitute the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, there must be certain hooligan motives and coercive objective behavior, and disrupt social order. The focus of the retrial of the case will be on whether Huang Deyi&#39;s relevant behavior constitutes the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, that is, whether Huang Deyi has the subjective intention to commit the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble and the objective behavior of forcing others to do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Therefore, the focus of the retrial may be on whether Huang Deyi had objective behavior of forcing others to cross the bridge. Specifically, whether Huang Deyi forced others to cross the bridge.” The legal person believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter in July 2023, Huang Deyi explained that the reason for building the pontoon bridge was because his family had land on the other side of the river, and at the same time, his ancestors were boat builders. Huang Deyi said that the charging standard of &quot;5 yuan for a small car and 10 yuan for a large car&quot; was determined after discussion with the villagers crossing the bridge. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/252355&quot;>;Village Bully Involved in Gangs , destroy lanes, return bridge tolls? Those convicted of building bridges respond to the controversy&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are different opinions in previous media reports regarding Huang Deyi’s claim that there is no mandatory toll. . In July 2023, Gu Tianfu, the party secretary of An&#39;an Village, which is only separated by a river from Zhenlin Village, said in an interview with the media that Huang Deyi had deliberately dug up the river channel, so that villagers passing by had to walk across his bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment determined that the amount of charges was 52,950 yuan. In previous interviews with Southern Weekend reporters, many villagers claimed that it was more than this amount. A villager who had also built a pontoon bridge on the Taoer River estimated that the amount built by Huang Deyi The fee charged by the floating bridge may reach millions of dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the determination of the amount to be collected will have an impact on the retrial judgment, the above-mentioned legal experts analyzed that the retrial decision stated that the original trial was an error in the application of the law, and the retrial stage should focus on the application of the law. &quot;This case is not a crime of amount. Whether Huang Deyi constitutes a crime and the sentencing has no absolute correspondence with the amount.&quot; At the same time, Article 469 of the Interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that, except for the protest of the People&#39;s Procuratorate, the retrial shall generally not increase the penalty of the defendant in the original trial. &quot;From this point of view, it is unlikely that Huang Deyi will be given a heavier sentence in the retrial.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the criminal verdict of the Taonan City People&#39;s Court, in addition to building a pontoon bridge, Huang Deyi also organized 17 relatives to guard the bridge. If any of the other 17 people involved in the bridge guarding case engaged in forcible behavior, would it have an impact on the case and Huang Deyi? The above-mentioned legal person said that if others forcefully demand it, he himself may not commit a crime because there is no intention to commit a crime together, but the premise is that Huang Deyi himself does not know about this behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The new bridge will be completed and opened to traffic at the end of October&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to the case itself, the &quot;floating bridge imprisonment&quot; has attracted attention, and the travel needs of villagers have also attracted local attention. In July 2023, &quot;Taonan Release&quot; issued an article stating that it plans to build a convenience bridge near the original pontoon bridge, which will be completed before the autumn harvest. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/252709&quot;>;Struggles for land, crossing rivers And bridge demolition: the dilemma of 11 illegal floating bridges behind the &quot;privately built floating bridges&quot; case&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Southern Weekend reporters, the location of the convenience bridge was not in the original Near the floating bridge, it was built in Yushu Village, Fushun Town, about ten kilometers downstream. On September 30, Yushu Village Party Secretary Wang Zuoxiang told Southern Weekend reporters that the reason why the Bianmin Bridge was built near Yushu Village was because the river surface in this section is narrower than that in other places. Other river surfaces on the Taoer River are four to five hundred meters long. Width, &quot;Our place is more than 200 meters wide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the river narrow and it is easy to build a bridge, it is also because it is at the &quot;center point&quot;. There are two rivers in Taonan, the Taoer River and the Jiaoliu River. About 67 administrative villages are distributed on both sides of the two rivers. Before the new convenience bridge was built, there were only three bridges on the 156-kilometer-long Taoer River, namely No. 1 Bridge, Manchudai Bridge and Zhenxi Bridge. Wang Zuoxiang said, &quot;The bridge is located here and can be accessed from both the north and the south. After the bridge is repaired, it will be about 20 kilometers away from the Manchudai Bridge and about 35 kilometers away from the Zhenxi Bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public signboard for the project It shows that &lt;a>;&lt;/a>;&lt;a>;the newly built convenience bridge is made of steel plate material, with a length of 327 meters and a width of 5 meters. The investment is 6.852 million yuan, and the planned completion time is October 31, 2023. &lt;/a>;Wang Zuo Xiangxiang, the local autumn harvest begins in mid-October every year. &quot;Now our Taonan side has basically completed the construction, and the bridge deck has been paved.&quot; However, because the Taoer River built by the Convenience Bridge is the dividing line, one bank is Taonan City, and the other side belongs to Taobei District, Baicheng City. On September 30, Wang Zuoxiang told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;There is a branch of the river in Taobei District, about 50 meters wide, which has not been repaired yet. Now the bridge is a Duantou Bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taonan A staff member of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee told a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;The situation I know currently is that they are accelerating the construction of the bridge. The main body of the bridge has been basically completed. The &#39;Duetou Bridge&#39; is the approach bridge to the other side. In the process of our bridge construction, It must be guaranteed. If the project is started and implemented, it can be completed in two or three days. It is not very complicated. There is definitely no problem with the bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zuoxiang believes that after the convenience bridge is completed, It will definitely be more convenient for people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. But he has new worries. He believes that after the bridge is completed, there will be a lot of vehicles coming and going, and his Yushu Village is only about 3 kilometers away from the convenience bridge. The vehicles entering and exiting will &quot;clearly use our village&quot; and will crush the village. There is a 4-meter-wide cement road, and the risk factor for villagers&#39; travel has also become higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He hopes that the relevant departments can repair the damaged roads in the village in the future, and at the same time, set up signs at the intersections around the convenience bridge, such as marking intersections or T-shaped intersections. &quot;I am the head of a village, and I have to be responsible for the safety of the villagers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[规避现代认知框架的陷阱：读葛兆光老师序言有感]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257798]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/XpeYfU92LInHlfvSMnOs1PA617EDgUhWQU0xWSXD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;910&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/XpeYfU92LInHlfvSMnOs1PA617EDgUhW QU0xWSXD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bao Gangsheng has two works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had time to read Teacher Bao Gangsheng’s new book &quot;Confucianism, Legalism and Taoism: Political Imagination in Early China&quot; (Guangxi Normal University Press, 2023), just after reading the preface by teacher Ge Zhaoguang, I felt that this book must be very interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have read Bao Gangsheng&#39;s &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot; (Peking University Press, 2015) and his works on democracy. I do not study political science, but am interested in discourse analysis, so the so-called Reading is just a superficial reading out of curiosity about political science discourse, especially the cognitive evolution of terminology and the presentation of discourse. Bao Gangsheng’s academic foundation and keen awareness of issues are absolutely top-notch. Just because I read his &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot;, I am full of expectations for his new book, but I also have some mixed thoughts about what Teacher Ge said in the preface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Ge is positive about Bao Gangsheng’s approach to the history of ancient thought from the perspective of modern political science, and believes that this is promoting the dialogue between Western theory and Eastern thought. He believes that it is meaningful to re-examine ancient thoughts from the perspective of modern political science. I completely agree with this, but I feel that in doing so, we must avoid the traps of modern cognitive frameworks. Cognitive frames have many functions, one of which is what William James called &quot;selective attention.&quot; One consequence of selective attention is that we pay too much attention to the similarities or differences between the objects being observed, ignoring the fundamental differences or similarities between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Give an example. When Bao Gangsheng introduced China&#39;s political outlook in &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot;, he mentioned three different political outlooks, one is modern, one is ancient, and there is also the Soviet model, that is, class rule. Let&#39;s not talk about this for now. . In the words of Bao Gangsheng, in the ancient political view, &quot;politics&quot; &quot;is most commonly understood to refer to the activities of the monarch and his ministers in ruling the country and governing society.&quot; Simply put, it actually means &quot;monarchy.&quot; According to Bao Gangsheng’s explanation, the modern political outlook is “the Chinese translation of English politics” and is a foreign concept. He quoted Sun Yat-sen&#39;s view that &quot;the management of people&#39;s affairs is politics.&quot; There is another sentence before: &quot;Government is a matter for everyone.&quot; Therefore, the politics in Sun Yat-sen&#39;s mind is &quot;administering political affairs by the people&quot;, which is the so-called &quot;democracy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to teacher Gao Quanxi in the book &quot;Modern Western Political Thought&quot;, the ancient Western monarchy is completely different from the ancient Chinese monarchy. If Bao Gangsheng’s summary and Gao Quanxi’s statement hold true, “monarchy” politics and “civil rights” politics are different concepts and belong to different cognitive frameworks with essential conflicts. Western &quot;monarchy&quot; theory and ancient Chinese &quot;monarchy&quot; or &quot;royal power&quot; also belong to different cognitive categories. According to the most basic assumptions of discourse analysis, terms generated by different cognitive frameworks and categories belong to different semantic fields and form different semantic relationships with related words. Two questions arise: 1) Is it appropriate to use different cognitive frameworks to explain political concepts expressed in the same text? 2) Is it appropriate to use words with different semantic relationships to explain the same term? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why I have such doubts is because there are many such examples in &quot;Political Science&quot; that I think are specious. For example, &quot;Confucius believed that politics should be upright. If the king above is upright, the people will be upright.&quot; When commenting on the concept of Confucius, Bao Gangsheng mentioned &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; written by Adam Smith. He seemed to think that &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot; are synonymous with Confucius&#39; &quot;rectitude&quot;, as if It is said that Confucius&#39; &quot;benevolent government&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot; are highly similar to Adam Smith&#39;s moral outlook. Is it really like this? Is Confucius&#39;s moral outlook centered on &quot;royal power&quot; and based on the differential order pattern the same as Adam Smith&#39;s moral outlook based on the concept of equality centered on &quot;civil rights&quot;? If traditional ethics are virtues, then why did Lu Xun think that ethics cannibalize people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example, &quot;General Knowledge of Political Science&quot; is based on Han Fei&#39;s &quot;The master of the Ming Dynasty guides his ministers with only two handles. The two handles are the virtue of punishment. What is the virtue of punishment?&quot; Killing is called punishment, celebrating reward is called virtue.&quot; This passage makes the following judgment: &quot;The principle here is close to the management philosophy of modern industrial and commercial organizations, that is, organizational management should pay attention to clear rewards and punishments.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t understand the philosophy of modern industrial and commercial organization management. Is such a simple principle of clear rewards and punishments the fundamental principle of modern industrial and commercial organization management philosophy? Are the premise of this principle for industrial and commercial organizations to be the same as Han Fei’s? What are the standards of modern principles? What are its basic assumptions? Do the two involve the same semantic relationship? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same section, the author draws this conclusion based on Han Fei&#39;s &quot;If a person does not die, the coffin will not be bought. Love does not mean hating people, but benefits from people&#39;s death&quot;: &quot;In fact , Han Fei had a perspective similar to Adam Smith more than 2,000 years ago, and he had elaborated the &#39;economic man&#39; hypothesis and the methodology of individualism to a certain extent.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;As an economic concept, doesn’t “economic man” have different basic premises and presuppositions? Is the core semantic term of &quot;individualism&quot; as an ism just &quot;profit&quot;? Are their semantic fields the same as Han Fei&#39;s? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw Teacher Ge’s high-level summary of some of the book’s viewpoints in the preface, such as “summarizing Taoism using methodism, weakness, inaction, and abandonment of wisdom.” Based on past readings, I even had the idea You shouldn’t have unreasonable doubts if you haven’t read the original work. I don’t know how the discussion of the book unfolded. Taoism&#39;s &quot;following the Tao, being weak, doing nothing, abandoning wisdom&quot; all have their own specific historical context and intertextual relationship. Is the &quot;wisdom&quot; mentioned in &quot;Qi Zhi&quot; a general sense? In terms of semantic relationship, can &quot;abandoning wisdom&quot; be separated from &quot;extreme sage&quot;? Although the political thought of Taoism is mentioned in academic circles, those who do not talk about &quot;governance&quot; but pursue &quot;governing by doing nothing&quot; and do not talk about &quot;law&quot; but hope for &quot;a world of supreme virtue&quot; generally use &quot;quan&quot; as the core meaning. Xiang’s “political thought”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Teacher Ge’s perspective in writing the preface is different. He criticized that &quot;some people always want to advocate &amp;nbsp;&#39;interpret China by China&#39;&quot;, meaning that these people attempt to study ancient Chinese thought in isolation from the world&#39;s modern pluralistic knowledge system. I totally agree with this. I think of Takeuchi&#39;s &quot;Asia as Method&quot; and Maruyama Masao&#39;s &quot;China as Method.&quot; The methods they advocate do not exclude the world&#39;s diverse knowledge systems. They just hope to use China&#39;s historical experience and traditional thoughts as one of the world&#39;s cognitive systems and methods. The reason why those advocates of &quot;explaining China in terms of China&quot; are problematic may be because they want to break away from the world&#39;s diverse knowledge system and develop a system that only they (here, they themselves) understand, and cannot communicate with others because they ignore consensus. The mystical explanation system of dialogue; or because its purpose is not to explain China in terms of &quot;China&quot;, but to explain China from the perspective of traditional &quot;rulers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teacher Ge is right in criticizing that these people always want to &quot;advocate going back to ancient times&quot; to find a &quot;whole must and tail&quot; explanation system. If these people have any basic respect for common sense, they should know that they cannot go back after receiving modern education. According to the basic assumptions of pragmatics, the context on which cognition is generated is not reality, but a construction, which is the result of selecting specific parameters. The so-called ancient context is actually a modern construction they made for a special purpose and based on their chosen cognitive framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, what Teacher Ge said: modern concepts and re-division and integration, &quot;allowing the originally chaotic ancient culture to present an understandable face&quot; should refer to allowing ancient culture to be understood in the modern cognitive environment. However, any contemporary &quot;rediscovery&quot; of ancient documents is actually a cognitive reconstruction of ancient times based on modern knowledge or experience. Therefore, how close this understanding is to the original face of the research object also depends on different perceptions. Know the choice of framework. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course I am not opposed to re-examining ancient ideas from the perspective of modern political science to present different modern understandings. I just want to say that the premise of this kind of review is that we cannot ignore the historical semantic fields and semantic relationships of various conceptual systems, and we cannot cut them off to suit their needs. What cannot be forgotten is that the reason why we can find modern elements in ancient concepts, that is, the so-called &quot;ancient concepts&quot;, is more because we have replaced the cognitive framework and placed related concepts in different semantics. field, a new semantic relationship is constructed based on the new semantic field. But because the words are still words from the past, it is very easy to mistake our construction for the original semantic items of these words. This is what I think is the trap of modern cognitive frameworks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book &quot;Political Science&quot; actually has a clear understanding of the differences in historical semantics. As the book points out, ancient Greece, the source of Western political science, had a fundamentally different view of politics: “In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, politics was the governance and management activities in which citizens of the city-state participated. The concept of politics at that time itself included citizen participation. The meaning of city-state affairs. Only the participation of citizens in the governance and management of city-state affairs can be called politics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, although the political words of &quot;royal power&quot; and &quot;civil rights&quot; have not changed, they Do they belong to the same semantic field? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t had the chance to read &quot;Confucianism, Legalism and Taoism: Political Imagination in Early China&quot;. &amp;nbsp;These are at best a record of random thoughts caused by reading the preface of the book posted online.

For students from families with incomes in the upper 10%, the probability of entering high school has increased by 5.3 percentage points on average, total education expenditures have increased by 67% on average, and study time per week has increased by 10.37 hours on average. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The overall conclusion is: first, the previous burden reduction policy has brought about the differentiation of educational output, increasing the probability of students from high-income families entering high school, while the probability of students from low-income families declining; Second, the burden reduction policy has also led to the differentiation of education investment: on the one hand, the education expenditure and student learning time of high-income families have both increased, while the low-income families have experienced a decrease; on the other hand, families with high investment in the early stage will reduce their family education expenditure. And low-investment families will increase their education expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This conclusion is simply that children from high-income families invest more in educational expenditures and educational time, and the results are better. Children from low-income families, on the other hand, experience a decline in financial resources, time, and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be said that this research is basically consistent with my observations around me. I live in Shandong, which is a province with a large population and a high level of college entrance examination. The difficulty of the college entrance examination also falls into the &quot;hell mode&quot;. In such a general environment, it is impossible to be completely &quot;flat&quot; on education issues. Parents attach great importance to education and examinations, and basically spare no effort in investing in education within their capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is an English training institution downstairs from my house. Although it is not as well-known as New Oriental and Xueersi, the management is generally quite formal and the student pool is decent. Many children have signed up there. The &quot;double reduction&quot; policy was introduced and business resumed after a period of suspension. This kind of reopening is also compliant, because the &quot;double reduction&quot; has a series of clear requirements for off-campus training, as long as you fully cooperate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, except for those places in the country where the college entrance examination is in the &quot;easy mode&quot;, many places are facing the pressure of competition for higher education. In these places, even people in the education authorities are also faced with the education problems of their own children. They still have some understanding of the actual situation at the grassroots level, so with a pragmatic and people-oriented attitude, some management aspects that are more humane can play a certain buffering role during the implementation of the policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reopening, prices have generally increased. For old customers, with various discounts, prices are basically the same as before. For new customers, the price has increased compared to before. Moreover, if you choose to pay fees for one year before, you can enjoy certain discounts. However, according to the latest regulatory requirements, you can only pay fees for one quarter at a time, and the discounts are no longer available. In fact, it is also a disguised form of payment. Price increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My eldest child is 11 years old this year, and my second child is 6 years old. One is in sixth grade and the other is in first grade. My child&#39;s classmates have previously enrolled in various cram schools, including mathematics, English, composition, etc. Of course, there are also those who don’t enroll in any classes. The overall situation is that those who used to enroll in various classes are still enrolling now, and I haven’t heard of a decrease. I used to rush to events on weekends, but I still rush now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of &quot;double reduction&quot; is to reduce the burden on families and children. However, the specific situation in each province and each region is somewhat different. In a province with a large population like Shandong, the pressure of competition in the college entrance examination will be passed down through the layers. Although parents also hope that their children can develop in an all-round way, they do not dare to take the scores lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents of several children get together, the focus of the chat will easily fall on the issue of future studies. Not only the college entrance examination, but also the previous high school entrance examination, high school and junior high school school selection and other issues. A very real problem is that although academic performance is downplayed in policy, most parents still focus on performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not all children who need tutoring are suitable for tutoring. Top academics are never taught. Academic champions generally have strong self-learning ability and self-motivation. They don&#39;t need to make up lessons, and it can even be said that their level may be better than the teacher&#39;s. It is a waste of time and money for top students to make up lessons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;stupid students&quot; do not need to make up lessons. The diversity of this person and society must be recognized. Just as not everyone is suitable for scientific research, many children are not suitable for learning book knowledge and Test taking. Of course, this does not mean that they are really stupid, but it means that learning book knowledge is too difficult for them. There is not much difference between making up lessons and not making up lessons, so there is no need to spend money and time on it. . Those who are at the middle level and have the motivation to make progress will see results after just a little supplement. This group of students needs supplementary lessons the most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, it is to improve grades, and on the other hand, it is to let children know that grades can be improved by working hard, and work can be done well by working hard. In my opinion, the learning process is also a process of building self-confidence and responsibility. Improving grades is important, and self-training and self-growth during the learning process are also important, or even more important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我与白塔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257994]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/bs57e1x4IQJ6KraNGzDhWuiQBUA9SVAGzsL5VDqO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/bs57e1x4IQJ6KraNGzDhWuiQBUA9SVAG zsL5VDqO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252400&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Children feeling the winter snow under the white tower&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;（&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaaaaa;&quot;>;Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a person from a small town in the northeastern border, I have a close relationship with the White Tower in Beijing What&#39;s the fate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who has lived in Beijing for a long time has his or her own feelings and memories about this city, and more or less longing for it. That year, when the lease of my studio in Wangjing came to an end, I tried to find a house in the alleys of the old city, thinking that this would be closer to the nobility and wealth of the city and would be conducive to new development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/NyevBw1waDLo7t2WNXaMdLMLJsSEndluWYr07jat.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/NyevBw1waDLo7t2WNXaMdLMLJsSEndluWYr07jat.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252404&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Vendors chatting at the door of the Gongmenkou wet market&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Correct In the middle of summer, I wear NB993 running shoes that are unchanging in all seasons. Because of Steve Jobs, this pair of shoes has a symbolic meaning for me that goes beyond practicality. I bought three pairs in one go and rotate them around. With the blessing of shoes, the scorching sun and showers are no longer unbearable, and the road to dreaming in a foreign land becomes easier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I first went to Houhai and Huguo Temple, then searched Dongzhimen and Dongsi. After several twists and turns, I came to Baita Temple and finally found a suitable house. The agent and the landlord have agreed on the price, and I want to go back and think about it before making a decision. As soon as I turned around and hadn&#39;t gone far, the landlord suddenly came out and stopped me, saying that the old man at home wanted to chat again. It turns out that my uncle accidentally heard me talk about his hometown, where he was sent to work as a teacher when he was young. The uncle&#39;s expression reflected the special meaning of that experience to him. I saw in his eyes a trace of sadness at meeting an old friend in a foreign land. The old man took me and asked me in detail about the current situation in my hometown, big and small, and took the trouble. Because of this unexpected fate, the house was settled quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, the place where a person first starts will give life a background and determine certain choices in life. Some passes cannot be forcibly reversed by manpower alone, and trying to do so is mostly in vain; but if you let nature take its course and take things as they come, you can see the bright future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, my fate with the White Tower began, and the White Tower in my heart gradually became clear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/jEn7Z0GY4C23HpNmcwD6YDqlDfw3Kaj5egrhQCDq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/jEn7Z0GY4C23HpNmcwD6YDqlDfw3Kaj5egrhQCDq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252405&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gongmenkou Hutong under renovation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;many times , I walked around the tower alone. I try to slow down and move forward with a calm and quiet mentality. It seems that it is easier to meet happiness this way. However, as time goes by, wrinkles creep up to the corners of the eyes, and white hair grows on the head. The happiness in the longing for is like a bird perching on the treetops. It seems to be close at hand, but it spreads its wings and slips away. Between movement and stillness, the tall and pure white tower always stared at me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The studio is on the second floor, and the windows face the White Tower. When the sun rises, it covers the window sill with gold; when the sun sets low, it casts the shadow of leaves on the screen window. There is a statue of Venus with a broken arm in the house. According to the uncle, it was left by a tenant painter from the Academy of Arts and Crafts. The statue and the white tower often appear in the same picture, with light and shadow flowing between them, chanting the changes of the four seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6NdsISkOezbywy1NFtuk6TR9j6tOavRRu9rtt8LO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6NdsISkOezbywy1NFtuk6TR9j6tOavRRu9rtt8LO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252403&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Golden Dome of the White Tower under the winter sunset&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/5dSDq00pAPdQZpEhhpiok1M8MxLyyb0yKUCvEC5d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/5dSDq00pAPdQZpEhhpiok1M8MxLyyb0yKUCvEC5d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252406&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pigeons flying around the tower&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is windy in spring. When the wind blows, the alley is no longer filled with yellow sand and dust, but the gentle airflow makes pedestrians hurry. Spring brings hope, and people want to do something quickly, maybe they can seize a chance and fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is rainy in summer. Unlike the continuous drizzle in the south, even in the rainy season here, the rain is cheerful and warm, and stops in a flash. Sometimes while walking, a sudden rain shower occurs. The huge raindrops make the leaves rustle and the roof tiles crackle. Pedestrians start running in panic, looking for shelter from the rain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Autumn is so nice. Only in autumn does her beauty fully show here. Every alley, every doorway, balcony, and both sides of the door are filled with various flowers and plants, embellishing a colorful picture against the blue sky. Perhaps only Mr. Lao She&#39;s &quot;Autumn in Peiping&quot; can fully explain that scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Winter is another scene. A heavy snowfall seems to bring time back a hundred years ago. It is difficult to distinguish north, south, east and west in the vast whiteness, but you can vaguely see the Beiping where masters gather. People stayed behind closed doors, but I ran into the wind and snow to capture this time-traveled black and white world with my camera. After the snow, the ice subsided, Lu Xun’s home turned back into his memorial hall, and I returned to reality, under the White Tower in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/T3moYVA9HC1x8ARXk9h7C6nvofjUhGIKDPF7LT9Q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/T3moYVA9HC1x8ARXk9h7C6nvofjUhGIKDPF7LT9Q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252407&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Residences shaded by vines and green plants&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/14Fkgiv03oPupBxYvfvRmNzScD7CZPGKsD0zSdW9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/14Fkgiv03oPupBxYvfvRmNzScD7CZPGKsD0zSdW9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252409&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;The dog taking a nap in summer&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still remember the Xuji Shaobing Shop in Anping Alley. Big, every morning the aroma of burning pasta wafts out, and people come here to queue up to wait for the sesame seed cakes to be baked. The small tables and chairs at the door are always full of diners, and the crowd is buzzing. The crispy sesame seed cakes paired with a bowl of fragrant bean soup is a delicious treat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Bao at the entrance of the palace is always crowded. The Xingyuan Restaurant opposite is a time-honored state-owned restaurant, and the food is quite affordable. Walking west along Fuchengmen Inner Street, you will find Xinchuan Cold Noodles near Fuchengmen Subway Station. In the summer, a big bowl of it, paired with a bottle of ice-cold Arctic Ocean, is so refreshing. There is also a shop selling salted duck eggs downstairs from the studio. The supply is rationed every day, and each one peeled out is full of red oil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/MpHQqXlXcavItT0RBSUSyhmc4sTUy7jzEVt8E7er.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/MpHQqXlXcavItT0RBSUSyhmc4sTUy7jzEVt8E7er.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252401&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Uncle drying birds under the warm winter sun&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LdvXPQc344shLwXqCY1sMvQQRuQmYmGOwk3chv83.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LdvXPQc344shLwXqCY1sMvQQRuQmYmGOwk3chv83.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On a summer night, people enjoy the cool air while playing with their mobile phones&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Fan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The alleys around Baita Temple The name is both vivid and interesting.

Some netizens carefully prepared their favorite snacks, such as kisses, konjac jelly, etc. as wedding candies, but were criticized as being too bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know when it started, but the &quot;happy&quot; wedding candy headed towards the involution track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, China&#39;s wedding candy market is in close conflict with each other and the two factions are divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One group is companies focusing on the wedding candy field, such as Aidoduo, etc.; the other group is traditional candy companies, such as Dove, Hsu Fuji, etc. Companies focusing on wedding candy focus on customization and packaging, while traditional candy companies focus on nationality and cost-effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the weddings of grandparents in the past, which were mainly fruit candies and milk candies with simple packaging, high-end wedding candies are now the choice of contemporary couples. For example, they will choose Godiva chocolate for 5 yuan a piece.

In addition, it also triggered the topic: In my country, the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the largest informatization country in globalization, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, why does there still exist such a gap between producers and sellers? The &quot;cyber peddler&quot; class is both ancient and modern, and occupies a huge share and decisive influence in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The explanation I put forward in the previous article is: just like the eloquent salesmen in the old society, in the process of walking around the streets, they can make potential customers buy or not. Feeling relaxed. In modern society, &quot;cyber salesmen&quot; like Li Jiaqi provide their fans with more than just eyebrow pencils, powders and lipsticks, but also emotional value, which is even more important than the actual goods. (Create a link: &quot;Before the &quot;best friends&quot; said bad things to each other: How can &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; like Li Jiaqi succeed against the trend?&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, after always using &quot;all girls&quot; as the opening of the live broadcast, use The &quot;bestie&quot; who held consumers in the palm of his hand and coaxed them into the clouds with his &quot;bestie voice&quot; suddenly broke out in his fatigue. When he began to &quot;struggle to educate&quot; consumers, he himself was &quot;cut off&quot; by the emotional value of the consumer. It is also an expected result that they are pushed into the whirlpool of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that &quot;emotional value&quot; is not only the key element for Li Jiaqi from the clouds of the business empire to the center of the whirlpool of public opinion, but also the root of the survival of the &quot;cyber peddler&quot; profession in modern society. In fact, this concept has already surpassed the live broadcast e-commerce industry and has spread in all fields of this society. We should talk about &quot;emotional value&quot; in the workplace, &quot;emotional value&quot; in love, and even in family life. Let’s talk about “emotional value”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is this &quot;emotional value&quot; that everyone wants and is more important than the commodity itself in commodity trading activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The spiritual pacifier of the adult world&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Contrary to the intuitive impression of most people, emotional value (Emotional Value), a term that looks very much like a psychological term, is actually a complete term. The marketing concept itself refers to the difference between emotional benefits and emotional costs in the marketing process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it simply, in a shopping trip, regardless of whether the transaction is finally concluded, as long as the positive emotional experience provided by the seller to the consumer is greater than the negative experience, the consumer will obtain positive emotional value. This is a right Favorable results for the seller. On the contrary, if consumers gain negative emotional value, it will be an unfavorable result for the seller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sales industry, emotional value theory is often used to design and optimize sales processes, guide sales staff training, provide customers with a better consumption experience, and convert and fix potential customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as mentioned above, in today&#39;s society, both the concept of &quot;emotional value&quot; and the theory of emotional value itself have been greatly abused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In almost all fields of social and interpersonal communication, people’s demand for “emotional value” is becoming more and more urgent and intense. On a popular social APP, you can see everywhere that the emotional value requested is not as good as expected. Various complaints are raised: the boss cannot provide emotional value, colleagues cannot provide emotional value, love/marriage partners cannot provide emotional value, parents cannot provide emotional value, and even strangers who occasionally meet cannot provide emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, &quot;emotional value&quot; has changed from a marketing concept to an ability, an ability to use language to make people feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. Regardless of whether this language is the result of rational thinking, or whether its rhetoric is consistent with objective facts, as long as it can make people feel &quot;comfortable&quot;, it has the ability to &quot;provide emotional value.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who are accustomed to asking for &quot;emotional value&quot; from others in life have a common characteristic, which is that regardless of whether they have this ability, they must require the other party to have this ability. While refusing to give in in public life, he complains that others cannot provide enough emotional value. This kind of mentality that is both strong and fragile, and wants to take but is unwilling to give, has formed one flammable and explosive tinderbox after another in social and public life, which can explode anytime and anywhere the moment they lose their pacifier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is an obvious fact that in modern society, while information technology and communication technology connect individuals more and more closely, the continuous disintegration of communities also makes individuals become more and more independent. Alone, people end up becoming what Hannah Arendt called &quot;atomized individuals&quot; - they may be very closely packed but at the same time isolated from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of &quot;noisy loneliness&quot; makes atomized individuals usually place material enjoyment in a very high position in order to alleviate and comfort the spiritual loneliness. Correspondingly, this kind of individual is psychologically lonely. Vulnerability also drives them to endlessly ask for the so-called &quot;emotional value&quot; from the outside world. Therefore, the overwhelming emotional value in modern society has long since changed from a marketing concept to a spiritual pacifier in the adult world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A paradise of clever lies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Just like in the business empire built by &quot;Cyber ​​Merchant&quot; with &quot;family members&quot; and &quot;queens&quot;, the emotional value is more important than the product itself. The &quot;emotional value&quot; that pervades other areas of society also exceeds reason, logic and objective facts themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the discussion of public affairs, the rhetoric of &quot;putting aside the facts, isn&#39;t XXX wrong?&quot; that can be seen everywhere is an excellent example of this kind of mentality, completely regardless of objective facts. Regardless of whether there is a problem with your own thinking logic (or no logic at all), as long as the other party makes you feel subjectively uncomfortable, it means that you have not provided &quot;emotional value&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an individual regards &quot;emotional value&quot; as the highest goal of social life, excessive and excessive emotional pursuit will inevitably consume and destroy their ability to think and express based on reason and logic. . The so-called &quot;thinking&quot; has become an animal conditioned reflex of &quot;if there is no pacifier, I will make a fuss&quot;. The so-called &quot;expressions&quot; are all the catharsis of accumulated emotions, and people cannot have any meaningful discussions, because all fact-based discussions will deviate from their original track and end in a hysterical mess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A society full of such individuals must be a kindergarten composed of &quot;children aged 6 years and 256 months&quot; where &quot;everyone is fragile and needs to be coaxed&quot;, and it will naturally become a place where all kinds of clever words and tricks are Liars are at home in this paradise of lies. For some people, the sweet-talking online opposite sex in the &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot; can obviously provide higher &quot;emotional value&quot; than the &quot;low emotional intelligence&quot; partner in reality. For the elderly, the health product sellers who hang around them every day and talk about &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; obviously provide more &quot;emotional value&quot; than their own children who come back once a month and become impatient with a few words. Ultimately, a society where &quot;there is always someone to trick you&quot; will inevitably become a society where &quot;there is always a liar that suits you&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ability to regulate one&#39;s own emotions is the basic ability of adults living in modern society. It is normal for people&#39;s emotions to fluctuate under the influence of others, but if an adult&#39;s emotions are completely provided and controlled by others , then he can only be an adult in the physiological sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of social modernization is irreversible. Problems such as individual atomization, mental loneliness and vulnerability, and psychological immaturity that arise in the process of social modernization cannot be solved by reconstructing the pre-modern society where &quot;chickens and dogs hear each other&quot; solve. The ultimate solution to the problems caused by modernization is modernization itself. From the perspective of &quot;emotional value&quot;, we see a &quot;crisis of modernity&quot; that needs to be faced squarely and urgently resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
