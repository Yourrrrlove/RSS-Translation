Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&quot;>;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the topic &quot;MBTI dormitory allocation statistics of Beijing Institute of Technology&quot; became a hot search topic, more and more universities refused to randomly allocate dormitories. People pay attention. However, each school has different criteria for allocating dormitories. It may be work and rest habits, major, student origin, or the most popular MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question that has been lingering in my mind throughout the interview is, would using certain specific indicators to allocate dormitories be better than randomly allocating dormitories? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, a long time ago, when the department needed to recruit interns, I tried to use MBTI to find the most &quot;perfect&quot; interns. My definition of &quot;perfect&quot; includes the following three indicators: enthusiasm for news, reliability in work, and perseverance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, based on the definitions of the 16 personality types classified by MBTI, I summarized several ideal types. However, during the recruitment process of several consecutive interns, I was surprised to find that there was no one. &quot;Ideal type&quot; students send us resumes. Later, when I communicated with the editor of a magazine, she quickly found a suitable intern classmate after hearing me talk about these &quot;ideal types.&quot; One of my guesses is that when submitting resumes, she would be interested in newspapers and magazines with different styles. The preference is the manifestation of a certain personality type. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, my strategy became to observe among the existing intern students. If any of them showed the above three traits, then I would understand their personality type and then recruit intern students. At this time, you can follow the gourd and draw the scoop. Of course, since the sample size is far from enough, this exploration is definitely not statistically significant. In other words, it must not be generalizable to the population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting interns is also a process of finding suitable peers. However, during the interview, we found that, unlike our definition of a “perfect intern”, each university’s definition of a “perfect roommate” The definitions are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some schools hope that students can chat well, and some students hope that students with outstanding performance can &quot;get rich first and then get rich later&quot;, which leads to various distribution methods. Even if they all consider the distribution of MBTI personality types and how to consider the matching of different types, the key points considered by different schools are slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your university dormitory is randomly assigned, will you further think about this question? Why has having a perfect roommate become so important that each school needs to figure out its own &quot;algorithm&quot; &quot;Up?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible answer is that the context is changing. Some people who want to improve dormitory relationships spent their college life in the 1990s or 2000. At that time, roommates were the most important partners in life. And when these people became university teachers one after another, they discovered that today&#39;s college students will understand roommate relationships from another perspective. In the manuscript, an interviewee mentioned: &quot;Many children have very clear goals after entering college: to secure a postgraduate degree and go abroad... From the beginning of their freshman year, they will arrange their lives according to their goals and will not participate in dinner parties, etc. For group activities, the dormitory may just be your own resting place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these &quot;algorithms&quot; really useful? This question will not get a definite answer in four years, or even further in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I only look at the &quot;perfect interns&quot; recruited, I will still ask each classmate about their personality type later, usually at the end of the chat, and will never refuse to let a certain classmate because of this. Come for an internship. I will also tell him my personality type. Knowing this information in advance can reduce a lot of friction in future communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI attempts to simplify complex individuals with some specific descriptions. In reality, even the same personality type will have completely opposite responses to difficulties. It is just a slice of a certain stage of life. The lovely thing about people is that they change every moment. A certain difficulty or a pleasant experience will make people change a little bit. Therefore, &quot;perfection&quot; should also be a process. Any &quot;perfection&quot; found with a single indicator will cease to exist the moment it is found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[证监会：调整优化融券相关制度， 取消上市公司高管、核心员工融券出借]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258614]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to further strengthen the countercyclical adjustment of the securities lending business, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has fully demonstrated and evaluated that based on the current market According to the situation, the system for securities lending and the lending of allotment shares to strategic investors will be adjusted and optimized in a targeted manner, and on the premise of maintaining the relative stability of the system, the securities lending and the lending of allotment shares to strategic investors will be tightened in stages. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;On the securities lending side, the securities lending margin ratio will be increased from no less than 50% to 80%, and for private securities The margin ratio for investment funds participating in securities lending will be increased to 100%, giving full play to the countercyclical adjustment function of the system.

They questioned that Xiaohongshu&#39;s AI painting product TriK was used without permission , &quot;feeding&quot; his paintings to AI training, causing copyright disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident first started when illustrator Xueyu questioned whether the pictures released by Trik AI were very similar to his original works. A few days later, many illustrators discovered that their works were suspected of being fed and edited by AI. As the incident unfolded, some original artists announced that they would stop updating, and some users changed their avatars to a unified &quot;Resist AI&quot; pattern in protest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, ChatGPT has set off a carnival of large AI models in China. Generative AI has become unprecedentedly popular, and major Internet companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Byte have entered the game. Xiaohongshu is also preparing for an independent large model team and will launch &quot;Trik&quot; in April. The &quot;China Artificial Intelligence Large Model Map Research Report&quot; released at the end of May 2023 shows that 79 large models with parameters of more than 1 billion have been released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The carnival brought about by generative AI continues, but many people are worried about whether AI will replace human jobs, and original painters are currently one of the professions most affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/o90KDT5Hk9wfM5y7p8knikhOeuXT3CPOHo19GSir.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/o90KDT5Hk9wfM5y7p8knikhOeuXT3CPOHo19GSir.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Original paintings under creation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Illustrator &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;The artist is wandering&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first reaction of illustrator Lin Meng was anger. She believed that everyone who devoted time and energy to the work and seriously created original works would not be able to accept it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng started painting at the age of 5 and has never stopped. When she was a child, her family conditions were average. She was sent to a painting preschool just because it was cheaper than kindergarten care at the time. It was this opportunity that paved the way for her future life. During her childhood, she was a quiet child who would not make any noise and could sit still. Drawing was a means of venting and expressing for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she had no beautiful clothes to wear and longed to have them, she drew them; she secretly bought expired magazines and copied character sketches in fashion magazines, feeling happy in the process. She knew about the existence of the Academy of Fine Arts at a very young age. , that is a &quot;longing for place&quot;. According to the art teacher, she is a child &quot;born for the Academy of Fine Arts&quot;, and she probably knows that she will definitely be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts when she grows up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From graduating from Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts to becoming an illustrator, everything has followed the ideal pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as two years ago, she tried using AI painting. The technology at that time was limited, &quot;very childish and not very mature&quot;, but the birth of AI painting itself exceeded her imagination: cold electronic information could complete a painting through algorithm training. Later, these technological breakthroughs became more like a necessity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng does not reject AI, and science fiction themes have always been her preference in creation, just like she believes in the existence of aliens. &quot;Every field needs technological development, just like when we were children, everyone drew on paper, and later on electronic devices.&quot; From the current era to the era of artificial intelligence, how to live in harmony is a need during the transition period Something that everyone should deal with together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contradiction is that it is difficult to live in harmony, &quot;because it does offend our interests, and it is also a matter of dignity. If someone steals your achievements, it is difficult for you to let them take it away generously.&quot; Lin Meng feels that the unfairness of AI is that, for a work that would take a creator a month or more to create, AI can produce almost the same effect in a few minutes. Although the details are insufficient, it can already achieve what outsiders would see at first glance. Pretty good effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an AI without emotions, it can achieve this effect because there are a large number of original works &quot;fed&quot;. For the original author, this is an unfair and difficult thing to solve. . Without rules and relevant legal constraints, virtuality and reality will conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Lin Meng settled in Xiaohongshu and successively released original works under the pseudonym &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;. After the incident, she announced that she would stop updating and start again on other websites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Lin Meng, the original artist Li Ke decided to stop updating and changed his avatar to a &quot;Reject AI&quot; pattern after learning about Xiaohongshu and TriK&#39;s practices. When talking about this topic, he was still angry. He felt that this approach was splicing, feeding, and training rather than creation. &quot;It just plagiarized the hard work of the predecessors and stitched together corpses, so I will not endorse AI, let alone AI.&quot; We will not regard AI as a tool, it is essentially plagiarism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After leaving the platform, going elsewhere seems to be just a temporary place to stay. It is common for unauthorized works to be used for AI training. . It seems that it is only a matter of time that the tide rolls to all corners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, illustrator Luo Qi also questioned on Weibo that the two-dimensional AI painting application Niji·journey was suspected of plagiarism. Many pictures generated by the application were similar to the original works of some artists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, NetEase’s LOFTERAI painting function was also questioned for using user works for AI training, causing many original painters to flee to other platforms. Subsequently, LOFTER removed related products from the shelves and issued an official apology letter. Nowadays, other platforms cannot guarantee that this group of &quot;wandering&quot; painters can find a shelter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, Station B was also on the hot search list for allegedly using AI painting to clean manuscripts and infringing the copyright of the NetEase game &quot;Yimengjianghu&quot;. At that time, netizens suspected that the &quot;Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day&quot; event promotion picture updated on the homepage of Bilibili was made using AI and incorporated the work of another original artist. It even had bugs in the details: recessed hands and only half-full shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the popular OpenAI and Microsoft received a 157-page class action lawsuit, accused of using the personal information of hundreds of millions of Internet users without permission. The plaintiff&#39;s lawyer cited a public statement by the head of OpenAI&#39;s security department, which stated that their AI product is &quot;a fairly immature technology&quot; and that without adequate security precautions, aggressive deployment of AI models would be very reckless. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like the painters stop editing, escape, or mark &quot;AI prohibited&quot; on their works, or learn ways to prevent being trained by AI, it is only temporary. They know very well that this will be a long process. challenge. The wave of AI is rolling forward, and all living beings are being swept up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;713&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253656&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Illustrator&#39;s &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot; workbench&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Illustrator &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;AI Impact: Some people embrace it, some people are laid off&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zela, a professional painter who has been in the industry for two years, is one of the earliest experimenters of AI painting - she did not recognize AI at first. But now AI has been used as a tool in painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her daily workflow is: learn from AI in composition, draw a sketch, and then color match according to some pictures of AI, using AI as a material library or tutor. The painting steps have not changed significantly, but Finding materials is faster. For her, the time-consuming step is not to refine, but to come up with a variety of plans for Party A to choose from in the early stage, and adjust the plans until they are finalized. This can save a lot of time on repeated work, but because she and AI are still in the running-in stage, overall Efficiency has not improved yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From early disapproval of AI to acceptance and embrace, the most critical reason is that Zela discovered that it can assist in painting, and half of the works generated by AI have merits, &quot;I can learn from them.&quot; , absorb.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, AI painting is still just a tool, but it will be a trend in painting in the future, &quot;because it is too cheap and convenient, especially the people at the bottom are most affected. Visual China , Artspace, and Pixiv have opened AI contribution channels, and AI graphics have also been used commercially, mainly in design work such as new media and event posters. The impact on animation and games remains to be seen.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game industry Practitioner Lin Yuan told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that game original painters include original scene paintings, original character paintings, original art promotion paintings, etc. Many companies will outsource their game original painting design needs to specialized companies. Outsourcing pays according to the amount of each painting, which can save labor costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The game project I am working on has clearly used AI to do some character design. As far as I know, there are several other similar game companies that also use part of AI painting technology. The most intuitive The impact is that a need that we might have had to outsource or use internal personnel to solve can be solved directly with AI.&quot; He mentioned that some small and medium-sized factories and even large factories in the gaming field have used AI, but the degree of application is different. The degree of modification varies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yuan gave an example. For example, to draw 100 original paintings, it would take 5 original painters to work for 3 months or more. Now you may only need one original artist to produce 100 pictures using AI, and he will make the modifications. This is a model that has been widely used commercially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yuan said that the current impact of AI is mainly on the lower market, and what it can replace is that part of the market that does not have high pursuit of quality and artistic attainments, such as game advertisements on web pages, many of which are drawn by AI. . Some game types that do not have high requirements for art packaging can also use AI, but for some more demanding needs, it will take time to design and polish, and currently AI is far from being able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng’s observation is similar to this. Major manufacturers are also using AI, but most of it is only for auxiliary reference and not a complete replacement. Because the current technology cannot be replaced, but it will indeed replace some small companies that can quickly issue orders. &quot;Such market demand has always existed, but it used to take a while for painters to piece it together. AI can be very fast, in a few minutes Or a few seconds, so it threatens some companies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of the impact of AI is becoming more and more widespread. Many game companies have begun to lay off art design positions, and many companies have reduced their original paintings. Teacher position recruitment. An original artist at a game company in a second-tier city recalled that it was very popular to find a job a few years ago, but now the company has laid off a large number of people, leaving only three original artist positions, and all the others have been laid off. Large factories also have a sense of crisis. A painter from a large factory mentioned that the company has spent almost a year training AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When original painters go for interviews, the salary can easily be reduced and the salary will not be too high. Some companies that deal with original painting outsourcing needs obviously feel that the demand has become less. They didn’t worry about orders a month ago, but now they may have one There are only a few orders per month. Because some requirements can already be completed using AI, this is the dilemma of the original painter.&quot; Lin Yuan&#39;s game project art director mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;AI will start by replacing labor force, just like robots replace workers in factories. Now AI is the robots in the creation factory. Those jobs that tend to be repetitive and have not so high technical content will be replaced. . Original painters will become more and more popular, and the entire industry will become more and more elite, and there will definitely be fewer positions. Unless the overall market size becomes larger.&quot; Lin Yuan believes that the emergence of AI is to meet market demand, and what can be used by existing If replaced by AI technology, it will naturally be replaced. With the improvement of AI technology in the future, the sense of crisis in the profession of painter will become stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even painters who have not been affected by AI have discovered that after the emergence of AI, customers are becoming more and more demanding on time. To a certain extent, this is a demand created by a fast-paced era, which has also pushed back changes in the entire production chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Comparison of the illustrator&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a snow fish&quot; painting (left picture) and the image generated by Trik AI &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (the illustrator&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a snow fish&quot; Fish&quot; social account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is difficult to prove infringement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The training database of generative AI is very large, which also makes the protection of intellectual property rights a difficult problem at this stage. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Yunting, a senior partner and intellectual property lawyer at Shanghai Dabang Law Firm, told Southern People Weekly that the main difficulty lies in providing evidence. The author has no way to prove that the platform used his own works for training. According to my country&#39;s copyright law, those who use other people&#39;s copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence must obtain the copyright owner&#39;s permission. However, the training process is not transparent, so it is difficult for authors to protect their rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also mentioned that even if the works generated by artificial intelligence are relatively similar to those of the original author, if they are included in the characteristic files (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Refers to inconsistencies in the unique elements of the work - for example, Tencent&#39;s logo is two penguins, and the penguins&#39; scarves or bows are the feature files. If the feature files are inconsistent, it is just a black and white penguin - no will be considered to constitute copyright infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin, a lawyer at Shanghai Mankiw Law Firm, also pointed out that according to existing laws and principles, if a platform uses the author&#39;s original works for AI training and content generation without obtaining copyright or copyright-authorized works, there will be Risk of copyright infringement. The difficulty is that my country&#39;s Copyright Law does not protect abstract &quot;ideas&quot; such as styles or concepts, but only protects &quot;expressions of ideas&quot; such as specific elements in paintings. However, it is precisely &quot;ideas&quot; that can reflect the author&#39;s originality. . In this context, if the author discovers that the AI ​​painting has a similar style to his own work, it will be more difficult to defend his rights; only when the AI ​​painting is obviously plagiarized, he can claim infringement liability against him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;493&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many original artists on Xiaohongshu have issued suspension notices&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to prove it Regarding AI infringement of original creators, Liu Honglin pointed out that current AI technology is developing rapidly, the selection of materials is highly random, and the calculation rules of algorithms are complex and diverse, making it easy to avoid traces of &quot;plagiarism&quot; in generative works from a technical perspective. Therefore, in order to prove that the AI ​​image generator infringes their copyright, it is necessary to prove which specific work was copied into the AI ​​algorithm system. However, the &quot;opacity&quot; of the algorithm makes this proof idea not easy to implement in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the platform user agreement may also allow users to agree to the platform’s use for AI training without reading it carefully. One of the reasons why the Xiaohongshu incident triggered protests from painters is that according to Xiaohongshu’s user agreement, the platform has the right to directly use users’ works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Yunting believes that if a platform uses users&#39; works to train artificial intelligence, it should obtain separate consent from the original author, rather than obtaining authorization with just a user agreement. &quot;Even if this user agreement is signed by the platform, it may be deemed as a standard clause that excludes the other party&#39;s main rights because no consideration is provided, which is also commonly known as the overlord clause.&quot; Liu Honglin also pointed out that some have a significant impact on user rights and interests. According to the terms and conditions, the platform is obliged to remind users. Users have the right to claim that the contract is invalid if there is obvious inequality or clauses that exempt themselves from liability and increase the liability of the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Effective modifications can avoid heavy traces of AI, avoid infringement and avoid problems of too low quality.” Lin Yuan believes that the problem of infringement is difficult to solve. If you only use your own pictures or When commercial images are used to feed AI, the scope of learning is relatively narrow. To avoid infringement, the current practice is to make secondary modifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also more cautious companies. A scene art practitioner at an overseas game company told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that this issue mainly depends on the company, and different companies have different attitudes towards tools. &quot;Our company prohibits AI drawing simply because we cannot control the source of materials for AI software. You may encounter potential copyright disputes. Rather than getting involved in such litigation, it is better to prohibit it in advance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin pointed out that the intellectual property issues caused by artificial intelligence deep learning are more complicated than general copyright infringement. . The infringement determination principles applied in traditional copyright law cannot fully respond to the infringement issues of artificial intelligence deep learning, and relevant laws and regulations need to be gradually improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin believes that the key to the conflict between AI and painters is that “there is currently a lack of a suitable profit distribution mechanism between the two parties. The AI ​​database uses the author’s works for data training, but there is no corresponding incentive mechanism. This is also something that the AI ​​industry needs to focus on in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng, who started learning painting at the age of 5, has a corner in his home dedicated to painting, where he stores several thick albums of paintings from childhood to adulthood. Sometimes, looking through past paintings, a certain scene from my growth will reappear like a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She remembered that one of the paintings was a still life gouache painting in high school, which was criticized by the teacher as having &quot;big problems&quot;. &quot;At the time, I felt like the sky was falling.&quot; But it was also the teacher&#39;s guidance. , also made her decide to focus on color and use color to express emotions. That painting was a key step in her growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connection between painting and emotion is a part that AI cannot replace. Her current paintings are mainly in the cyberpunk style, but they are not mechanical in cold colors such as purple and blue. She chooses cheerful colors, mainly pink, a high-saturation cyberpunk. Lin Meng said, &quot;I hope that technology and machines will not be so cold, innocent and warm, and can be associated with cyberpunk. It is also an expectation for technology. I believe it can reach a balance point with human beings.&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(To protect the privacy of the interviewees, Li Ke, Lin Meng, and Lin Yuan are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以新一轮冲突已造成双方超过3500人死亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258616]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Statistics released by the Palestinian health department show that as of 11:55 local time on the 14th, a new outbreak in Palestine and Israel Since the first round of conflict, 2,215 people have been killed and 8,714 injured in the Gaza Strip; 54 people have been killed and more than 1,100 injured in the West Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/14/r3ul30Yf0qpASfHeUb5c5ZXZyQhhsrSXuY3QL1Jt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;533&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/14/r3ul30Yf0qpASfHeUb5c5ZXZyQhhsrSXuY3QL1Jt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254060&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; In addition, according to a report by the Jerusalem Post on the evening of the 13th, data from the Israeli Ministry of Health showed that since the current round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the number of Israeli deaths has exceeded 1,300, and the number of injured has reached at least 3,484. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of conflict between Palestine and Israel has killed more than 3,500 people on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[诺贝尔文学奖得主格丽克逝世：她的诗有超越创伤与丧失的力量]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258626]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/ 10/30/8e55339d6974425b5125d21cabec25cb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height=&quot;738&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/20/10/30/8e55339d6974425b5125d21cabec25cb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;117172&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;Picture/Katherine Wolkoff&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The word &#39;poet&#39; must be used with caution; it names a desire, not a profession.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Years ago, Louise Glick wrote in an autobiographical essay: The desire to make art produces an ongoing experience of longing, a restlessness that sometimes ends in a romantic or sexual way. There always seemed to be something ahead, the next poem or the next story, visible but out of reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To fully understand it is to let it haunt and torment; a certain sound, a stone, becomes a torment - the poem that symbolizes this sound seems to be somewhere, completed, It is like a lighthouse, but the difference is that when you swim towards it, it retreats.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his nearly 60 years of poetry career, he has accumulated 13 poetry collections, which are stacked in the corner of the room. Occasionally, Glick would deliberately suppress some &quot;sneaky&quot; complacency and lament that he &quot;didn&#39;t waste time.&quot; Now, a new stamen has been added to her crown - the Nobel Prize for Literature. The award citation praised her &quot;unpretentious poetic voice that universalizes individual existence.&quot; Her first reaction after winning the award was: Oops, I won’t have any friends! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps in response to the suffering and shadow of the current global epidemic, jury chairman Anders Olsen quoted &quot;Snowdrops&quot; in his speech, which was the novel that won Glick the Pulitzer Prize. Award-winning poetry collection &quot;Wild Iris&quot; (1992). It depicts the miraculous return of life after winter and seems to symbolize the poet&#39;s &quot;radical transformation and rebirth,&quot; who, despite being constantly troubled by life&#39;s mistakes and changing circumstances, is still able to &quot;make leaps from a profound sense of loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She saw a vision of death at the age of seven, and was choked by anorexia as a teenager. The precocious girl shouldered the destiny of the poet to &quot;witness&quot;. With the help of myths and religious fables, she traveled between the holy and the underworld, transcending the &quot;confessional poets&quot;. As predicted in the poem, she is indeed more like Lazarus than Joan of Arc - the person in the Bible who was saved and resurrected by Jesus, whom the poet Sylvia Plath wanted to &quot;imitate&quot; but ended up The lost road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In her poems, the self listens to its remaining dreams and fantasies, and no one is stronger than her in the face of its own fantasies.&quot; Olson said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hungry is not for experience, but for understanding​&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I was born cautious, in Taurus under the sign./I grew up and thrived on an island,/in the second half of the twentieth century;/the shadow of the Holocaust/barely touched me.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1943 Glück was born in Long Island, New York, to a Hungarian-Jewish family. These few words are the &quot;autobiography&quot; she wrote for herself. As the title of her second collection of poems suggests, this &quot;house on the swamp&quot; is not stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her father is a successful businessman with a long-cherished wish to be a writer, and he often tells her legends and historical anecdotes such as Joan of Arc. My mother graduated from Wesleyan Women&#39;s College, where many ladies were born, and served as the &quot;arbiter&quot; of the family&#39;s art education. She also had a sister who would become a banker in Manhattan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Glick&#39;s writing is not Cold War-style politicization, but personal politics. Her writing returns to the identification of human identity. This is a key point. All the women in her works are Looking for my own voice.&quot; Fan Jinghua, the translator who first introduced Glick to China, pointed out that the rise of personal writing in the American poetry tradition, including the rise of Western feminism, is the reason why Glick has won many important awards over the years. background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Glick, family seems like her &quot;concentration camp&quot;. &quot;I have a strong desire to speak, but this desire is often thwarted: my sentences, if interrupted, are completely altered—transformed rather than interpreted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short , &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;She does not meet the definition of a child: full of hope for everything.&quot;&lt;/span>; As an adult, she wrote in her poem Wrote, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;All the defense, spiritual stubbornness, persistence/taking off the mask of ordinary people and revealing the tragedy,/these are actually the The ignorance of the world./Means that which is partial, changeable, capricious -/everything that is excluded from the &#39;absolute&#39;.&quot; (&quot;Birthday&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the real The family trauma occurred 7 days before her birth, when her &quot;sister&quot; died unfortunately. &quot;Her death is not my experience, but her absence is; her death made me born.&quot; Glick later realized that she made such a dazzling declaration in her first collection of poems: &quot;Birth, not birth.&quot; Death is the unbearable loss.&quot; (&quot;Cottonmouth Snake Country&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tension between mother and daughter turns into a zero-sum game between the two sisters competing for maternal love in fantasy. In &quot;Ararat&quot;, the &quot;Book of Death&quot;, Glick wrote, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When my sister dies,/my mother&#39;s heart changes Very cold, very hard, like a tiny iron pendant./ Later I felt that my sister’s body/ was a magnet. I could feel it sucking/ my mother’s heart into the earth,/ so that it would grow.” (“Loss” &quot;Love&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also rewrote the story of Solomon&#39;s verdict. When two mothers fight for one child, the mother is torn between the two daughters, and she is &quot;willing to destroy herself&quot; to prove who is the righteous child and cannot bear to split her mother apart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This mental symptom is related to the early realization of the &quot;destiny&quot; of writing. Not only out of the overwhelming will to get rid of her mother, but also the &quot;obsession with purity and control&quot;, when she was a teenager, Glick began to strictly implement a diet, from 85 pounds to 75 pounds, to some extent, she also imitated Zhen. De&#39;s asceticism eventually developed into anorexia, and he almost starved to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It quietly begins/in some girls/the fear of death, in the form/of devotion to hunger, / Because a woman’s body is a tomb; it will accept / anything. I remember / lying in bed at night / touching soft, discrete breasts, / touching, at 15 / the disturbing flesh / that I would have sacrificed / until Limbs no longer / blossom and escape: I feel / what I feel now, align these words - / the same need for perfection, / death just a by-product.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The need for perfection Linked to forms of resistance, body and mind are both unified and separated, leading to a &quot;metaphysical hunger&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Hunger is not for experience/ It is to understand as if it were available in the abstract.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven years of psychoanalytic treatment saved Glick. After dropping out of high school, she interrupted her formal professional education and entered a poetry seminar at Columbia University, where she studied under two American poet laureates, Leonie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Under the influence of the latter, she changed from being arrogant and arrogant to being humble and restrained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said frankly, &quot;Psychoanalysis taught me to think. It taught me to use my ideological tendencies to oppose the clearly expressed parts of my thoughts. It taught me to use doubt to check my own words and discover (self-expression It gave me the intellectual task of transforming paralysis—an extreme form of self-doubt—into insight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/30/5baeee3b828154edc453d9aa22355dc5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height=&quot; 656&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/30/5baeee3b828154edc453d9aa22355dc5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;117173&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Some works by Louise Glick&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When I feel safe , I can love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Glick viewed this experience in a positive light, &quot;The feeling of hunger helped me control my greed, which was very helpful in gaining an independent self.&quot; And this seems to be It also established her own &quot;poetics of desire&quot;: in love, nothing is desired. She expresses her desire for someone or something in the world that she wants to possess by saying &quot;no&quot; instead of &quot;yes.&quot; What is undoubtedly revealed here is the finitude of human beings. Just like &quot;Ripe Peaches&quot;, from the door to the dining table, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Certainty, a dead thing/...accompanied by that obscene mouth/ Hungry for love -/it&#39;s like love&quot;&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, because love is as scary as death, this has been planted since childhood: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Fear, of loss The fear of disease; / the fear of disease wearing the bride’s white dress” (&quot;Joan of Arc&quot;)&lt;/span>;; and the mother who “knitted red scarves of various colors” also said to her grown-up son: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s not surprising that you are like this, / afraid of blood, your women / are like brick walls after brick walls.&quot; (&quot;Poetry of Love&quot; )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the representative work of his mature period, the collection of poems &quot;Averno&quot;, Glick reinterpreted the story of Persephone in Greek mythology: she accidentally ate Pluto&#39;s pomegranate, Kidnapped as a wife and returning home &quot;stained with red juice&quot;, she realizes that &quot;she has been a prisoner since she was born a daughter&quot;; Pluto wants to say, &quot;I love you and nothing can hurt you&quot;, But he thought it was a lie, and what he finally said was, &quot;You are dead, nothing can hurt you.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Burning Heart&quot; and Dante&#39;s &quot;Divine Comedy: Inferno&quot; The protagonist Franziska&#39;s dialogue explains the power of the &quot;male gaze&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Both fire and eternity/... even when I am touched Before, I already belonged to you;/You only need to look at me.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A more controversial poem is &quot;Mountain Plum Blossom&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I hate them./I hate them as much as I hate sex,/that man&#39;s mouth/it blocks my mouth, that man&#39;s body/it makes people limp&quot;&lt;/span>; , the upper and lower positions of the body during sex, are as conventional as choosing which flower to &quot;light up the yard,&quot; but are essentially rooted in forced silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Glick has always refused to be labeled as a &quot;hyphenated poet&quot;, and &quot;feminism&quot; is the most prominent prefix. Glick once emphasized that she and her sister were raised &quot;to reorganize, to achieve and to aspire to glorious achievements... We were never asked to believe that such achievements were impossible, either because of our gender Or our historical period.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is logically puzzled by the determination of some women today to write as women, since this appears to be an existing notion of ambition being constrained by gender differences. Rather than gendered distinctions, she cares about a &quot;bigger distinction&quot; between symmetry and asymmetry, harmony and homophony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we cannot forget that Glick calls herself an &quot;untrustworthy speaker&quot; in her poem. In her case, language is a medium that switches between frankness and disguise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother suffering from postpartum depression in &quot;First Born&quot;, the emotionally numb and silent daughter mourning her father in &quot;Ararat&quot;, the anger in the face of cheating and broken marriage in &quot;The Pasture&quot; The provocative wife... These images more or less reflect the loss and isolation that Glück constantly encountered in his life: he was divorced twice, and a house was burned down by fire. From then on, she became &quot;a dreamer and a viewer&quot;, an author &quot;obsessed with loss&quot;, &quot;waiting for 20 years to endure the inescapable loss&quot;. &lt;p>; /span>;This straightforward spoken language suddenly appears at the end of the entire collection of poems &quot;Rebirth&quot;, leaving a blank space with an aftertaste, which is also humorous and spicy. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I once told myself/From nothing/Nothing can be taken away./But can you still love anyone?/When I When I feel safe, I can love&quot;&lt;/span>; - this is the answer given by &quot;New Life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Greek mythology, Dido committed suicide because of the loss of Aeneas; when they reunited in the underworld, he asked for her forgiveness, but she walked away without saying a word. In Glick&#39;s writing, she asked the goddess of fate to allow him to repay her passion, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Even if the time is short. What is the difference between a short time and a lifetime: Indeed, in these moments./They are all the same, all eternity.&quot; (&quot;Queen of Carthage&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem was included in the book &quot;America&#39;s Favorite Poems&quot; 》Anthology. In his introductory work on Glück, scholar Daniel Morris noted with interest this anecdote: An administrative assistant in Kansas City, Missouri, described in detail how the poem spoke to her and helped her gradually come out of it. Intense intimacy with a scientist, moving on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Individualistic and universalistic, ordinary and oracular, ephemeral and mythical, tragic and comic...&quot; Daniel Morris pointed out that Glick&#39;s &quot;subject status&quot; in contemporary literature ” has enough room for malleability, it’s hard to think of another American poet since Bishop who has attracted such a wide range of critics, readers, and contemporaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick&#39;s early &quot;Garden&quot; poems include &quot;fear of birth&quot;, &quot;fear of love&quot; and &quot;fear of burial&quot;, which are always Glück&#39;s The core theme, but the song &quot;Garden&quot; mixed in it still overflows with the true desire for love: &quot;But still/there is something you need,/your body so soft and alive, among the animals of stone./Admit it: being like them is scary,/more than hurts.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No wonder the poet Zhou Yan said: After Plath, how do women love? I recommend reading Glick. &quot;For a poet like her, if you are deceived by the surface coldness, aloofness, repulsion, and even the rudeness from time to time, you will be stupid. This kind of poet does not waste energy on the surface. What she focuses on is Human emotions, spirits and symbols. So it must be compassionate and warm inside. It is not the kind of poet who is cold or numb inside. This is the fundamental difference.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This voice is in &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; 》 is even more firm: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;He is already a dead person, sacrifice/because of the part that can love, the part that can die.&quot;&lt;/span >;Translator Liu Xiangyang summarized Glück&#39;s expression as &quot;love is greater than death.&quot; Desire goes beyond the trappings of self-protective life and is connected to the recognition of virtue and glory. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let more voices fall off the paper&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was from &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; that Glick drew inspiration from mythological characters, those who were abandoned and abandoned. The voice of punishment and betrayal was re-contextualized in modern society and became her personal and universal &quot;mask&quot;. In the words of poetry critic Helen Vendler, &quot;give experience a permanent mythical form&quot; instead of turning your autobiographical experience itself into mythology like Plath, Lowell and other confessional poets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick regarded the first collection of poems with the imprint of the &quot;Confessional School&quot; as a &quot;failure&quot;. Although the Nobel Prize committee complimented her by saying that &quot;in her own severity and unwillingness to accept simple principles of faith, she is more like Emily Dickinson than any other poet,&quot; Glick said that Dickinson was just her &quot; One of the Early Heroes,” which later became unreadable, like chalk on a blackboard or scratches of fingernails, or the voice of a crazy little lady—like a kitten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;American Narcissism,&quot; she pointedly pointed out the seductive misleading nature of Rilkean romanticism, &quot;In our poetry, narcissism reaches its most terrifying definition: It is not an extension of the self but a substitute for it, as if the lifeless mirror somehow allowed the surviving boy to survive.&quot; The end result: &quot;He reaches the end of his insight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;There is an automatic sentence pattern in Glick&#39;s mind, starting with &quot;Poets should not...&quot;, and the following blanks can be filled with anything. Originally, teaching also fell into this category. But she unexpectedly accepted a teaching position, taught poetry classes at Yale every fall, and served as a judge for the Yale Young Poets Prize. She was grateful for this and believed that it inspired her creative motivation. The rhythm and structure of one of the young poets gave her great inspiration. She also apologized to him specifically for this, fearing any suspicion of &quot;plagiarism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is as strict with her students as she is with herself. The technique for preparing new poems is to completely forget the previous one. Each book is a resistance to the previous one. &quot;I have nothing to do with polishing milestones.&quot; Interest.&quot; Glick said in the interview, &quot;What I am thinking about is how to make the poems live longer. In these ever-expanding poems, he needs to reach different destinations from different starting points.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Typical Glick, with a language style that is &quot;alloy-like&quot;, always with coldness and restraint. However, different from the gloomy image on paper, she would imitate horse braying when reading poetry and also liked to laugh loudly. Humor itself has become a weapon for her style renewal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick said she always tries to &quot;let more voices fall onto the page&quot; in order to shift gears at any time. She likes poems like this: you think you are reading one poem, but you are actually reading another, and then a third. &quot;Each sentence itself is not derived from the previous sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of musical The polyphony has already appeared in &quot;Meadow&quot;, and Mozart&#39;s opera has become the aria in the poem. Poet Nicholas Kristof commented on the collection of poems &quot;Averno&quot; and said that the 18 poems are rich and harmonious, &quot;with complex interrelated images, recurring characters, overlapping themes, forming a unified collection, but among them Every part counts as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And all her collections of works are not a unified collection? When the translator Liu Xiangyang contacted Glick in 2007 to discuss the publication of the Chinese version of &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, Glick was reluctant at first and hoped to publish it in full. In the United States, &quot;Poetry 1962-2012&quot;, which was published in 2012, did not use the title of &quot;Complete Works&quot;. It did not make any modifications except for proofreading, and there was no personal introduction. &quot;Poetry is the only thing she left to the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the collection of poems &quot;Village Life&quot; ten years ago, the 66-year-old Glick seemed to declare some kind of impossible truce: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Body, thinking that we won&#39;t be together for much longer, I/begin to feel that I have a new kind of tenderness for you, which is very raw and unfamiliar, / Just like the love of my youth that I can remember.&quot; (&quot;Crossroads&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is still writing, and she is not writing slowly. The 2014 collection of poems, &quot;A Night of Faithfulness and Virtue,&quot; continues to approach the theme of death with extraordinary grace and lightness. The latest collection of poems is also expected to be published in the United States next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, &quot;hunger&quot; was always present. This is Sisyphean drudgery, &quot;The artist lies because he is haunted by arrival, he feels that the pinnacle is where he will dwell forever, a place where his burdens are transposed: Every moment of my life, I stand At the top of this mountain. My hands are empty. And that stone has increased the height of the mountain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s very different now - there&#39;s no rush at all.&quot; Glick in recent years In the interview, she admitted that she could sit on the terrace and write trivia while thinking, &quot;This is the most beautiful thing in life, the sweetest thing.&quot; Just change the sentence and think, oh, this is okay. That sense of joy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It was a beautiful summer, everything was growing in the garden, and there were no obligations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Reference: Louise Glück, &quot;Alloy of Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Until the World Reflects the Deepest Needs of the Soul&quot; (translated by Liu Xiangyang and Fan Jinghua); Louise Glück, &quot;American Originality&quot; &quot;; Daniel Morris, &quot;The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王毅同美国国务卿布林肯通电话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258628]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 14, 2023, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister, communicated with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at request Telephone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken introduced his current visit to the Middle East and the US position on the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi said that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues to escalate and faces the risk of losing control. China opposes all actions that harm civilians and condemns all practices that violate international law. China believes that safeguarding its own security cannot be at the expense of harming innocent civilians. There is no way out through military means, and using violence for violence will only create a vicious cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi pointed out that the top priority is to cease fire and cool down the situation as soon as possible to avoid exacerbating humanitarian disasters; abide by international humanitarian law and open up channels for humanitarian relief; support the United Nations in building international consensus and the Security Council in playing its due role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi emphasized that the fundamental way to solve the Palestinian issue lies in implementing the &quot;two-state solution&quot;, establishing an independent Palestinian state, and realizing peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.

China will continue to promote peace talks in accordance with the basic principles proposed by President Xi Jinping. The United States should effectively play a constructive role and push the issue back to the track of political settlement as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken said that the United States supports the &quot;two-state solution&quot; to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli issue, supports the United Nations in playing a role in easing the situation and providing humanitarian relief, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two sides also briefly exchanged views on Sino-US relations. Wang Yi said that China and the United States have recently carried out a series of high-level contacts, and bilateral relations have stopped declining and stabilized, which has been welcomed by the people of the two countries and the international community. It is hoped that the United States will work with China halfway, implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Bali, overcome interference and remove obstacles, lengthen the positive list and shorten the negative list, effectively respect China&#39;s core interests and major concerns, and push China-U.S. relations back to the track of stable development. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken said that the United States is willing to work with China to implement the important consensus reached by President Biden and President Xi Jinping in Bali, manage U.S.-China relations responsibly, and promote the stability of U.S.-China relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D还原水下绝境，亚洲第一人陨命九顿天窗洞穴深处]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258618]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[154套新房雪藏12年后打折抛售，一个多月内近九成未成交]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258601]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《坚如磐石》编剧陈宇：在经典叙事中，做人性实验]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258592]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/KyKxXJnZBTyfvTFlRrv8TG4pP5T55r4tXATQia9k.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/KyKxXJnZBTyfvTFlRrv8TG4pP5T5 5r4tXATQia9k. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253693&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; will be released on National Day in 2023. The script was originally written by Chen Yu. Chen Yu is a screenwriter, director, and professor at Peking University School of Arts. A few years ago, after he finished writing this story, he felt that he had &quot;made a fortune&quot; and wanted to find a strong director to work with. He turned it to Zhang Yimou, who decided to shoot it the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So there was the first collaboration between Chen Yu and Zhang Yimou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, the day before the movie was officially released, Zhang Yimou, Chen Yu and the leading actors sat in a row on the edge of the stage at the premiere at Beijing Wanda CBD Cinema. Chen Yu recalled that after Zhang Yimou read the script, he made an appointment with him for the next week to discuss the script. A week? Chen Yu was confused. Zhang Yimou said, just plan it for a week and talk every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day later, on the night when &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; was released in theaters, I met Chen Yu in his studio. When talking about the process, he said, &quot;I have to understand that he is I know what he is thinking about and his current artistic creation philosophy. On the contrary, he is also curious about me.&quot; As a scholar-type creator, Chen Yu inevitably thinks that the film they are about to make will occupy the highest position in the coordinates of film history. where? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After chatting for a week, the two reached a consensus on their creative views and methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the audience saw in the finished film was this story: a bus bombing occurred in Jinjiang City, and the suspect died on the spot. Subsequently, Li Zhitian, chairman of Jinwu Group, and the deputy mayor were implicated. Zheng Gang&#39;s infighting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many wonderful group scenes in the film, and several main characters are also dramatic: Deputy Mayor Zheng Gang, played by Zhang Guoli, married the daughter of a high-ranking official, and along the way, he did whatever it takes to get his official position; Li, played by Yu Hewei, Shida was born into a poor soldier. He started from scratch and grew into a big company. The group is involved in many industries such as real estate and entertainment. He always has to deal with complex interpersonal relationships, including winning over officials, guarding against his peers who want to conquer the world together, caring for his innocent daughter, and investigating those who want to help him. The superior son-in-law. Since that explosion, the fact that the officials represented by Zheng Gang and the businessmen represented by Li Zhitian have been colluding for many years has gradually been revealed, and their relationship has gradually broken down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Jianming, a police officer played by Lei Jiayin, is involved in the investigation of the bombing case. He is highly intelligent but slow-witted. He relies on intuition and experience to investigate the case. He is led along the way, and finally realizes that there may be an unscrupulous person behind his adoptive father. A black hole, in which his secret life experience is hidden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holiday are over, and the National Day schedule has concluded. &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; leads the box office with 880 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hitting it off with &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;, Chen Yu served as the original author and screenwriter and collaborated with Zhang Yimou on two other films, which were released in the past two Spring Festival festivals. &quot;Sniper&quot; (2022) sees the big from the small, focusing on the cold gun battle between the squad leader and soldiers of the fifth squad and the enemy on the battlefield to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; (2023) is based on the suspense genre, supplemented by comedy elements. It tells the story of the civil strife in Qin Hui&#39;s house after the death of the famous anti-gold general Yue Fei. It ranked first in the 2023 Spring Festival box office with a score of 4.544 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three films co-written and directed by Chen Yu and Zhang Yimou show some commonalities, such as the creators&#39; fascination with drama and their pursuit of classic narratives. &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; has a solid plot, and &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; and &quot;Sniper&quot; are in line with the &quot;Three Unities&quot; principle, telling stories that serve one theme in one day and one space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/tK4paBl06q4ikz59llIIfdapVcVBsY4rjGH9nYHI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/tK4paBl06q4ikz59llIIfdapVcVBsY4rjGH9nYHI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253694&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A group photo of the main creative staff of &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;People may go to the opposite side of themselves, Chen Yu said. Before he became obsessed with content, he had an extreme fascination with form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went to college in Xi&#39;an, &quot;an extremely simple environment.&quot; While others in the cafeteria were queuing up to serve rice and dishes with stainless steel plates, he insisted on holding two blue and white porcelain plates under his arm. He used this as an example to describe the artist-like self he had in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I entered the Beijing Film Academy to study as a graduate student in the directing department. My first assignment was titled &quot;What is Love?&quot; Chen Yu&#39;s film looked like this: two teacups of the same color (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;represents a pair of lovers&lt;/span>;) was put into a tray, &quot;entering into some kind of agreement or marriage&quot; - he recalled with interest: a teacup Leave and put together with teacups of other colors; four teacups form new pairs; finally they separate again, leaving only one teacup on each tray. This is a story made entirely of still images: love is the sets of teacups on the tray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You can also say it is very unique. I was quite proud of it back then, but today it seems to be a clever creative attitude.&quot; Chen Yu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating with a master&#39;s degree, Chen Yu felt that he still lacked in the principles of dramatization and actor guidance, so he decided to study for a doctorate at the Central Academy of Drama. In the interview, he recalled that it was &quot;an enlightening help&quot; to him. In his doctoral thesis, he compared the nature of theater and film. The principles of drama provided a methodological fulcrum for him to write film scripts in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Egg Fried Rice&quot; (2011), which can be seen on streaming media, is a work written and directed by him. From the special era to the reform and opening up, and the rise of the market, three children in Beijing&#39;s hutongs grew up. Some stayed where they were, while others went south to make their own way. In the extremely small changes in the relationship between the characters, images of big history occasionally appear alternately. This film was shortlisted for the main competition of the 18th Beijing University Student Film Festival and won the Best First Film Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change in creative outlook coincides with the growth of personal mind. &quot;From a relatively extreme self, I grew up, matured, and formed a relationship with this society. My self echoed and resonated with other people.&quot; Chen Yu summed it up this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of creation, Chen Yu turned to classic narrative. The principles he agrees with include: the narrative must be complete - have a beginning, development, climax, and ending, and each part fully completes the corresponding function; there is a relatively scientific set of Effective solutions reveal, hide, and convey information within the timeline; the narrative should conform to values ​​that most people can appreciate, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to make a &quot;hard-hitting&quot; movie that was solid enough from plot, structure to character design. Do you want to chew this hard nut? he asked himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; was created under this background. Thinking and creating is hard. It is normal to sit in front of a blank word document, watch the cursor flash, and sit and think for hours. The longest time, for three days in a row, Chen Yu didn&#39;t write a word. At that time, he went to eat and sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/B503aQQiAaFpH0MWrMopgpEoeZFpxaQeIlHaYSkD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/B503aQQiAaFpH0MWrMopgpEoeZFpxaQeIlHaYSkD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253695&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Sniper&quot; stills&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Early 2020 , Zhang Yimou called Chen Yu and wanted to make a book. He had three requirements: talk about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, not making grand narratives, and strengthening the charm of the narrative - this is the starting point of &quot;Sniper&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; is a house in Shanxi. Zhang Yimou took Chen Yu to visit and asked him to think of a story based on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After cooperating on three films, it is normal for the screenwriter and director to have differences and arguments. For example, for a character, somewhere, Zhang Yimou thinks he should be stronger, but Chen Yu thinks he should hide. There are many times like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, Chen Yu will turn the argument into an explanation, &quot;What did we think at the beginning? We have several methods. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method? In summary, I recommend this method .Send it to him. We will not discuss this issue. I will implement it according to his final decision. Let’s move on to the next question. As a person I respect and as a director, I believe in him from any angle. The final decision was the one that best suited the movie.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yimou once commented on Chen Yu: &quot;Chen Yu, you can still come up with some good stories and tell them very well. Ups and downs.&quot; In the future, they will collaborate on a fourth film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From &quot;Rock Solid&quot; to &quot;Sniper&quot; to &quot;River Red&quot;, the scripts can withstand analysis, and there is suspense at the beginning: &quot;Sniper&quot; is set in the vast snow, and the US military wants to capture a sharpshooter. , and the Fifth Squadron was ordered to bring back the prisoners of war; the beginning of &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; is a messenger of death, a lost secret letter, and a panicked soldier; &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; leads the audience into a case where the murderer is clearly visible car crash and fatal explosion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The academic article &quot;Genre Film Creation Methodology Based on &quot;Narrative Dynamics&quot; - A Dialogue with the Original Writer and Screenwriter of the Film &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;&quot; published in the core journal &quot;Contemporary Film&quot; in 2023 In &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;, Chen Yu used the concept of &quot;dimensionality improvement&quot; when analyzing &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;: in the seemingly unlucky soldier Zhang Da, the dimensionality improvement in plot actions is reflected in &quot;survival by solving crimes - assassination and revenge - forcing poetry and dedicating oneself to justice&quot; changes; and at the same time complete the dimensionality of the characters, &quot;spy and ruthless soldier - astute assassin - hero and martyr&quot;; thereby realizing the dimensionality of the theme, from survival, to revenge, to &quot;the manifestation of the spirit of family and country&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good script must have precise purpose, structure and fulcrum. However, Chen Yu emphasized that the narrative ultimately points to the exploration of the essence of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the story developed, the audience discovered that the squad leader of the fifth squad in &quot;Sniper&quot; fought against the enemy under extremely limited objective conditions, completed an almost impossible task, and showed the light of humanity; &quot; In &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;, the soldier being wrongly accused is not the main plot. The failed assassination of several small figures is not the ending. It is a poem that makes everyone die for it. In &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, the death of a stakeholder company boss is not the final answer. Because in addition to money, there is money, and there is also an official position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/KGq2LVKvpgX5gvCmiyXmz6zlc8yBpfH6u8AhDH0x.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;609&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/KGq2LVKvpgX5gvCmiyXmz6zlc8yBpfH6u8AhDH0x.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253692&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; stills&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The blend of animality and divinity may be The Essence of Human Nature - A Conversation with Chen Yu&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The little glimmer of light in the darkness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the week when you and Zhang Yimou discussed &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, what kind of conceptual consensus did you find? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first sentence he asked me was, what kind of movie do I think this is? What kind of video is it close to existing? I&#39;ll give you a rough idea of ​​what I expect this film to be in the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; at the script stage? 》Close to what? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will use some keywords: cold, cold, hard core, explosion, depth of humanity, light of humanity. This is a crime film, but it is actually about human desires. When desires are alienated, what kind of tragedy will happen? There is the alienation of the villain, but in the process of fighting against dark things, the light of humanity shown by the struggle of the positive characters under alienation is what I am particularly looking forward to presenting. I am not obsessed with the beauty of darkness, but the little glimmer of light in the darkness. So I focused the story on Su Jianming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The darkness between the two big guys (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zheng Gang and Li Zhitian&lt;/span>;) The fighting and game show the wonders of human nature after it has been alienated. Su Jianming, a normal and sympathetic person, was strangled in the middle. He showed the strength of a person in the face of a powerful whirlpool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you wrote this original script, you used what you just said Are those keywords consciously connected? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, my creative concepts and creative methodologies began to become relatively mature and stable. I wanted to write a solid classicist tragedy. Because everyone has desires, and desires are distorted under specific periods, circumstances, and behaviors, people will inevitably be swallowed up by the darkness formed by the people around them, including themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aesthetics has formed a classic narrative today, classical - you can say it is classic, in line with most people&#39;s aesthetics, and has a classical meaning. I think it is by far the most effective narrative method that is acceptable to most people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many stages in the history of film where we are all exploring new film languages, and I was very obsessed with these. But after actually entering the industry, I found that those experiments should be internalized and serve the narrative. I would make it my first goal to tell the story well and clearly, instead of letting being unique and clever become my focus. Hands, I began to return to the classic narrative. When writing &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, first of all, I started from this perspective. I wanted to challenge the hard nut of classic narrative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, I am particularly fascinated by the understanding and recognition of human nature. A story ultimately points to an understanding of human nature. I think human nature is a black box, and studying oneself is the most difficult. We can only keep experimenting, looking at human behavior under different experimental conditions, and finding out what the characteristics of human nature are. Quite hard to find. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many authors write about human nature. People want to realize their desires in the name of liberating their nature. In essence, it is animal nature and bestiality. This is just one animal. The other end is divinity, and some people can sacrifice their own interests and lives for some noble value. For example, sacrificing one&#39;s life to save a friend is completely contrary to animal nature. In animal nature, I must save my own life, even snatching a bite of food from my own child&#39;s mouth and eating it. The aspect that appears between animality and divinity, or the blending of animality and divinity, may be the essence of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially after being influenced by classic drama works, I returned to the creation and exploration of narrative art that I considered to be more grand and mainstream. The proposition of expressing human nature became the goal and motivation of my creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the classical dramas that make you watch and think about again and again? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have read many others, but Sophocles&#39; &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; and Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; &quot;King Lear&quot;, Arthur Miller&#39;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, Tennessee Williams&#39;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, Cao Yu&#39;s &quot;Thunderstorm&quot;, Lao She&#39;s &quot;Tea House&quot; are some of the examples that have achieved this.

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;是不能避免的苦修。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，有这种苦修，才可能完成一个优秀的作品。我在《坚如磐石》之前是几十万、上百万字地写，我刚毕业那阵，中国电影产业化还没兴起，我什么活都干，广告片、宣传片、各种电视剧。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我不相信天才的出现，特别是对电影这种高度集成化、系统化、具有工艺要求的形式而言，像音乐家那样脑海里飘出来一段音乐，把灵感写下来就成为千古绝唱，这种情况非常罕见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;类似于这样——在电脑前对着空白文档——艰难思考的过程，实际上我就锻炼出了思考的复杂性。我一直认为人的思考是有维度的。大部分人的思维是一维的：我喜欢这个男孩，我跟他好；我不喜欢这个领导，我远离他。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而日常生活中的烦恼可能是二维的：我虽然不喜欢这个领导，但是我得养家，于是我虽然很反感他，但我必须把我的工作调控好，让他重视我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在文艺作品中，可能再深一层：我不喜欢这个人的做派，又要去迎合他，但到最后我还是冲他拍桌子。就形成三个维度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;建立多重维度的思考，寻找这些维度之间关系，我把它归结为进行复杂思考的能力。电影的创作，涉及的要素特别多，至少要想几千个思维的点，还要把它形成结构，非常复杂。说一个作者相对成熟，可能跟我刚才讲的这个有很大关系。随着训练、思考，逐渐具备了思考复杂问题的能力、组织复杂思考的方法，可能他能做的作品，深度、圆融度、自洽性，能够到一个更好的层次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种维度的思考也进入到我的方法论中。我经常会就自己的作品跟团队一起讨论。有三个维度是成为一个剧本的基础。我还必须要做到，在这三个维度再往上提升一个维度，非常难。它不是机械叠加，是维度的上升。看起来我写的是这样一个事，突破这个维度天花板，在新的维度里又进入一个全新的方向。但它们是相关联的，不是乱跑的。观众以为就这么着了，我还要再有新的、让你意想不到的东西，给观众这样的心理感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你和团队在创作时，会在视觉上把这个过程呈现出来吗，像画受力分析图？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;从各种角度画思维脑图。内容创作是一个系统化的工程。编剧可以拆分成两个阶段，第一，策划和原创故事的阶段；第二，剧本的阶段。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;策划原创故事，意味着要明确我们要做一个什么样的电影，它的命题是什么，美学风格是什么？我们对应的是怎样的观众趣味？你要了解社会、当下中国的大众心理，以及电影的合作方、投资规模，等等。这些成为原创故事的一个切入点。我们都是团队在一起分析讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也会把局部工作分下去。比如说我们要弄个侦破片，会列出相关的文学和电影，相当于一篇论文。在这个基础上做侦破片，我们的当代性体现在什么地方？我们不可能再按柯南·道尔、阿加莎·克里斯蒂那样写，至少也得站在东野圭吾的肩膀上看问题。接着我们会进行故事的头脑风暴讨论，出来比如10个故事模型，分配给大家，先写成500字的（梗概）。往前走一走——圈出这片地，不知道哪里有水，我们挖坑，如果这条路是死路，那别走了；剩下三个坑看似是有潜力、有可能产生流水的，都往下写到3000字，再对比，找到那个对的坑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到第二个环节，开始写剧本初稿，就把它一次完成。后面才是针对这个初稿的修改，项目的各种具体要素进来。确定了演员，那我们结合演员的情况进行调整。比如《满江红》，我在剧本里可能会强化沈腾的长处，在台词上给他一种比较高级的幽默感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;业界对广义编剧的理解就是“你给我拿个本子来”。但这两块（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;上述两个阶段&lt;/span>;）区别非常大的，甚至前一块的重要性不亚于后一块。它不只关于编剧能力，实际上涉及对社会、对行业的认识，这些在前，才能产出一个好的项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你以前说过，你们团队内部是采用非常科学化的创作方法。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;是，好的作品是天衣无缝的，好像是个天然的有机体，你很难将部分从整体中间分离出来。一个作品越难拆，说明它的有机化程度越高。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你知道剧本的受力结构，只要能提取出来元件，这块可以拆出来，那就去提升它。比如我非常清楚这段对话叙事信息不够，那我们需要把这段对话的冲突性增强，在冲突中完成叙事信息的呈现。做类似这样的细节打磨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，创作是感性和理性的结合。驱使你写作品的一定是感性，愤怒、同情、感动、遗憾等等，创作者内心激发的情绪特别珍贵，在行业中工作时间越长，情感的冲动越难以激发，因为见得多了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要保护这种情感，哪怕一篇小文章、一首歌让我心里一颤，我立刻就要想，是什么东西打动了我？这不能是一个泛泛的很好。我就很小心地呵护这个火苗，去分析、归纳它，把它放大成一团火焰，这团火焰就是激发我从事后面的理性创作的动力。要很清楚这个火焰是什么。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你怎么能够确定你珍惜的火苗，同样也会打动大多数人，可以发展成一部经典叙事的电影？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;每个艺术家都有自己对世界的独有感受，但人需要一个逐渐理解他人、跟社会真正融合的过程。我并不认为艺术家就应该绝对特立独行，除非一辈子做实验性的、先锋的艺术，那很可贵，探索的是人类思想和情感的边界。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但另一些优秀的作品，是不断寻找人类精神崇高的意义，要寻找共识，把它呈现出来，创作者的价值在于连接。我认为当你逐渐能淹没在人群之中，能理解跟大多数人共通的情感，才是真正成熟。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么我觉得触动我的东西能触动其他人？首先我是一个人，第二当我是一个成熟的人，对世界的认知更广泛，自身能容纳更多的生活样态、情感运作方式，内心更加充盈，那我的呼吸、感受，和其他人的频率会更有可能趋向于一致。我极为个性的部分，逐渐能和其他人形成某种共振，这时候我就能够逐渐了解大众的心理脉搏。有这种情况：我看到这个故事很感动，它对其他人没那么重要；但也有些故事，我自然地能判断，它对更多的人有情绪价值，我可以去呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到今天，我期待自己做的作品能够跟更多人形成交流。好多文艺青年会觉得这是堕落，我并不觉得如此，我希望我的作品能够去影响、感动更多的人，给予更多的人以情感的慰藉。这个时刻是我觉得自己的创作最有价值的时刻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;艺术创作来源于限制&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《坚如磐石》是你自己写就的完整剧本，和张艺谋导演合作的后两部，《满江红》和《狙击手》，原初的点子都不是由你提出来的，接到邀约后，你怎么让它们成为从你心灵生发出来的、能够打动自己的作品。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我认为艺术来源于限制。当不准用语言、只准用肢体来传递信息和情感的时候，产生了舞蹈。当不准用正常方式说话，但是要传递复杂叙事信息的时候，才产生戏曲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我在别的采访里也提到，艺谋会有一些关键词，比如我们做一个抗美援朝的电影，讲一个狙击手故事。我是需要关键词、需要限制的。我就可以讲一个实时的故事，就从一个人的视点去看他卷入复杂的事情。虽然从多个视点讲故事自由度非常高，但是你会发现这种故事讲出来没有那么妙趣横生。很多时候，叙事的乐趣和叙事的价值就是来自于这种对视点的精准控制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就电影的情境来说，限制反而会让你更加自由，更加能呈现想象力。我有时候考试招学生，就直接扔给他们这样的题：现在你是一个手无缚鸡之力的人，被歹徒给逼到商场的厕所里，歹徒在外面砸门要冲进来。你想脱困，没有第二个门，怎么办？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本质上这是一个局部训练。观众就是想看，逼到绝路了，创作者有什么办法？当你真正想出了有价值的办法，意料之外、情理之中地完成了这件事，观众感到满足，你就完成了和观众的合谋。创作者也要把自己逼到墙角去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;比如刚才这个命题，大家会给出怎样的解法？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;有各种各样的。比如声东击西，有的把他骗进来，拿个石头砸他；让水箱在那响，我走到另外一个隔间里。还有人想，通过什么方式和外界联系，把保安叫来……没有标准答案。这实际上是看你的创作力，同样一个场景，你有多少种传递信息、呈现信息的方式。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也会出另外一道题，比如说出玻璃杯的15种用途。一般人会说，我可以拿它养花、养金鱼，喝酒、喝水、喝果汁。这样的回答得不了分，它只使用了杯子的容器属性。有的人会往下答，拿它里面套上灯泡，晃动，在墙上产生光斑。可以拿五个玻璃杯，站在上面当梅花桩。可以打碎了用碎片自杀。可以拿它聚焦太阳光，当凸透镜。就开始得分了。能打破常规的思考，显然创作力会更强。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你之前说编剧是一个非常需要电影工业素养的职业，你同时身处学界和业界，是否会寻找一种通行的方法论，并进行推广？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;陈宇：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我并不把它视为一个金科玉律，要推广到整个行业。每个人对电影可能都有不同的观念，甚至同一种观念里头也有不同的侧重，不同的作者有不同的表达方式。我现在只能做到，用我自己的方法和合作者一起完成一个我认为还OK的东西。在教学中，我把我的方法介绍给学生，他们找自己的创作方法。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如先做结构还是先做人物？有两种不同的创作：先想故事的结构，然后把人放在其中；或者我先建立这个人，让人自己动起来、去做事，形成结构。亚里士多德认为两者都行，只不过他更倾向于先结构。我自己也是，先做结构。但也有很多优秀的创作者，是让我脑子里这个人先出来，一颦一笑，他是怎么样做事，遇见人是什么样的反应，我让他这个人物去面对这些事。我觉得也很好。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;把自己的财务问题放大为和亲戚相关的问题，一旦不能如愿，立马撕破脸，以道德大棒重击对方，不惜在家族范围内败坏其名声，可谓市侩、阴冷而残酷。对这样的做法，当然不能听之任之。亲戚关系建立在血脉基础之上，泛起特别温情，但这并不等于某个人对另一个人负有拯救财务危机的责任和义务。这是被骂后慌张无措的提问者首先应该明白的道理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事犹如一个楔子，引得众多网友的共鸣与吐槽。一位网友说的故事颇有典型意义，曾有一个多年未联系的同学，不知道从哪里要到的电话号码找到他，开口就是借几万块钱，答主当然委婉拒绝，于是对方降到1万，最后将借款的数额变成1000。答主面对这样的道德绑架，挂了电话，拉黑了对方。这种情况颇为常见，因为很多人都会面对一个不知道啥时冒出来、八竿子打不着的亲友向自己求援，若是你不应允，受到对方的揶揄那是大概率的事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;借钱一事，若有能力是可以考虑的。就算不还，如果数目不大，大抵不会伤筋动骨。但是在种种关于私人的经济关系中，替人作保堪称最具迷惑性也最凶险的行为。一位答主讲述了这样一件事：他的表哥和表嫂和别人开了一家木材加工厂，让他拿出结婚证给哥嫂做担保，贷10万元。他没有答应，表哥不死心，通过各种方式死缠烂打，但最终他没有同意。而在无意中他得知，表哥根本没有和人合伙开厂这回事，而表哥已经穷得叮当响了。他感到后怕，要是头脑一热给答应了，这事就悬了，要是中间出点状况，压力还不是全给到了他自己身上？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;站在求援者的角度，除了个别肆意欺骗、给亲友“下套”者之外，亦有不少以窘迫实情相托者。因而也不必将所有的求援者列为不可信的“异类”。但纵是如此，我们也需要以一份理性和冷静来对待他人的求援。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这几年，创业的人多了，对于投资、资金、担保的需求自然也多了起来。有的人以“倾家荡产”般的决心上马某个项目，一旦资金跟不上，面临全局溃败之时，忧急之下，首先想到的是找亲友助力，或许之以利，或晓之以情，总之希望亲友伸出援手。这种心情可以理解，但具体回应之道，却值得商讨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位朋友告诉我，他就被堂弟请求，将自己的房产抵押，以换一笔救命钱来输血续命。但他考量再三，还是婉拒了，因为他仅有两套房，一套自住，一套出租补贴家用，既无多余之力帮助他人，也无实质的抗风险能力来“兜底”。堂弟自然是埋怨甚多。但他觉得自己并不是有能力不帮堂弟，也没有对堂弟利益造成任何损害，因而他无愧于心。何况，他后来得知，堂弟并不是只跟他一个人开过口，也并不只是他一个人拒绝了。这事的利害关系其实在于：房产之事系一个家庭的身家性命，丝毫经不起风浪，堂弟所提要求本身有点过分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广东俗语称，“不做中，不做保，不做媒，三代好”。古往今来，多少保人因为一次作保，受累甚大，肠子都悔青了，遂留下“古训”警示后人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作保看似签个字、画个押，云淡风轻，但真相并非如此。作保实在是牵连着严重法律后果的重大之事，其严峻程度往往超越了一个普通家庭的经济承受能力。无论是以何种方式为人作保，一旦被担保者跑路，相应法律后果就完全有可能转嫁给保人。这方面的例子举不胜举。几年前，江苏省常州市天宁区法院就强制执行了一起案件，由于借款人“跑路”，由担保人代偿25.5万元。至于因为被人连累，担保人被限制高消费、乘坐高铁和飞机的情况，亦很常见。而作保失败之后，夫妻不和、离婚的例子也颇多，实在划不来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法律界人士就此提示，为人担保，陷阱不少。例如，写借条时没有约定保证份额，担保人就承担了连带责任。一些保人之所以“失足”，一方面是因为抹不开面子，另一方面是因为对可能要承担的风险与责任一知半解，轻率同意。殊不知，你的“讲义气”，在让你难以“自保”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当一个人处于现实中的经济地位和家庭局面时，就不能意气用事，搬石头砸自己的脚，而是应该在不合理的求助面前果断说“不”。无疑，如果你连自己都保护不好，谈何“保”他人？要知道，当你因为一时之间的错误决定，而陷入重重麻烦时，那些当初找你作保的人，多数是不会出来救你的。相比之下，你因拒绝作保所担负的“见死不救”恶名，不过是最微小的代价。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，因拒绝作保而被亲戚辱骂、排斥、败坏名声，你是有权维权的。大不了“骂”回去，以及干脆进行亲情断舍离。对付亲情绑架，最好的手段就是见招拆招。总之，不管何种情形之下，不能因为感情好，就打肿脸充胖子，卷入本来和你无关的别人的财务漩涡中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;围绕作保之争议，说到底，还是应该建立起边界意识。彼此是亲戚不假，是兄弟姐妹不假，理应谨慎界限，既不能强求别人、提出非分要求，也不能被别人强迫、答应非分要求。我所在南京本地素有“亲戚不共财，共财两不来”的说法，也是由诸多教训中提炼出来的。这话的要义就是，人际之间，过自己的生活，解自己的难，是本分。亲友之间确实可以有互助，以在能力范围之内又不影响自己的生活为限，这也是亲情的意义所在，但在处理重大财务问题时，绝不应越过界限和底线，轻率给别人无限兜底，最终令自己沉入无法自拔的泥沼，到这份上，不仅亲戚做不成了，自己的人生与家庭可能也完蛋了。 &lt;/p>;
