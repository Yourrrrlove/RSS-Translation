In 2002, he retired from Sanlian Bookstore and established his own studio. Retirement just means changing places and continuing to design books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When drawing design drawings, Ning Chengchun&#39;s sitting posture was the same as when he was young: his back was straight, his shoulder blades were arched, and his head was slightly bent. He is still used to wearing shirts. The biggest change in his appearance is that he has grown a silvery white beard and trimmed it neatly after getting older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various books, a computer, and a pot of tea on his work table. Through the window on the left, sunlight pours in. The computer was for the assistant. Ning Chengchun used pens, rulers, and grid paper. The covers and layouts that were drawn by hand were handed to the assistant and turned into computer files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two book walls in the studio, and one of the bookshelves contains books he designed himself. In August 2023, he published the collection &quot;A Person&#39;s History of Book Design&quot;. In his nearly one year of design career, he has produced more than 1,500 books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These sixty years are equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. In 1986, after Sanlian Bookstore resumed its independent establishment, Ning Chengchun became the first director of the art department. His works outline the historical changes of Sanlian Bookstore. The &quot;Reading and Writing Series&quot; closely related to the publisher Fan Yong established the ideological banner of the 1980s; &quot;Huai Ju Shi Cun&quot; and &quot;Bathing&quot; designed for Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang set a precedent for writing books for a large number of scholars. ; &quot;Collection of Jin Yong&#39;s Works&quot; has made countless fans of Jin Yong bow and remain unforgettable to this day; &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; inspired the &quot;Chen Yinke craze&quot; in the 1990s; the &quot;Local China&quot; series has led the creation of &quot;picture books&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the editor of Sanlian Bookstore, Ning Chengchun is not old at all. When he has an important manuscript, he still asks him to contribute as he has done for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the balcony, a Monstera deliciosa grows as tall as a person. It was given to Ning Chengchun by his colleagues when he was hospitalized in 2008. Assistant Hu Changyue met Ning Chengchun in 2006. At that time, Ning Chengchun was working hard. At most, he hired 6 assistants to cooperate with the design. During his hospitalization, Ning Chengchun was still drawing layouts even in the hospital bed. The nurse reminded him to stop drawing and take a good rest. Within a week of his heart bypass surgery, he was back in the studio. &quot;If you can&#39;t do it in a day, you can do it for half a day.&quot; Hu Changyue recalled to a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after the operation, Ning Chengchun decided to close his studio, but many people continued to approach him for design, but the number of orders was reduced, and the work did not really stop. In 2019, Ning Chengchun underwent another heart stent surgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the collection of works has been published and is selling well, he wants to &quot;retire&quot; as soon as possible, writing, painting, and reading books that he had no time to read before. But when someone asked him to design some books, he still couldn&#39;t bear to refuse. The National Library wanted to publish &quot;The Complete Collection of Dunhuang Documents&quot;, and he agreed, &quot;This is a very important book. You can&#39;t just watch it fail.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that Ning Chengchun received the invitation, I was actually very happy in my heart, but my body really couldn’t bear it. The job of declining various design invitations was left to Hu Changyue. When faced with requests from others, Ning Chengchun would most likely nod, &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun likes natural, folk and humanistic things. The books in his studio are dotted with various traditional artifacts he collected: blue and white porcelain, Pixiu stone carvings, and paper-cuts. His collection is all based on hobbies and nothing expensive or rare. While out hunting, I saw the cute porcelain bowls in farmers’ homes, so I bought a few from the local second-hand market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He took out a set of picture albums that he bought from the Panjiayuan Secondhand Bookstore. They were all full of line-drawn bronzes. He had bought a 32-karat version before and the pictures were very small. This set has a large format and the decorations are clear at a glance. &quot;Actually, there were many good things in ancient times.&quot; Ning Chengchun murmured. In the past twenty years, he has experimented with various traditional patterns, either using them on the spine of books or using a continuous square pattern as the background of the cover. His designs have become increasingly quaint and solemn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ning Chengchun’s eyes, utensils are used by ordinary people in their daily lives. They are made by unknown craftsmen and may look humble, but they have the beauty of everyday life. Books are utensils that serve people, and they should also have &quot;the beauty of utensils.&quot; Literary theorist Chao Wen once said, &quot;The art of binding is the soul of book aesthetics.&quot; Ning Chengchun deeply agrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1156&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252130&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1985, Ning Chengchun was at Kodansha Japan. In the 1980s, he went to Japan twice for further study, allowing Ning Chengchun to truly and systematically study design, and his design concepts were in line with the world. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;This is what this book should look like&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;A variety of teas are placed on the dining table in the studio. Ning Chengchun always makes a cup of tea when guests visit. The book designer&#39;s studio is also a living room. Editors, printing staff, and suppliers often come to the door. Ning Chengchun has long been accustomed to switching between putting down and picking up design drafts at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At home, the time after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night is the quietest time. Ning Chengchun likes to conceive designs at these moments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After visiting his studio, Zhang Lixian, the founder of Duku, said: &quot;The designers I have come into contact with are all very good-tempered. I think it&#39;s because they communicate too much with editors and are polished. I have a good temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Ning Chengchun&#39;s early masterpieces, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, designed 12 drafts, three or four plans each time, and submitted it for review several times before it was approved. The highest record is a book on international trade, with 20 drafts designed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the plan was called back, what Ning Chengchun thought was, &quot;Maybe because I didn&#39;t understand the book or didn&#39;t meet his ideas, I will continue to do it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mindset Only if you are better can you persist for sixty years.&quot; Ning Chengchun attributed this to his family influence. His brother was labeled as a rightist, and the family lost income. His mother taught him from an early age to work seriously, argue for words, and talk less. No matter at school or at work, Ning Chengchun was used to working hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun entered the industry in his early days, all he could think about was design. When he woke up every morning, his mind was already spinning even before he was fully awake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many political movements at that time. When a book was published by a publishing house, all the art editors would design it, and then choose from many designs. In other words, it may be in vain. Ning Chengchun didn&#39;t care about this and just kept busy. He is the youngest but has been selected the most times. For many years, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1992, when he designed the book &quot;Yixing Zisha Appreciation&quot;, Ning Chengchun had no knowledge of Zisha teapots and tea. He and his photographer traveled to 24 places across the country to take photos of classic Zisha teapots. Due to the limitations of technology at that time, many of the negatives produced were color cast, but Ning Chengchun had seen and touched all the teapots, and listened to the explanations of Gu Jingzhou, an expert on purple clay teapots, so he repeatedly adjusted the color tone of the layout with the plate maker based on his feeling and memory. When printing at the printing factory, Ning Chengchun woke up once every hour and 15 minutes in order to supervise the color effect, and stared at it for four days and nights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Post-80s designers Xu Yijun and Ning Chengchun went to the printing factory together. During the book printing process, color shades or technical details may not be completely accurate, and some differences are difficult to discern with the naked eye. Designers need to be on-site to help solve the problem. Printing was done all night long, and Ning Chengchun sometimes had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the workshop to look at the samples. Now that he was old, Xu Yijun and other young designers persuaded him to take a rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Changyue&#39;s eyes, Ning Chengchun&#39;s rigor in publications was beyond imagination. Once when a picture book was being produced, the quality of one picture was not good enough. The editor said that there was only this picture and there was no way to replace it. Ning Chengchun said sternly that if a higher quality picture could not be found, this picture must be used for publication. , he stopped doing it. Finally, he and the editor rummaged through the box and found the negative of the picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiaming, former deputy editor-in-chief of Sanlian, compared book design to building a house, “After a book editor has worked hard to compile a good book, he will always consciously or unconsciously imagine what the designer will design it to look like. ”, and the designer arranges the graphics and text content appropriately to create a reading space that looks attractive from the outside, allowing readers to walk in without any obstacles and is pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A manuscript is just a stack of paper. To form a book, it must be designed. The quality of the design has a great influence on the book.&quot; Ning Chengchun said that after the book is finished, others will read it and feel that it is a good book. It should look like this, and he would be happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height= &quot;1302&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When he entered the industry in his early days, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books a year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Design is not just a cover&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Ning Chengchun loved books. When he was in middle school, Yang Shuo&#39;s generation of writers came into public view. He read many Chinese literary works. At that time, Tianjin People&#39;s Publishing House and Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House were publishing with high quality, which he still remembers today. Many small books published by Baihua Literature and Art are &quot;very lively and have illustrations. The illustrations of Zhang Deyu and Wang Guofeng are very famous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun’s eldest brother taught art in school. Under his influence, Ning Chengchun liked painting since he was a child. Mass cultural and artistic activities are also active in Tianjin. Ning Chengchun took the painting class of the district cultural center and went to the old house with several floors to paint in his spare time every week. When he was in junior high school, he published some sketches in newspapers and periodicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His first choice in the college entrance examination was the printmaking department. Printmaking played a propaganda role in various movements during the Anti-Japanese War and the early days of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It was &quot;down-to-earth and not too lofty.&quot; At that time, many book illustrations were created by printmakers, and he also hoped to work in a publishing house. In the end, he was admitted to his second choice and entered the Decoration Department of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. Three years later, he was transferred to the book art major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, there was no systematic modern design teaching in China, and most of what Ning Chengchun came into contact with was painting education. For those who study painting, they prefer design literature books, political economic philosophy books, and can only do abstract designs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He clearly remembers the first academic book he designed, &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;. The philosophy book was difficult to understand, and I couldn’t use too concrete paintings to express it. I designed many drafts, but they didn’t pass. Ning Chengchun went to the publishing house&#39;s library to look through the collection of paintings, searching for modern paintings from Wittgenstein&#39;s period, trying to figure out the relationship between Mondrian and others&#39; paintings and philosophy, and finally applied large color blocks to the cover design. Later, when designing a series of triplex academic books, Ning Chengchun would start with abstract patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun why his contemporaries who studied design changed careers one after another, but he persisted. Ning Chengchun thought for a moment and replied, maybe because he went to Japan to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun truly and systematically studied design when he went to Japan for further study twice in 1984 and 1986. In Japan, Ning Chengchun personally studied design masters Sugiura Shohei and Manabe Kazuo, and took up basic design courses to integrate with the world in design concepts. At that time, all domestic design relied on painting, and no one knew how to use grids. Ning Chengchun returned from his studies and helped Sanlian usher in the era of picture books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Ning Chengchun’s graduation to 1995, nearly thirty years of the printing era, all design was done by hand. With the advent of computers, printing was gradually eliminated, and he was still used to designing on paper first. Ning Chengchun did not know how to operate a computer. At that time, the computer company next to the publishing house had five computers. He sat in the middle, drew the layout, and directed five assistants to use the computers to complete the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Designers of Lu Mingjing’s generation basically complete the entire design process on the computer, while Ning Chengchun still maintains the habit of manual grid design. It was pictures and books that prompted Lu Mingjing to learn from Ning Chengchun. The first task she received was to design Jiang Xun&#39;s &quot;History of Chinese Art for Everyone&quot;. The pictures were many and the text was fragmented, and the layout was difficult to form a block, which was very unsightly. Facing such a book, Lu Mingjing, who had just entered the industry, was confused. Wang Jiaming suggested that she go to Ning Chengchun&#39;s studio to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun took out several pieces of octavo paper, a ruler, and a pen, and showed Lu Mingjing how to use a grid to draw a layout, and accurately calculate the number of words on each page and the size of the pictures. &quot;The pictures and text information are all controlled on the manuscript paper, instead of pushing it page by page, and falling into the dilemma of having to redo the entire book if a few pictures are changed.&quot; Lu Mingjing realized that the seemingly backward grid design , actually has its own advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While studying at Sugiura Kohei&#39;s studio, Ning Chengchun understood the meaning of what he said: &quot;A book is a universe.&quot; Later, Ning Chengchun introduced Sugiura Kohei&#39;s theory for the first time in China. Sugiura Kohei emphasized the overall design and the core position of the book binding designer in the book design process, &quot;from the layout of the text, text, font, font size, title, table of contents, title page, cover, letter sleeve, belt to the copyright page, and the design of All paper and material selections, and printing and binding process settings are within the scope of the book designer&#39;s responsibilities. Modern book design concepts were promoted in China, and everyone began to understand that design is not just about making a cover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun observed that in the early days of Ning Chengchun’s design career, design was often regarded as a vassal and branch of painting and lacked independence. As one of the first batch of book designers to study in Japan, Ning Chengchun mastered the professionalism of design. Coupled with his &quot;persistent pursuit of the design profession, including personal talents and opportunities&quot;, multiple factors superimposed to support his departure. Come down. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I did what I should do for this book”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun came back from Japan, he was over forty and his hair began to turn gray. When he made &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; in 1995, his hair turned gray overnight. The 200,000-word manuscript that fascinated him was once stolen along with his backpack. Ning Chengchun couldn&#39;t describe the pain. In just a few days, regret and guilt turned his hair white. Fortunately, two weeks later, the thief who took away the wages left the manuscript at the door of the neighborhood committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun chose a black cover for this book because both the content itself and the author&#39;s writing made him feel the intensity of emotion and the depression of the atmosphere. He compressed the catalog together, arranged it into an upside-down, fragmented, and disorderly combination, and placed it on the top of the cover to express the condensation of the last 20 years of the author&#39;s life. The photo of Chen Yinke on the lower right was one that Ning Chengchun spotted at a glance from many photos - his eyes were blind, but still bright, and he was holding the crutch tightly with both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It particularly represents Mr. Chen&#39;s spiritual atmosphere in his later years, lonely and determined, as if staring at us descendants in the heavy shadow of history.&quot; He believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua, the person in charge of Shenzhen Shangshu Bar, has collected more books designed by Ning Chengchun than Ning Chengchun himself. He began to pay attention to book binding design in the 1990s and found that each book presented a different state. Sanlian&#39;s books were quite different from other publishing houses, being more elegant and heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Hua’s view, Ning Chengchun’s designs reveal a unique Chinese spirit. &quot;His creative language has absorbed the essence of traditional binding very well. He has taken deep roots. He also caught up with the reform and opening up. He went to Japan to study twice and learned modern techniques. He is not conservative at all, which is even more rare.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun often thinks about how to distinguish each book when designing. Every book is unique. To design well, a designer must first understand the author&#39;s thoughts and feelings, and then convey this understanding to readers through book binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you encounter a book that attracts you, the design is often more inspiring. Ning Chengchun was very moved after reading &quot;Fu Shan&#39;s World&quot;. The author Bai Qianshen is an art history scholar. He originally studied international politics, but turned to calligraphy after studying in the United States. He tells the story of Fu Shan&#39;s ideological changes by examining the society in the late Ming Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing, Ning Chengchun used Fu Shan’s calligraphy works as the background. In a chaotic night sky, those characters slightly emitted seven-color light, as if flying from the depths of history, ancient and modern. The book has a wide influence and is constantly reprinted. Bai Qianshen highly approves of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I did what I should do for this book.” When Ning Chengchun talks about these books that he has never forgotten, his words can go very far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The understanding between designers and authors sometimes extends from books to reality. After retiring from Sanlian in 2002, Ning Chengchun received direct invitations from many authors. Wang Yuanhua and Zhong Shuhe both wrote letters asking him to design. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relic expert Wang Shixiang asked a publishing house to design &quot;Jin Hui Hei&quot;. When printing, he found that the design format was wrong and could not be printed. He found Ning Chengchun for help. &quot;At that time, he had just lost the sight in his left eye, and he was so anxious that he was really trusting him with his life.&quot; The two became friends from then on. Wang Shixiang sometimes went to the Sanlian Art Studio to look at design drafts and invited Ning Chengchun to have dinner downstairs. Ning Chengchun once witnessed Wang Shixiang instructing the chef to improve the taste of eel paste. The next time he went back, the store made it according to his method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is no longer just reading a manuscript, the key points of the manuscript and the author&#39;s taste are all very clear.&quot; Wang Jiaming sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hong Kong triptych edition of Wang Shixiang&#39;s &quot;Research on Ming Style Furniture&quot; is divided into volumes with pictures and texts. Ning Chengchun found it inconvenient to read, so when designing this book, he reintegrated the text narrative, picture explanation, and illustrations. Wang Shixiang&#39;s wife, Yuan Quanyou, did a lot of work for this book. Unfortunately, she passed away before the design of the book was completed. Ning Chengchun knew that Wang and Yuan had been together all their lives and had a deep love for each other, so he temporarily added and changed the design. He chose a black background for the cover, with a line drawing drawn by Yuan Quanyou printed in white gold stamping in the middle. There are two Ming-style chairs designed on the cover of the letter sleeve. One is a photo of the actual object, and the other is a line drawing of Yuan Quanyou, as if the two people met each other in heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua was moved by a series of Wang Shixiang&#39;s works designed by Ning Chengchun: &quot;The younger generation does not know much about Wang Shixiang&#39;s pursuit and achievements. It can be presented perfectly, and the content and form are completely unified. That is very difficult and can only be designed after full understanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some books failed to be implemented according to his ideas, which will also become a regret that Ning Chengchun talks about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing &quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&#39;s Manuscripts&quot;, he hoped to put the statue in front of the Lu Xun Memorial Hall - a more natural and life-like appearance - on the cover using 3D imaging technology. The effect was very good, but in the end the publisher chose a safer solution and used the black-and-white photos of Lu Xun in the textbook. Ning Chengchun felt that the design could have been more innovative. Now is no longer the era of &quot;cold eyebrows&quot;. &quot;Lu Xun&#39;s life was difficult and he had a fragile side.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is nothing we can do about it. You are Party B, and I am Party A.&quot; Ning Chengchun smiled and changed the topic again, &quot;But I will use this method again when I meet the right person in the future. I will definitely It must be suitable, and ordinary people are not suitable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It is difficult to overcome loneliness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun showed Lu Mingjing a sketchbook. He took it with him when he went to participate in the Four Clean-Up Movements in college, and he painted the countryside scenery along the way. It takes two to three hundred miles to walk from the city of Beijing through the suburbs to the countryside of Hebei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun told her that she could leave now. Lu Mingjing asked, how to go? Ning Chengchun said, arrange a car, let&#39;s go and put our luggage in the car. Are you coming with me? Lu Mingjing agreed wholeheartedly, thinking to herself, oh, I have to do it all over again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He will encourage you for anything that is beyond what ordinary people can do.&quot; Lu Mingjing discovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten years ago, they met a violin maker together. The workshop is in a small thatched house on a remote hill. The guqin he and his disciples made was expensive enough to allow them to be independent from the world and not have to worry about making a living. Ning Chengchun encouraged Lu Mingjing: &quot;You have to become such a person!&quot; Lu Mingjing had just started working at that time and was a little confused. She understood what he meant - now that she has special skills, she no longer needs to be confused about whether to be born in the world or to join the world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of Ning Chengchun’s contemporary designers have become painters and artists. Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun, who was also good at painting, if he wanted to become an artist. Ning Chengchun answered firmly: no , I just want to be a designer all the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Yijun was studying design, his classmates generally believed that design would not be a lifelong career. &quot;They all voted with their feet and they all left.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Design has long been regarded as a practical art, and has not been taken seriously in the traditional thinking of attaching more importance to morality than tools. There is a huge difference in social status between artists and designers. Xu Yijun mentioned the fault lines in China’s design industry. There are only a handful of people born in the 1940s like Ning Chengchun who are still writing books. &quot;Although there are very few designers of the older generation, there are still some. This is too precious, otherwise I would be very lonely.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paper books are already a sunset industry. If you study graphic design, you can switch to Internet product design. Higher income. Xu Yijun said that paper books are not very profitable, and many design companies produce them in batches. &quot;If you spend so much time doing it, it may be difficult to survive.&quot; It is rare for designers of Ning Chengchun&#39;s generation to spend a lot of effort on each book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Mingjing once divided book designers into different types and styles such as philosophers, engineers, and artists. Ning Chengchun chose the opposite path to artists who express themselves. He has an exciting side, but he is willing to shrink himself and hide his name behind a book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun emphasized one thing in his book and interviews. At the 8th National Book Design Art Exhibition, a Japanese design theorist looked at the exhibits and said that an author spent a lot of time writing a book. If the designer included personal things in the book, it would be a great disservice to the author of the text. Disrespectful. &quot;This phenomenon is very common among the exhibits in the Eighth Exhibition, which is to break away from the text, or impose the text to create something, in order to attract attention, for personal display of skills, not for the book, not for the text, this pure artistic tendency, he They say this is disrespectful to the book and the author, but no one takes it seriously,&quot; Ning Chengchun told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always speaks out directly about things that are not in line with his own ideas. In one event, Ning Chengchun was a judge and felt that the procedures were very unreasonable. Even after he pointed it out, there was no change, and he finally left the venue angrily. &quot;Young people&#39;s awards... are too focused on fame and wealth.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun is very wary of the impetuous and utilitarian atmosphere. &quot;Put utilitarianism first, and everything is for utilitarianism, and that won&#39;t work.&quot; In Japan, he has seen many college students doing carpentry, which is also very good. Society should not be so monotonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Southern Weekend reporters visited, Ning Chengchun was working on Lei Diansheng’s book. Ning Chengchun admired this hiker who was the first person to cross Lop Nur and traveled all over China in ten years. When he walked in the late 1990s, the economy was booming and all walks of life were making money. However, Lei Diansheng had been preparing for ten years. He had planned all the details in advance and was well-planned and capable. &quot;He relied entirely on one person to overcome many difficulties. It is difficult to overcome loneliness first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always reminds Xu Yijun of Lu Xun’s words: Huge buildings are always made of wood and stone. Why don’t we make this wood and stone? I do little bits and pieces from time to time, just for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Everyone wants to do earth-shattering things and have heroic ideas. There is no point in doing these ordinary things. But now I don’t think so.” Xu Yijun said that many great ancient buildings , such as the Forbidden City, was designed by unknown craftsmen, &quot;It is also important to make ordinary books, and do things in a down-to-earth manner.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun worked with Ning Chengchun for a long time last year. He found that no matter which city he went to, Ning Chengchun always had books to design with him. “Keep reading, keep reading, and eat.” Lie on the bed after dinner, then take out the manuscript and read it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun always said that he only does one thing in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Xu Yijun and Zhang Huahua changed their names at the request of the interviewees)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[傅首尔与老刘闹离婚说明了什么？“全职丈夫”难以得到尊重]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257545]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The divorce between Fu Seoul and Lao Liu on the show made the variety show earn enough traffic, but it still It is a soap opera in life. Although it cannot be said to be a bad drama, it is also a plot that many people like me don&#39;t like to watch at all. Even so, we can still learn enough &quot;lessons&quot; from this incident. One of them is that men should be &quot;full-time husbands/full-time dads&quot; because society&#39;s acceptance of this is too low and it is difficult to be respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Seoul and Lao Liu have experienced &quot;poor and lowly couples suffer all kinds of sorrows&quot; and can be regarded as a couple in need. After Fu Seoul rose to prominence through &quot;Qi Pa Shuo&quot;, Lao Liu began his career as a complete &quot;full-time husband&quot; and the source of Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. In terms of the height an individual can achieve, Fu Seoul is definitely a strong woman and a successful person who uses knowledge and eloquence to embark on a unique track. There is no doubt about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Lao Liu returned to the family and became a full-time husband, the good stories about their marriage have existed on the Internet for a long time. Every time he participates in the show, Fu Seoul will almost always talk about how good Lao Liu is to him. Fu Seoul and Lao Liu had divorced once before. Later, they remarried. The reason was that Fu Seoul, who was on the rise in his career, had a mess in his work and life after the divorce. Fu Seoul also publicly described this marriage as &quot;the best marriage I could ever encounter.&quot; If this is the case, then why should we go to that step again at this time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because, the status and relationship between the two people are no longer what they used to be. The ancient saying that &quot;time and status change people&quot; must also exist in marriage relationships. The &quot;economic ability determines family status&quot; that today&#39;s people lament is actually the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Lao Liu has advanced in the life of a stay-at-home husband to the point where Fu Seoul kicks him and &quot;knows it&#39;s time to pour out the water&quot;, and Fu Seoul asks Lao Liu to throw away the garbage even though there is a trash can next to him. , they will never &quot;go back&quot;. Regarding the happiness of marriage, there are only feelings left. &quot;I can guarantee that my husband is very happy to be a stay-at-home dad, and I can make money to support the family.&quot; When Fu Seoul said this, Lao Liu was experiencing the most difficult time. This shows that Fu Seoer no longer understands his husband. And Lao Liu also lost himself in being misunderstood and became a symbol. Although he said that he didn&#39;t mind being used as a joke and ridiculed by Fu Seoul on the show, the subtext I realized was: The premise is that you have to respect me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, what did Fu Seoul say? She said: Do you know why a person keeps making salted fish? Because he is suitable to be a salty fish. Once the belief of not seeking improvement is formed, he will even breathe slower than others. You should not push him, because there is no harm if there are no expectations. Of course, there is an element of &quot;program need&quot; in such a statement, but too many details have already revealed that Fu Seoul is increasingly intolerant of Liu&#39;s &quot;not seeking to improve&quot;. She may not even realize that she has regarded Liu as a Stephen Chow It&#39;s a waste of words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger wrote: Lao Liu was forced to struggle by Fu Seoul. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu became the material for Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu needs to report accounts to Fu Seoul. How many full-time housewives have experienced this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is indeed not necessarily true. For example, some jokesters will also &quot;operate&quot; on their wives, but overall, Lao Liu&#39;s experience is indeed the real experience of &quot;full-time husbands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, an old acquaintance quit his job and became a full-time &quot;housewife&quot; because he had to take care of his children. Although he talked about the pleasure of having a lot of free time when he was drinking with us, in his heart, he became increasingly intolerable to a life where he had to look at his wife&#39;s face even for pocket money and clothes. This is the same thing as the case where Lao Liu wanted to buy clothes he liked but because Fu Seoul didn&#39;t like them, his expectations were wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All the shocking details do not appear out of thin air and have no direction. To put it bluntly, whether it is Lao Liu or some &quot;house men&quot;, they have lost the respect of their wives and been rejected, which has become a normal feature of life. It’s hard to imagine how long this kind of lack of understanding and respect can last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people didn’t understand Lao Liu’s complaints, thinking it was pretentious and something he did in his spare time. But if the identity were to be changed - if the husband had all kinds of dislikes and restrictions on the stay-at-home wife, wouldn&#39;t many people be upset? In addition, if a stay-at-home housewife complains that she is under great pressure, she is often sympathized with, but you see, after Lao Liu’s difficulties were revealed, many people accused him of not knowing how to be blessed despite being blessed, and of not being considerate of Fu who worked hard outside. Seoul. What a double standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between a full-time wife and a full-time husband exists objectively. Simply put, stay-at-home wives are more tolerated, while stay-at-home husbands are not. This nature has transcended the scope of a family. The pressure faced by that old acquaintance was not limited to his wife, but also came from the strange looks from the people around him. Some netizens also mentioned various bitternesses when commenting on Fu Seoul and Lao Liu&#39;s divorce. For example, no matter how you explain the &quot;force majeure&quot; of being a stay-at-home husband, you may still be regarded as a &quot;soft ricer.&quot; I would like to ask, have women been looked down upon as &quot;soft rice eaters&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traditional social concepts have shaped men into &quot;family breadwinners and family responsibility bearers&quot;, in the eyes of some people, it is unforgivable for men to return to the family. This proves that men actually lack the public opinion environment to become full-time husbands. If you do it accidentally, you have to change it. A male compatriot I know started working odd jobs after being unemployed for many days and relying on his wife to support the family. He didn&#39;t make much money and was still looked down upon by his wife, but at least he could &quot;straighten his back a little&quot; in front of his neighbors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that marriage is based on love. Isn’t marriage based on respect? First, if a man really needs to be a full-time husband, the prerequisite must be that he can be respected by his family and society. Since being a full-time wife is a job for a woman, it is also a job for a man to be a full-time husband. He should not be labeled as &quot;eating soft food&quot; or &quot;receiving charity&quot;. Secondly, since the concept that men cannot eat soft rice is still solidified, then a man must think clearly whether his choice is appropriate, whether he can withstand the pressure caused by it in the future, and whether there is a better choice than being a full-time husband. Options? The reality is cruel. When the subtlety and even contradictions in the relationship between husband and wife gradually become apparent because of your &quot;full-time&quot; choice, can you calmly bear the consequences of not being happy or even being a loser? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[去珠峰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gZ8MqmWkWhwE91TzmJdUkCKkearqzv7ohY6Hk2KN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2434&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gZ8MqmWkWhwE91TzmJdUkCKkearq zv7ohY6Hk2KN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251363&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dingri County, Shigatse, Tibet, overlooking Mount Everest from Rongbuk Temple&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to Mount Everest requires a border defense permit.

&lt;p>;在抵达西藏前，我已经采访了多位珠峰科考队员。有一晚，我与一位地理学家坐在兰州大学的操场上聊天。他说了一个珠峰科考惊险故事：从6300米高处接力抬下一位高反严重的壮汉，天黑迷路，珠峰落雪，险象迭生。他谈起高原上的意外，我接了一句：万玛才旦也是在高原去世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;地理学家很惊讶万玛导演5月去世了。那时他们正在珠峰上科考，没有信号。他看过万玛的电影，说万玛导演是个好人啊，拍的都是普通人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;万玛及其所带动的藏地新浪潮，是许多人了解藏族生活、藏族文化的窗口，从他的电影望去，那是一个个悠扬动人、神秘又矛盾的藏族故事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/E5quYTxdMo071IYXlNf6A5LUYTJ9BqaBunC0AhEK.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;在珠峰国家公园门口，游客们排着长队要与大幅“318国道此生必驾”地面涂绘合影。我一阵恍惚，用手机搜索后确认，318国道的终点确实不在珠峰，而在日喀则的聂拉木县中尼友谊桥。那天晚上，在珠峰国家公园5200米处的游客大本营，人们放声歌唱，时而是《义勇军进行曲》，时而是《海阔天空》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/W8spSjGms58H9uY0nGIVUg5Og01ZHiIg3bNMO8iV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;绒布寺因绒布沟得名。珠穆朗玛峰北坡下面，有一条南北向的绒布沟，由绒布河水冲刷而成。绒布河则由东绒布冰川、中绒布冰川、西绒布冰川的部分融水汇成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ysgmjcberZRv1P54zGkbT6jEbttPiggpyvG3n1Le.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;虽然马洛里错过了东绒布冰川，但他拍下了一张珍贵的中绒布冰川照片。在2023年的珠峰科考中，西北研究院经过三次努力，找到了当年马洛里的拍照点。通过对比两张跨越百年的照片，他们估算，中绒布冰川比过去退缩了4公里，即平均每年退缩40米。全球气候持续升温必然加剧冰川的退缩，如遇雪崩，超量的融雪将汇成急流，冲向珠峰山脚的山庄。在过去20年里，珠峰雪崩引发的山洪，冲毁了多个尼泊尔村庄。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2014年1月，一场意外的火灾将独克宗古城部分烧毁。如今，古城已经慢慢复原。漫步在古城的石板路上，两侧是一座座木质结构的房子，经营着客栈、餐馆、酒吧或工艺品店，让人想到英国植物学家金敦·沃德笔下的“古雅小城”。 1913年，为了考察横断山脉的河流与植物，金敦·沃德行经此地，借宿在一户人家里，发现“屋子极为清洁，铜烹锅及茶器擦得光可鉴人”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为香格里拉留下文字记录的远不止金敦·沃德。近代第一位赴藏“女钦差”、有“东方奇女子”之称的刘曼卿在1933年出版的《康藏轺征》中，以细腻的笔触写到独克宗古城：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“天色黎明或夕阳西落，满街尽背水之人，取水之瓢用树皮折叠而成，质轻而容量大，泉源之畔，取水者麇集如蚁。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，大龟山山下，刘曼卿所述的泉眼依旧在汩汩流淌。有人在泉眼边放了一把水瓢，方便路人取水品尝。太阳穿过透明的池水，水下波光跳荡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自古以来，香格里拉就是茶马古道上的传奇。当年，仅来往于香格里拉—拉萨之间的商号就有一百九十多家，每年过往的马帮马匹达两万多匹。在独克宗古城的巷子里，我遇到了英俊的康巴汉子扎巴格丹。扎巴格丹的父亲是香格里拉人，年轻时是马帮中的一员。 1970年，扎巴格丹出生在印度的一个小山村里。他当过七年僧人，十七岁那年，才和父亲一起辗转回到故乡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎巴格丹的人生传奇从香格里拉开始。回国后，他从小学一年级读起，后来留学奥地利和美国。他会讲藏语、英语和印地语，还有带着咖喱味的汉语普通话。他打过工，当过公务员，做过导游，开过旅行社和餐厅。 2012年，扎巴格丹在独克宗古城创建了第一家“阿若康巴”民宿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“阿若康巴”是父辈们行走在茶马古道上，彼此间打招呼的一句话，意为“来吧，朋友”。创建“阿若康巴”既是扎巴格丹父亲生前的梦想，也是他自己的梦想。当年，马帮走在茶马古道上，每当精疲力尽时，就会在大山深处的“乃仓”里获得休整的机会。父亲每次向扎巴格丹提起马帮的故事，总会说起那一座座“乃仓”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2014年的那场大火重创了古城。虽然阿若康巴庄园得以幸存，但大火留给扎巴格丹的记忆始终未曾消退。他仍然清晰地记得那些被大火笼罩的店铺、民居，像一个个手无寸铁的巨人，悲壮地倒下。液化气罐爆炸的声响此起彼伏，一团团烟火翻卷而起，崩飞的碎裂物打在断壁残垣上，发出各种尖利的声音。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这像是一场一边倒的战争，在迅猛而至的火灾面前，我们被打了个措手不及。”扎巴格丹说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让扎巴格丹感到欣慰的是，这些年来，经过“建新如旧、以旧代旧、新中仿古”的重建，独克宗古城逐步恢复了原来的模样。曾经的满目疮痍，被焕然一新的面貌取代。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“石板街、各具特色的藏式客栈、富有民族色彩的手工艺店、充满文艺气息的咖啡馆和酒吧，昭示着曾经的独克宗古城又回来了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于香格里拉，扎巴格丹始终怀有热爱和信心。他至今都会经常想起当年他和父亲翻过一座垭口，第一次看到香格里拉时的情景：“那是一幅在我梦中无数次出现的卷轴画。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;奔子栏位于金沙江上游右岸，在藏语里意为“小小的沙坝”，是奔腾的金沙江和陡峭的群山之间的一块河谷地带。然而，随着海拔降低，河谷的风景却变得荒凉：两岸沙砾瘠壤，岩石暴露。刚刚还能看到高大的阔叶林，一派郁郁葱葱的景象，渐渐却变成了低矮的灌木和仙人掌。风吹在脸上，又热又干，让人恍若来到了墨西哥的沙漠地带。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种“干热河谷”景象是“三江并流”地区典型的地质景观，堪称自然界精彩的一笔：暖湿气流在翻越峡谷两侧高山迎风爬坡时变冷引发降水，因此山顶降雨频繁，植被茂盛。气流经背风坡下降变热，到达谷底时则成为干燥炽热的“焚风”——“焚风”加剧了干热程度，致使植被更加稀疏，形成“干热河谷”的地貌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而“干热河谷”绝非全然荒凉。透过车窗，可以看到赭石色的山间镶嵌着一块块玛瑙般的台地。当地人通过对这些台地的改造，打造出一块块适合耕种的局部环境。台地上种植着核桃、柑橘、葡萄、西瓜和油橄榄，与黄褐色的金沙江交相辉映。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过奔子栏镇，我们离开大路，沿着溪流，穿过苞谷地，抵达宁静的白仁村。裸露的岩石间生着仙人掌，路边种植着花椒树和李子树。我要拜访的是一位法国女建筑师Estelle Achard。九年前，这位来自阿尔卑斯山脚下的法国女士，卖掉了法国北部的小屋，独自来到这座河谷深处的藏族村庄，开了一家名叫“土路”（Tulu Lodge）的客栈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“土路”由村内的一栋藏式老民居改造而成，在外观上尽量保持了原有的风貌：土石墙围出的小院子里，栽着李子树和石榴树，石砌的花坛里种着迷迭香和薄荷。 Estelle出门迎接我们，身后跟着两条狗（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;其中一只是瞎狗&lt;/span>;），兴奋地在我们脚边打转。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle一头灰褐色的头发，戴着眼镜，脖子上挂着藏式项链。三十年前，当建筑师的她第一次来云南出差，不可抑制地爱上了这里的山山水水。十五年后，她移居昆明，做了几年酒店设计后，搬到香格里拉，最终在奔子栏定居下来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle带领我们逐一观看她设计和布置的房间。虽然每个房间风格不同，但都将民族特色与现代理念有机地结合了起来，仿佛时光在这里静静沉淀。在改造房子时，Estelle最看重的是生态环保理念。她尽量保持裸木的状态，不使用带有化学制剂的清漆。她还特意保留了农村的“旱厕”：在厕所的地面上开一个洞，洞口上方摆一张椅子，座位被掏空了，洞口下是一堆木屑，排泄物直接落入木屑中，成为院外菜地的肥料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在奔子栏生活近十年，Estelle可以用汉语和村民交流，村民都称她为“法国阿佳”。她喜欢当地产的酥油、牦牛肉和新鲜的蔬菜瓜果，自己则在花园里种植各种法餐需要的香草。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那天晚上，我们坐在花园的李子树下，与一家来迪庆旅行的法国人共享Estelle做的乡村晚餐：番茄西瓜冷汤、香料烤鸡、土豆泥，搭配香格里拉产的红葡萄酒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;院外的苞谷叶在晚风中摇曳，溪水声显得更加响亮。我们谈起各自的经历。 Estelle说，她也想过在普罗旺斯开一家民宿，但普罗旺斯已经太过饱和。她很高兴在奔子栏定居下来，开一家小小的民宿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“普罗旺斯是全世界的想象，而这里也一样。”Estelle说，“每当我告诉法国朋友，我在香格里拉定居了，他们都会发出一声惊呼！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;金沙江大拐弯&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（刘子超/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“雪山市场墩市洋”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;第二天一早，我们离开奔子栏，离开干热河谷，沿着金沙江而行。公路的海拔再次上升，山上的植被又变得郁郁葱葱起来。在金沙江大拐弯处，我看到黄色的江水转了个弯，像男性弯起的臂膀，充满力量感——夹住江水的山脉，仿佛河流的守护神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从奔子栏到德钦县城有八十六公里，山路虽然盘桓，但路况良好。解放前，德钦县不通公路，到1959年才修通滇藏公路。那时需要翻越海拔四千多米的白马雪山，每年十月到次年五月，经常因大雪封山而交通受阻。如今，开通了隧道，已不必再翻越白马雪山的隘口。我们的汽车仿佛在公路上滑行，两侧皆是茂密的林海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;德钦县城过去叫阿墩子。据传，宋元时期，藏传佛教高僧噶玛巴在禅定中发现梅里雪山的主峰卡瓦格博为莲花生大师所预言的胜乐金刚圣地，从此开启了藏传佛教徒朝拜卡瓦格博的先河。阿墩子既是朝拜神山的起始和终点，也是茶马古道上重要的物资集散地和文化交流地，因而有“雪山市场”的美誉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从更广阔的角度看，阿墩子处在汉藏民族的接触地带。如学者所说，就像张家口商业发达，是因为处于汉蒙民族的接触地带，阿墩子商业发达也是同样的道理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抗战时期，国际传统商路遭到封锁，阿墩子商贾云集，成为保持中印贸易和运输战备物资的桥梁。由于各大商号云集，为了方便交易，商人们使用一种“墩市洋”货币作为流通媒介。这种货币只能在阿墩子市场上使用，由此可见阿墩子当年的繁盛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，德钦已经恢复了一座山间小城的样貌，建筑物沿山谷蜿蜒而下，有将近六百米的落差。走在街上，我看不出当年茶马驿站的繁盛景象，更像是一座普普通通的山城。只有行人的肤色、口音和部分居民的装扮，才让我意识到自己身处以藏族为主的少数民族聚居区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于地处狭小的山沟，德钦县这些年面临的最大风险是泥石流。 2003年，迪庆州政府曾考虑把县城搬至他处。 2010年，与其地形相似的甘肃舟曲县发生泥石流，更是引发人们对德钦的担忧。但当地人告诉我，德钦附近山峦起伏，想找到一块足够开阔的平地十分困难，所以政府最新的考虑是把县城整体搬迁到相邻的维西县——如果是这样的话，阿墩子古城也将成为一段历史。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;清晨，我们去飞来寺观看“日照金山”圣景——金色的阳光打在卡瓦格博山峰上，然后回到德钦县城，与诗人扎西尼玛在一家藏餐馆见面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎西尼玛出生在德钦县下辖的明永村。这个村子坐落在卡瓦格博雪峰之下，藏语意为“明镜”，因村后雪山上倾泻而下的巨大冰川而得名。除了明永冰川，明永村还是已故诗人马骅支教的地方。在那里，马骅写下了诗集《雪山短歌》，被评论界誉为当代汉语诗歌中最明净、最澄澈的部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;午饭过后，我请扎西尼玛带我去明永村看看。我们坐上汽车，上了214国道，很快就看到了奔腾的澜沧江。这里同样是干热河谷地貌，但我发现，只要有台坎坡地的地方，就有田园民居，就能看到麦浪翻滚、瓜果飘香的景象。行驶在这条路上，一块块绿洲，一座座民居，镶嵌在雪山、峡谷与大江共同绘制的风景中，令人心旷神怡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一路上，在河谷两岸的隘口和田间地头，不时可以看到耸立的土碉楼，大都倾圮破败，充满了历史的沧桑感。我问扎西尼玛，这些碉楼建于何时？所为何用？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎西尼玛告诉我，由于年代久远，就连当地人也已经失去了对碉楼的记忆。它们究竟是出于战争的目的，亦或只是财富和身份的象征，历史学者和考古学者们各执一词。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;梅里雪山下的藏族村庄&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通往明永村的公路是1998年4月开通的，以前进出明永村只能走崖壁上的小路。在扎西尼玛的记忆中，当时明永河的水声比现在更大。他去上学，步行要走半天时间，还要溜一道滑索。暑假时，他去山上放羊，饿了就烤从森林里采到的松茸，撒上盐巴和辣椒就吃。如今看来，这一切算是“生命中难得的体验”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那时，明永村人的生活十分困苦。多数人家全家人共睡一个铺，家里甚至没有多余的碗。扎西尼玛记得，上初中时，有一次放假回家，他邀请同学到家里吃午饭。由于家里没有客碗，只好用家人的碗，还是只变形的碗——他父亲有一次上山砍木头，摔了一跤，把木碗压变形了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;初中毕业后，扎西尼玛去师范学校读书，随后辗转在德钦县管辖的村镇。 1997年，他调入德钦县旅游局，参与编制了梅里雪山生态旅游区开发规划。正是那份规划把明永冰川作为优先开发的景区，而明永村的巨变也是从那时开始的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着政府大力度的推介，卡瓦格博峰和明永冰川开始吸引越来越多的游客。德钦县抓住时机，投资了七千多万元，为明永村修建基础设施，明永冰川成为迪庆州第一个国家4A级景区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在冰川旅游开发中，明永村村民主要参与的是为游客提供牵马服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“骡马成了明永村的钱袋子。”扎西尼玛说，“1999年，牵马收入是平均每户八千七百元；到了2006年，平均每户突破了五万元。”村民在旅游业中致了富，家家户户都置办了卫星电视、电冰箱、洗衣机、高档音响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，县里又提出实施冰川索道项目。因为饲养骡马成本不小，修建索道则可能带来更多的游客。村民们认为，跟索道公司订合同，谈好分成办法，这样既可以舒舒服服地挣钱，又不用为喂养骡马和安全问题大伤脑筋。冰川索道投入运营以来，村民每户每年至少可以分到五万五千元的红利。明永村从过去的贫困村，变为德钦县乃至迪庆州的富裕村。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;扎西尼玛告诉我，据明永村的老人们说，以前推开窗户就可以看到冰川，感受到冰川的凉气。那时候的冰川很“强壮”，把山谷堆得满满的，整天听得到冰川开裂发出的巨响。 1913年，英国植物学家金墩·沃德也曾造访过明永冰川，看到“一根巨大的冰柱醉汉般摇晃，瞬间后便咆哮着滚落山谷，将树上一群绿色的鹦鹉惊起”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎西尼玛说，在他小时候，冰川的出水口会被掉落的冰块堵住，河水一下子断流了，村妇们就到冰川边上，亮着嗓门唱起“嘛呢调”。唱着唱着，冰块被冲开，河水哗哗地汹涌而出。然而，这些年冰川逐渐消融，这让扎西尼玛感到心情沉重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每次回村，都会感觉冰川变小了一些。”扎西尼玛说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为此，他还拍摄了一部名为《冰川》的纪录片，从朝圣者、旅游者、村民三种视角，表达了藏族人对雪山的信仰，对外来文化影响的不同理解，以及他们在旅游开发浪潮中面临的种种困惑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;扎西尼玛和马骅是同龄人，又都是诗人，当年很快成为朋友。他回明永村看马骅时，两人经常一起聊书聊音乐。马骅会拿起吉他，唱起民谣，长长的头发像一团黑色的瀑布。他们去附近的山上野餐，躺在一棵不知有多少年月的老桃树下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;微风时时拂过，花瓣沿着暖洋洋的阳光纷纷飘落下来。背后是在云雾里时隐时现的卡瓦格博雪山和雪山上伸展下来的巨大冰川，冰川在阳光的照射下发着蓝幽幽的光，偶尔会传来冰崩的轰响，山谷的两岸覆盖着茂密的森林，头顶上是蓝得醉人的天空和天空中变幻不定的云彩。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

. There are also many people who are eager to travel and use third-party platforms&#39; &quot;Light Speed ​​Ticket Grabbing&quot; and &quot;Ticket Grabbing Magic Tool&quot;. Tickets usually cost extra. In this regard, Railway 12306 issued a statement through its official Weibo, stating that it has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statement said: &quot;Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only are there traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, bundled sales services, etc., but there may also be risks of personal information leakage. Please Passengers must purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the true meaning of this statement? Will &quot;ticket-grabbing tools&quot; lose their market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must understand why for many years, it is difficult to get a ticket for high-speed rail on many lines during long holidays. But first, starting from this year, the shortage of tickets on some lines may change. And turn down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use intensity of high-speed rail passengers on different lines is different. Some lines are more popular, with constant demand for commuting, business travel, tourism, etc., and there are many trains every day, such as between cities in the Pearl River Delta or Yangtze River Delta regions. There are lines between major urban agglomerations, as well as lines to popular attractions; some lines are not so popular and have relatively few flights. During the long holidays, in order to cope with the surge in travel demand, the high-speed rail will open some additional trains. However, it is obvious that the former will increase the absolute demand and relative demand much more, but the potential for additional operations is limited; the latter has great potential for additional operations, but the increase demand is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, for a long time, most high-speed rail lines have had the same price during normal times and long holidays, which often leads to the following consequences: when demand is low during normal times, the fare is higher than the market equilibrium price; during long holidays When demand increases sharply, ticket prices are significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, causing tickets to sell out as soon as they are released. The National Railway is well aware of this situation, so it is also making improvements to make fares more market-oriented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway began to implement floating fares. The highest second-class fare for the entire journey was 598 yuan, an increase of 8%; the lowest fare was 498 yuan, a decrease of 10%, that is, the upper limit was increased. , the lower limit is lowered, which is the first time in the nine years since the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway was opened that a floating fare mechanism has been implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from May 30, 2023, the railway department will conduct &quot;fare inspections&quot; on many high-speed rail lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity, Nanjing-Hangzhou High-speed Railway, Nan-Guangzhou High-speed Railway, Jiaoji Passenger Line, and Liunan Passenger Line. &quot;Optimization adjustment&quot;, the upper limit is the published fare, the lower limit is 34% of the published fare, the upper limit is further increased, the lower limit is lowered, and the floating range is further relaxed. Taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity as an example, the published fare for second-class seats from Nanjing Station to Shanghai Station is 166 yuan, which is the highest fare after adjustment, an increase of 19% from the pre-adjusted fare of 139.5 yuan; the lowest fare is 110 yuan. The fare dropped by 21% from the 139.5 yuan before adjustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to raising and floating the fare caps on some popular lines, the railway department has also launched discount tickets. China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group announced that &quot;in order to facilitate intercity passengers&#39; business travel and commuting travel&quot;, starting from June 20, 2023, the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Tanzhou Intercity Railway will officially launch regular tickets and time-counted tickets. Passengers can Take the S-shaped train running on the route at the designated departure station. Take the 60-time/30-day regular ticket from Chengdu East to Chongqing West priced at 5,852 yuan, which is equivalent to 97.5 yuan per time, which is close to the lowest operating fare for ordinary tickets, with a discount of up to 52%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general trend is that the pricing strategy of high-speed rail is in line with that of airplanes. Unless there is an emergency, as long as you buy a ticket some time in advance, you can basically buy a ticket, and even the price is very favorable. This is because the air ticket will be set at a high &quot;original price&quot;, which is much higher than the market equilibrium most of the time. The price does not go up, but only goes down, with discounts of 30% or 40% off, giving passengers a sense of gain. This is a pricing strategy that is purely market-oriented and accurately grasps the psychology of passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pricing strategy of high-speed trains is completely copied from that of air tickets. Starting from September 15th, high-speed trains will go on sale during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays. When purchasing tickets, many people found that compared with normal times, some high-speed trains and trains and trains increased significantly during the National Day holiday. A passenger posted on social media that a dormitory ticket from Beijing to Shenzhen only costs 1,150 yuan on weekdays, but on September 28 the upper berth price increased to 1,860 yuan and the lower berth price increased to 2,090 yuan. On the same day, the lowest direct fare from Beijing to Shenzhen is 1,100 yuan (excluding tax). On the official website, the published fare for Beijing to Shenzhen is 2,264 yuan, with discounts of 1,860 yuan and 2,090 yuan, approximately 12% off and 92% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, floating fares are not yet implemented on all lines. If you cannot get tickets during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, it only means that the fares are still low relative to demand. For this line Either fixed fares are still being implemented, or floating fares are not in place. This is the explanation from economics. And this means that the &quot;ticket-grabbing artifact&quot; still has room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essence of &quot;ticket grabbing artifacts&quot; is digital scalpers. When the official price of a commodity is significantly lower than the market equilibrium price, the price difference is &quot;unowned income&quot;, and many people are motivated to compete for this. In terms of income, scalpers are one of them. Those who are diligent and queue up early to earn hard money, and those who have the skills to get insider tickets will share the income with insiders. Digital scalpers are also scalpers, but if a third-party platform claims to have &quot;priority to purchase tickets&quot;, it is a lie. If you buy an acceleration package, they will help you buy tickets at 12306. In this sense, clarification from the railways is necessary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, using algorithms and apps to grab tickets is definitely faster than hand speed. This is the market niche of the “ticket grabbing artifact”. The railway department&#39;s clarification cannot persuade passengers who are eager to return home and are eager to get tickets. Of course, 12306 can ban certain IPs or even the App itself that frequently brushes tickets, but it is also difficult to completely exclude machine ticket purchases, leaving only hand ticket purchases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, &quot;As long as there is room for profit, technology will continue to evolve.&quot; Therefore, the fundamental solution is to further marketize fares so that passengers’ bids reflect their demand intensity as much as possible. In this way, people who really want to go somewhere can always go there if they can&#39;t wait for a whole day. Those who don&#39;t mind delaying for a day or two can also save a lot of money and get what they want; the high-speed rail can also make more money to pay for the operating costs of the high-speed rail. , cost and even bank principal and interest, digital scalpers naturally have no room for survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[汪顺破纪录夺金：看看这个成绩，还行吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257641]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 18:57:22&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/QlfWjfuC6wKHukCvJfShO65Zew6GziVEFjCHXCWb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QlfWjfuC6wKHukCvJfShO65Zew6GziVEFjCHX CWb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun in the competition &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;1:54.62&quot;, Wang Shun is far ahead in the swimming pool, followed by continuous Cheering and cheering, the big screen gave a more accurate record.

At the World Swimming Championships two months ago, Wang Shun failed to enter the finals in any of the three competitions he signed up for, leaving him far behind his peak form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, in the preliminaries of the Asian Games, Wang Shunyou clocked 1:58.84, which was still far behind his 11th place finish at the World Championships (1:57.97). Teammate Qin Haiyang ranked first 0.12 seconds ahead of Wang Shun and advanced to the finals that night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final final, Wang Shun led the way and won the gold medal, and at the same time broke the Asian record (1 minute 55 seconds 00) held by him, which was previously set by him at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s like I (can) swim,&quot; Wang Shun and the story of this blue swimming pool began in the summer when he was 5 years old. He followed his father to the swimming pool for the first time. When he saw his father jumping into the pool, he jumped in immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The body sank and he was scrambling to grab something. Wang Shun quickly choked on the water, but he didn’t feel scared. “I didn’t feel like I was choking on the water and wanted to stay away from it. Instead, I wanted to To conquer it. Perhaps, I have a natural affinity for water. In the water, I feel unprecedented happiness and relaxation, and I feel like a fish in the water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun&#39;s past achievements are indeed marked by the feeling of being like a fish in the water. : Born in Ningbo, Zhejiang in 1994. In 2007, he was selected by coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the first team of Zhejiang Province. In 2009, he followed coach Zhu Zhigen and entered the second team of the Chinese swimming team. In the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, he became the runner-up in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley; in 2016 In 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley at the FINA Short Course Swimming World Championships and won China&#39;s first world championship in men&#39;s medley; on July 30, 2021, he won the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley championship at the Tokyo Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in water, it’s not always possible to go downstream. After winning the Tokyo Olympics, Wang Shun lost his goal and felt that he could no longer get happiness from swimming. Raising the national flag and playing the national anthem at the Olympic Games has been Wang Shun&#39;s ultimate goal in his sports career of more than 20 years. He has long said, &quot;Athletes must have clear goals.&quot; From national champion to world champion, and then to Olympic champion, he has improved his competitive performance step by step. &quot;I always encourage myself to achieve good results.&quot; It&#39;s hard won, it&#39;s all step by step.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252116&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, Chinese player Wang Shun (right) shook hands with teammate Qin Haiyang after the game&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the cheers, there was confusion without a goal. Looking back at the glorious moments in the past, Wang Shun said: &quot;Olympic championship has always been the ultimate goal pursued by all athletes. Before winning the Olympic championship, it took me more than 20 years to establish this goal and work unswervingly towards it. Let&#39;s go. After winning the championship, I found that the goal had dissipated and all the sources of motivation would disappear. I had to set new goals again, which was more difficult. I spent a year to re-establish the goals and then go Hit the peak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 2023, World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. Wang Shun feels that he has regained his motivation, hoping to forget the halo of the Olympic champion, continue to surpass himself, and fill the last gap in his gold medal Grand Slam (Olympic Games, Asian Games, Short Course World Championships and Long Pond World Championships) - Long Pond World Championships Tournament champion. However, Wang Shun ranked 16th in the men&#39;s 200-meter medley preliminaries of this competition and was almost eliminated; he ranked 11th in the semi-finals and missed the finals. In the 400-meter medley, he was disqualified due to a foul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Wang Shun okay? Such questions come from the outside world and from his heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interval from the Fukuoka World Championships to the Hangzhou Asian Games was less than two months, and Wang Shun has been adjusting his condition. He is 29 years old this year and this is his fourth time participating in the Asian Games. At the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, Wang Shun was still a newcomer. It was the first time he stood on the stage of the Asian Games and competed in the same swimming pool with his Asian opponents. Looking back today, he is &quot;still full of enthusiasm.&quot; But Wang Shun is no longer just a passionate novice. He has reached his peak, experienced ups and downs over a long period of time, and finally chose to jump into the swimming pool again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;619&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252115&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, in the men&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming competition held at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Natatorium in Zhejiang Province, Chinese player Wang Shun won 1 point Winning the championship with a time of 54.62 seconds &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;He has to look at it carefully&lt;/span>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun was still a child when he first faced the choice of swimming pool. At that time, he was studying painting and doing well, and at the same time he received an olive branch from the swimming team. Should he choose to become a professional swimmer? There was no such precedent in his family. It was instinctive and risky, so he chose the swimming pool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Swimming has always given me a sense of progress.” As an adult, Wang Shun explained his choice this way. When time passed long enough, he experienced and felt more and more the other side of swimming: boring, repetitive, and self-confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swim in the 50-meter-long, 25-meter-wide swimming pool with 8 lanes, and take the trouble to go back and forth between the starting point and the end point again and again. He said: &quot;Swimming is a relatively boring sport. During competition and daily training, you rarely communicate with others. The only thing you can hear is the water sliding towards you, and the sound flowing through your ears is the most intimate thing for me. partners.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shun once accidentally said in an interview that for 7 months in 2022, he would train at the base, just like building blocks. Every day he would start with basic training and train in one class. The class swims 13,000-16,000 meters, and sometimes there are two or three training classes in a row, including reaching the edge, turning around, rolling, and returning, and a complete set of water movements are repeated in a cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His hands looked thin, with sharp knuckles, but rough calluses formed on the palms. During the first two years of training, the skin on his hands would wrinkle from being soaked in water for too long. Over time, the body gradually adapts, and &quot;the apparent reaction is basically gone.&quot; Long-term, fixed training also changed his daily routine. &quot;When I was on vacation, I was fine one day, but if I didn&#39;t go to the swimming pool the next day, I would feel uncomfortable all over. As long as I get to the swimming pool, I will feel very comfortable. Now I have such an emotion towards water.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In addition to physical training, facing one&#39;s own heart is also a required course in this track. At the 2019 World Championships, Wang Shun was very eager to win a gold medal, but he did not even perform at his normal level. At the Military World Games three months later, Wang Shun&#39;s desire remained unabated, &quot;I must prove myself.&quot; He desperately increased the difficulty of training, but as a result, his lungs ruptured and he developed a pneumothorax due to excessive training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treatment plan given by the doctor at that time was to inhale oxygen for one hour a day, but he hoped to recover as soon as possible and bring glory to the country, so he started to inhale oxygen for two hours a day. Even so, the doctor still recommended that he give up the game and rest for a week. He refused. After lying in bed for five days, he returned to the training ground and tried his best in the next day&#39;s game to win the championship. Now when he recalls the situation at that time, he still feels sad: &quot;There are many things that you may not be able to see. To me, it&#39;s like risking your life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;774&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 23, 2023 , the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, torchbearer Wang Shun and digital torchbearers jointly lit the main torch &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that The peak moment is the Tokyo Olympics.

A month later, Zhao Ling&#39;er&#39;s account released an encounter with Qubu video. Qubu is similar to Ding Zhen, who became popular in 2020. They are both from remote villages, with dark skin, handsome face and innocent smile.

They rented several local houses and They grow corn on the land and cook on the mountain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter asked Wang Ershuai in the live broadcast room how to tell the authenticity of Internet celebrities. Wang Ershuai replied: &quot;You can tell the difference clearly after watching it too much.&quot; Come on... you can analyze it yourself. I can tell you about the things that have been revealed now.

Meng Yang dropped out of school early and worked in Guangdong. Villagers believe that Meng Yang’s fortune is inseparable from “meeting a good boss.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police stated that the above-mentioned illegal and criminal acts are well-organized and confusing. The case is strong and involves a wide range of areas, forming a gray industrial chain of counterfeiting and selling in recent years, including front-end creation of characters, incubation of Internet celebrities, mid-end script shooting, e-commerce operations, end-end supply of agricultural products, and traffic realization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Why are these MCN institutions so keen on &quot;mining gold&quot; in Daliang Mountain?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Huilin, a senior practitioner of agricultural products e-commerce, analyzed that Daliang Mountain is a natural reservoir of products and traffic. First of all, Daliang Mountain&#39;s The products have become popular among Internet celebrities; secondly, the topic of Daliang Mountain caters to traffic, “Daliang Mountain has ethnic minorities, beautiful scenery, and rich cultural heritage. People are rare for these few things, which solves the biggest traffic problem. &quot; Wang Huilin told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The economic development of Daliang Mountain is relatively slower than that of coastal areas, and with the attribute of helping farmers, this matter will develop more logically. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Daliang Mountain, but also Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, places with “products, scenery, people, and culture” are sought after.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nong Ge believes: &quot;It&#39;s more credible to shoot there. There must be a choice. Why doesn&#39;t anyone choose to go to Zhejiang to help farmers? &quot;According to his many years of experience in carrying goods in the countryside, many short video bloggers like Meng Yang are suspected of exaggerating the misery of the countryside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A farmer practitioner from a mountainous area in the north told Southern Weekend reporter, people always have a prejudice against mountainous areas. In fact, including the business environment, some local things may be better than those in developed cities, but these have no attention and traffic. &quot;There is no electricity in mountainous areas in xx&quot;, this topic is With traffic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Supporting farmers has become the focus of short video platforms.

Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, Anhui and Sichuan have become the agricultural products on the platform. Businesses originate from the top five provinces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangshan Prefecture Police released the script of the MCN agency’s agriculture and rural areas video, which includes “collecting mountain goods”. For example, Shiyi and her cousin went to local villagers with scales, bags, backpacks, etc. Collect mountain goods at home.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of rural areas and farmers caters to the traffic algorithm of short video platforms in disguise. Nie Wenchang, chairman of an e-commerce group in Shandong, established one of the first live broadcast bases in Linyi.

This version of the catalog adds 111 new drugs, covering multiple treatment fields such as oncology, immunity, rare diseases, and anti-infections. Among them, 91 drugs such as orebatinib, sarvotinib, and rispalan have been admitted through negotiation. By adding new drugs to the catalog, the total number of drugs negotiated for medical insurance during the agreement period reached 346. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;From March to August 2023, a total of 123 million people were reimbursed for negotiated drugs during 346 agreement periods, with medical insurance fund expenditures of 49.17 billion yuan, and the average actual reimbursement ratio was 69.7%.

Those who wantonly publish abuses and insults against individuals on the Internet Cyber ​​violence that spreads rumors, defamation, invades privacy and other information must be subject to due legal sanctions. On September 25, the Supreme People&#39;s Court, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held a press conference to officially release the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Punishing Internet Violence and Crime According to the Law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; have a total of 20 articles, mainly covering ten aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, clarify the applicable rules for the crime of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; provide guidance on the nature of online violence in accordance with the criminal law and relevant judicial interpretations. Specifically, those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others on the information network, if the circumstances are serious, will be convicted and punished for the crimes of insult and slander; organize &quot;human flesh searches&quot; to illegally collect and release citizens&#39; personal information to an unspecified majority of people, and the circumstances are In serious cases, they will be convicted and punished for the crime of infringing on citizens&#39; personal information. In addition, the crime of illegal use of information network can be applied to malicious marketing and hype behaviors carried out through cyber violence incidents; the crime of refusing to perform information network security management obligations can be applied to the behavior of failing to perform information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to clarify the rules for handling illegal online violence. For online violence, we should adhere to multi-dimensional and joint governance and improve the connection mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that the implementation of online insults, slander and other online violence does not constitute a crime. If it complies with the provisions of the Public Security Management Punishment Law and other provisions, administrative penalties will be imposed in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to clarify the policy principles for punishing cyber violence crimes. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that the spirit of severe punishment for cyber violence crimes should be reflected so that the people can fully feel fairness and justice. Adhere to strict law enforcement and justice, strictly investigate cyber violence crimes in accordance with the law, and effectively correct the erroneous tendency of &quot;the law does not punish the public&quot;. We must focus on cracking down on malicious initiators, organizers, malicious promoters, and those who persist in reforming despite repeated abuses. The &quot;Opinions&quot; also stipulate that there are those who commit cyber violence against minors and disabled people, organize &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot; to commit cyber violence, fabricate &quot;sexually related&quot; topics to infringe on the human dignity of others, and use &quot;deep synthesis&quot; and other generative methods If artificial intelligence technology releases illegal information, or if network service providers initiate or organize cyber violence, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is to clarify the boundaries between illegal crimes and legal behaviors of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that reporting or exposing other people&#39;s crimes or violations of laws and disciplines through information networks should not be considered a defamation crime as long as they do not intentionally fabricate facts or knowingly spread the facts to be fabricated. Commenting and criticizing other people&#39;s words and deeds, even if the views are biased or the speech is extreme, as long as it is not wanton abuse or malicious slander, it should not be considered an insult or crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fifth is to clarify the work requirements for public security organs to assist in evidence collection. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, in cases where the victim files a private prosecution for online insult or defamation, if the people&#39;s court determines after review that it is indeed difficult for the victim to provide evidence, it may request the public security organs to provide assistance. The &quot;Opinions&quot; reiterate the provisions of the Criminal Law, and also clarify that the public security organs should promptly identify the perpetrators of online insults and slander according to the requirements of the People&#39;s Court and the specific circumstances of the case, and collect evidence and materials such as the spread and spread of relevant information and the impact caused. Network service providers shall provide necessary technical support and assistance for public security organs to obtain evidence in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth is to clarify the public prosecution standards for criminal cases of online insult and defamation. According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, those who commit crimes of insult or slander and seriously endanger social order and national interests shall be prosecuted in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that in cases of online insult and defamation, public prosecution procedures will apply if one of the following circumstances occurs: (1) causing serious consequences such as mental disorder or suicide of the victim or his close relatives, and causing a bad impact on society; (2) arbitrarily using The general public is the target of infringement, and relevant information is widely disseminated on the Internet, triggering a large number of vulgar and malicious comments, seriously disrupting the order of the Internet, and having a bad impact on society; (3) Insulting and slandering multiple people or spreading insulting and slanderous information multiple times, causing social harm Those with a bad impact; (4) Organizing and instigating people to spread a large amount of insulting and slanderous information on multiple online platforms, with a bad impact on society; (5) Other situations that seriously endanger social order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seventh is to clarify the transition process from private prosecution to public prosecution in criminal cases of online insult and defamation. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that for online insults and slander that seriously endanger social order, the public security organs have filed a case as a public prosecution case, and the victim simultaneously files a private prosecution in the People&#39;s Court, the People&#39;s Court may request the private prosecutor to withdraw the private prosecution or rule not to accept it; it has been accepted If the case is found, a ruling should be made to terminate the trial and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. The original private prosecutor can participate in the lawsuit as a victim. The victim files a private prosecution before the public security organ files a case. If, upon review, the people&#39;s court determines that the relevant online insults and defamation seriously endanger social order, the case shall be transferred to the public security organ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eighth, support civil rights protection against online violence in accordance with the law. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if cyber violence is committed against others and infringes on others&#39; reputation rights, privacy rights and other personality rights, and the victim requests the perpetrator to bear civil liability, the people&#39;s court will support it in accordance with the law. If the right holder has evidence to prove that the perpetrator is committing or is about to commit an illegal act that infringes upon his or her personality rights, and failure to stop it in time will cause irreparable damage to his or her legitimate rights and interests, the people&#39;s court may, upon the right holder&#39;s application, issue an injunction against infringement of personality rights in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ninth is to clarify the rules for public interest litigation in cases of online violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; stipulate that if online violence harms public interests, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. If a network service provider fails to perform its information network security management obligations in accordance with the law for discovered cyber violence information, resulting in the large-scale dissemination of illegal information or other serious circumstances that harm the public interest, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may file a public interest litigation with the People&#39;s Court in accordance with the law. When handling public interest litigation cases in the field of cyber violence control, the People&#39;s Procuratorate may require network service providers to provide necessary technical support and assistance in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tenth is to proactively perform duties and promote comprehensive management of cyber violence. The &quot;Opinions&quot; require that when handling cases of cyber violence, information on the progress of the case should be released to the public in a timely manner in accordance with the law, clarify the truth, and eliminate the adverse effects of cyber violence, so as to reduce the harm to the victims and help the victims get out of their predicaments; carry out legal publicity and give full play to law enforcement The role of rule guidance, value orientation and behavioral norms in handling cases is to educate and guide netizens to consciously abide by the law and lead social civilization; to conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes that promote the occurrence of online violence, promote multi-dimensional co-governance of online violence, and fundamentally reduce online violence occurrence, creating a clear cyberspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一文止步八强，新旧交替的女子重剑队亟待历练]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257567]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEzLcs4MrEYLK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/qLY0NaAvQ3TEA5d5kye3jm2Vd1xtEz Lcs4MrEYLK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251880&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, women&#39;s individual epee four in the fencing event of the Hangzhou Asian Games In the quarter-finals, Chinese player Sun Yiwen (right) lost to South Korean player Song Shiluo 12-14 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;12 to 14, on September 24, the first official competition day of the Hangzhou Asian Games, in the quarter-finals of the women’s individual epee fencing event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese player Sun Yiwen lost to South Korean player Song Se-ra and stopped in the quarterfinals. So far, all Chinese players in this project have been eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yiwen’s third Asian Games trip. She and her teammates won the women&#39;s epee team championship twice before. At the last Asian Games in Jakarta, Sun Yiwen also reached the finals of individual events, but ultimately lost to South Korean star Kang Young-mi and won a silver medal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This sport pays great attention to variety, balance, game and precision.” A game lasts up to 9 minutes. If you hit at the same time, you must be 1/25 second earlier than the opponent to score. A blink of an eye is 0.75 seconds, which is enough to turn the tide or give up victory. To do this, fencers need to &quot;count one step at a time.&quot; Excellent fencers are often in a &quot;man-sword-in-one&quot; state, that is, under various circumstances, they can hit the opponent&#39;s exposed effective parts (including the torso, legs, feet, hands, arms, and helmets) at the fastest speed and the shortest route. . Behind the &quot;subconscious&quot; sword thrusts again and again is the muscle memory cultivated over many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tokyo Olympic champion Sun Yiwen is the number one Chinese women&#39;s epee player. He has always been good at &quot;stopping with stillness and attacking later.&quot; &quot;Determined, calm, and explosive&quot; is how she sums up her playing style. However, after winning the Tokyo Olympics and Xi&#39;an Games, Sun Yiwen has been trapped by injuries and will not resume training until October 2022 and systematically participate in events. To &quot;find the feeling of starting over&quot;, the road is rough. Sun Yiwen once lamented that he &quot;can&#39;t even play games anymore&quot; and was &quot;very unfamiliar.&quot; It was not until the International Fencing Federation World Cup Barcelona in February 2023 that he gradually regained his form and won two bronze medals in a row, both individual and team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Y1LICojmKJNk0KhWE9ZrblJq0W0assdjikvr0Ab1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 24, 2021, Sun Yiwen (right) celebrated with his coach after winning the women&#39;s individual epee final in fencing at the Tokyo Olympics&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous interviews with the media, Sun Yiwen once said that winning a gold medal is not necessary for this comeback. After reviewing the schedule performance of the last Olympic Games, she and the coaching staff found that although they won the gold medal, many problems and deficiencies were still exposed in the process. If they can be improved, the state will be better than before. &quot;There is a new coach in the team who has taught me many new ideas and moves. Now I dare to try new moves in the game and explore new areas. This is what makes me most interesting and what makes me happy.&quot; The reason why I decided to stick to another Olympic cycle is that I am still learning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, the Chinese fencing team is facing a transitional period of replacement of old and new players and adjustment of the coaching team. Three-quarters of the athletes participating in the Asian Games have never competed in the Tokyo Olympics. The Hangzhou Asian Games is regarded as an important training opportunity for this young team to prepare for the Paris Olympics. According to the competition plan, the fencing competition of the Hangzhou Asian Games will be held from September 24th to 29th, with a total of 12 gold medals produced. On September 27, Sun Yiwen will also lead his young teammates to continue their pursuit of medals in the women&#39;s epee team competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Zhang Xin, Secretary-General of the Chinese Sports Delegation at the Hangzhou Asian Games and Director of the Competitive Sports Department of the State Sports General Administration, said, the Hangzhou Asian Games is the &quot;high school entrance examination&quot; before the Paris Olympics. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Sun Yiwen will usher in her third Olympic trip in Paris, and before that, she and the young Chinese fencing team still need to overcome many obstacles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/zSTuMc9YvjlkUYhKNhKW9jT7caOSYptFWqNxmbnw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 20, 2023, in the 2023 Asian Fencing Championships Women’s Epee Team Third Place Competition held in Wuxi, Jiangsu, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team and won the bronze medal. Chinese team players Tang Junyao (first from left), Lin Sheng (second from left), Zhu Mingye (third from left) and Sun Yiwen took a group photo after the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Behind the &quot;Duel of Swords&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen never considered himself a &quot;talented player&quot;. She attributes her gains in her career to her seriousness and stubbornness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yiwen was born in Wanggezhuang Village, Qixia City, Yantai, Shandong Province in 1992. When she was young, her health was very poor and she would catch a cold every winter. Sun Yiwen&#39;s father, Sun Hongming, is a local village doctor. Under his father&#39;s supervision and company, she has developed the habit of running and exercising since she was a child. Long-term persistence pays off. In elementary school, Sun Yiwen had become the school&#39;s top sports student. When he was 11 years old, Sun Yiwen was selected by the Qixia Sports and Competition School to focus on middle and long-distance running. Two years later, she had grown to 1.66 meters, and her best standing long jump score was over 2.5 meters. Because of her tallness, long wingspan, strong instantaneous explosive power, and being left-handed, she was spotted by Xu Zhaowei, the then head coach of the Yantai City Fencing Team, and officially embarked on the road of fencing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fencing is a project that requires very comprehensive abilities. &quot;Strength, speed, explosive power, endurance, coordination, flexibility, and thinking&quot;, none of them can be missing. The initial training was hard and boring. Morning training starts at 5:30 in the morning. Basic steps and movements last for several hours. In order to develop their endurance shortcomings, the team members also need to receive additional running training. From Monday to Friday, I run 3,000 meters in the morning and evening, and there is also a 6-kilometer cross-country race on the weekends. If you fail to complete the task within the stipulated time, you will be fined. The longer it takes, the greater the fine. After the high-intensity training during the day, there are cultural classes in the evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a week, Sun Yiwen wanted to give up. In order to comfort and encourage his daughter, Sun Hongming rushed to Yantai from his hometown and stayed with his daughter for two days. After the initial adaptation period, Sun Yiwen, who is physically fit and good at thinking, began to gradually emerge. &quot;Every time I practice an action and I can&#39;t do it, I will carefully review it and think about why. Every time I win or lose a game, I will dig deeper into the underlying logic.&quot; At the 2010 Shandong Provincial Games, the 18-year-old Sun Yiwen represented the Yantai Fencing Team and won 8 gold medals with his teammates. After the competition, she was successfully selected for the provincial fencing team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But life was not smooth. For a long time, because there was no establishment in the provincial team, Sun Yiwen had to pay for outings by himself. Sometimes a game would cost half a year&#39;s salary of my father. At that time, his younger brother was still studying at home, and Sun Hongming and his wife were living in a very tight situation in their hometown. Due to technical and tactical breakthroughs facing bottlenecks, Sun Yiwen was withdrawn from the provincial team twice. Worried that he would not be able to get ahead by practicing fencing, Sun Yiwen once proposed to his father that he should give up fencing and go out to work to support his family as soon as possible. The father knows his daughter&#39;s thoughts well. Just like when he was a child, Sun Hongming sought psychological relief on the one hand, and actively communicated with the coach on the other. In the end, no one gave up. Fortunately, under the advice of her coach, Sun Yiwen began to try to change the gun-handled sword to a straight-handled sword. After that, her hard training finally paid off. For a time, there was no female player in the province who could match her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Sun Yiwen was selected for the national fencing team. In the same year, at the age of 21, she made her debut in international competitions and won the women&#39;s epee World Cup Grand Prix team championship. Two years later, she won her first individual championship at the Italian Fencing World Cup. However, it was the 2021 Tokyo Olympics that really brought Sun Yiwen to the pinnacle of his career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Sun Yiwen, as a &quot;dark horse&quot;, won the individual bronze medal and team silver medal in women&#39;s epee. But with the end of the Rio Olympics, the national women&#39;s fencing team has also undergone earth-shaking changes. At that time, the head coach &quot;Bole&quot; Levavasseur, who had a profound influence on Sun Yiwen&#39;s thinking and technology, resigned, and the main players such as Xu Anqi and Sun Yujie retired. The burden of leading the new team suddenly fell on Sun Yiwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/O0mKyXd6lHmdwegDkVKOPAasw1yJDwy0BEGRnrOb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sun Yiwen&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Sun Yiwen was used to &quot; The &quot;second intention&quot; style of play is to first use fake moves to confuse the opponent, and then attack by surprise. However, the successor head coach Yuge Oberly is good at direct offensive tactics, which is exactly Sun Yiwen&#39;s shortcoming. During the running-in period, which lasted for about a year, Sun Yiwen&#39;s performance in competitions has been mediocre. She felt as if she had returned to the state when she had just joined the fencing team at the age of 15, and everything had to start from scratch. &quot;My thoughts and thoughts at that time were completely chaotic, like a ball of knotted hemp rope.&quot; She has experienced too many ups and downs. Sun Yiwen could only encourage himself silently, &quot;This state must be temporary. There will always be low points in life. It depends on how you overcome it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, due to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, Held in 2016, Sun Yiwen adjusted back to his form in time during the Olympic points competition. By blending the strengths of both sets of technical ideas, she developed a new combat style. In the summer of 2021, she won the gold medal in the Tokyo Olympics women&#39;s epee individual finals, defeating Romania&#39;s Popescu, who was ranked number one in the world at the time. The only regret was that in the subsequent team competition, Sun Yiwen was injured and had to be replaced. The Chinese women&#39;s epee team eventually failed to reach the top four of the team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, Sun Yiwen missed several major events in 2022 due to injuries. In an interview with the media in early 2022, she described her injuries this way, &quot;I now have a torn posterior cruciate ligament and water accumulation in my left leg, a knee cyst, a worn meniscus, and a long stretch from the back of my right leg to the knee. Injury. Even if I move a few times or when the weather is bad, my knee will still hurt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many other sports, few people can maintain absolute dominance in the field of fencing. force. In the past year, Sun Yiwen has been participating in the competition while sick due to the lumbosacral pressure on the nerves in her legs. She has been exploring how to coexist with the injury technically and psychologically. At the World Fencing Championships in Milan in July, Sun Yiwen won the bronze medal in the women&#39;s epee individual event. This was her first time winning an individual event medal at the World Championships. In a post-match interview, Sun Yiwen said that this bronze medal was a &quot;heart booster&quot; for her and made her understand that she &quot;can do it&quot; despite injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t care about winning or losing, but I have perseverance. I think I can do things that others can do. Injuries, difficulties and problems are in front of me, and I will never run away from them. I won&#39;t be afraid, I will definitely solve it. The higher you go, the more problems you will encounter.&quot; In Sun Yiwen&#39;s view, the most important lesson her 18-year fencing career has taught her is &quot;not to accept weakness. Don’t admit defeat.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;(Reference materials: &quot;Blog World&quot;, &quot;GQ Report&quot;, Chao News, Dazhong Yantai Channel, Forbes China, &quot;Wonderful OK&quot;, &quot;Qilu Evening News&quot;, China News Network, &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, Shangguan News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
