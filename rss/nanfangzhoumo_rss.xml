The statues were defaced and vandalized, causing concern. After seeing the pictures, netizens lamented: &quot;It makes me want to cry. The protection of cultural relics has a long way to go.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The daubed statue is a new discovery in 2021&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Pictures posted by netizens show that the statue has been painted colorfully.

In February 2022, the Bazhong Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau, the School of Archeology and Museum of Sichuan University, the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum and the Nanjiang County Cultural Relics Protection Research Center jointly conducted an investigation of the cliff statues. The subsequent report concluded that:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;Cliff statues were rarely excavated in the late Northern Wei Dynasty, and were continued in the early Tang &lt;span>;, Wu Zhou and middle and late Tang dynasties. The excavation date was early and the formation process was complicated. The entire natural stone package on the ground was excavated into a stele for the statue. The characteristic practice is an isolated example in Sichuan. These materials have very important academic value in completing the development sequence of Sichuan grottoes and revealing the Buddhist culture and art exchanges between Sichuan and the northern Central Plains.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bba7b257b7a0b0b11359cbf62d37a1f6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bba7b257b7a0b0b11359cbf62d37a1f6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/f853a85bd792a1975d1d34c3a761dd02.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;688&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/f853a85bd792a1975d1d34c3a761dd02.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258374&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;After another local cliff statue was daubed (top picture) and before it was daubed (bottom picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; The cultural protection staff did not have time to stop it after discovering it&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter called the Bazhong Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau. A staff member said that the incident happened two days ago, and he went to stop it after discovering it through surveillance. &quot;Because it is in a barren mountain, they had already finished painting it when we arrived. The statue was discovered only two years ago and has not yet been included in the cultural protection unit. We have built a cultural relic shed and surveillance, but it is too far away.&quot; Inside the mountains, local protection capabilities are also limited. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff said that those who daubed the statues were all old men in their 70s and 80s, saying that they were &quot;clothing the Bodhisattva and fulfilling his vows.&quot; &quot;It is not easy for us to deal with it, we can only criticize and educate. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As to whether the statue can be restored to its original appearance, staff from the Bazhong Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau said that the paint used on the statue is mainly acrylic. Relevant experts have been invited to demonstrate, &quot;It should be possible to restore it, and we will Strengthen publicity and education on cultural relics protection, and also call on everyone to increase awareness of cultural relics protection through the media. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;Local report: The public security organs have intervened in the investigation&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the early morning of the 15th, the Nanjiang County Cultural Relics Protection Research Center issued a report on the &quot;Shifei River Cliff&quot; Report on the situation of &quot;the statues were painted&quot;:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 13, some of the cliff statues in Shifeihe County were painted, which aroused widespread concern among netizens.

As long as it is a &#39;national security unit&#39;, it has basically been restored and I can hardly recognize it anymore. &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;National Protection Units&quot;, that is, key cultural relics protection units in the country, are directly allocated by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage for protection and are the strongest.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, Guangzhou woman Liao Hua (pseudonym) was pursued across provinces by Shandong police on suspicion of drug trafficking, which attracted attention. Liao Hua repeatedly stated that the analgesic drugs she resold for 260 yuan were left behind by her father after his death. With the idea of ​​saving and not wasting, she transferred the drugs among her patients, not knowing that they were &quot;drugs.&quot; &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Yangxin County Court of Shandong Province held in the first instance that Liao Hua violated national regulations on drug management and, for the purpose of profit, trafficked drugs controlled by national regulations. Psychotropic drugs that make humanoids addictive constitute the crime of drug trafficking. In the first instance, he was sentenced to two months&#39; detention, suspended for three months, and fined RMB 1,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua said that after the verdict of the first instance was announced, the more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she became. Previously, she only thought that she was violating laws and regulations by selling prescription drugs, but she did not expect that it would be a serious criminal charge such as &quot;drug trafficking&quot;. Since her job is administrative accounting, the criminal stain will greatly affect her career development. Liao Hua chose to appeal. At the end of October 2023, the second instance of the case was heard in Binzhou Intermediate Court, and no verdict has been announced yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 13, the judge in charge of the Binzhou Intermediate Court case told Southern Weekend reporters that the court will conduct an investigation in accordance with legal provisions, and the direction and progress of the investigation will be determined during the trial. It won&#39;t be announced until it&#39;s over. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Both drugs and drugs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua said that the drugs he sold were all leftovers taken by his father before his death. Liao Hua&#39;s father suffered from advanced rectal cancer. During the treatment, he often suffered fractures and suffered severe pain. The hospital prescribed many types of painkillers. After his father died of a serious illness, Liao Hua didn&#39;t know what to do with the leftover medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, Liao Hua entered a &quot;patients exchange residual medicine transfer group&quot; through the introduction of patients, and transferred his father&#39;s remaining 15 medicines to treat COVID-19, joint pain, etc. Put the medicines together, take photos and send them to the WeChat group. At that time, a person nicknamed &quot;Xiao Wang&quot; in the group quickly added Liao Hua and sent a private message to inquire about purchasing tramalin hydrochloride and telenine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua told Southern Weekend reporters that after the accident, she noticed that although people in the group often switched drugs, most of them were anti-cancer and chemotherapy drugs. Painkillers are less common. The three boxes of tramalin hydrochloride and two boxes of Telenine that she resold to Xiao Wang for 260 yuan were &quot;other narcotic drugs and psychotropic drugs controlled by the state that can induce humanoid addiction.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On July 14, 2023, after receiving the express delivery, Xiao Wang drove to the local police station, reporting that he had purchased the national drug online without a prescription. Controlled drugs, “These are narcotics and can also be regarded as drugs.” The police&#39;s transcript of their inquiry showed that Xiao Wang was a drug addict in Yangxin County, Shandong Province. He had &quot;skated on the ice&quot; (smoked methamphetamine) before and wanted to use these drugs as a substitute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tang Jianbin, a lawyer at Beijing Jingdu Law Firm who has long represented drug criminal cases, told Southern Weekend reporters that the national drug control targets include traditional drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana. In addition, there is also a type of &quot;narcotic drugs&quot; that have both medicinal properties and drug properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tang Jianbin introduced that in judicial practice, to judge whether it is a &quot;drug&quot;, we must first check whether the substance is in the list of anesthetic drugs controlled by the state, that is, the state The latest &quot;Catalogue of Narcotic Drugs&quot;, &quot;Catalog of Psychotropic Drugs&quot; and &quot;Supplementary Catalog of Controlled Varieties of Non-Medicinal Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Drugs&quot; released by the Food and Drug Administration, the Ministry of Public Security and the National Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter checked and found that these lists are dynamically updated. For example, codeine in cough drops is an analgesic, but due to its addiction Sex, as early as 2000, there was an addiction to cough drops. Relevant departments have successively issued a series of regulations, requiring &quot;sales based on prescriptions&quot;, &quot;sales and purchases in appropriate amounts&quot; and &quot;monitoring of flows&quot;; in 2015, codeine-containing compound oral liquid preparations were included in the second category of psychotropic drug control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tramalin hydrochloride resold by Liao Hua this time is a central analgesic, mostly used for various postoperative pain relief, cancer pain, labor pain, etc. treat. Excessive use can cause bradycardia, convulsions, respiratory depression and coma, and is addictive. In 2008, tramadol (including its salts, single preparations and possible isomers) was included in the Class II psychotropic drugs for control. However, tramadol’s compound preparations will only be included in the Class II psychotropic drugs on July 1, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tylenine (oxycodone tablets), another drug resold by Liao Hua, is a compound preparation of oxycodone and is also widely used clinically. Analgesic drugs were included in the management of Class II psychotropic drugs on September 1, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After July 1, 2023, the nationally controlled varieties of anesthetic drugs and non-medicinal anesthetic drugs have reached 456 types and 2 entire categories (fentanyl, nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Listed&quot; means that tramalin hydrochloride and oxycodone paracetamol have dual properties of drugs and drugs. &quot;The first is the nature of drugs,&quot; Tang Jianbin explained. The listing of these anesthetic drugs does not automatically equate to drugs. They will only become &quot;drugs&quot; if they flow into the illegal drug market or are smoked by drug addicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;2023 National Court Drug Crime Trial Work Conference Minutes&quot; (Kunming Conference Minutes) issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court on June 26, 2023, knowingly Criminals or drug addicts who smuggle or sell drugs and sell narcotic drugs or psychotropic drugs that are controlled by the state and have legal medical or other uses shall be convicted and punished for the crime of drug trafficking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the minutes of the Kunming meeting, &quot;there is definite evidence to prove that for the purpose of treating diseases and other related purposes&quot;, those who privately operate anesthetic drugs with legal medical purposes are not allowed to Punished as a drug crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, whether Liao Hua still sold tramalin hydrochloride and paracetamol and oxycodone even though he knew that the other party was a drug addict has become the key to the case. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73518&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70320&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/15/3af0ad6d97.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG3215.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Chat records between Liao Hua and drug buyers.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is it &quot;fishing for law enforcement&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the process of purchasing drugs online, Xiao Wang once revealed that he was a drug addict. The chat records between the two parties show that Xiao Wang once said: &quot;I used to skate, but now I can&#39;t buy it. I use these medicines instead! I&#39;m still a little addicted now! It&#39;s too hard to quit.&quot; Liao Hua did not reply immediately, and Xiao Wang later mentioned To: &quot;I&#39;m not sick. I used to play music and smoke marijuana, but it&#39;s hard to find it now! Use this medicine to replace it!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liao Hua argued, She didn’t know what “skating” meant, and her understanding of tramalin hydrochloride and telenine had always been limited to painkillers. She didn&#39;t pay attention to the words Xiao Wang said about addiction and difficulty in quitting. After sending the medicine, she also suggested that if Xiao Wang had pain, he could try acupuncture of traditional Chinese medicine. This was her previous pain relief experience when taking care of her father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fu Chengchen, a lawyer at Hubei Today Law Firm, believes that the key to this case is whether it can be determined that &quot;drugs&quot; were knowingly committed. Liao Hua&#39;s above statement can be used as a defense reason, but objectively Liao Hua has carried out the act of selling &quot;drugs&quot;, and what she resold is the medicine that her father has used. She is very clear about the effects of the medicine, and may even prescribe medicine before the doctor During the process, you will have a certain understanding of the nature of controlled prescription drugs. To determine that he &quot;did not know&quot; it was a drug, further evidence and the judge&#39;s discretion are needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to another chat record provided by Liao Hua, she also donated fentanyl pain relief patches to a gastric cancer patient who had undergone surgery, and the other party expressed her gratitude. . Liao Hua said that his original intention was to help patients, not to sell medicine specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​month after the incident, Xiao Wang, who had contacted Liao Hua to buy medicine, once again added friends in the WeChat group who wanted to transfer medicine. . Liao Hua noticed that the group photo of drugs transferred also included Tramalin Hydrochloride Sustained Release Tablets. She suspected that the man was &quot;fishing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tang Jianbin analyzed that when drug addicts purchase alternative drugs in drug switching groups, they actively indicate that their drug taking behavior is not consistent with common sense. In this case, these few sentences constitute the key to Liao Hua&#39;s drug trafficking crime. It is necessary to consider whether this approach is suspected of &quot;criminal inducement&quot;, that is, the party himself does not have the intention to commit the crime, and special personnel induce him to commit the crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the minutes of the Kunming meeting, evidence materials obtained when there is &quot;criminal inducement&quot; by persons who conceal their identity should be excluded. After excluding the above evidence, if the evidence in the case does not meet the standard of proof to find the seduced person guilty, a not guilty verdict shall be made in accordance with the law because the evidence is insufficient and the alleged crime cannot be established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But currently, there is no definite evidence for the &quot;fishing law enforcement&quot; questioned by Liao Hua.

The heads of state of China and the United States met and were invited to attend the 30th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting. The two heads of state will have in-depth communication on strategic, overall and directional issues related to China-US relations, as well as major issues related to world peace and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Heads of State diplomacy is the &quot;compass&quot; and &quot;fixing star&quot; of Sino-US relations. Therefore, all walks of life in China and the United States and the international community are looking forward to this meeting in San Francisco. They look forward to Sino-US relations under the guidance of the heads of state&#39;s diplomacy strategy. Get back on the right track of healthy and stable development as soon as possible. At this critical juncture, Xinhua News Agency launched a series of commentary reports on &quot;Pushing China-U.S. Relations Back on Track&quot;, calling on the United States to work with China to meet each other halfway, overcome interference, eliminate obstacles, accumulate results, create an atmosphere, and jointly promote China-U.S. relations to return to healthy and stable development. track. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;On the return to the consensus of the heads of state: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Return to Bali, to San Francisco&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/81189d3f04a246747fbb029002acbbe4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/81189d3f04a246747fbb029002acbbe4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258349&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;To make expectations for stable and developed Sino-US relations a reality, China and the United States need to meet each other halfway. The action road map is also very clear, which is to return to Bali and lead to San Francisco, truly implement the consensus reached by the Chinese and US presidents at the Bali meeting, expand the positive agenda of bilateral relations, reduce the negative agenda, create conditions for the San Francisco meeting, eliminate interference, and accumulate results and create an atmosphere. There is no doubt that the journey back to Bali and to San Francisco will not be smooth sailing, and we cannot rely on &quot;automatic driving&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only by returning to Bali can we lead to San Francisco. Returning to Bali is the foundation and prerequisite. In recent times, China-US relations have shown some positive signs precisely because the follow-up and implementation of the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Bali has been accelerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We hope that the positive stance shown by the United States in recent interactions between China and the United States is not political calculation and tactical speculation, and that the verbal commitments made can become concrete policies and substantive actions. We also hope that the United States will not be fettered by domestic party disputes and the selfish interests of politicians, and will work together with China to make long-term efforts to accumulate good news and momentum in China-U.S. relations and promote the real stabilization and improvement of bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the most important set of bilateral relations in the world, Sino-US relations affect the future and destiny of mankind. During the meeting in Bali, President Xi Jinping emphasized that Sino-US relations should be viewed and handled from the perspective of grasping the general trend of the world. What is the general trend of the world? It is peace, development, cooperation, and win-win that have become the trend of the times, and no country or group of countries can dominate world affairs alone; it is the era of the &quot;Great Awakening&quot; in the global South, and human society is accelerating into a multi-polar world; it is the time for humankind to transcend We are increasingly becoming a community with a shared future in which we are among you and you are among us. At the same time, we are also facing many global challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Second Discussion on Calibrating the Course of Relationship:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;China and the United States must find the right way to get along&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/0ac4418ea1390505b89c25926818c887.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/0ac4418ea1390505b89c25926818c887.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258351&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As two world powers, whether China and the United States can establish a correct way to get along is crucial to world peace and development and the future and destiny of mankind. For some time, the changes in the relationship between the two countries have affected the hearts of the world. Its ups and downs have shown the seriousness and complexity of Sino-US relations. It is not easy to establish a correct way for major countries to get along with each other. It will be affected by various factors. On the other hand, the two sides finally eliminated the interference and reached the important consensus of &quot;returning to Bali&quot; and &quot;facing San Francisco&quot;, which once again proved that as long as we have a responsible attitude towards history, the world and the people, we can establish a correct attitude towards each other. With rational understanding and the greatest sincerity in improving relations, Sino-US relations can develop in a positive direction, truly stabilize and get better, and return to the right track of healthy and stable development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for how China and the United States can get along correctly, President Xi Jinping has already given a clear answer, which is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. These three principles are important conclusions drawn from examining the ups and downs of Sino-US relations for more than half a century. They are the correct way for major countries to interact with each other in today&#39;s era. They are the key to ensuring that the two giant ships of China and the United States do not yaw, stall, or interact with each other. hit an important beacon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without respect, there is no trust; without trust, there is no way to avoid conflicts and no real cooperation. This is an important experience accumulated in Sino-US exchanges and a basic prerequisite for bilateral relations to get back on track. Keeping the bottom line of peace is the right choice that China and the United States must make. Win-win cooperation has been the true narrative of Sino-US relations for half a century, and it is also the common goal that both sides should continue to strive for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along the way from Bali, the recovery of Sino-US relations has been hard-won and deserves to be cherished. Facing San Francisco, both sides should draw inspiration from the past, gather forces that work toward each other, jointly explore and build a new era of Sino-US relations, and create a bright future for both China and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Three discussions on correctly defining relationships: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Competition and confrontation are not in line with the trend of the times&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3d831fec756e7799ca88717c940571ca.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width= &quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/3d831fec756e7799ca88717c940571ca.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258350&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;How Sino-US relations develop ultimately depends on the two major countries’ understanding of each other. If cooperation dominates the perception, bilateral relations will develop in a good direction; if competition dominates the perception or even defines the entire relationship by competition, antagonism will continue to increase, and there is a risk of slipping into the abyss of a &quot;new cold war.&quot; At present, the key for the United States to straighten out its relations with China is to establish a correct understanding of China, get out of zero-sum game thinking, accumulate and expand cooperation, and continue to promote the stabilization and improvement of Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As two major countries, China and the United States have both cooperation and competition in trade, technology, diplomacy and other fields. It is not about you losing and me winning, or life and death, but you should be catching up with each other and making progress together. China does not shy away from competition nor is it afraid of competition, but competition should be fair, reasonable, and benign, with red lines and restricted areas. We cannot ignore market economic rules and basic norms of international relations, let alone use issues of core interests as a tool of competition or a means of provocation. Competition in China should be track and field events. There are tracks and rules, and you can improve your own performance while chasing each other. Just like what athletes pursue in competition is to constantly improve themselves, break through themselves, and achieve better results, rather than giving other athletes &quot;Stumbling&quot; or malicious interference, otherwise you will only be ejected for violating the rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Competition is not the whole story of Sino-US relations. The economies of China and the United States are more complementary than competitive. The essence of China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutual benefit and win-win results. Under the current situation, the common interests between China and the United States have not decreased, but have increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As two major countries, China and the United States bear important responsibilities for the prosperity and development of mankind. Whether we will jointly open a new era of human development through cooperation or slide into the abyss of conflict and confrontation between major powers is the question of the century that the two countries must answer. Breaking out of the narrow perspective of who wins and who loses and pursuing the noble goal of winning together for mankind should become the common pursuit of China and the United States in the new era. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Four Discussions on Improving Cooperation Consensus: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The earth can accommodate China and the United States’ respective development and common prosperity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bbf6559966456f470c67eaca5d5e8e57.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/bbf6559966456f470c67eaca5d5e8e57.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258348&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent times, the trend of positive interaction between China and the United States has been increasing. On the one hand, the United States continues to introduce restrictive measures on China&#39;s science and technology, economic and trade cooperation, driven by the consciousness of &quot;competition&quot;. On the other hand, it also seeks to contact China through various channels, showing signs of &quot;seeking common ground&quot; that has been rare in recent years. Fundamentally, China and the United States are the two largest economies in the world. Sino-US relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world. The economic ties between the two countries are deep and wide. Neither the two countries nor the world can afford miscalculation of intentions and confrontation and conflict. heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development and progress of China and the United States can become opportunities rather than challenges for each other. The economies of the two countries are more complementary than competitive. China and the United States should be mutually beneficial and win-win rather than a zero-sum game. Both sides can achieve each other&#39;s achievements. Make the pie of common interests bigger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-US cooperation not only has existing advantages, but also has incremental advantages. Although China and the United States are each other&#39;s important trading partners, with an annual trade volume of hundreds of billions of dollars, there is still room for growth in bilateral trade, which is unmatched by bilateral economic and trade relations between the United States and other countries. Cooperation will open up more room for growth in a wider range of areas for both parties. Technology research and development exchanges and joint investments in the field of &quot;carbon neutrality&quot; will benefit both parties; the demand for medical services by the aging population in China and the United States will increase significantly in the future, and the exchange of medical technology and data will bring great value to both parties; China&#39;s ultra-large-scale medium Income groups provide immeasurable potential markets for U.S. agricultural products; both the United States and China benefit from two-way investment flows, and encouraging mutual investment will feed back the economies of both countries from multiple angles... The list of cooperation between the two sides can be very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vast earth can fully accommodate the respective development and common prosperity of China and the United States. The Chinese people, like the American people, are self-respecting, confident and self-reliant people, and both have the right to pursue a better life. The common interests existing between the two countries should be taken seriously. The success of each is an opportunity rather than a threat to the other. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Five arguments to consolidate the foundation of public opinion: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Gather the positive energy of Sino-US exchanges and cooperation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/817b7b6597dfe47c2b5300188083c049.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;1138&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/817b7b6597dfe47c2b5300188083c049.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258352&quot;>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Although China and the United States are separated by vast oceans, the people of China and the United States have a long history of exchanges and cooperation. &quot;The relationship between countries lies in the mutual affinity between people.&quot; Looking back on the past, the friendly people-to-people exchanges between China and the United States have never been interrupted, and the people of the two countries have also forged a deep friendship during the exchanges, which has played an important role in the development of Sino-US relations. History has fully proved that the people of China and the United States can transcend differences in systems, cultures, and languages ​​and establish a profound friendship. Mutually beneficial and win-win non-governmental exchanges between China and the United States are not only an independent choice made by the two peoples, but also an unstoppable historical trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when Sino-US relations are at a critical crossroads, continuous people-to-people exchanges and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation are particularly valuable, injecting a steady stream of positive energy into the healthy development of bilateral relations. The more flights, cargo ships, tourists, and students and scholars across the Pacific, the more solid the public opinion foundation, the broader the space, and the stronger the impetus for the development of China-U.S. relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both China and the United States should handle, manage, and develop bilateral relations with a responsible attitude towards the people of both countries and proceed from the well-being of the two peoples, so as to inherit and carry forward the precious values ​​for the two peoples. The legacy of friendship creates favorable atmosphere and conditions and builds a solid public opinion foundation for friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Recently, the &quot;general climate&quot; of Sino-US relations has been warming up. More and more people from all walks of life in China and the United States are calling for the two countries to expand exchanges and cooperation, working hard to promote mutual understanding and mutual understanding between the two peoples, and sending out a positive message of Sino-US people-to-people friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-US relations still face many difficulties and challenges, and there is a long way to go to stabilize and improve relations between the two countries. Fortunately, these fundamental people-to-people ties from history still exist, and positive energy to promote the development of Sino-US relations is constantly gathering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“去中国躲一下”，缅北战区逃生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;There is a war in our hometown, let&#39;s go to China to hide.&quot; Alan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 10, Myanmar&#39;s &quot;post-90s generation&quot; Alan queued up at Ruili Port in Yunnan, waiting to enter the country. Compared with 7 days ago, the speed this time is much faster. &quot;On the Chinese side, it can be done in one hour.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alan’s family is in Guikai Town, Muse City, Shan State, Myanmar, and his ancestral home is Yunnan, China. In late October this year, when Alan returned to his hometown for a short stay, he unexpectedly encountered a sudden war. &quot;You could hear gunfire in the first few days, and the road to China was also blocked.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until November 4 that Alan returned to Muse Port again, where she saw many people like her queuing up to go to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, a large number of Han immigrants have moved into northern Myanmar, gradually forming an important Chinese settlement area. It is closely connected with Yunnan, China. Many residents speak Chinese and write Chinese characters, and have a natural affinity for Chinese culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the conflict in northern Myanmar broke out, there were not a few Chinese in northern Myanmar who &quot;took refuge in China&quot; like Alan. Along the thousands-kilometer border, they either enter China or enter the China-Myanmar border refugee rescue point, hoping to experience a moment of peace here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73514&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70316&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/15/4f8ecd78b4.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Ruili.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ruili National Gate, Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China.

Looking out the window, it was still dark outside. She felt that the sound of gunfire this time was different from before, and the sound was more powerful. They hid in the corridor for safety, and there was a firefight just outside the wall. &quot;The fighting was fierce on the bridge at that time, and I heard someone screaming.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more than 20 families of Bamar people working here living near Wu Xing’s home. As the daylight grew brighter and the sound of gunfire faded, some workers came to explore the streets and were discovered by armed soldiers occupying the area. &quot;There is still a group of old Burmese there!&quot; Wu Xing heard someone shouting, and then intensive gunshots suddenly rang out again, and her heart skipped a beat again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Here, many Chinese refer to the Burmese as ‘Lao Burmese’.” Wu Xing saw that at the request of armed soldiers, these workers put their hands on their heads and separated men and women to check whether they were carrying weapons. After discovering that they were civilians, the workers were released. &quot;I didn&#39;t actually shoot anyone, I just wanted to scare them,&quot; Wu Xing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After dawn, soldiers in military uniforms went from door to door calling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she arrived at the door of Wu Xing&#39;s house, she quickly explained that she was a local citizen. &quot;They asked people to leave quickly, saying that Burmese military planes might come to bomb later.&quot; Wu Xing and her husband immediately set off as quickly as possible. &quot;Each person has one set of clothes and some cash. I didn&#39;t bring anything else.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the conflict, Wu Xing, who heard the news, sent his daughter and mother to Mengding in advance, and She and her husband stayed with a sense of luck. After the thrill, Wu Xing couldn&#39;t help but sigh: &quot;I really didn&#39;t expect to survive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Wu Xing and her husband have temporarily settled down in Nandeng, Wa State. It&#39;s very close to home, it only takes 10 minutes to drive back. For several days in a row, Wu Xing drove home during the day and returned to South Deng District in the afternoon. She said the home was largely undamaged, with a car and a motorcycle parked in the yard. When I went back, they were still in the same place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A few houses were bombed, but most of them are still in good condition.&quot; After finishing speaking, Wu Xing added, &quot;I don&#39;t know if they will be bombed again in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Border refuge,&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;The road was once congested&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At about 6 o&#39;clock in the morning on November 9, pale white fog enveloped the Kokang 125 refugee relief site in Myanmar. Dark blue and light green waterproof tents are lined up on the dirt floor, and a small yellow building stands tall not far away. &quot;This place was originally designed as an economic cooperation zone, but it was not developed. Now there are some unfinished buildings left,&quot; said A Wei, a volunteer at the rescue site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Awei, the 125 refugee relief site is located in Kokang 125 Industrial Park, covering an area of ​​more than 100 acres. Soon after the conflict in northern Myanmar broke out, more than 2,000 people rushed to the rescue site. Pictures taken at the rescue site show that many children and the elderly live in simple tents outdoors. A mat is spread on the yellow mud floor to form a bed. Some families set up earthen stoves at the door to light a fire for cooking, and use colorful plastic low stools as dining tables. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Refugees who come early can live in the iron tents indoors, while those who come late can only set up tents outside.&quot; A Wei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73517&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70319&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/15/23181e76b0.png&quot; img-title=&quot;Refugee 4.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the Kokang 125 refugee relief site in Myanmar, many Burmese people only carry a small amount of luggage with them.

Each family here has an average of 4-5 children.” Awei said that some families pretend to receive supplies, and the management staff of the rescue points are limited, so they are often fooled. &quot;Some people ask their sons to collect it once, and their father collects it again. Some people collect it and sell it to others at a high price.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The stored rice is basically gone.&quot; Ah Wei told a Southern Weekend reporter on November 9 , the materials at the rescue site come from donations from caring people from other places, local purchases, imports from China, etc. Affected by local conflicts, the road from Lower Burma to Lao Cai is blocked, relief supplies including food cannot be transported in, and tents, rice and other supplies are in urgent need. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rescue station is close to the 125 boundary marker between China and Myanmar, and is only separated by a wall from China&#39;s Nanshan Port. For a long time, this was the main channel for Kokang border residents to enter China. &quot;The most convenient place to go from Kokang to China is Nanxian.&quot; A Wei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that Nanshan Port is located in Nanshan Town, Zhenkang County, Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. It is only about 10 kilometers away from Laojie, the capital of Kokang. However, the entry and exit of China&#39;s Nanshan Port is temporarily closed, and many Kokang people holding passes are unable to pass through the port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since November 13, Zhenkang has issued an announcement to promote the normalization of mutual trade between border residents. According to the announced process, starting from that day, border residents and enterprises in Zhenkang can declare in advance and receive vehicles and goods at the port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After China&#39;s national door is opened, materials can come in from China, and the shortage of materials should be improved. However, Myanmar personnel are still unable to enter and exit through the Nanshan Port. At present, it is still only currency, not people. &quot;Awei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Chinese border, the Wa State adjacent to Kokang has also become a refuge choice for many Myanmar people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73516&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70318&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 + Picture)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1766&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/05c118ff2b.png&quot; data-key =&quot;258314&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the conflict broke out in northern Myanmar on October 27, there was an influx of people from the South Deng District of Wa State in northern Myanmar. A large number of people fled. (Photo courtesy of the interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Gong’s hometown is Qujing, Yunnan, and he is currently engaged in clothing wholesale business in the Wa State and Xiaomengla areas in northern Myanmar. After the conflict in northern Myanmar broke out, he witnessed the influx of many Burmese people from the war zone in the South Deng District of Wa State. In the video he showed to Southern Weekend reporters, a large number of people gathered at the rescue point in Nandeng, waiting for the distribution of supplies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The fighting started on the morning of the 27th, and many people ran to Nandeng on the afternoon of the 27th.&quot; Mr. Gong said that the fleeing people were placed in an open square, and Wa State Army soldiers were responsible for registration personnel, maintain order, and distribute supplies free of charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People come by car if they can, and ordinary people ride motorcycles or walk. Maybe because of the sudden incident, many people are empty-handed. Some people go out with only a blanket.&quot; Mr. Gong said. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the large number of people fleeing from the Kokang war zone, roads in the neighboring Wa State were once congested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Voice of the Kokang Nation&quot; on November 7, there have been at least 400 vehicles on the road from Shiyuanzi to Changjie Street in the past few days. About 500 to 600 people wanted to seek refuge in neighboring areas but were trapped. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the graphic and text materials it released, a winding &quot;vehicle train&quot; was driving towards the Wa State on a cement road about three to four meters wide. Eager people opened the car doors and stood on the road in groups of three or three, stretching their necks to look at the &quot;dragon head&quot; in the distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xing, who also moved to Wa State, lamented, &quot;Fortunately we left early, otherwise we would have been stuck on the road.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I will get passes for my parents in the future.&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Alan has eight brothers and sisters, ranking second in the family. When he was a child, Alan&#39;s father burned charcoal to feed his family and lived in the mountains all year round. Alan and his brothers and sisters helped their father carry charcoal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are no protective measures. For example, you go in first and hand out the charcoal piece by piece. If you can&#39;t hold it anymore, let me go in instead.&quot; Alan remembered that when he came out of the charcoal kiln, his whole body was filled with excitement. Stained black by charcoal ash, &quot;even the phlegm coughed out is black.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because his family was poor, Alan only went to elementary school and worked in Ruili since he was 16 years old. In her hometown, many girls of the same age choose to work in China. Compared with big cities in Myanmar such as Yangon and Naypyitaw, Ruili is “closer and has higher wages.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Alan is the only one in the family who has a China-Myanmar border pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After one entry and exit, she can stay in Ruili for seven days; after seven days, she will return to Muse, Myanmar. After completing one entry and exit, she can stay for another seven days. By continually &quot;renewing&quot; the pass, Alan can travel across borders without having to apply for a passport, which has a more cumbersome process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is only a few tens of meters between China’s Ruili National Gate and Myanmar’s Muse National Gate. You can see the China-Myanmar boundary monument No. 81 on the way. For Alan, this road is all too familiar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First pass through the Chinese gate, go to Myanmar (national gate) to get a stamp. Then come to China (national gate) to get a stamp, and it&#39;s done.&quot; Alan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While working in Ruili, Alan initially worked as a waiter in a Chinese-run restaurant. Because she knows Chinese characters and speaks Chinese, her salary is always higher than that of other fellow Burmese who came with her. Over the past ten years, her salary has increased from 200 yuan per month to 2,000 yuan per month. Most of the money earned goes to support the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the rise of live streaming platforms in recent years, Alan began to share his life on social platforms and at the same time sell e-commerce products. Every once in a while, she sends orders for tea, honey, souvenirs and other products from Myanmar to all parts of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many Chinese brothers and sisters support me. I am especially grateful to them.” Alan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the entry and exit channels are open, residents on the China-Myanmar border can conveniently trade across the border with their passes. Myanmar&#39;s rice, sugar, rubber, beef, tea and other agricultural and sideline products are sold to the mainland, and businessmen earn the price difference. Myanmar’s jadeite and other mineral deposits are also distributed here. For residents on the China-Myanmar border, this represents unlimited business opportunities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it costs about hundreds of thousands to 500,000 kyats to get a pass, which amounts to a few hundred to a thousand yuan in total. Due to financial difficulties at home, Alan&#39;s family has never applied for additional documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing in his hometown due to the war, Alan felt very tortured. When I was sleeping, I was worried whether a gun would suddenly fall on my head. It wasn&#39;t until she returned to Ruili that she could have a good night&#39;s sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the conflict in northern Myanmar, Alan firmly decided to apply for certificates for his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a way to spend money this time.&quot; Alan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“No party can afford to offend”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the ethnic list of Myanmar formulated in 1983, the Kokang ethnic group was listed as one of the 135 ethnic groups by the Myanmar government. Specifically refers to people living in the Kokang area in northern Shan State, Myanmar, adjacent to Zhenkang and Gengma counties in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shilu, a scholar of Chinese Burmese studies, pointed out in the article &quot;The &quot;Kokang Tribe&quot; in Myanmar: Ethnic Name, Origin, Situation and Transnational Interaction&quot; that the name &quot;Kokang Tribe&quot; is very unscientific from an ethnological perspective. Yes, these overseas Chinese and Chinese people called the &quot;Kokang ethnic group&quot; should actually be the &quot;Yunnan Gang&quot; among overseas Chinese and Chinese people in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the private sector, many Chinese in northern Myanmar habitually call themselves &quot;Han people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Alan’s hometown still sees familiar Han customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, there are couplets with gold characters on a red background on the door frame of the house, a tablet with the words &quot;Lord of Heaven and Earth, Lord, Prince and Master&quot; stands prominently in the middle hall, and there is an incense burner in front of the stage. Alan said that every lunar month and half, the Spring Festival, etc., the whole family would place tributes and solemnly kneel down and pray here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alan’s grandfather passed away very early, and his grandmother told Alan that their ancestral home was Longling County, Baoshan, Yunnan, China. Alan has never been to Longling, his ancestral home, and has no impression of it. She said that the Chinese city she most wanted to visit was Beijing, and one day she wanted to see Tiananmen Square. &quot;We all read Chinese books, and we have been yearning for them since we were young.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Myanmar formally became independent from the British Commonwealth in 1948, dozens of local armed groups in the country engaged in long-term armed confrontation with the central government in border areas, seeking independence. The Kokang, Wa State, Myanmar Kachin State Second Special Administrative Region and Myanmar Eastern Shan State Fourth Special Administrative Region on the northern China-Myanmar border are controlled by four powerful armed forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, the central government of Myanmar did not really control the region. Amid multiple conflicts, local armed forces in northern Myanmar have taken turns taking charge, and fighting continues in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the Myanmar government has launched attacks on local ethnic armed forces in northern Myanmar, and its regional control has gradually increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 25, 2011, the Kokang region was officially renamed &quot;Kokang Autonomous Region in Northern Shan State, Myanmar&quot;. On March 26, 2015, the Myanmar military announced that it controlled the entire Kokang region and adopted a policy of integrating the Kokang region into Myanmar, vigorously introducing Burmese teachers and using Burmese language teaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We have read Chinese books and spoken Chinese since we were young. But we are Burmese and we must listen to the Burmese government.” Wu Xing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just eight years later, artillery fire broke out again in the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Voice of the Kokang Nation&quot; on November 13, 18 days since the start of the &quot;10.27 Military Operation&quot;, the coalition forces have captured towns such as Qingshuihe, Menggu, Gunong and recaptured large and small military strongholds. 141, and a batch of weapons and ammunition were seized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Frequent wars and changes in local political power have kept the people secretive about the forces of all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Kokang area fights a small war every three years and a major war every five years.&quot; Ah Wei is less than 50 years old and has experienced four or five wars. He hoped that the media would remain neutral when reporting on refugee relief sites, because “no one can afford to offend any party.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In our place, dying of a person is like stepping on an ant. If you have no power and no friends, you are nothing.&quot; A Wei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;【Overview of Shan State】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Shan State is located in eastern Myanmar, bordering Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China to the north, Laos and Thailand to the east, and Kachin State and Kachin State to the west.

Historically, Chinese immigrants from Yunnan, China, immigrated in large numbers, gradually forming a Chinese settlement in northern Myanmar. There are armed forces advocating independence in southern Shan State. The eastern border with Thailand and Laos is the famous Golden Triangle area. The northern border with China is the main settlement area of ​​the Kokang (Han) ethnic group in Myanmar. From 1986 to 1989, the area formerly under the jurisdiction of the armed forces was divided into four parts, becoming the Shan State First Special Administrative Region of Myanmar (Kokang), the Shan State Second Special Administrative Region of Myanmar (Wa State), the Kachin State First Special Administrative Region of Myanmar, and the eastern part of Shan State of Myanmar.

The reason why this news is attracting attention is related to Ming Xuechang’s identity. According to public reports, Ming Xuechang is an &quot;old leader&quot; of the Kokang Autonomous Region in northern Myanmar. He has held important positions in Kokang for a long time. He once served as the county magistrate of Kokang.

The Ming family is huge in Kokang and is said to be second only to the four major Kokang families (one theory One of the four major families). In the past few days, news about the Ming family has continued to ferment. It has been circulated on the Internet that multiple people were shot and buried alive in Kokang on October 20. The location was located in the Crouching Mountain Manor area controlled by the Ming Xuechang family in Laojie, the capital of Kokang. At the same time, photos of Ming Xuechang’s grandson Ming Guangzhong receiving the admission notice from Peking University and many celebration pictures of Ming Xuechang and Ming Guangzhong at the university entrance banquet were circulated online. The Publicity Department of Peking University responded on the 13th that Ming Guangzhong was not a Peking University student, and there was no record of his application to Peking University on the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Ming Xuechang and the Ming family behind him&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Kokang Autonomous Region in northern Myanmar borders Yunnan Province, with a population of about 140,000, mostly Han Chinese. Historically, it has a deep connection with China. In 2011, the Kokang Autonomous Region was formally established as part of Shan State and is now controlled by the Myanmar military junta. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the 69-year-old Ming Xuechang joined the Communist Party of Myanmar following the Kokang warlord Peng Jiasheng in his early days and participated in the founding of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army. After the internal affairs of Myanmar changed, he was appointed by the Myanmar military government as the head of Kokang County. In 2011, he served as a member of the Shan State Parliament, Vice Chairman of the Kokang Autonomous Region, and a member of the Daily Work Committee and Leadership Committee of the Kokang Autonomous Region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the Chinese Ministry of Public Security issued the wanted order, Ming Xuechang attended a local meeting to deal with telecommunications network fraud as a senior leader in the Kokang area.

In addition, veteran regional leaders Ming Xuechang, Zhao Deqiang, and Liu Zhengxiang attended the meeting.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;This was also the last time Ming Xuechang appeared in public reports.

Ming Julan, who is the same age as Ming Xuechang, is the daughter of Ming Xuechang. There is also a member of the Ming family, 27-year-old Ming Zhenzhen.

Media reports stated that the mining, casino, and real estate operations in Kokang Old Street are all controlled by four major families, and the four major families are also the backers of electronic fraud groups in the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The arrest warrant issued by the Ministry of Public Security of China directly pointed out that the criminal group headed by Ming Xuechang has long organized and opened fraud dens, openly armed fraud, and carried out telecommunications network fraud criminal activities targeting Chinese citizens. The amount of fraud was Huge, and also suspected of multiple serious violent crimes such as intentional homicide, intentional injury, and illegal detention. The notice urged him to recognize the situation clearly, step back from the brink, voluntarily surrender, and strive for leniency. The police wanted order also stated that a reward of 100,000 to 500,000 yuan will be given to those who provide effective clues and assist in the arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just after the wanted order was issued, it was circulated on the Internet that multiple people were shot and buried alive in Kokang on October 20. The location was located in the Crouching Mountain Manor area controlled by the Ming Xuechang family in Laojie, the capital of Kokang. At the same time, the confession clips of many arrested telecom fraud leaders have attracted attention on the Internet, including Wei Qingtao, the second son of the Wei family, a member of the four major Kokang families, Liu Zhengqi, Liu Abao&#39;s brother, and Bi Huijun, the son-in-law of Ming Xuechang, who all went abroad to confess and urged their families to voluntarily surrender. , saying that China “will never withdraw its troops until it eliminates telecommunications fraud.” The Information Bureau of Myanmar&#39;s Wa State responded to media reporters on the 13th and stated that the above three people were indeed members of electronic fraud and were currently under the control of judicial agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The civil war broke out in northern Myanmar and the situation was tense. The Myanmar authorities promised to completely eliminate e-mail fraud by the end of the year&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, some ethnic Chinese minorities in northern Myanmar Ethnic armed forces are fighting the military junta, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that at least 6,000 people have been displaced since the conflict broke out on October 27. The leader of the Chinese ethnic minority armed forces, Peng Deren, is the son of Peng Jiasheng. He claimed that the war was to eliminate telecommunications network fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that China is highly concerned about the conflict situation in northern Myanmar and urges all parties to immediately cease fire and end the war. &quot;Insist on resolving differences through dialogue and consultation through peaceful means to avoid escalation of the situation, and Take practical and effective measures to ensure the security and stability of the China-Myanmar border.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the video circulated on the Internet, Wei Qingtao, the second son of the Wei family of the four major families, also said in his confession that war is currently breaking out in Myanmar and may cause disaster at any time. He suffered serious casualties and urged his family to seize the last opportunity to open the park and return the Chinese people in the park to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to CCTV News, since February 2021, domestic tensions in Myanmar have intensified, providing more opportunities for telecom fraud groups to settle in northern and eastern Myanmar and form a &quot;community of interests&quot; with local forces. space. In Myawaddy on the Myanmar-Thailand border alone, there are hundreds of fraud parks. Including fraud groups entrenched in parts of northern Myanmar, there are at least 1,000 parks in total, and more than 100,000 people commit telecom fraud every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The areas where telecom fraud groups gather in northern and eastern Myanmar are only a very small part of Myanmar’s land area, and are mostly areas controlled by ethnic minority local armed forces. However, they have dealt a fatal blow to Myanmar’s national image. &quot;CCTV reported this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the Chinese government has continuously increased cooperation and carried out joint law enforcement operations with Myanmar, Thailand and other countries to severely crack down on telecommunications network fraud in accordance with the law. Especially since this year, China has been even more aggressive. Recently, the police of China, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos launched a special joint operation to combat gambling fraud groups, aiming to severely crack down on telecommunications network fraud and online gambling crimes in the region, and resolutely reverse the high incidence of human trafficking, kidnapping, detention and other crimes. According to incomplete statistics, since September this year, many batches of telecom fraudsters have been escorted back to China from Myanmar, Cambodia and other overseas countries. On October 14, 2,349 telecom fraudsters were transferred from Myanmar to China, setting a record high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as the war broke out, on October 31, Min Aung Hlaing, Chairman of the National Governing Council of Myanmar, met with State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong in Nay Pyi Taw. Wang Xiaohong mentioned that the law enforcement and security departments of the two countries will strengthen cooperation in the fields of combating online gambling fraud, counter-terrorism, drug control, law enforcement in the Mekong River Basin, and the security of major projects, so as to safeguard the security and development interests of the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that this series of actions demonstrates China’s determination to crack down on telecommunications network fraud. Recently, Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson of the Myanmar National Governing Council, also stated that the Myanmar authorities are determined to completely eliminate online gambling and online fraud in northern Myanmar by the end of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[食品还是药品？争议中医院药膳“生意”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260623]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/5a2c29f80e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/15/5a2c29f80e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258298&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: justify;&quot;>;TCM hospitals are competing to expand The business field and entry into the &quot;business&quot; of medicinal diet are related to the traditional Chinese medicine theory of &quot;medicine and food come from the same source&quot; that has been passed down for thousands of years and people&#39;s increasing awareness of &quot;health blood&quot;.

The expansion of the medicated diet business has objectively driven an increase in the number of offline TCM clinic visits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, in reality, the business of medicated diet also faces an embarrassing situation due to the &quot;individuation of medicine and food&quot; - whether the product is positioned as a medicine or a food, it affects different business entities. , material selection and regulatory standards also affect consumer expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;Health-preserving medicated diet is different from clinical medicated diet. It must use medicinal materials with the same source of medicine and food approved by the National Health Commission, and the efficacy cannot be discussed. Strictly speaking &quot;It cannot be a clinical medicated diet that has clear therapeutic effects without a doctor&#39;s consultation and syndrome differentiation.&quot; Song Lucheng, chairman of the Medicinal Diet Branch of the Chinese Society of Chinese Medicine and director of the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Suddenly popular a year after its launch, with 80% of female users&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Sour Plum Soup was caught off guard by its popularity &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;On the day before it was removed from the shelves, the single-day sales of sour plum soup even exceeded 40,000 posts.&quot; Lu Xiaoai, director of the medical department of Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, told Southern Weekend reporters. You must know that before leaving the circle, the hospital’s average daily orders for sour plum soup were only a few hundred orders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In fact, as early as a year ago, on May 31, 2022, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine began to launch traditional Chinese medicine tea drinks on the Internet hospital platform, including health care products. There are many tea-based prescriptions for dispelling dampness in the spleen, calming the liver and lowering lipids, improving eyesight and moisturizing the eyes. The prescriptions are developed by the studio of famous doctors in the hospital, and the price of a single prescription ranges from 2 to 17 yuan. Sour plum soup will be launched in the summer of 2022. It is composed of four medicinal materials: black plum, hawthorn, licorice and tangerine peel. The prescription details page shows that the prescription has the effects of relieving heat, promoting body fluids and appetizing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It suddenly became popular a year after its launch. Lu Xiaoai believes that this reflects the current increase in enthusiasm among young people for health care. Sleep disorders, low back pain, cough, irregular menstruation, and fatigue syndrome are the top five diseases treated by Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in September 2023. They are all common sub-health problems for office workers. Traditional Chinese medicine teas are launched to target common diseases and meet the health needs of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Data provided by Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine shows that the users rushing to buy sour plum soup this time are mainly young women, with over 80% of female users aged 17-30 years old. Users account for 71.25%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Wang Ci, who lives in Hangzhou, immediately bought the sour plum soup from the Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, &quot;I thought it could be used as a substitute for milk tea, which is healthy and delicious.&quot; Two years ago, 28-year-old Wang Ci was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism due to endocrine disorders. Since then, she has been making tea, making soups, and using medicinal foods to maintain her health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Hua Bichun, vice president of the Medicinal Diet Research Professional Committee of the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies, professor and MD of Fujian University of Chinese Medicine, told Southern Weekend reporters that traditional Chinese medicine Medicinal diet has always been one of the application forms of traditional Chinese medicine. Under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine theory and through the differentiation of syndromes and diet by TCM doctors, it is often popular in different forms in different regions in different eras, and has penetrated into people&#39;s daily life and the methods of disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and health preservation. In every aspect. &quot;The basic characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine are holistic view and syndrome differentiation and treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine Dietetics is guided by the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studying the theories and experiences of traditional Chinese medicinal diets and dietary nutrition, and sorting and improving them to make them compatible with modern nutritional therapy and nutritional hygiene. A practical science in medical care that combines science and technology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;The basic method of treating diseases in traditional Chinese medicine is to use appropriate combinations of drugs, food properties and flavors to form a certain Use prescriptions to treat diseases. In addition to issuing clinical prescriptions, doctors also need to tell patients what they should and should not eat,&quot; Song Lucheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;From online to offline&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;TCM hospitals are engaged in the &quot;business&quot; of medicinal diet and It’s not new. What’s new is the business model. Currently, there are two main business models: Internet hospitals and catering stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The promotion of medicated diets on the Internet hospital platform has a lot to do with the development of Internet medical services in public hospitals across the country during the epidemic.当时，全国大批中医院利用互联网医院平台推出新冠预防制剂，打通了线上开单、配送到家的在线购药流程，并将其沿用至药膳业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;比如，河北省中医院曾在2022年12月推出“防疫食疗方”系列“药膳包”“发酵膏”；厦门市中医院在2022年11月推出中药防疫方，并于2023年4月上线健脾祛脂茶；推出酸梅汤之前，浙江省中医院也曾在互联网医院平台上线两个防疫药方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;除了线上开方，药膳推广更贴近市场化经营的路径，是在线下打造药膳餐饮品牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;柳州市中医医院治未病中心主任刘静告诉南方周末记者，“食药同园”药膳坊开业三年以来，结合广西道地药材和地方气候特色，推出了菜、汤、粥、糕点、饮品、面点等不同形式的药膳产品，其中中药奶茶最受年轻人好评。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;“中医院不能直接经营餐饮业务盈利，因此我们委托有资质的第三方餐饮企业生产药膳产品，所有产品配方都由治未病中心药膳团队研发，药材也由医院申领，保证药材质量。”刘静说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;刘静介绍，“食药同园”药膳坊的对面是柳州中医医院的营养科门诊，提供营养筛查与评估、营养咨询与指导等服务，“前来就餐的消费者如果追求适合个人体质、更有针对性的药膳，可以来门诊进一步咨询”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;线上购药膳，规定不一&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;药膳的定位不同，经营路径亦不同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;互联网医院平台推出的药膳产品定位为药品。以浙江省中医院为例，中药茶饮的药方详情页明确标注了药品名称、适应症、用法用量、禁忌和注意事项。在药材选用上，为保证药方的安全性和普适性，以药食同源物质为主，但也会选择相对平和的临床药材。消费者下单茶饮时，系统自动跳转在线复诊处方，由便捷配药门诊医师开具相关诊断信息后方能进入支付页面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;作为药品的药膳，如何辨证施治？浙江省中医院为每款协定方设置包含三道问题的问卷，用于判断消费者体质。如勾选项与答案不符，则会弹出“暂时不推荐购买，建议去医院就诊”的提示信息。不过，南方周末记者发现，用户可不限次数进入页面重新作答。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;对此，浙江省中医院在产品宣传文章中曾提示消费者“设置题目的初衷是为了辨别是否适合这个药方，不要为了跟风而去尝试各种答案，按需选择合适的就好”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/0c6134d93a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1989&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;南方周末记者发现，目前不同中医院对于线上购买药膳的管理规定并不统一。如广州中医药大学附属清远中医院的自助购药系统就要求“仅复诊者才能进行线上购药”，如系统未能读取近三个月的院内就诊记录，则无法线上开具药膳方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;食品药膳：药材受限、不提功效&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;相比中医院里定位为药品的药膳，市场更为广阔的药膳产业中，药膳通常作为食品经营。以北京同仁堂、郑州东济堂、上海童涵春堂为代表的中药房是药膳产业的主体，少数中医院则借助第三方公司开拓食品药膳业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;无论中药房或中医院，经营食品药膳都面临药材选用和疗效宣传的限制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;a>;2002&lt;/a>;年以来，国家卫健委曾多次更新“按照传统既是食品又是中药材的物质目录”，确定了共计102种“药食同源”物质（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;其中包含9种试点物质&lt;/span>;）。按照规定，面向大众的药膳食品只能选用药食同源目录内的药材作为原料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;中国药膳研究会会长杨锐在接受中国小康网专访时曾指出，药膳是一个“常在河边走”的产业，一不小心就容易触碰“食品中添加药品”或者“非法行医”的法律红线，但目前“按照传统既是食品又是中药材的物质目录”还不够健全和完善，很多既符合老百姓传统食用习惯又属于中药材的物质，例如辣椒、大蒜、黑豆等列入了《中国药典》，但却没有进入食药物质目录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;此外，养生药膳食品不同于药品，不能标注疗效。北京市海淀区市场监督管理局广告监督管理科副科长徐莹向南方周末记者表示，根据《中华人民共和国广告法》第十七条、第四十六条，以及《药品、医疗器械、保健食品、特殊医学用途配方食品广告审查管理暂行办法》第二条规定，药品不能随便做广告，药品广告必须经药监部门审查后发布，非药品的食品则禁止宣传疗效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;柳州市中医医院药膳坊营业之初，曾在菜单上标注了药膳的对应功效，经有关部门提醒后，目前的菜单仅保留主要成分，菜品名称也删除了涉及功效的词汇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;刘静认为，药膳的科普宣传和广告宣传应有所区别，找到平衡点。医疗机构对于药膳的科普宣传无法提及功效，可能让药膳推广陷入尴尬的境地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;宋鲁成注意到，有些药膳餐饮商为了规避监管，会巧妙地改变说法，“比如针对宫寒症状的药膳产品，就通过&#39;关心大姨妈&#39;这样的词汇暗示消费者”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;广东省食品安全保障促进会副会长、食品产业分析师朱丹蓬向南方周末记者表示，虽然以酸梅汤为代表的中药茶饮消费频次提升，但药膳餐饮产业目前尚无国标出台，以目前的发展水平很难形成大规模市场。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;“这些药膳产品虽然定位为药品，实际上仍以养生效果为主。就好比打仗，药膳和临床用药都朝着同一个目标，但一个是步枪，一个是大炮，打击的效果不一样。”浙江省中医院中医内科主任、中医师夏永良说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;多位中医师向南方周末记者表示，中医药膳讲求“因时、因地、因人制宜”，切忌盲目跟风。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;比如，同样是睡眠不好，有人需要清热安神，有人需要补气血，有人需要活血化瘀&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;，只有明确自身体质后服用合适药材的茶饮，才能改善症状。四川和浙江两地同样湿气深重，但人在四川吃麻辣食物可以祛湿，到了浙江就不行，这是地域湿寒和湿热的区别。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;酸梅汤风行时，“喝中药茶饮能不能加冰”曾被广泛讨论，夏永良认为，这需要根据个人体质和茶饮用药的药性来决定，“如果是体热人群服用凉茶这样清热去火的饮料，可以适当放冰。但如果茶饮性温而个人体质偏寒，加冰就会降低药效”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;“一个人的美食，可能是另一人的毒药。”宋鲁成说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;育人集团曾向员工承诺以校舍与土地提供抵押担保，借来的钱用于“共渡难关”，提出的优厚条件是以1.33%的标准向员工支付每月贷款利息，高于银行的0.66%，同时在子女上学、房产购买上给予员工福利。而从2021年底以来，集团经常停发利息，导致一部分贷款已经逾期、征信受损，还有一部分员工的贷款也将到期。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年8月2日，7名员工代表就违法放贷问题向国家金融监管总局河南监管局进行了举报。近日，国家金融监管总局河南监管局出具回复员工代表的调查意见书。经调查，郑州农商行在发放郑州育人教育集团员工消费贷款过程中，存在违反贷款“三查”规定和信贷管理不到位问题。部分员工违反合同约定改变贷款用途，协助育人集团挪用贷款资金并获取一定的经济收益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这并不是“贷款上班”第一次成为新闻。 2022年9月，兰州公交集团提出要员工以个人名义向银行贷款用于解决6到9月份工资，公交公司提供连带担保，负责按月结息、到期还本；2023年3月，国美也推出了“员工贷款”计划，引入民生银行信用贷缓解员工的欠薪压力，在公司发薪之前，每月为员工报销3万元以内的贷款利息，超出部分员工自行负责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;兰州公交“贷款上班”是为了给员工发工资，国美集团的“员工贷款”是为了缓解欠薪压力，育人集团的“贷款上班”则是笼统的“供集团使用”：让员工以个人名义贷款，然后员工将贷来的钱又交给企业，企业承诺以高于银行的利息向员工偿还这笔钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纵观事件全过程，首先要问的就是，为何企业不以自身名义进行社会融资，反而却要找员工借钱？这里面可能有经营风险较大、缺乏有效担保抵押品、企业信用低等问题。而如果企业直接向员工借钱，那么就是纯粹的民间借贷关系，企业需要承担偿还责任，还可能涉嫌非法集资罪。育人集团鼓动员工以个人名义向银行申请“装修贷”，等于是利用员工有正式工作单位、信用记录完整的条件，将员工的个人贷款资格拿来供自己使用，不仅成功地向银行贷到了钱，借款人还是员工而非企业，可谓“用心良苦”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，员工为何愿意帮助企业贷款“共渡难关”？ “部分员工违反合同约定改变贷款用途，协助育人集团挪用贷款资金并获取一定的经济收益”，金融监管局在调查意见书中的这句话显示，事件中的员工并非完全是浑然不觉的“被贷款”，至少有部分员工了解贷款资金的去向，但仍然与企业合谋完成了贷款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些员工是为了贪图那点“利息差”，还是为了保住公司也保住自己的职位，或两者兼而有之，目前看都有可能，员工与企业之间形成了实质上的共谋关系。金融监管局在意见书中“举报人提出的将借款主体变更为郑州育人教育集团的诉求属于民事纠纷，应按照民事法律法规规定通过协商或诉讼途径解决”的表述，也等于是在表明，员工既然在借款合同上签字盖章，就应承担责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不仅如此，当事员工甚至可能涉嫌违法犯罪。根据《中华人民共和国刑法》第175条，以转贷牟利为目的，套取金融机构信贷资金高利转贷他人，构成高利转贷罪，处以拘役、徒刑或罚金；而根据最高法《关于审理民间借贷案件适用法律若干问题的规定》第13条，育人集团与员工之间签订的“专项贷款使用协议”恐怕也有很大概率属于无效合同，双方的纠纷还需要通过协商或诉讼途径解决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纵观这起事件，企业巧立名目让员工以个人信用为企业贷款，银行疏于审核借贷人资格与贷款用途，员工贪图所谓“利差”与目前的职位，监管方疏于把关，各方在事件中均负有责任。 “贷款上班”事件也显示，育人集团员工与企业之间的关系出现了问题。试问，一家企业已经窘迫到需要拿员工的名义贷款来救活自己，员工保住这份工作的意义又在哪里？ &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除非有员工持股计划或是期权计划，否则员工与企业之间仅仅只存在普通的雇佣关系。育人集团的“贷款上班”称得上是巧立名目，这种行为既规避了非法集资，也不是公司内部的理财产品，也不算企业直接向员工借款，更不是什么员工持股计划或是期权计划，倒像是员工负债计划，结果也是呈现出企业与员工双输的局面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起事件中“员工贷款养企业”的行为更像是让自己沦为了企业的人质，贪图“利息差”的表现也称得上是“利令智昏”。员工与企业之间应是权责对等的雇佣关系，超越法定权责之外的“谈钱”或“谈感情”，都是站不住脚的。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;关于加强合作应对气候危机的阳光之乡声明&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;重温习近平主席和约瑟夫·拜登总统在印尼巴厘岛会晤，中美双方重申致力于合作并与其他国家共同努力应对气候危机。为此，中国气候变化事务特使解振华和美国总统气候问题特使约翰·克里于2023年7月16—19日在北京、11月4—7日在加利福尼亚阳光之乡举行会谈，并发表以下声明：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一、中美两国回顾、重申并致力于进一步有效和持续实施2021年4月中美应对气候危机联合声明和2021年11月中美关于在21世纪20年代强化气候行动的格拉斯哥联合宣言。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二、中美两国认识到，气候危机对世界各国的影响日益显著。面对政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）第六次评估报告等现有最佳科学发现的警示，两国致力于有效实施联合国气候变化框架公约和巴黎协定，体现公平以及共同但有区别的责任和各自能力的原则，考虑不同国情，根据巴黎协定第二条所述将全球平均气温上升控制在低于2℃之内并努力限制在1.5℃之内，包括努力保持1.5℃可实现，达成该协定的目的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三、中美两国致力于有效实施巴黎协定及其决定，包括格拉斯哥气候协议和沙姆沙伊赫实施计划。两国强调，公约第28次缔约方大会（COP28）对于在这关键十年及其后有意义地应对气候危机至关重要。两国认识到，两国无论是在国内应对措施还是共同合作行动方面对于落实巴黎协定各项目标、推动多边主义均具有重要作用。为了人类今世后代，两国将合作并与公约和巴黎协定其他缔约方一道直面当今世界最为严峻的挑战之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四、中美两国决定启动“21世纪20年代强化气候行动工作组”，开展对话与合作，以加速21世纪20年代的具体气候行动。工作组将聚焦联合声明和联合宣言中确定的合作领域，包括能源转型、甲烷、循环经济和资源利用效率、低碳可持续省/州和城市、毁林以及双方同意的其他主题。工作组将就控制和减少排放的政策、措施和技术进行信息交流，分享各自经验，识别和实施合作项目，并评估联合声明、联合宣言和本次声明的实施情况。工作组由两国气候变化特使共同领导，两国相关部委和政府机构的官员以适当方式参加。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;五、中美两国将于COP28之前及其后在工作组下重点加速以下具体行动，特别是切实可行和实实在在的合作计划和项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;能源转型&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;六、在21世纪20年代这关键十年，两国支持二十国集团领导人宣言所述努力争取到2030年全球可再生能源装机增至三倍，并计划从现在到2030年在2020年水平上充分加快两国可再生能源部署，以加快煤油气发电替代，从而可预期电力行业排放在达峰后实现有意义的绝对减少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;七、双方同意重启中美能效论坛，以深化工业、建筑、交通和设备等重点领域节能降碳政策交流。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;八、中美两国计划重启双边能源政策和战略对话，就共同商定的议题开展交流，推动二轨活动，加强务实合作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;九、两国争取到2030年各自推进至少5个工业和能源等领域碳捕集利用和封存（CCUS）大规模合作项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;甲烷和其他非二氧化碳温室气体排放&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>;

&lt;p>;2023年3月底，北京市政府发文称，计划到2025年，每千人口拥有3岁以下婴幼儿托位数达到4.5个，其中普惠托位占比不少于60%。到了10月，两个街道办的托儿所揭开了神秘面纱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去，北京是托育方面的“差生”：截至2022年末，千人托位数仅为1.3，远远落后于全国平均水平（2.03），也比不上深圳（2.0）、上海（2.12）和广州（3.58）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且北京95%的托育机构都是营利性的，公办托儿所只有2家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京托育为何如此稀缺？该如何追上全国的步伐？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;找个场地不容易&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;想为孩子们找到一块场地并不容易。北京市卫健系统一位知情人士向南方周末记者形容，率先办起托儿所的两个街道，一个是“挤”出来的，另一个是“借”出来的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;号称北京第一家街道办的托儿所，位于小井汽车队，这是北京六里桥一处偏僻的停车场。六里桥街道办就在这个停车场的角落里，托儿所也是从街道办的场地中挤出来的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一间大约80平米的房子，紧凑地分布着厕所、配餐室、娃娃屋、阅读角及一个迷你滑梯。户外活动则在停车场另一边的足球场里，这块人造草坪之前属于一家羽毛球馆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;运行了一个月，总共18个托位只招了5个孩子，老师们的解释是，新生入园都需要安排一名老师全程跟着，算上园长共4个老师，“实际上，我们入园已经排到下个月了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，它的位置并不理想，背靠着一条高速公路，附近一公里内，只有一个小区，而且停车场门前就是一条汽车主干道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者以家长身份参与了一次六里桥街道托儿所的招生会，前来参观的家长，许多都不是附近居民，这里的优势是价格便宜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“外面托儿所一个月都得七八千，这里只要3600元”，一对来自湖南的“北漂”父母告诉南方周末记者，家里老人没办法帮忙带孩子，只能在公司附近找了一个托儿所，算上餐费，每月4200元。这几乎是北京最便宜的托儿所了，“除了一个公共的体能教室，孩子平时待的教室就30平米”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可他们最终也没能下决心送过来，“如果来这里，早上需要提前送过来，算上50元/小时的延时费，两边价格也差不多了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一位托育机构的负责人告诉南方周末记者，托育园对距离更敏感，“幼儿园还能辐射周边三公里范围内，托儿所必须在家门口。北京冬天那么冷，有多少人会愿意抱着那么小的宝宝出门走十几分钟？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;位于北京西城区新风街一号院的德胜儿童中心，是北京第二家街道办的托儿所，这里是寸土寸金的核心区域——德胜街道。一座带有独立院子的二层小楼，一楼已经改造成了托儿所，二层仍保留为早教中心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;负责运营这所托儿所的是华育天成（北京）托育服务有限公司的创始人韩小良，他们原本在德胜街道开办了一所托育园，是西城区的示范园。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年7月，德胜街道通过招标引入了韩小良的机构来运营德胜儿童中心。韩小良对南方周末记者说，“只要不亏损就愿意参与，算是为街道作一些贡献”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京市对普惠性托育机构的指导价是不超过本区居民上年可支配收入的20%，“算下来是不高于3900元”，这所托儿所的价格是每月3600元。韩小良说，北京对两岁以上的托班师生比要求1:7，常态下有15到18个孩子，配了5名老师，“刚刚维持收支平衡，还略微亏一点”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;九月的最后一周，德胜街道举办过一轮招生说明会，“现场就报了18个全日托，还报了12个半日托”，韩小良说算上后来报名的，目前50多个托位基本满了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个托儿所的场地不是德胜街道的，而是从其他小区借来的。一位北京市卫健系统的知情人士告诉南方周末记者，“这里过去是小区的锅炉房改造过来的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩小良之前在西城区开办的那座营利性托儿所，场地也等了三四年，“刚好疫情期间有个培训学校不做了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位连锁幼儿园品牌的负责人告诉南方周末记者，北京不少区已经不再新批幼儿园了，西城区教委是为数不多积极欢迎大家去开园的，“可你手里哪怕拿着钱，也找不到合适的地方”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述北京市卫健系统的知情人士介绍，哪怕六里桥这样的场地也是好不容易找到的，“因为我们要求场地必须免租金”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩小良之前也和一些街道沟通过，大家普遍面临场地紧张的问题，“一些街道说自己办公用房都还不能满足，上哪找房子？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;北京市第一家街道办的托儿所。南方周末记者罗欢欢摄&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/2cfbdac886.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/2cfbdac886.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258236&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;北京市第一家街道办的托儿所。南方周末记者罗欢欢摄&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;102个街道中，96个尚无规划&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;按照北京市的计划，2025年每个街道都要办一所普惠性托儿所。对此，南方周末记者联系了北京市西城、东城、海淀、朝阳、丰台五个城区共计121个街道，除了19个街道多次致电依然无人接听之外，接通电话的102个街道中有3个在规划中、3个正在建设，还有96个街道目前仍没有计划。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海淀区青龙桥街道、东城区龙潭街道和东四街道，是继六里桥、德胜之后即将开办托儿所的三个街道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，海淀区青龙桥街道的场地已建成，正在备案。龙潭街道正抓紧建设，预计12月初能完成，东四街道已经找到了地方，“正在等上面批准”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外，朝阳区的朝阳门街道表示，“街道现在没位置做，在等上面下一步计划”，潘家园街道也表示，“场地紧张”，左家庄街道则正在规划中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“场地再紧张，街道想想办法也能解决”，上述北京市卫健系统的知情人士表示，他们都知道这事不容易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一个令人担心的问题是，托儿所建起来后，能招来多少孩子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位街道办工作人员向南方周末记者表示，“民办托幼机构只有7-9个孩子，目前看来市场需求不是很强烈”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据北京市发展改革委社会处的调查数据，截至2022年，北京市托位使用率平均为35.4%，最高为64.9%，最低只有13%。大部分托育机构都是空置状态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩小良说，他运营的另一家营利性托儿所，每月八千多托费，满园率只有50%，哪怕目前德胜街道这间普惠性的托儿所也是刚刚满员，没出现想象中的“一位难求”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“三岁以后送到幼儿园还那么多的担心，何况更小一点的宝宝”，韩小良认为比起建托儿所，现在更大的问题是如何改变家长们的认知，“我们总把两三岁的孩子当成无能无知的婴儿，没认识到孩子们也需要一个发展技能的空间”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管北京已经出台了普惠托位试点方案，宣布将参照普惠幼儿园的政策对托育机构进行补贴，可具体细则还在等待中。上述北京市卫健委知情人士表示，市里下发文件后，具体细则还是由区政府来确定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;已经开园一个多月，韩小良目前还没有拿到过补贴，“说是会补，但是怎么补？补多少？我们现在也只能等”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;上海已经“交卷”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;比北京早走几步的上海，已经出现了一位难求的现象。 2023年11月，上海市教育部门公布的数据显示，上海幼儿园普惠性托位的利用率已经高达90%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，上海、北京总和生育率分别只有0.74和0.87。总和生育率指一名妇女一生中所生孩子的总和，一名妇女平均生育2.1个孩子，才能保证下一代人口总数不减少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;普惠性托育建设，北京刚刚“开考”，上海已经“交卷”。 2017年，上海就开始建设普惠托育点，当时设定的目标是每年新增50个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年，上海领先于全国发布了《上海市托育服务行动计划（2020-2022年）》，目标是到2022年，中心城区每个街镇至少开设1个普惠性托育点，全市街镇普惠性托育点覆盖率不低于85%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一行动计划的落实情况被纳入区政府履行教育职责督导评估，关键指标纳入年度自评公报，成为考核区政府履职的重要标准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今上海已经超额完成了任务，中心城区至少每个街道都开设了1个普惠性托育点，全市覆盖率达到95%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“托育学院”创始人陈维凯也是上海市婴幼儿照护服务专委会副秘书长，这是上海市人口早期发展协会下设的一个专业委员会，协助政府促进婴幼儿照护服务是其职能之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈维凯向南方周末记者回忆，一开始上海做了很多种试点，“从最早的独立托育机构，到早托一体化，乃至&#39;宝宝屋&#39;这类社区托育都在做。百花齐放之下，从最终实践来看，还是幼儿园办托班来解决家长送托难题是最划算的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国范围内，上海是唯一一个由教委主管托育的地方，其他地方都由卫健委来主管托育。为此，上海市教委专门成立了“托幼工作处”，鼓励幼儿园向下延伸开设托班，要求“能开尽开、应开尽开”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈维凯说上海的学前教育公办化也是全国推进最好的，“在解决学前教育普惠化的进程中，顺便就把托育给解决了”。上海市教委的数据显示，全市近1000家幼儿园开设了托班，占全部幼儿园的60%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海要求，新建、改扩建的幼儿园均规划托班，现有公办幼儿园盘整资源、努力增设托班，民办幼儿园积极开设普惠性托班。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公办幼儿园设置的托位享有与幼儿园学位同等的生均补助——每生每年3.1万元，普惠性民办幼儿园办托班，每生每年补贴1200元。上海市教委还为每个普惠性托育点提供一次性开办经费10万元，支持园所购买玩教具和设施设备等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这使得上海几乎成为全国托育收费最低的城市，示范园的托班每月收费700-800元，一级园托班270元，二级园托班220元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈维凯介绍，一些核心地区的幼儿园托班，同等学位条件下，不得不按照年龄大小排队，优先录取年龄更大的孩子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;幼儿园办托是主渠道&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;北上广深四个一线城市中，北京的行动方案出台最晚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深圳、广州分别在2020年和2021年出台了行动计划，《北京市托育服务体系建设三年行动方案（2023年—2025年）》出台则是2023年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;北京的目标是到2025年，每千人口拥有3岁以下婴幼儿托位数4.5个，其中普惠托位占比不少于60%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据上述行动方案，未来北京将增加不少于6.2万个普惠性托位，其中3万个由幼儿园办托，另有3.2万个来自街道、企业办托等其他形式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述北京市卫健委的知情人士告诉南方周末记者，这个计划是动态调整的，“当年做计划的时候，还不是特别明确学前资源能出来多少延伸给托班，只是估算了一下。整个北京是动态调整的，不会限定死哪部分解决3.2万个，哪部分解决3万个”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相对于街道、企业等多种办托形式，幼儿园办托班的优势明显。 “这当然比重新打造一个机构要节省人力、物力、资源，场地是现成的，批下来就快，也规范。 而且幼儿园这么多年，家长也更信任。”这位知情人士表示，“幼儿园办托班肯定是主渠道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;幼托一体化被视为普惠托育的一条捷径，它的阻力主要来自幼儿园本身。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位业内人士向南方周末记者表示，幼儿园老师普遍对开设托班缺少积极性，相较于3岁以上儿童，3岁以下儿童的工作要求更高，难度也更大。特别是公办幼儿园老师，相当于工资不变、工作量增加。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈维凯分析，由于上海是教委牵头推广托育，相较其他由卫健委牵头的城市有更强的执行力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不少地方而言，幼儿园办托班，需要优先解决“大班额”问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年4月，在回应关于推动有条件的幼儿园开办普惠性托育班招收2-3岁幼儿的建议时，教育部副部长郑富芝表示，目前全国还没有完全普及学前教育，3-6岁儿童入园难问题虽得到缓解，但还没有根本解决。现阶段各地幼儿园“大班额”比例较高，全国还有几百万孩子超班额在幼儿园就读。 “在这种情况下，已经实现学前教育全面普及的地区，要创造条件增设托育班，还没有全面普及尤其是普及比例较低的地区，要把3-6岁和0-3岁入园入托问题的关系处理好，逐步推进。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;专业机构的机会？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一位上海托育行业创业者告诉南方周末记者，最近参加一些行业展会，明显感受到民间资本正从托育行业中退出来，“仅仅还有一些玩具和教具厂商在参加，几乎看不到托育企业”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“7000元和700元怎么竞争？”这位创业者近几年劝退了不少想入局的朋友，“现在资本已经不看这块了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;优儿学堂是一家全国性托育连锁品牌，创始人苏德中告诉南方周末记者，“未来普惠要占大多数，2020年开始优儿学堂更多是跟政府和当地国有企业合作”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在他看来，幼儿园办托班解决的并不是托育问题，“它实际上是解决幼儿园的问题，现在幼儿园面临从&#39;一位难求&#39;到&#39;一孩难求&#39;的问题”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家“十四五”规划要求，到2025年,每千人口拥有3岁以下婴幼儿托位数4.5个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;苏德中算了一笔账，哪怕每年全国出生人口只有1000万，3岁以下也有3000万人，到2025年实现千人口4.5个托位也就是约600万个托位，真正入托率也不过20%。如今发达国家的入托率已经到了50%-60%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他反而认为普惠性托育的发展，是专业机构的机会，“幼儿园的体系已经非常成熟了，但是托育体系还处于空白期，许多幼儿园老师是不知道怎么去面对3岁以下的孩子的。幼儿园节省的是前期投入，但人才培训、管理精细化等，和企业托育、医育结合这些途径相比，所面临的挑战是没有分别的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在的问题是，“托育的服务能不能跟得上？价格能不能降下来？” 现阶段很多托育园都没有达到满园率，有人认为托育是伪需求，对此苏德中举了一个例子，“比如开餐厅或养老院，当你的质量不够好或服务没有达标时，人们不可能积极地去餐厅吃饭，养老院也不会满员。但这不是伪需求，而是服务品质不够好。”他指出，现在很多声音在讨论托育园怎么开出来，“但是最根本的是托育园怎么做好，服务品质怎么提升。只有服务品质好，这个东西才会产生价值，刚需才能被满足。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月底，北京即将有6000个来自幼儿园的托位开始招生。对于北京第一家由街道兴办的托儿所而言，即将到来的冬天将给它带来一次艰巨的考验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[与南方周末读者交换一本书，你要来玩吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260552]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;云中谁寄锦书来？先卖个关子。&lt;/p>;
