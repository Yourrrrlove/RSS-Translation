On the other hand, the charging model has been changed from the unilateral payment of the agency fee by the buyer to a joint payment by the buyer and seller, with each buyer and seller bearing 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, on April 27 this year, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the State Administration for Market Regulation jointly issued a document to regulate real estate brokerage services. The document clearly states that real estate brokerage institutions should reasonably reduce the brokerage service fees for housing sales and leasing, and guide both parties to the transaction to share the brokerage service fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Beijing Lianjia stated that this adjustment to the intermediary fee standards is Lianjia’s response to market changes, responding to ministry documents, proactively adapting to changes, and achieving stable development of the enterprise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Housing Policy Research Center of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Urban Planning, said that under the guidance of the policy and combined with the current weak market trading sentiment, Beijing Lianjia has adjusted charging methods and standards, actively offered benefits to the market, and reduced Transaction costs boost market sentiment and confidence, which is a reflection of active response to national policy calls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia believes that Beijing Lianjia’s move will help reduce consumers’ home purchase costs, help expand the market size, better promote a virtuous cycle between new homes and second-hand homes, and promote the healthy and stable development of the real estate market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An intermediary from Beijing Lianjia told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that on the basis of lowering the agency fee standards and adjusting the charging model, his store currently has additional intermediaries for chain single customers and regular customers. There is a fee discount, that is, serial customers who sell and buy houses on Lianjia can get a 10% discount, and customers who have bought or rented a house on Lianjia in the past year can get a 9.5% discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang is a serial customer of Lianjia who sells old and buys new ones. She has just paid the down payment and agency fee for her new house. After learning that Lianjia had reduced agency fees, she contacted the house purchase agency on the morning of September 26, hoping to apply for a reduction in the agency fees she had paid. In response, Lianjia Intermediary responded that if the intermediary fee is lowered, it can apply, but it has not yet received a clearer answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang’s own house is still for sale and has not yet been sold. After Beijing Lianjia implements bilateral commission collection, she will also bear an agency fee of 1% of the total price. In this regard, she told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that if the seller needs to pay an intermediary fee when selling the house, she will add the intermediary fee to the total house payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Jiang is not the only landlord who has similar ideas. Li Yujia said that theoretically, owners would have an incentive to pass on agency fees to housing prices, and this has also happened in the past. But whether it can be passed on, or how much it can be passed on, depends on the pricing of housing prices in the micro market. Second-hand housing is a highly decentralized and fully competitive market-oriented transaction. The market information is very transparent, and it is difficult to consider using information gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia believes that the current market competition situation is completely different from the past. The number of second-hand house listings in various places has reached a record high. Selling old and buying new, selling small and buying big, and asset transfer are very common. In more cases, owners Reasonable pricing, or even lowering the listing price, in order to sell the house as quickly as possible will make it difficult for the seller to transfer the agency fees to the buyer. If the seller passes the costs onto the house price, it is likely to affect the transaction efficiency of the house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianjia emphasized that Beijing Lianjia’s adjustment of intermediary rates is an independent adjustment by the company. As for whether other companies will follow suit, it is also the company’s independent market behavior. However, Lianjia is the leading intermediary institution in Beijing, and its adjustments will have a catalytic effect on other institutions and even the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia said that in fact, in most second-hand housing transactions in the world, the intermediary fees are shared by both parties, or the seller pays all costs. With the changes in supply and demand in the real estate market, some property owners in many places across the country have begun to be willing to share agency fees to facilitate transactions. In cities such as Chengdu and Dalian, bilateral charging has been implemented for more than ten years. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chongqing and other cities have also implemented bilateral tolling in recent years. It can be seen that this model has become more and more accepted by everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 17:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[徐悲鸿 欲倾东海洗乾坤丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257692]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访15岁亚运冠军陈烨：“不要放弃，多去尝试”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257675]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/26/n6BzmUN9Dh6lZmOCtTVLbE7rL6I5BEPM9zP1aG3o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;648&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/n6BzmUN9Dh6lZmOCtTVLbE7rL6I5 BEPM9zP1aG3o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252196&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, champion Chinese player Chen Ye (middle) and runner-up Japan Contestant Yuro Nagahara (left) and third runner-up Japanese player Kensuke Sasaoka spin and jump at the award ceremony &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; , take the board, fly... On the afternoon of September 25, 2023, at the Qiantang Roller Skating Center, after performing a series of wonderful skateboarding moves, the 15-year-old Guangdong teenager Chen Ye won the championship in the Hangzhou Asian Games Men&#39;s Skateboard Bowl Final. This is the first gold medal won by the Chinese team in the skateboarding world competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye is a high-profile rising star in skateboarding. He was born in 2008 and has been making a mark in national competitions since he was 12 years old. In the 2020 National Skateboarding Championships and the men&#39;s bowl pool event of the 2021 National Games, Chen Ye won second place; in the selection of the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games Skateboarding National Training Team, Chen Ye was selected with first place . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the preliminaries on September 24, Chen Ye&#39;s competition state was to seek breakthroughs in stability, and advanced to the finals with fourth place in the preliminaries. After the game, Chen Ye said that he would give it all in the finals and perform the most difficult moves, &quot;try to get into the top four, or even the top three.&quot; Facing a field filled with experts, Chen Ye competed with a learning mentality. Didn&#39;t put too much pressure on myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/JUNbfTebCRVb3G62S8AhCzeh1tcePOy7GmsOmyev.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252192&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, Chen Ye in the finals&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the finals, Chen Ye continued to perform at a high level, breaking through the preliminaries in the first round, scoring 82.82 points, ranking first; in the second round, he set a new high score again, scoring 84.41 points, maintaining his advantage; In the last round, Chen Ye scored 80.62 points. Although it was not as good as the 84.00 points of Japanese player Yuro Nagahara in this round, he won the gold medal with the highest score of 84.41 points in the three rounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the media interviews and press conferences after the game, Chen Ye repeatedly thanked one person, his father Chen Wanqin. On the road to the championship, his father always supported him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/rMtC7bLDYbb9LaCpTUv2iNfzZVqJ5DW4qOVv7X3W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye (right) and his father Chen Wanqin&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Father and son&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Learning that he won the championship After the news, Chen Ye excitedly put on the national flag, slid around the bowl with a bright smile, and waved to the audience. &quot;I didn&#39;t really think about anything at the time. I was just very happy and very excited.&quot; At the post-match press conference, Chen Ye sat upright in front of the stage and answered reporters&#39; questions unhurriedly with a slightly hoarse voice during the voice change period, acting like a Shy boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye emphatically thanked his father, &quot;He built two venues for me, thank him.&quot; Chen Ye only entered the national training team two months ago. Before that, he was his father. Chen Wanqin was guiding him. Skateboarding was only introduced to China at the end of the 20th century, and it was also relatively late to be listed as an Olympic sport. In 2016, the International Olympic Organizing Committee announced that skateboarding would be officially included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Therefore, when Chen Ye first came into contact with skateboarding, there were almost no professional players and professional coaches in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ye fell in love with skateboarding by chance. On New Year&#39;s Day in 2016, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye to the sports mall. Chen Ye tried out the skateboard and liked it very much. Chen Wanqin said, &quot;I will take you to play when you want to play.&quot; A month later, Chen Ye He went to play every day, and Chen Wanqin bought him a skateboard. When Chen Ye persisted in playing for half a year, Chen Wanqin made up his mind to make skateboarding Chen Ye&#39;s longer-term hobby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with street skateboarding, Chen Ye prefers skating in bowls and pools. “It can fly higher and go faster.” When he first started practicing, Chen Wanqin took Chen Ye on the Internet Find videos of skaters on the internet and practice whatever moves you’re interested in. Chen Wanqin&#39;s experience in learning dance allowed him to break down complex movements one by one and arrange Chen Ye&#39;s training in an orderly manner. They practiced at a public skatepark in Zhongshan City. At that time, there were very few people skateboarding. Most of the time, only the father and son were practicing. In order to communicate with more skateboarders, they would go to Hong Kong and Tokyo during holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2016, the International Olympic Committee voted to include skateboarding as an official event in the Tokyo Olympics. The mentality of father and son has quietly changed, from &quot;becoming a skateboard master&quot; to a more professional direction. It was also at this time that national skateboarding competitions began in China, and skateboarding was also included in the 2017 National Games. The first competition Chen Ye participated in was the 2018 &quot;U Series China Youth Skateboarding Tour&quot; and he won third place. They found that &quot;it turns out that if you practice like this, your skills are pretty good.&quot; Does that mean that as long as you work harder, you can achieve better results? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no professional bowl pool in Zhongshan City. The nearest bowl pool is in Guangzhou, which takes two hours from Zhongshan. In 2019, in order for Chen Ye to have a professional training venue near his home, Chen Wanqin made a bold decision to build his own bowl pool. Later in his self-report, Chen Wanqin said that he was afraid of failure before building the project. &quot;I was afraid that I would invest all the money and not be able to make it.&quot; He simulated it with 3D printing and then felt confident. &quot;At that time, I thought, just be I work for my dreams. If I fail, I will fail. Anyway, I don’t have much money saved.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Wanqin rented a warehouse of more than 200 square meters and about 4 meters high, and learned to saw wood. Start by building the structure of the bowl piece by piece. Half a year later, Wanchi was actually made. And Chen Ye lived up to his father&#39;s efforts, honing his movements and techniques to become increasingly sophisticated, and achieving a major breakthrough in Chinese skateboarding at the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Chen Wanqin built a larger and more comprehensive skatepark. While accompanying Chen Ye in training, he accumulated experience and became a professional skateboard coach to guide more skateboarders. Kids enjoy skateboarding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And Chen Ye will continue to challenge a broader arena. After winning the Asian Games, Chen Ye admitted that he had no hope of participating in the Paris Olympics because &quot;the current speed and height are still not enough&quot;, but he will try to &quot;fly higher and accelerate faster&quot; during training and go to more places. The venue is slippery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1205&quot; height= &quot;855&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/cYC3ATrbphgccA0H997dau8HWkQcpgJ1fdk6TcEo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252193&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye is studying&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Conversation with Chen Ye&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/p>; strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said at the press conference, “When training, you should try to fly higher, accelerate faster, and overcome psychological obstacles. .&quot; So do you still feel scared when you skate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, if the speed (skating) is fast or very high, it is actually quite scary. When accelerating air (flying into the air), the faster the flying speed, the easier it is to shake and it is difficult to control. Should you jump in or out? It is also possible to jump very far and fall on the flat ground, which is a bit scary. It is necessary to accurately control the take-off position and landing position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then how do you overcome your fear? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If you are afraid, start with the short one first and increase the height little by little. There is no need to exaggerate all at once. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you flew up, it was because you had no control Good wrestling? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, especially when I am in a hurry, I think I will fly higher immediately. If I cannot control it well at this time, it is possible It dropped so low that it hit my knees and feet. Wrestling is very common. When you first start practicing each action, you must &quot;practice&quot; wrestling first. This will be safer, otherwise you may be seriously injured if you fall. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You initially followed the video training on the Internet , but complex movements still require on-site observation and learning. What movements did you go to Tokyo to learn? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At first, my father and I watched some simple teaching videos, broke down slow motion, and tried to practice. I went to Tokyo to learn air, because at that time there were no professional bowl pools in China, and U-shaped pools were hard to come by. There was a 4-meter U-shaped pool in Tokyo, and there were many skateboarders, and you could watch their demonstrations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 980&quot; height=&quot;1709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/26/GHb00IUOhv75Pq0ynXy0pNvlyZJ9mQdU2j8gGtwx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252194&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Ye in daily training&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How long did it take you to practice to learn air? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the beginning, you grab the board to jump, and then you click on the board to jump. The most standard thing is to grab the board when you hit the pole. About half a year. There will definitely be boredom. It was okay when I was in Tokyo, there were more skaters practicing together, but there aren’t that many skaters back home. When the moves get boring, just change to another move. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You started skateboarding in 2016. When did you decide? Become a professional skateboarder? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It should be before the National Games. In 2019, in order to prepare for the National Games, my father built a bowl pond for me. The two of us decided to build it together. Because I participated in several competitions at that time and watched the performance of foreign players, I felt that if you want better results, you still need to have a professional venue. After building a professional venue, I felt that I should practice skateboarding seriously and professionally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your father said before that he took it out All your savings were used to build the bowl pool. Did you make a lot of determination at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Ye: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No. Anyway, my father still wanted to support me and saw that I had achieved some results, but he did not say that he had particularly high hopes. He mainly wanted me to continue to stick to this hobby and interest. He wouldn&#39;t put too much pressure on me, just let me perform well during the competition, and he didn&#39;t say I must win any awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I asked about the training team training and father&#39;s training in the afternoon When talking about the difference, you said the styles are different.

I practiced all the basic movements first, and then I could try more new ones. The training is to prepare for the Asian Games and show off my moves. My father knows me better than my coach.

One day late, one year delayed! Some pregnant women have just completed 37 weeks of pregnancy (the standard pregnancy period is 40 weeks, 38-42 weeks is considered normal) and the baby is removed through a laparotomy. Manual intervention can advance the baby&#39;s birthday to before September 1, so that the baby can go to school at the age of 6. Parents hope that their children will be one step ahead of other children at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the fact is: there is no evidence that premature infants can win at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;. Premature infants have not been seen to have an advantage in any human group, at any historical stage, or in any field. Not only that, but premature babies have a greater chance of being born with physical and mental deficiencies. Not only do they lose at the &quot;starting line of life&quot;, but they are also likely to fall behind step by step in life, lose for the rest of their lives, and even suffer from lifelong illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot; pointed out: Newborns between 39 and 41 weeks are considered full-term babies. In the absence of external factors, full-term babies have the greatest probability of being healthier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doctors generally advocate that caesarean section is not recommended unless it is difficult to deliver, and caesarean section is even more undesirable if the baby is less than three months old. Because any caesarean section carries risks for both the mother and the baby. There is a high probability that the child&#39;s lungs will not develop maturely, and premature babies are prone to accidents and stunted growth. For parturient women, performing a caesarean section before uterine contractions may result in incomplete uterine reduction and increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cesarean section when the baby is less than a month old or without signs of labor will also have varying degrees of psychological impact on the newborn. Child psychology research has found that children born by caesarean section have a significantly higher incidence of ADHD (ADHD) than children born naturally. They will develop symptoms of attention deficit, impulsivity, and hyperactivity later in life, which will affect learning and understanding for a long time (even lifelong). ability, while the situation of premature infants is even worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Child psychologist Jean Piaget proposed the theory of &quot;stages of child development&quot;: at different ages, children&#39;s intellectual development grows gradually, and the order of each stage cannot be exceeded. Disruption, otherwise it will disrupt the normal development process of children&#39;s minds and even affect their adult personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The old saying &quot;Children look the same every year&quot; is a simple summary of this objective natural law. Children aged 5, 6 and 7 are at different stages of psychological and intellectual development. Forcibly turning a child into a &quot;twisted melon&quot;, or even cutting it out of the mother&#39;s belly in advance, is &quot;stealing the seedlings&quot;, forcing the child to skip the normal development stage of life, forcing it to make a &quot;big leap forward in life&quot;, which not only affects the child&#39;s physical development It is unfavorable and will cause children under school age to be unable to keep up with their studies, resulting in low self-esteem and a dislike of learning. The outcome will most likely be counterproductive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous psychologist Gsell proved the &quot;maturity advantage theory&quot; through experimental data: through testing more than one hundred pairs of twins for many years, he found that regardless of race, gender, and regional differences, children with more mature development After training in a shorter period of time, you can get better learning results. It proves that a person&#39;s individual physical and mental maturity develops in an orderly and regular manner. Only when the individual matures, the learning effect will be better. Wait patiently, and when the time comes, the result will often be twice the result with half the effort in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a private group discussing &quot;school-starting babies&quot;, some netizens said: I went to kindergarten or school when I was a little young, and I was not welcomed by the teacher because I couldn&#39;t keep up with the progress, and I felt quite hurt inside; Some netizens said: I have regretted for half my life that I had a caesarean section in order to catch up with school in September. Little did I know that my child has resumed high school. After all the effort, I have given back all the stolen years. I, my husband, and my child are exhausted and scarred both physically and mentally. Tired...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some educationists have proposed that not only should children be born by caesarean section so that they can go to school early, but even full-term children born normally should not learn too early, but should ensure that children have enough education in childhood and adolescence. Play time. Play is not &quot;abstaining from one&#39;s duties&quot;, but an important way and stage for the normal and complete development of various brain areas in human childhood, the formation of imagination and creativity, the cultivation of curiosity and exploration spirit, and the shaping of personality and character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forcing children to read, read, and recite ancient poems too early will not only enhance the memory areas of the brain, but also suppress the excitement and development of imagination, creativity, exploration, adventurous spirit and other areas. As a result, I had a caesarean section and worked hard for my children in early childhood education. The result of the struggle in the first half of my life was to be a clerk, being assessed on KPIs with trepidation, and calculating how much more would be deducted from my already limited salary each month. And those &quot;bad boys&quot; who have more comprehensive minds, stronger personalities, and are more daring to think, venture and do become bosses and leaders... Assess your children&#39;s KPIs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In foreign countries, the standards for children&#39;s admission are relatively flexible. Many countries specifically select children for admission based on their actual development. In France, New Zealand, Australia and other countries, if a child prodigy who develops early and quickly is found, the school entry age can even be advanced to 5 years old. The regulations in the United States are 5-7 years old, and prodigies can enter school at the age of 5. It is usually very difficult for children to enter school again at 7 years old. Normal; South Korea stipulates that children can enter school at the age of 6, but the average child is still 7 years old. If the child grows and develops later, the school age can be pushed back further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, as early as 2017, the Ministry of Education had relaxed its policies at the policy level: it no longer imposed a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mandatory age limit for enrollment before September 1. In Hubei, Henan, Anhui and other places, the enrollment age has also begun to be &quot;relaxed&quot;, and &quot;flexible enrollment&quot; has gradually been realized, and the reforms have gradually become more and more reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As policies become more reasonable, people’s psychology must also keep up. They must treat themselves and their children’s lives more rationally, scientifically, objectively, and tolerantly, and view the world and life from a more modern and broader perspective. , don&#39;t make yourself and the child in your belly live too miserable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[讲真，一条动辄上千的瑜伽裤，为何在中国卖爆？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257657]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/65d372307b9d31c86cb8c661caab1c7f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/25/65d372307b9d31c86cb8c661caab1c7f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252095&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, lululemon announced its latest financial report. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The financial report shows that in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, its sales increased by 18% year-on-year to US$2.21 billion (approximately 16.2 billion yuan, the same below). Among them, the most eye-catching is the Chinese market - lululemon&#39;s revenue in the Chinese market in the second quarter was US$277 million (approximately 2 billion), a year-on-year increase of 61%. So far, China&#39;s market revenue in the first half of this year has reached US$527 million (approximately 3.87 billion), a year-on-year increase of 69%, making it the fastest growing region in the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon focuses on the mid-to-high-end market. A pair of yoga pants costs thousands of dollars and is rarely discounted. It is known as the &quot;Hermès&quot; of the yoga industry, although there are also many voices complaining on social media. lululemon charges IQ tax, and lululemon&#39;s performance in China is still booming - why is lululemon so popular? What are the hidden worries behind high growth? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Sales are booming&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon is a very young brand, launched in Canada in 1998 Vancouver is established. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Founder Chip Wilson saw many people practicing yoga in yoga classes who did not have appropriate yoga clothing. Many people came to class wearing cotton clothes or dance clothes. Clothes made of this kind of material are not suitable for hot and sweaty sports scenes. Chip Wilson seized this market demand and continuously improved the functionality of yoga clothing on the market, quickly gaining reputation and influence in the local area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2000, lululemon opened its first store in Vancouver. In 2005, lululemon received capital investment and expanded rapidly. In 2007, lululemon was listed on the NASDAQ in New York and the Toronto Stock Exchange at the same time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon’s sales have grown rapidly over the years. From 2004 to 2018, revenue increased from US$41 million to US$3.3 billion. In 2020, the number was US$4.4 billion, and in fiscal year 2022, US$6.257 billion was sold. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Seventeen years ago, net profit was only more than 1 million US dollars, and it has approached 1 billion US dollars in fiscal year 2022. In July 2022, lululemon&#39;s market value reached US$37.4 billion, surpassing Adidas and becoming the world&#39;s second largest sports brand after Nike. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;With the development and growth of lululemon, the Chinese market has become an existence that cannot be underestimated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon officially entered the Chinese market in 2013, and the growth rate in the Chinese market is the most eye-catching. Lululemon&#39;s second quarter financial report this year shows that in the last quarter, the revenue in the Chinese market showed astonishing rapid growth: sales increased by 79% year-on-year, and the three-year compound growth rate of the mainland Chinese market exceeded 50%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of the end of the second quarter, lululemon has 672 directly operated stores around the world, 126 of which are located in the Chinese market. According to lululemon&#39;s global development plan, by 2026, the brand&#39;s revenue will double from 2021 to US$12.5 billion, the number of stores in mainland China will reach 220, and the Chinese market will become the brand&#39;s second largest market in the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/dc3185eb107611c6a0b78fe41a77ba8b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/dc3185eb107611c6a0b78fe41a77ba8b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252096 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Why are they so expensive yet so popular&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why can a pair of yoga pants priced at thousands of dollars sell so fast? Why has the market value become the second largest among global sports brands in such a short period of time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, find the track. The success of lululemon is related to its keen grasp of yoga, a relatively niche market demand at the time, forming differentiated competition, avoiding head-on competition with giants such as Nike and Adidas, and successfully overtaking in corners. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Second, do it to the extreme. &lt;span>; Even though there have been a lot of complaints about lululemon yoga pants, we have to admit that it is far ahead in the yoga pants market. It is indeed because after long-term and continuous investment in research and development, lululemon&#39;s yoga pants have a higher &quot; technical content”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, its scientific fabric ratio of 86% nylon and 14% Lycra, Slivere scent anti-odor technology, and seamless crotch cutting make it better than other yoga pants. It has greater comfort, better perspiration performance, and better fit. It is also slimmer and better able to reflect women&#39;s body curves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This also makes lululemon’s wearing scenarios not limited to yoga venues. Many women also wear lululemon in their daily lives, expanding the use scenarios of yoga pants, and invisibly also Increased lululemon&#39;s sales. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Third, target middle-class women. From the beginning, lululemon’s pricing has been relatively high. Its user portrait is “a woman between 24 and 36 years old, with an annual income of more than $80,000, a high level of education, owns her own house, and has one and a half hours of work every day.” Take time to exercise and have a positive attitude towards life.&quot; Lululemon calls them &quot;super girls&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, it coincided with the rise of middle-class women in North America. They needed more ways to prove themselves. lululemon’s positioning perfectly matched the needs of this group of women, and lululemon became the “super girl” &quot; logo. Later, lululemon&#39;s expansion in the international market copied this path. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fourth, community operation. Lululemon hardly advertises and does not hire big-name celebrities as spokespersons. On the contrary, in various offline lululemon stores, ordinary yoga enthusiasts, athletes, and entrepreneurs become store ambassadors, and they serve as opinions in the local yoga community. Leaders, their trust and choice in lululemon also affects other community members. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, lululemon will hold a variety of community activities from time to time in its offline stores to enhance the connection between people, enhance consumers&#39; recognition of the brand, and They become the &quot;tap water&quot; of the brand. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fifth, which is also the ultimate goal of the above four items, is to ensure lululemon’s brand style, increase brand premium, and make lululemon a symbol of identity, taste and lifestyle, allowing consumers to People are willing to spend a higher price to buy a pair of yoga pants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, a pair of lululemon yoga pants can easily cost thousands of dollars. While the outside world is complaining and confused, they also think that those who are willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy a pair of yoga pants should be People who have more financial resources, are more pursuing the quality of life, and are more particular about yoga exercises, right? The brand premium of all luxury goods comes from the imagination of this identity, and the same is true for lululemon. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Hidden worries still exist&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lululemon, whose performance has been soaring and is now going smoothly, is not without hidden worries. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On platforms such as Xiaohongshu, there have been a lot of complaints about the poor quality of lululemon, such as deformation, pilling, non-sweat absorption, off-line... Netizens have pictures When the truth was revealed, I really thought this was a product purchased from Pinxixi for more than ten yuan, but the receipt posted by netizens proved that it was indeed an authentic product purchased from the store. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It costs hundreds to thousands of yuan, but the quality is so bad? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;lululemon&#39;s products come from OEMs, which also means that the requirements for quality control are very high. In the context of rapid development, problems such as cutting corners and cutting corners will arise, which will affect the quality of products. The brand image has a very big impact. In recent years, lululemon’s quality issues have been reported to officials several times. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In January 2018, lululemon’s women’s knitted sportswear was fined 51,000 yuan by the Shanghai Huangpu District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau for “substandard products passing off as qualified products”; In August 2019, lululemon was once again fined 81,900 yuan by the Shanghai Jing&#39;an District Market Supervision Bureau for &quot;passing off unqualified products as qualified products&quot;; in May 2022, lululemon violated Article 50 of the Product Quality Law (adulteration in products) Miscellaneous, adulterated, fake as genuine, substandard as good, or substandard products as qualified products), and was fined RMB 81,420 by the Beijing Xicheng District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although lululemon&#39;s yoga pants have good technical content, the core competitiveness in the apparel field is not out of reach. For example, the fabric texture of other yoga brands today is extremely close to that of lululemon. In addition to the brand premium, the wearing experience is not as obvious as the price difference. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the one hand, lululemon’s quality has problems from time to time, and on the other hand, lululemon’s pricing is too high and the price-performance ratio is not high. Therefore, lululemon’s “replacement” products have emerged in large numbers. MAIA ACTIVE, Rampage Lolita, Particle Fever, Keep, Decathlon and other brands of yoga pants have gained many fans. In this context, whether lululemon&#39;s brand premium can always be maintained, we can only maintain a wait-and-see attitude. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From major foreign luxury brands to lululemon, the ultra-high premiums of these brands have repeatedly explained: for a brand, quality is important, cost-effectiveness is important, and brand building Also crucial. If lululemon can maintain its brand position of &quot;seeing all the mountains at a glance&quot;, there will still be consumers paying for it-not just yoga pants, but also the brand logo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, lululemon must also ensure that it &quot;does not seek death.&quot; If quality problems are an exception, consumers may still be able to tolerate them. Once quality problems become the norm, technological content cannot maintain its leading edge, complaints become mainstream, and the brand will easily fall from its high position. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the pursuers have no way to achieve the brand effect of lululemon for the time being, if they can catch up and surpass them in terms of quality, technological content, cost-effectiveness, etc., it is possible to have the last laugh. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[免签、“白菜价”能否翻热泰国游？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257673]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 13:01:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At 10:15 am on September 25, 2023, Thai AirAsia flight XJ761 from Shanghai landed in Bangkok Vannapur Airport, this is the first day that Thailand implements a temporary visa-free policy for Chinese tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to welcome the first batch of Chinese tourists arriving in Thailand after the visa-free policy, Thai Prime Minister Settar Thavis personally led many ministers to pick them up at the airport. The crowded crowds, smiling officials, and staff holding flowers... all reflect Thai hospitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Suvarnabhumi Airport, the first welcome ceremonies are also held simultaneously at Don Mueang Airport, Chiang Mai Airport and Phuket Airport. Tourists will receive jasmine garlands and pants with elephant patterns. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that a similar grand airport pick-up has occurred in Thailand. In January 2023, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Anutin, Minister of Tourism and Sports Phipak, and Minister of Transport Sassaya and other officials also went to the airport in person to welcome the first batch of Chinese tourists to Thailand after the implementation of the &quot;Category B Control&quot; for new coronavirus infections. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists with open arms, but it has not completely ignited the enthusiasm of Chinese people to travel to Thailand. After a short-term boom in February and March, affected by rumors such as &quot;Ka Yaozi&quot; and the successive release of crime-themed movies based on Southeast Asia, the newly revived &quot;Thailand fever&quot; fell to the freezing point again. In the first half of 2023, China has fallen out of Thailand’s largest source of tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can Thailand’s visa exemption attract Chinese tourists to return? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Thailand is anxious&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When I saw Zhang Lixia, she had heavy dark circles under her eyes and looked haggard. She was obviously not as busy as she had been in the past few days. recover from. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Lixia is the person in charge of a travel agency store in Guangzhou. From September 15th to 17th, the 2023 Guangdong International Tourism Industry Expo opened in Guangzhou. For the next week, Zhang Lixia was extremely busy. As the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday approaches, more and more tourists visit Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because it coincides with Thailand’s visa exemption, in just the three days of the Tourism Expo, the number of people who came to us to sign up for a group trip to Thailand exceeded the entire first half of the year.” Zhang Lixia told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, the Thai Cabinet meeting decided to implement a five-month visa-free policy for Chinese tourists from September 25, 2023 to February 29, 2024, covering China during this period. National Day, Lunar New Year and other time points when Chinese people like to travel. Thai Prime Minister Sai Tha Thakta emphasized that the visa-free policy will also waive visa fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, after being elected as the Prime Minister of Thailand, Saitha continued to regard attracting Chinese tourists as an important means to stimulate economic recovery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the third day after taking over as prime minister, Saita publicly announced that he would implement a visa-free policy for Chinese and Indian citizens. According to Thai Prime Minister&#39;s Office spokesman Chai Wachalom, Saitha will visit China in October, and promoting tourism cooperation between China and Thailand will become one of the main topics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of this series of measures is that the situation of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand in the first half of 2023 is unsatisfactory. The Thai government hopes to attract more Chinese tourists to return through more effective measures. The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; article pointed out that the Thai authorities aim to quickly stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry by relaxing entry policies and inject a shot in the arm for economic recovery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the epidemic, China was once Thailand’s largest source of overseas tourists. Therefore, since China resumes outbound tourism in 2023, the Thai government has high hopes for the return of Chinese tourists and set a goal of attracting 5 million Chinese tourists at the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to official data from Thailand, as of September 10, the number of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand was only 2.28 million, ranking second on the list of inbound tourists, less than Thailand’s neighboring country Malaysia. In 2019, the number of Chinese tourists to Thailand reached 10.98 million, accounting for 27.6% of all inbound tourists in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Thailand has also fallen from the top spot of China’s outbound destinations. Judging from the transaction volume of popular outbound destinations in the first half of 2023 given by Alipay, Thailand ranks fourth. The top three are: Hong Kong, China, Macau, China and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand was lower than expected, which not only caught Thai officials off guard, but also devastated many domestic travel agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the first batch of 20 countries to &quot;restore outbound group travel&quot;, and Thailand was among the list. Affected by the epidemic, outbound tourism has been at a standstill for nearly three years. After the news was released, many tourism companies began to plan outbound travel, and Zhang Lixia was one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Thailand’s outbound tourism business in the first half of the year, Zhang Lixia summarized it with “the repeated alternation of hope and despair.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I didn’t expect the direction of the wind to change so quickly. In February, tourism to Thailand had just picked up, but in March and April, we began to have trouble getting guests.” Regarding the decrease in the number of tourists traveling to Thailand , Zhang Lixia’s memory is still fresh, “Colleagues in the operation department kept posting advertisements to attract tourists sooner or later, but they couldn’t get any response no matter how much they shouted. In the end, the price dropped and there was no way to lower it, so I had to pay for it myself and bear the loss.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&quot;Cut position&quot; is a professional term in the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Travel agencies purchase a certain number of airplane seats from airlines in advance for sale to tourists. Such seats cut in advance are non-refundable and non-cancellable. You can enjoy discounts on group tickets by cutting seats, but there are also risks. If tourist arrivals are lower than expected, travel agencies will face losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The “cabbage price”&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;can’t attract people yet&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In early August 2023, Gao Bin and a group of friends came to Bangkok and Pattaya travel. Departing from Zhengzhou to Thailand, including visa fees and customs clearance tips, the six-day and five-night trip only costs less than 3,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The reason why the tour fee is so cheap is mainly because the tour period is approaching and there are not enough people to sign up. The travel agency has adopted a low-price strategy, which is more than a thousand yuan cheaper than the normal tour fee.&quot; Gao Bin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Guangzhou, the price of the same pure play group is only a little more than 3,000. “When overseas travel was first opened at the beginning of the year, everyone thought that Thailand was becoming more popular. In addition, there were not so many flights, so the price of group tours in Thailand increased slightly. Now, although Thailand is visa-free, the overall demand has not increased significantly. When supply and demand are almost equal, we dare not raise the price.&quot; Zhang Lixia said, &quot;The price of traveling to Thailand is now even lower than three years ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the &quot;cabbage price&quot; still fails Fully impress Chinese tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The queue time for a visa on arrival in Thailand was once a &quot;weather vane&quot; for the number of tourists in Thailand. Gao Bin traveled to Thailand twice in 2018 and 2019. Compared with before, he obviously felt that there were many fewer Chinese traveling to Thailand and the customs clearance time was much faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I came to Thailand in the past, I had to wait at least one or two hours in line to apply for a visa on arrival. This year, I only waited in line for about 20 minutes. After leaving the airport, there were only a dozen or so people picking up the group. It is no longer the previous grand occasion where there were huge crowds of people holding Chinese placards waiting for tour groups.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thailand tourism has experienced a downturn, and travel agencies and hotels that directly interface with tourists have a deeper feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wan is the manager of a travel agency in a first-tier city in central China. In the first half of 2023, the store only accepted more than 30 customers who traveled to Thailand. &quot;Although the price of traveling to Thailand is low enough, outbound travel Tourism has not recovered much.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation is not unique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The province and region where Li Wan lives has just held a summer review meeting. Domestic tourism sales accounted for 80% of summer tourism revenue, while outbound tourism only accounted for 20%. &quot;Before the epidemic, the turnover was basically divided equally between domestic and overseas companies.&quot; Li Wan told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July and August are the peak periods of the rainy season in Thailand, but with the rise of study tours, summer study tours in Thailand have become a popular alternative for Chinese parents. However, this year, overseas study tours have not become popular in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after the epidemic, Wang Ying has high hopes for this summer’s study tour program. She booked a hotel in advance and made connections with teachers from Chiang Mai University. But what Wang Ying didn&#39;t expect was that the summer study tour turned out to be a rare hit, with almost no one interested in it. In the end, she had no choice but to cancel it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At our peak, we received 500 Chinese people in one summer vacation, but very few signed up this year. Many people are worried about safety issues, and the elderly at home are unwilling to let their children go to Thailand. There are also some Those who were determined to register suddenly canceled their orders due to the sudden cancellation of direct flights to their cities.&quot; Wang Ying, who has been running study tours in Thailand for many years, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Public opinion whirlpool&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;China’s tourism to Thailand has been in the cold, and safety has always been an unavoidable factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, self-media bloggers broke the rumors on the Internet that &quot;Thailand specializes in Chinese kidneys&quot; and &quot;Male model restaurants specialize in abducting Chinese women.&quot; Related videos and articles flooded the Internet. Thailand, with its &quot;beautiful scenery and high cost-effectiveness&quot;, once became synonymous with &quot;Ka Yao Zi&quot;, so much so that many people &quot;dislike Thailand&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Outrageous rumors are rampant, and the Thai authorities have to frequently refute them in an attempt to reverse the huge destructive power of negative rumors on Thailand&#39;s tourism industry. However, the official refutation of the rumors did not eliminate people&#39;s doubts about Thailand&#39;s security issues, and Thailand&#39;s tourism, which had just improved, once again encountered a downturn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year, tourism in Thailand has indeed been greatly affected by public opinion. Many people who come to sign up for group tours will ask whether Thailand is safe or not. We can only emphasize to them again and again the safety of group tours. &quot;Zheng Yun, a practitioner in the tourism industry in a certain first-tier city, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In order to dispel customers&#39; concerns, we had to forward a large number of Thai official rumor refuting articles in WeChat Moments and push them to tourists.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, , the &quot;Gayaozi&quot; controversy has not completely subsided, and new public opinion crises are coming one after another. Since June, two crime-themed movies based in Southeast Asia, &quot;The Vanishing Girl&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, have once again brought Thailand to the forefront. Thailand, which is &quot;a waste of Chinese tourists&quot;, has been shaped by public opinion into the role of a &quot;transit station&quot; for telecom fraud in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend of Gao Bin had applied for a passport, but his family did not allow him to go to Thailand because they were worried about safety issues. They even chased him from his hometown to the city to try to get him to give up the idea of ​​traveling to Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar worries are actually not isolated cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, in a Thailand tourism WeChat group, many netizens still raise doubts about whether it is safe to travel to Thailand from time to time. A tourist who bought a ticket to Thailand for the National Day said in the group, &quot;I don&#39;t dare to say I want to go to Thailand. I am afraid of being laughed at by others, and I am also worried that my family will not let me go.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;February and March When I visited, I clearly felt that the number of Chinese tourists on the streets was increasing, and there were three or four people traveling in Thailand just by checking the circle of friends.&quot; Wang Wan, who has been running a B&amp;B in Thailand for 6 years, told Southern Weekend reporters, but by the end of March, he could not see them at all. When people arrive, the whole street is empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the analysis of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, the slow growth of Chinese tourists in Thailand can be attributed to four reasons-the relative weakness of the economy and currency, the Chinese government’s promotion of domestic tourism and local transportation upgrades, the insufficient supply of Thai tourism services and the lack of living standards. Rising costs and negative publicity about safety are hurting Thailand&#39;s image. Among them, concerns about safety are the most critical factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest obstacle facing Thailand’s tourism industry is eliminating negative perceptions about the safety of traveling to Thailand. Without action to reduce crime in Thailand and eliminate negative content on Chinese social media, any verbal or written commitments will be It will be meaningless,&quot; said Tourism Association of Thailand chairman Sisatheva. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Losing money and making money&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Thai government seems confident whether the visa-free policy can ignite the enthusiasm of Chinese tourists to travel to Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, 2023, Thailand’s Minister of Transport Suriya Tsenglongliangjit told the Bangkok Post that driven by the visa-free policy, flights from China are expected to increase from 72 per day to 96, and the corresponding number of tourists will double, from 9,680 to 18,656 per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Attracting 5 million Chinese tourists to Thailand is completely achievable.&quot; Surya vowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rapidly rising search popularity of Thailand on several domestic online travel service platforms seems to also confirm the return of &quot;Thailand fever&quot;. Half an hour after the visa exemption news was announced, Thailand-related searches on Ctrip’s platform soared 800% month-on-month. &quot;Qunar&quot; big data also shows that the search volume for Thai air tickets on the platform increased by more than 70% from the same time last week, and the search volume for Thai hotels doubled from the same time last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to what extent this attention can be translated into actual travel numbers, practitioners are continuing to wait and see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the visa-free policy was introduced, Wang Wan originally wanted to consider raising the price of her property, but the volume of orders made her give up the idea of ​​raising the price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, 98% of Wang Wan&#39;s self-operated B&amp;Bs were Chinese tourists, but now only 20 to 30% of the guests are from China every month. The peak tourist season in Thailand is from October to February of the following year. Tourists usually book rooms in advance. Half of the rooms in Wang Wan&#39;s B&amp;B have been booked, but few of them are from Chinese tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The three orders I received recently were from Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. After the visa exemption, I did not receive any orders from Chinese tourists at all.” Wang Wan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The short-lived popularity of Thailand tours before the National Day did not completely dispel Zhang Lixia&#39;s worries. She did not dare to take the risk of booking a flight in advance. The &quot;Thailand fever&quot; predicted in the first half of the year did not appear, and the large amount of compensation for charter flights in advance still left Zhang Lixia with lingering fears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In March and April, the cost of a six-day, five-night trip to Thailand had dropped to a minimum of 1,999 yuan, while the flight cost was 2,000 yuan. The tour fee was no longer enough to cover the cost. This was purely a loss. I made a lot of money, but still no customers were willing to sign up for a group tour,&quot; Zhang Lixia recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After the repeated torment of hope and disappointment in the first half of the year, our mentality has become a little calmer. Now we reserve seats for two or three flights a week. If the number of passengers increases, we will purchase additional seats. I will no longer rush to occupy 50% to 80% of the seats like before.&quot; Zhang Lixia sighed and said, &quot;I dare not now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yun also pointed out that he was indeed busy for a while before the National Day. &quot;Thailand tours from September 27 to October 2 were all booked, and the price increased by almost a thousand yuan compared to before. However, the popularity soon faded away, so we had to lower the price.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yun is still &quot;hopeful&quot; about the recovery of Thailand&#39;s tourism in the next three months of 2023. But at the same time, she is not prepared to increase the number of charter flights and seats in advance. She is not sure how long the current enthusiasm of Chinese people to go to Thailand will last. &quot;If the number of subsequent group registrations increases, we will discuss with the airlines to obtain seats.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Thailand’s tourism industry has experienced a downturn, airlines’ strong position is no longer what it used to be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Air Travel Zongheng’s big data shows that in the first week of August, the number of flights to and from Thailand by domestic airlines exceeded 800, which was only about 52% of the same period in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In 2019, everyone had to pay full price in advance to grab a seat, and whoever can get the seat can receive more guests. Now the situation has been completely reversed. As long as you have guests, the seat Any time.&quot; Zhang Lixia said frankly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Zhang Lixia, Li Wan, Wang Ying, Wang Wan, and Zheng Yun are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[困在考研考编里的年轻人，他们是在逃避什么吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257615]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In recent years, the number of postgraduate admissions nationwide has increased year by year. From 760,000 in 2018, it surged to 1.25 million last year, more than 60%. During the same period, the number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination more than doubled from 2.38 million to 4.57 million. About 70% of those who fail the postgraduate entrance exam every year will face fiercer competition next year if they choose to retake the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other examination rooms, the situation is similar. The number of people recruiting civil servants and public servants across the country has increased significantly, and the number of applicants has also skyrocketed. No matter which examination room young people rush to after graduation, they will face fierce competition that is no less fierce than the college entrance examination. The accumulation of consecutive losers has become a rich source of stories for the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sanlian Life Weekly’s article “Five Years Trapped in the Postgraduate Entrance Examination and Editorial Examination” interviewed a person who took the postgraduate entrance examination, the public examination and the editor examination continuously. According to the narrator, she felt that the major she studied at university had no future in work, and her family worshiped academic qualifications, so she took the postgraduate entrance examination every year, and also took the public and editing examinations at the same time, which lasted for five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After failing the five-year exam, this girl had to enter the workplace under financial pressure. She realized that although her new job was hard, it was at least &quot;possible&quot; and that her classmates who &quot;went ashore&quot; were actually not doing much better. But by the end of the article, this girl still couldn&#39;t forget it and was still taking the exam in September this year. Just when the reader thinks there is a bright future and the spiritual internal friction is coming to an end, everything returns to the starting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many full-time exam takers today spend a lot of time and energy just to gain some uncertain advantages in the future. In terms of postgraduate entrance examinations, although a master&#39;s degree has some advantages over a bachelor&#39;s degree in the workplace, the advantages are actually limited considering the age factor. Those who work hard for the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; seem to be very good, but the career path of most positions is narrow, the income is not high, and it is difficult to change jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to postgraduate entrance examinations, public examinations and editing examinations, there is also a large group of &quot;teacher examinations&quot;. In 2022, more than 11 million people will take the teacher qualification examination. Many people take the test for everything, whether they like it or not. They continue to take exams all year round, but in order to find a decent and stable job, these jobs are basically within the system, with poor mobility and difficulty in changing jobs, but they are better than &quot;stability&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spending a lot of time and energy on a huge gamble in life is deplorable in my opinion. At the age when life is the most energetic, you hide in a study in a small building and study hard to prepare for exams. You do not create value, do not learn knowledge and skills, and you cannot even enjoy happiness. Is it really worth it to have a stable job in the future? Moreover, most people are destined to fail and become the denominator rather than the numerator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media and exam forums, this kind of day is &quot;inspirational&quot;. Many people stick together to keep each other warm, and even if others disagree, it seems difficult to criticize them: everyone has a different path, and the choice does not matter whether it is high or low, right? There are more and more people taking vocational exams, which is related to the employment environment and this atmosphere. Studying full-time for exams right after graduation has become a popular phenomenon among the new generation of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this phenomenon really blameless, even inspiring? Hard to say. The premise of the &quot;professional examination family&quot; is: they don&#39;t make money, they rely on support. College students are generally over 20 years old after graduation and cannot support themselves but rely on their parents. This kind of &quot;parasitism and support&quot; is all voluntary, and some parents even ask their children to take exams, but from a sociological perspective, they are not adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Young people get better education, get rid of the shadow of their parents, start careers, and surpass their parents&#39; achievements. This is a common phenomenon in a healthy society. Relying on parents for support and being unable to &quot;wean off the baby&quot;, the opportunity to obtain large amounts of wealth is directed to inheritance, and the life style of nibbling on the elderly and parasitism is ridiculed as &quot;full-time children&quot;. This kind of spiritual epidemic is a kind of malaise and decadence, and it is not worth beautifying at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, full-time candidates are pursuing a stable job, but in reality they are escaping from market competition. They have gone from being temporarily supported by their parents to hoping to be supported by the system. Even if they are admitted, their income comes from taxes, and taxes rely on individuals and companies to create value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the reason why the country requires streamlining administration, delegating power and reducing personnel. It’s just that due to the huge pressure on the job market, civil servants and public servants are regarded as “employment reservoirs” by some places. In recent years, local governments have been cutting jobs while expanding recruitment. This approach cannot completely solve the employment problem, but will only continue to delay it for you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young people who are &quot;trapped in the postgraduate entrance exams&quot; are not really trapped. They just hope to pass the exam and get rid of market competition and sit back and relax. I personally don’t like this kind of life choice; and when the public examination becomes a popular competition, more and more people are addicted to it. I believe it is not a good thing for individuals and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people feel that it is a helpless choice for young people to take the postgraduate and editing exams repeatedly. This is true to a certain extent, but this choice is not worthy of encouragement, and it must be pointed out that for personal destiny, this tragic and painful journey is full of huge risks. Is it worth it to spend so much effort &quot;getting involved&quot; with your peers in order to escape market competition? Wouldn’t it be much more meaningful if this kind of motivation and effort were applied to work? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, on the other hand, the other path, which seems to be full of thorns, is actually more reliable. In the past two years, many young people have taken jobs that were previously held by people with low academic qualifications. They face it with a pragmatic spirit, put aside their highly educated self-esteem, support themselves first, and then develop. Compared with those who are addicted to exams, this choice is more worthy of respect and more likely to lead to a better life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 12:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[山西大同小学生遭多名同学辱骂、殴打、欺凌，官方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257671]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 12:38:39&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 26, the joint working group of Datong City, Shanxi Province issued a notice.

Since 2014, American astronauts have used vegetable production systems on the International Space Station to cultivate lettuce, Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard, zinnias and other plants. Some of them are for scientific research, and some are used by astronauts. Eat it as a salad, I heard it tastes great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advanced plant habitat is a more complex, more automated, fully enclosed plant growth device equipped with cameras and more than 180 sensors that can monitor light, temperature, humidity, atmospheric content, etc. Sensing and controlling, and staying connected to the ground laboratory so that observations and research can be carried out simultaneously on the ground and the space station. Advanced plant habitat installations enable more complex, diverse, and long-term plant growth studies. So far, American astronauts have used this device to conduct full life cycle cultivation experiments of Arabidopsis thaliana, dwarf wheat, radish, pepper and other plants. The pepper planting test is the longest and most &quot;stimulating&quot; test among them. After more than three months of growth, the pepper seeds have gone through the entire process of germination, flowering, fruiting, and maturity. In November 2021, after the peppers matured, the astronauts stored part of them and left them for ground laboratories to conduct follow-up analysis and research, while the other parts were made into delicacies by them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1032&quot; height= &quot;688&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Astronauts pose with the peppers they grow on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rice bears seeds on the Chinese space station&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhou The first manned flight on the 5th, Yutu&#39;s visit to the moon, Zhurong&#39;s inspection of Mars, the &quot;reunion in space&quot; of the Chinese space station... The booming Chinese aerospace industry has also injected new vitality into the exploration of space farms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2019, a mysterious scientific device was transported to the far side of the moon by the Chinese lunar probe Chang&#39;e-4, where it was performing an important mission. This scientific device was developed by scientists from Chongqing University and contains four kinds of seeds, including cotton, rape, potato, and Arabidopsis, as well as two animal eggs, yeast and fruit fly. After landing on the far side of the moon, the seeds that were originally dormant began to wake up and enter growth and development mode. Within nine days, the seeds began to germinate, and the cotton seeds also sprouted buds. Although the germination of cotton seeds on the moon is just a flash in the pan, this is the first green leaf to grow on the moon. Perhaps in the near future, more plants will sprout, bloom and bear fruit on the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the newly built Chinese space station, Chinese astronauts started longer-term plant growth experiments. This time the test subjects were Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. As we all know, rice originated in China and is one of China&#39;s main food crops. No one has ever conducted a full life cycle cultivation experiment of rice in space before. During the four-month test, both Arabidopsis and rice successfully completed the entire life cycle of seed germination, seedling growth, flowering and seeding, proving that rice can grow on the space station. However, scientists have observed that many indicators of rice grown on the space station are significantly different from rice grown on the ground, such as earlier flowering period, longer grain filling time, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rice generally has the ability to regenerate. The rice stalks left behind after normal harvest can also grow rice ears, thus increasing rice yield. This experiment also observed the regeneration ability of rice on the space station. As a result, more than 20 days after the rice was harvested, a rice plant on the space station also regenerated and grew two rice ears, indicating that regenerating rice is feasible in a small closed environment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our country has achieved world-leading scientific and technological achievements in the field of aerospace breeding. It is believed that with the in-depth development of aerospace projects such as the China Space Station, the Moon Landing Project and the Planetary Exploration Project, our country’s astronauts will be in a wider field. Grow vegetables, flowers, and crops in space to bring fresh, nutritious and delicious food to future space travelers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;806&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rice seeds growing in the Chinese space station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How far is it from the real space farm&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, so far So far, these plant cultivation experiments conducted in the space station have been extremely small-scale. It is a huge challenge to actually build a space farm, and there are still many problems that need to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the moon or Mars, the harsh environment is not suitable for plant growth at all. Therefore, the first step in building a space farm is to build a large-scale intelligently controlled greenhouse facility, similar to the intelligent greenhouses built on the earth, so that Plants have &quot;houses&quot; to live in. First of all, this greenhouse facility is completely airtight, can maintain stable temperature, and can protect plants and humans from cosmic rays. Secondly, this greenhouse facility is suitable for remote control, which requires full monitoring of the growth process of plants and timely control of temperature and light. , atmosphere, moisture and nutrients are precisely controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to allow the plants to &quot;eat and drink&quot; to maintain the operation of plant life and the operation of the entire greenhouse facility. The main power for greenhouse operation comes from solar power generation. This technology is not difficult, but it is a big problem to provide the necessary soil, nutrients, water, atmosphere, etc. for plant growth. Soil mainly provides support and nutrients for the growth of plant roots. Studies have shown that plants can grow in lunar soil or volcanic ash, but they will grow more slowly than in earth soil. In addition to soil, hydroponics can also be used. This smart greenhouse is relatively common on the earth. Of course, hydroponics requires a lot of water. The moon and Mars are both dry planets with little water and require artificial synthesis. This means that water must be accurately distributed to plants according to their needs. Plants also need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are needed for plant growth. These need to be synthesized or extracted by making full use of raw materials on the planet where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;housing&quot; and &quot;food and drink&quot; problems are solved, the protagonist can be invited out. At this time, it is very important to choose what kind of plants to plant. Not all plants are suitable for space farms. First, these candidate plants must be able to adapt to the unfavorable conditions of space, such as microgravity, high radiation, large temperature differences, lack of water and fertilizer; secondly, candidate plants should be rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients to provide space for astronauts, space tourists or settlers. Supplement additional nutrients; in addition, candidate plants should have the characteristics of short growth cycle, small space occupation, and easy management. In addition to selecting existing plant varieties, in the future, scientists may tailor special plant varieties for space farms, such as potatoes that are more suitable for growing in Martian ash, tomatoes that grow better under microgravity conditions, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, each plant to be grown on the space farm needs to be carefully selected and passed simulation tests in ground laboratories to accurately calculate the nutrients, moisture, atmosphere, light, etc. required for its growth. , in order to minimize the waste of resources in space. It is worth mentioning that NASA assigned this part of the work to middle school students. NASA has launched a &quot;Growing Beyond Earth&quot; public welfare program, inviting middle school students across the United States to participate in space plant growth research and select plants suitable for planting on the International Space Station. As of December 2022, more than 40,000 middle school students and their instructors have participated in this activity, and screening tests of more than 180 types of plants have been carried out, and pak choi grown on the vegetable production system is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s manned moon landing plan is being steadily implemented, and the U.S. government also plans to return to the moon. Musk even proposed to build a self-sufficient city on Mars around 2050, and it is possible for humans to settle outside the earth. The day seems to be getting closer, when the construction of space farms is an indispensable link, which requires future scientists around the world to continue to improve space farms, maybe you can also participate in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
