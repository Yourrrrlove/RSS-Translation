This was strongly opposed by parents. Subsequently, there was a huge discussion and controversy on the Internet about the safety of prepared dishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Xinhua News Agency’s report on the evening of September 22, the head of the relevant departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Education said in an interview with reporters that in view of the fact that there is currently no unified standard system, certification system, traceability system, etc. for pre-made dishes. The supervision mechanism should be very cautious about &quot;prepared dishes entering campus&quot; and should not promote them into campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Education expressed its position on &quot;prepared dishes entering schools&quot; and responded to many parents&#39; questions. Looking back on the discussions and controversies that have occurred on this topic these days, the views and attitudes of those directly involved, especially parents, should be fully respected. Although some experts say that prepared dishes are as safe as fresh meat and vegetables, many parents do believe that compared to meals made on site, prepared dishes pose more food safety risks. The safety and nutrition of school meals is by no means a trivial matter. Ensuring children’s dietary health is more related to the future. Only based on this premise can our understanding and analysis of this issue have real value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, after this debate, the safety of prepared dishes should be given full attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be clear that it is biased to simply conclude that pre-prepared dishes are safe or unsafe, because pre-prepared dishes are different from pre-prepared dishes. They have the same name &quot;pre-prepared dishes&quot;, but each person The understanding of the denotation and connotation of this concept may vary widely. The pre-made dishes with the same name are obviously different from those produced by small workshops. They also sell pre-made and ready-to-eat beef and salad. Big supermarkets use refrigeration to keep fresh, while roadside stalls allow them to be exposed to the scorching sun. The safety and quality are also guaranteed. different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following are common pre-prepared dishes: 1. Self-heating hot pot, high in oil and salt, stored at room temperature. It is very convenient to eat, but obviously cannot be eaten often; 2. Frozen storage introduced by some manufacturers . Heat-and-eat dishes, such as &quot;Kung Pao Chicken&quot; and &quot;Ma Po Tofu&quot;, are also high in oil and salt, and their taste is obviously inferior to those freshly made in restaurants; 3. From breeding and planting bases to industrialized assembly lines, they are processed into semi-finished products, and then The whole process is uninterrupted cold chain transportation and distribution, and restaurants and canteens purchase it and then make it into finished products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of health and taste, the first two are obviously not eaten frequently, so they cannot become mainstream. The third type is the development direction of prepared dishes worthy of discussion. If they are not stored properly or the cold chain cannot be guaranteed to be uninterrupted, these three types of prepared dishes may have safety issues. Prepared vegetables have a long chain of production process, from breeding and planting to slaughtering, processing, and cold chain transportation and distribution. Every link has safety risks, so scientific management is required to control risks and strictly follow operating procedures. Production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, some parents are opposed to the introduction of prepared dishes into schools, which also reflects parents’ dissatisfaction with school cafeterias and schools for ignoring their rights to know, supervise and choose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents reported that the school did not seek their opinions and made a unilateral decision to bring pre-made dishes to campus. To say what parents are opposed to in their hearts, in addition to concerns about the prepared dishes themselves, they also include but are not limited to the opacity of school management in the canteen, which makes their rights to know, supervise and choose missing or in vain, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a parent group in my child’s primary school, which fully described a parent’s experience of supervising the canteen: Because some children reported that the dishes were small and tasted bad, some parents went to try them at noon one day ( This is the right of parental supervision recognized by the school). As a result, the dishes on that day were rich and tasted good. A parent who went to supervise said: &quot;My daughter came back and said that the food was unpalatable in the past two days. On the day I went, I was satisfied. There was plenty of meat in the dishes on the day I went.&quot; This may not have anything to do with the school, but this is how the catering company deals with parents. I believe there are more than one or two parents who are dissatisfied with their children’s meals at school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about the fact that the right to operate a canteen in some schools can be sold for millions. Parents often have no say in the selection of catering companies. It is not difficult to understand parents&#39; distrust of schools and school cafeterias. In fact, even if there are no pre-prepared dishes, the meat bought freshly from the market may contain illegally added clenbuterol, and the vegetables may also contain excessive pesticide residues. Therefore, deciding whether it is safe or not based on fresh vs. frozen or pre-made is not the core or the most critical point of the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to build parents’ confidence in schools and school cafeterias? The solution is also simple: take necessary measures to establish or re-establish the trust that should exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, parents should have a certain right to speak and full rights to know and supervise in selecting the dishes prepared by catering companies, canteens or catering companies every day. If every parent wants to understand and participate informedly, they can do so at any time without hindrance. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. Transparency, openness and frankness can dispel all kinds of suspicions, concerns and worries. Schools, canteens or catering companies should be open-minded and act in accordance with conscience, operating procedures and professional ethics, and are not afraid of routine or surprise supervision from parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, all teachers and administrators in the school should eat the same dishes as the students. It can not only demonstrate the equality between teachers and students, but also, if both teachers and principals eat it, any concerns about food safety can be instantly eliminated, killing two birds with one stone. On this basis, parents&#39; trust in the school can be rebuilt. Only with trust can there be healthy and effective communication, and we can clarify various misunderstandings and solve various problems at any time. Children will also have more trust and identification with the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you achieve these two points, many things will be solved easily. &quot;Whether prepared dishes can be brought to campus&quot; should be a matter of public discussion: What are the pros and cons of using prepared dishes or fresh meat and vegetables, and what is the difference in cost? Which catering company should you choose that is more conscientious and has guaranteed food safety? If canteens and catering companies use pre-prepared dishes, which company should they use? etc. Moreover, when parents have the right to speak, know, and participate, I believe that whether it is a catering company or a food production company, the first consideration is how to win the trust of parents, and the school cafeteria will have better safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运运动员村——身在“村里”，如在“家里”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257464]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Asian Games Village is the largest non-competition venue for the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. It is divided into Athletes Village, Technical Officials Village, There are three parts to the media village. As the Asian Games draw closer, how athletes from various Asian countries and regions will start their &quot;Asian Games life&quot; during the competition has become a hot topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 22, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters visited the Hangzhou Asian Games Village Athletes Village. The Athletes Village is located in the northeastern area of ​​the Hangzhou Asian Games Village. It can accommodate 10,400 athletes and team officials. It is divided into international area, residential area and operational area. Among them, the International Zone has facilities such as a VIP reception center, village chief&#39;s courtyard, flag square, and commercial street. The delegation welcome center is the &quot;first stop&quot; for all delegation athletes and team officials. It is also one of the daily entrances to the athletes&#39; village during games. At the Flag Square, Southern Weekend reporters witnessed the welcoming ceremony of Hong Kong, China and other delegations entering the Athletes Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the village, athletes and team officials will take the village shuttle bus to their respective rooms. Each building in the Athletes Village ranges in height from 10 to 42 floors and is divided into 22 types of units. In the Athletes Village Cultural House, athletes from all over Asia can experience traditional Chinese culture up close. In a badge exchange center, people can interact with a machine full of badges, put the badges into the machine, and then choose any other badges in the machine. In addition, the athletes&#39; village also has a beauty and manicure center to create various exquisite looks for athletes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I hope athletes can feel the greenness and intelligence of this Asian Games here, and experience the warmth of ‘home’.” The Hangzhou Asian Games Village construction team told the media. &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;Previously, the Canadian government accused &quot;Indian government personnel&quot; of being involved in the murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, but this was firmly denied by India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nijar is the leader of the Canadian Sikh community. On June 18, he was murdered outside a Sikh cultural center in British Columbia, Canada. The case triggered strong protests from the Canadian Sikh community, demanding that the Canadian government solve the case as soon as possible and bring the murderer to justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau mentioned the matter when speaking in the House of Commons, saying that he had obtained &quot;credible&quot; evidence that the Indian government was involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India and Canada are far apart. Why does a case that happened thousands of miles away involve the Indian government? Why did the latter react so violently? This is related to the &quot;Khalistan&quot; (that is, the Sikh independence movement) movement in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to solve the issue of the status of the Sikhs has always been a family scandal that successive Indian governments have tried hard to cover up. The incident of India and Canada expelling diplomats from each other has once again attracted widespread attention from the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Are you no longer afraid of exposing family scandals&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Successive Indian governments have always been highly vigilant about the return of the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement. When the governments of countries where overseas Sikhs live show support and condone behavior, India will use various channels to implement measures. pressure, but generally adhere to the principle of low-key handling in order to minimize the opportunity for the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement to express its claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office, the Modi government has shown new thinking on ethnic issues, and its domestic and foreign policies and statements have become increasingly stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestically, the Modi government’s economic and social development policies continue to sacrifice the well-being of India’s minority groups. Violent incidents against ethnic minorities by Hindu extremist organizations occur from time to time, and the economic and social conditions of the Sikhs in India are deteriorating day by day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abroad, Modi insists on exporting Hindu nationalist ideas among overseas Indians. Whenever he visits foreign countries, he will use Hindu elements to hold large gatherings to build support for the cause of Hindu nationalism among overseas Hindus. . The Modi government&#39;s ethnic policies have successfully brought sharply antagonistic ethnic relations at home to Indian groups overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2002, Modi was serving as Chief Minister of Gujarat. The state government led by him was accused of adopting a policy of inaction in response to riots and even condoning attacks, resulting in thousands of casualties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as Prime Minister of India, Modi took a very strong position on the issue of overseas Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is to increase pressure on host governments and require these countries to take practical measures to combat so-called anti-India activities in their own countries. Senior Indian officials have repeatedly accused the United States and Europe of using the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement to involve issues of Indian sovereignty in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to support overseas Hindus and rush to the forefront of opposing overseas Sikhs. Overseas, when Sikh demonstrations occur, overseas Hindus are often arranged to hold tit-for-tat activities at the same time. People from both sides exchanged insults, and overseas Hindus and overseas Sikhs even caused conflicts in the streets, forcing the host government to intervene by creating social security incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the United States has deepened its reliance on India, European and American countries have been less concerned about issues such as the status of the Sikhs for some time. The Modi government has emphasized its strong strategy to deal with overseas Sikh issues. It seems to be quite effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has not followed the United States and Europe in imposing comprehensive sanctions on Russia. Disappointed, the United States and Europe will no longer tolerate concessions to India&#39;s actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the intention of the United States and Europe to use the status of the Sikhs to attack India has become increasingly obvious. The United States took the lead in attacking India. For example, in May 2022, the state of Connecticut passed a resolution declaring that April 29 was recognized as the &quot;Sikh Declaration of Independence Day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we enter 2023, &quot;Khalistan&quot; gatherings have occurred one after another in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, and activists have also had violent clashes with local Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Canada, anti-India demonstrations have also occurred frequently since 2023, and India-Canada relations have continued to be tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Confrontation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Canada has expressed its views on the Sikh issue from time to time. India has always been quite dissatisfied and regards Canada as the overseas base camp of the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the number of Sikhs in Canada is about 770,000, accounting for about 2.21% of Canada’s total population, which is equivalent to the proportion of Sikhs in India’s total population. Sikhs generally develop well in Canada, have higher economic and social status, and have greater political influence in the local area. For example, when Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada in 2015, his cabinet included four Sikh ministerial officials. Sikhs also have a relatively high representation rate in Canadian parliaments at all levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Modi first took office as Prime Minister of India, he had quarrels with Canada over the Sikh issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2015, when Modi paid his first state visit to Canada, India attached great importance to it. However, some organizations in Canada immediately held protests and marches, demanding that the Canadian government investigate Modi’s 2002 murder in Gujarat. A high-profile state visit was tarnished by his dereliction of duty amid ethnic riots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the United States and Europe begin to revisit this disagreement, India and Canada have had many confrontations over the Sikh issue, adding uncertainties to the already troubled bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Canada, two incidents occurred in June 2023, exacerbating tensions between the two sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, on June 4, the Sikhs held a parade to protest against the &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; launched by the Indian government that year, and used a float parade to recreate the scene of Indira Gandhi&#39;s assassination. . The Indian government protests that Canada has violated its sovereignty and dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then on June 18, Nijar, the famous leader of Canada’s “Khalistan Independence Referendum”, was shot dead by two gunmen in the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if Canada&#39;s concerns about the Sikhs in India are not taken into account, the Indian government&#39;s involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen has involved Canadian sovereignty and is a serious criminal case. This can be said to have touched the bottom line of the Canadian government. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the G20 summit in early September, the host Modi did not hold a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau. Instead, he expressed &quot;strong concern&quot; about &quot;Canadian extremists&#39; continued anti-India activities&quot;, which triggered strong opposition from Canada. dissatisfied. Then came Trudeau’s latest briefing on the Nijar incident mentioned above, emphasizing that he had obtained “credible” evidence and that the Modi government could not escape its involvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India and Canada not only expelled diplomats from each other, but also interrupted negotiations on a free trade agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Sikh Question&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;India’s&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Thunder&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;India&#39;s &quot;dissension&quot; on the Sikh issue has a lot to do with the historical grievances of ethnic conflicts in India that led to the emigration of Sikhs overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the latest census by the Population Registration and Survey Commission of India, there are about 20 million Sikhs, accounting for about 2% of the total Hindu population. The Indian state of Punjab has one of the largest concentrations of Sikhs. Punjab has a total population of 27.7 million, of which 57.69%, or about 16 million, believe in Sikhism. In Punjab, the Sikhs are the majority ethnic group. From a nationwide perspective in India, the Sikhs are an absolute minority. This situation has created a unique political status for the Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sikhism originated in India in the 15th century. The founder, Guru Nanak, opposed the caste oppression of Hinduism and put forward the slogan of &quot;everyone is equal and treats others equally&quot;. The Sikh ethnic group has strong internal cohesion and a martial ethos. They are hard-working and hard-working, and have a high economic and social status in India. However, the political status of the Sikhs is one of India&#39;s most sensitive internal affairs issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since India’s independence, the Sikhs have always hoped to gain more autonomy under the Indian federal system. The decentralization movements carried out at different times have also achieved certain results, including the original Punjab state being divided into two parts in 1966. Second, this made the Sikhs the majority ethnic group in a local state for the first time in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late 1970s, the Sikhs in Punjab, India once again launched a non-violent regional autonomy movement, but the Indian government took strong measures to suppress it, especially the &quot;Blue Massacre&quot; on June 3, 1984. &quot;Operation Star&quot; had the greatest impact. At that time, the Indian armed forces used heavy equipment including tanks, artillery and helicopters to attack the Golden Temple in Amritsar where militants were entrenched, causing huge casualties and damaging the sacred Golden Temple building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sikhs compared &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; with the foreign invasions and massacres they encountered in history, which aroused the sentiments of the Sikhs at home and abroad with the same hatred. Sikh soldiers mutinied in many places in India. . &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; caused serious antagonism between Sikhs and Hindus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the acts of retaliation, on October 31, 1984, the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. Indira&#39;s assassination triggered a mass crisis in India. A wide range of Hindu attacks on Sikhs killed at least 3,000 Sikhs. Since then, the relationship between the two ethnic groups has become completely antagonistic, and the incident has gradually evolved into an armed separatist rebellion by the Sikhs fighting for independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 1993, the &quot;Khalistan Movement&quot; rebellion was considered largely quelled, causing a total of 21,443 deaths during this period, including 11,694 civilians, 1,746 armed forces soldiers, and 8,003 militants . Since then, many Sikhs have emigrated overseas, mainly to the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia and other countries. Today, about 1.5 million Sikhs live outside India and have become an important part of overseas Indians. However, the Indian government offended the memory of the Shwedagon Temple and the large-scale pursuit and killing of Sikh people in &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; , continues to exist among Sikhs overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, the incident is still unfolding, and the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom have all expressed serious concerns. It is still unclear whether India is certain that Trudeau will not disclose key evidence in the case, or whether Trudeau has produced evidence to pin Modi on the pillar of shame for continuing to persecute the Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the most injured person in the whole incident was the third party, the United States. The Biden administration in the United States has made great efforts in recent years to build the so-called alliance of democracies.

Recently, reporters interviewed the heads of relevant departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Education regarding &quot;prepared dishes entering campuses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the person in charge, school food safety and nutritional health are related to the healthy growth of students. The Ministry of Education has long been working with relevant departments to effectively implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and strictly implement the Food Safety Law and other laws regulations, and has successively formulated and implemented regulations such as the &quot;Regulations on the Management of Food Safety and Nutrition and Health in Schools&quot; and the &quot;Guidelines for the Construction of Nutrition and Healthy Schools&quot; to continuously strengthen the management of school food safety and nutrition and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 57 of the Food Safety Law stipulates that canteens of schools and other centralized dining units must strictly abide by laws, regulations and food safety standards; those who order food from catering units must obtain food production and operation licenses from The enterprise orders and inspects the ordered food as required. Catering units should strictly abide by laws, regulations and food safety standards when processing meals to ensure food safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge pointed out that the party and the government attach great importance to school food safety and are very concerned about the healthy growth of students. Parents expect their children to eat green, safe, nutritious and healthy food in school. After research, given that there is currently no unified standard system, certification system, traceability system and other effective regulatory mechanisms for prepared dishes, a very cautious attitude should be taken when &quot;prepared dishes are brought to campus&quot; and it is not appropriate to promote them into campuses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成为全职儿女，是双向奔赴还是逃离社会？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/1JE8T6YwMwSf39ignBvAWz6wqusEAeMivHPOMl8t.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;930&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/1JE8T6YwMwSf39ignBvAWz6wqusEAeMivHP OMl8t. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most effortless social identity a person can acquire from birth is &quot;son or daughter&quot;. As life progresses, a variety of new social identities will be acquired, including occupations, titles, Relationships, political identities, and more. When a person interrupts the process, deviates from the life trajectory preset by mainstream concepts, and retreats from society to the family, what words can he use to define himself? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, British society classified people who were not employed, enrolled in higher education, or furthered as NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training). This term was adopted when it was introduced to Japan and Taiwan. The transliteration of &quot;Nite tribe&quot; is translated as &quot;gnawing old tribe&quot; in mainland China. But the &quot;elder-gnawing behavior&quot; is not limited to &quot;elder-gnawers.&quot; According to a China Family Tracking Survey by Peking University, the proportion of &quot;elder-gnawers&quot; among my country&#39;s working-age population jumped from less than 2% in 2010 to 40% in 2018. %above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese scholar Yamada Hiromasa proposed the term &quot;single parasites&quot; in 1999, which is more specific than NEET. It refers to those who have been delaying marriage and rely on their parents for daily life such as housing and food. People who use their income as &quot;pocket money&quot;. The male protagonist of the Japanese drama &quot;My Story is a Long Story&quot; is a &quot;single parasite&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is &quot;gnawing at the old&quot; or &quot;single parasitism&quot;, the words themselves have a certain derogatory color, and are only measured by social value. In the context of unavoidable stigma, some people who have returned to their families choose to define themselves as &quot;full-time children&quot;. Apart from all external social identities, they are at least the children of their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having full-time children is not a large number, nor is it an option that can be easily replicated, but it has caused a huge amount of discussion on the Internet. Rather than what a full-time son or daughter is or how to be a full-time son or daughter, we are more concerned about why they give up other identities. The reason why they have become full-time children is not only due to themselves, but also has a lot to do with the common difficulties they face in this era, but they have not been able to overcome it for the time being, or have given up the fight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jv6s6VVx0pKS8P6lINgiWhE5nOKQqLExILl63Ng2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jv6s6VVx0pKS8P6lINgiWhE5nOKQqLExILl63Ng2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251336&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Single sojourn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In The popularity of exchanges in the Douban group &quot;Exchange Center for Full-time Children&#39;s Work&quot; has subsided. Old posts from the past are constantly being dug up by students and reporters in journalism and sociology, showing a strong sense of exploration into &quot;full-time children&quot;. Such inquiries sometimes arouse resentment. Some people couldn&#39;t help but post and ask, &quot;Why are people suddenly paying attention to full-time children?&quot; Most of the people who responded thought it was hype and hot-button pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most active period of the group is from January to April 2023. Many people who choose to describe themselves as &quot;full-time children&quot; share their stories publicly. In these stories, happiness and relaxation are rare, and anxiety and confusion are the main themes: &quot;I feel that my sense of worth is very low&quot; &quot;I am especially tired when facing relatives, and my parents sometimes show dissatisfaction&quot; &quot;I have already started to feel anxious in the third week&quot; &quot;...Some people also mentioned that some people who become full-time children are under peer pressure and are easily traumatized - they are out of touch with the mainstream development path of society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The definition of full-time children in the group introduction is somewhat similar to the &quot;single parasitic family&quot;: single young people, living in their parents&#39; homes and enjoying financial assistance from their parents. The difference is that full-time children will work hard in exchange for financial assistance, and they do not give up employment, but keep studying, waiting for opportunities to return to the workplace, or take public postgraduate entrance examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This definition is consistent with most full-time children aged 20-30, although it is not applicable to those over 30 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi is 26 years old, and her situation fits the definition of a full-time child. After graduating from an overseas master&#39;s degree in December 2022, she went through various considerations of applying for a doctorate and finding a job, and finally chose to concentrate on preparing for the civil service exam at home. The background of her circle of friends is Russell&#39;s famous saying: &quot;Don&#39;t feel guilty for sleeping in, because you can&#39;t create much value when you get up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi believes that major has the greatest influence on her career choice. She majored in education. “Two of my classmates from the same school who studied accounting and marketing quickly joined the workforce. One joined PricewaterhouseCoopers and the other joined Mercedes-Benz. But these big companies don’t require education. student.&quot; Her original career plan was to enter a university after completing her Ph.D., but during the four months of applying in 2022, she felt tremendous pressure. Being infected with the new crown epidemic in December was the last straw that crushed her. The application was abandoned. Later, when she accidentally opened her mailbox, Xixi discovered that she had received an offer from the University of Birmingham in the UK, but by that time she had missed the deadline to apply for a scholarship. &quot;It is too low cost to spend millions to study for a doctorate in liberal arts at your own expense.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;A 985 master&#39;s degree in liberal arts is not as good as a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science with three majors.&quot; Xixi felt this from the salary. A friend of hers joined an Internet company after graduating with a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science. After a few years, his annual salary rose to 600,000 yuan. When she was applying for a master&#39;s degree, she briefly found a job with a monthly salary of only 3,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When taking the civil service exam this time, Xixi did not prepare for the exam while working as she did when applying for a master&#39;s degree. She found that the competition is too fierce now, and the number of people taking the civil service exam has increased significantly in recent years. Taking the National Civil Service Examination as an example, since 2021, the number of applicants has increased by about 500,000 every year, reaching 1.51 million in 2021 and exceeding 2.5 million in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xixi’s parents supported her decision to stay at home and find a job. Her father said to her: “Don’t worry, you can slowly find a job that you are more satisfied with.” One of her classmates was not so lucky. The family&#39;s financial situation is good, but his parents really wanted him to find a job as soon as possible after graduating from the master&#39;s degree. He could only find a job as a counselor in a local technical secondary school in a hurry, with a monthly salary of two to three thousand, and the work was very tiring. “He wanted to take the entrance examination for a certain position, but he had no energy to review after work, so he was caught in a dilemma: he was reluctant to give up his current job because he was afraid that he would not be able to find another job in the future; he was tired, unhappy and had little money if he didn’t give up. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the lessons learned from her classmates, Xixi prepares for the provincial exam with peace of mind at home. Her family&#39;s finances are jointly managed by her parents and her. She can freely use the fraction of her savings, which is enough to cover her living expenses, but she does not have to take on housework. &quot;I mainly want to be a companion.&quot; After going to college, Xixi rarely grew up like this. Spending time living with her parents, my mother cherishes her days at home. Every night, my parents watch TV in the living room, while Xixi does aerobics. One day when Xixi went to her room to exercise, her mother asked unaccustomedly, &quot;Why don&#39;t you dance outside today?&quot; Push her to work, but she still feels anxious, and she feels like her days at home are getting nowhere. &quot;We are in a result-oriented society. I cannot accept the view that life is not a track but a wilderness. I am still trapped by the mainstream values ​​of society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Professional Value&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Douban There is a question thread in the group, &quot;Why do children become full-time workers?&quot; Among the 16 answers, the reason &quot;doesn&#39;t want to work/can&#39;t find a job&quot; accounted for 11, including young people who are unemployed after graduation. In 2023, the youth unemployment rate continues to rise. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the national urban survey of the population aged 16-24 years old, the unemployment rate exceeded 20% from April to June 2023. Since August, this data has been suspended release. When some young people who cannot find jobs return to their families, they become full-time children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lan Qi is one of the unemployed youth aged 16-24. She understands that having a full-time job is not a normal way of employment. &quot;I also get a salary at home, but it cannot be compared with going out to work outside. Any kind of job should communicate with the outside world.&quot; Lan Qi was forced to stay at home. She had a job after graduating from undergraduate school, but her father rejected it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;His worries are too conservative. Isn&#39;t it safe for a girl to go on a business trip for a few days? What&#39;s more, there are female colleagues traveling with her. His concept is that after I get married, I will have nothing to do with him. Before, we had to protect our daughter&#39;s reputation. The value of a virgin is better than anything else in her growth.&quot; Lan Qi did not try to persuade her father and resigned and returned home. She was pained by the absurd stubbornness of her parents and her own weakness, and had no courage to find a new job. &quot;I feel like I am useless. I am lagging behind my peers and out of touch with society. I am like Juexin in &quot;Home&quot; and Nora in &quot;A Doll&#39;s House&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In me Among all the stories about stay-at-home children that I have read, Lanqi’s case is very special. I was not sure whether she belonged to this group, but she chose the word herself because she liked the professional attributes in it. &quot;As long as there is labor, it is a career. Some people think that children who work full-time are &#39;cheating on the old&#39;, but I don&#39;t agree. &#39;Cheating on the old&#39; means relying on their parents for food and clothing without putting in any work, which means losing one&#39;s own value. I want to do housework too. Valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lan Qi made me realize that in most descriptions of full-time children, the children should be the dominant one, asking their parents for financial assistance to provide for their own lives, but in fact Parents may also be the ones in control, and their attitudes and concepts shape the appearance of the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lanqi’s parents believe that doing housework is a better choice for women than working outside the home. Lan Qi said, &quot;They seem to be cultivating a housework machine. They do housework and cook for the future when they get married, and the skills they learn are for future generations. For example, my mother thinks that I learn swimming so that my children can learn it faster. .&quot; One time I was chatting with Lan Qi, and she said that she was cooking dinner that night, and her mother said to her, &quot;You took my place.&quot; She felt very sad, &quot;She could have worked hard in society, but she was doing heavy housework at home. , can the heart be willing and the emotion be willing?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of Lan Qi&#39;s parents comes from their ancestors, &quot;My grandfather &#39;protected&#39; his daughters very well, which was very rare in that era. They had a good reputation and were surrounded by neighbors. Quite recognized.&quot; Lanqi&#39;s parents hope that she will be a daughter who is waiting to be born, and she chooses to be a full-time child. Modern and traditional are integrated in this word, so it is both understandable and novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0HS9ni4yQzkUz8L7e5v5VxyjTfDi9SPGBnIha9zC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0HS9ni4yQzkUz8L7e5v5VxyjTfDi9SPGBnIha9zC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251335&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Puppet on a string&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Among the reasons for becoming a full-time child, Yue Hang’s answers left a deep impression on me. She was the first person to accept my request for an interview. Before the interview, I didn’t realize how courageous she was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s narration drew me to Shenzhen, a hot and humid place with endless summers. In 2017, 25-year-old Yue Hang returned from studying abroad, and her father found her a job in Shenzhen. This job made her unhappy. At the end of 2020, she lost her sense of smell. After that, her skin problems worsened, her acne bleeds, and her attempts to resolve the unpleasantness all failed. In the spring of 2021, the second job her father found brought a turnaround in her life, but she was persuaded to quit after a three-month probation period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wait while I light a cigarette.&quot; Yue Hang said, but she didn&#39;t take a few puffs in total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s first job was in a family business. The boss was from Chaoshan, Guangdong. There were less than 10 employees in the office, most of whom were relatives of the boss. Yue Hang couldn&#39;t even understand Chaoshan dialect, and she couldn&#39;t understand it until she left her job. She was like an outsider in the office and could only do things in silence. Salaries have basically never been increased. In 2020, the company&#39;s performance was not good and wages began to be owed. Other non-relative colleagues resigned, but Yue Hang persisted - she also submitted several resumes, but received no response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This company is not equipped with dormitories. When Yue Hang first arrived, he still had expectations for life. His salary was 5,000 yuan and he spent 3,500 yuan on renting a house. Later, her rental price dropped to 800 yuan. &quot;It&#39;s not a good house. It&#39;s cheap. I don&#39;t want to spend a dime on this job. I also struggled with myself. I endured hardship, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the company finally allocated dormitories, and Yue Hang moved in even though there was no air conditioning. She admitted that her mentality at the time was a bit stupid, &quot;Finally, the company provided free housing, and I had to live there to earn back my money.&quot; The highest temperature in Shenzhen in summer can exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Yue Hang was so hot that she was desperate while calculating her profits and losses. Only later did she realize I have suffered a great loss, and my health has been compromised. &quot;I hate that company, so I have to recover the psychological gap from the financial aspect. It&#39;s just that I feel it&#39;s unfair to get such a small salary.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second company made Yue Hang feel much better, until his boss He asked her: &quot;What did your parents teach you?&quot; He even criticized her in public and called her father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the four years of working in Shenzhen, Yue Hang was like a screw in a machine, always tense and unable to relax. The weekly working hours are from Monday to Saturday, with only one day off on Sunday. She will eat a lot of desserts and stuff them into her mouth until she feels like vomiting, just to get a little happiness. Although such happiness was short-lived, she didn&#39;t know where else to find it. When she had insomnia at night, she would masturbate to make herself fall asleep quickly, &quot;I need to have enough sleep to be able to serve my work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the night when she resigned from the second company, Yue Hang I have been lying in front of my desk, thinking about what happened in the week before leaving my job. Her whole body was frozen in place like a puppet. If she wanted to move, her body could move, but she had no will to drive her body. She fell into stupor for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Yue Hang went out of town to attend a relative’s wedding on behalf of her family—both her parents worked, and she was the only one free. At the wedding, Yue Hang suddenly fell into a coma. Her parents came to take her home and sent her to a psychiatric ward the next day. She became a puppet again, conscious but unable to leave the darkness. She woke up only a few days later. Her depression was already severe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The overdraft generation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November 2021, Yue Hang was discharged from the hospital and began a life of recuperation at home. She almost shuts herself away and rarely communicates with her parents. They would get angry when they saw her sitting on the sofa &quot;doing nothing,&quot; so she always stayed in her room alone. Like a rebound from the regular life of commuting to and from work in the past, her sleeping time has become disorderly, and she will let herself suffer from insomnia. &quot;I just coax myself, not to be anxious, and I don&#39;t have to go to work anyway.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2022, after returning to her hometown as a child, Yue Hang resumed socializing, driving to meet friends, eat delicious food, and visit scenic spots... She likes to travel by car, but she has almost no chance to use a car in the past few years in Shenzhen. Her life includes many activities that were not available during her working life: trying to plant flowers and plants, going to the rooftop to dry clothes in the sunshine, and collecting express cartons to sell scrap products. She likes the process of collecting cartons. She first selects the largest carton, then unpacks and flattens other small cartons to stuff more things into a fixed space. Although the cartons collected for several months can only be sold for ten A few dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the small town in his hometown, apart from paying social security, Yue Hang’s other living expenses are about 1,000 yuan. Her parents gave her a living allowance, and she also earned pocket money through part-time work - she worked as a temporary assistant in a photography studio, earning 50 yuan for half a day. Since 2023, she has also worked as a temporary dishwasher in a hotel. These two jobs made her feel comfortable. The customers who came to take pictures wanted beautiful photos and were very polite to the staff. After the dishwashing work was over, she was able to share some dishes that had not been touched with chopsticks. &quot;This kind of physical work doesn&#39;t require using your brain and gives you a sense of accomplishment. As long as you finish the work in front of you, you don&#39;t have to work overtime after get off work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doing these two jobs is a rare independent decision-making for her. From a young age, Yue Hang&#39;s life has been arranged by her parents. When she graduated from junior high school, her parents suggested that she study abroad. She agreed. She completed high school and university abroad, and majored in economics, which is easier to find a job. Now, her parents&#39; investment in her education has become a burden and pressure on her. &quot;Even if your parents don&#39;t show their disappointment in front of you, it&#39;s difficult for children to not find this feeling if they have been raised for a long time and cannot find a job. They have not been able to make money for so long and it does not meet their expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang feels that his qualifications are average, especially not good at taking exams. After returning to China, her parents asked her to take the junior economist exam, but she failed and was unwilling to take other certificates. She was also not good at socializing, and only gradually became more open-minded after returning home. She is not used to fighting for anything. She didn&#39;t write her resume well when she wanted to change jobs. Recently, she changed it to a more formal version when she was looking for a job. She will also write down her experience as a dishwasher to enrich her resume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Yue Hang also has a sense of frustration in the face of the times, &quot;It is impossible for me to make more money than my parents. In their era, as long as you worked hard, you would have money, but I worked hard, and I I don’t have money to work overtime.” Yue Hang felt that many of the peers she saw in Shenzhen worked harder than her parents. Their generation worked harder but got less. &quot;We seem to have overdrawn our lives in advance. We have been busy attending cram schools since elementary school. We don&#39;t know what progress we are making. We can&#39;t catch up with a house or even a relaxing vacation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two years of being a full-time mother and daughter have been the happiest time for Yue Hang in recent years, and she has considered continuing to do so. In 2022, my grandma had an operation. During this period, Yue Hang proposed to his father that he wanted to be her caregiver. &quot;When I was hospitalized before, my parents hired me a caregiver, which paid me two to three hundred (remuneration) a day. I wanted to make this money. Of course, as long as they took care of my food, I wouldn&#39;t ask them to pay the price of a caregiver. Please ask me. But my father doesn&#39;t agree.&quot; Yue Hang feels that he can act as a nanny among relatives. In addition to his grandparents, his parents will also face care needs, because they all only have one child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang’s condition has stabilized a lot, and he is currently trying to find a new job, such as the food department or transportation department of IKEA. “It requires physical work, no overtime, plenty of exercise, and you don’t have to worry about so many interpersonal relationships. , taking into account physical health and mental health.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5pnGTNAYzfxYTyw3tMlHgbRtlytjPo5Ob5t5BLlp.jpg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5pnGTNAYzfxYTyw3tMlHgbRtlytjPo5Ob5t5BLlp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251337&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Crazy Work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yue Hang believes that the biggest constraint for children who work full time is financial resources. She does not want to rely on her parents all the time, so she can only continue to work. For Qingtian, a 37-year-old with 10 years of work experience, she does not have much financial burden, so she can calmly resign and withdraw from the labor market. She refers to herself as &quot;laying down trash&quot;. At the end of 2022, friends forwarded her a topical article about full-time children, with the sentence &quot;You are so typical.&quot; She rolled her eyes and approved of the new title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stay-at-home children reminded Qingtian of a report he had read about Japanese people in their thirties and forties who nibbled on the elderly. One of the stories was that a 40-year-old daughter accompanied her 60-year-old mother on a trip abroad. , my daughter is very envious of her mother’s high pension. In &quot;The Choice of Being a Woman&quot;, she saw Chizuru Ueno having a similar discussion in 2003, &quot;&#39;60s generation&#39; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Refers to people aged 60-69&lt;/span>;) whose parents had retired before the economic downturn and widespread layoffs, and received generous pensions. It can be said that they are the first and last generation to fully enjoy the economy. People with high growth and good fortune. But the next generation does not have that kind of protection. It is precisely because this generation’s family has a strong financial background that it provides the possibility for their children to live in old age.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After resigning, his parents gave Qingtian a slap in the face. A large sum of money supported her life, and she put most of it into the stock market. Although she has lost a lot of money, she has confidence in the stock market. &quot;Our family started stock trading in the 1990s, and we have experienced several bull and bear markets. I believe we will always come back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingtian was originally a middle-level cadre of a medium-sized Internet advertising company. What made her put down her career was her work. The futility and absurdity felt in it. In 2020, the company advocated cost reduction and efficiency improvement. Employees&#39; salaries were reduced by 15% and no bonuses were given. However, the company&#39;s performance that year was not bad. At the end of the year, the company&#39;s top executives went to Macau for the annual meeting. Qingtian&#39;s leader came back and showed off to her privately, &quot;The Rolex watch I just bought doesn&#39;t look good, and I want to change it.&quot; Qingtian thought of her employees, &quot;They are all good students of 985 and 211, diligent and diligent They worked diligently overtime, worried about losing their jobs, and didn’t complain when called by customers in the middle of the night, but they only paid several thousand yuan a month, what’s their fault?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a colleague in Qingtian died of pancreatic cancer. , at the funeral, a former colleague who joined a leading Internet retail company vividly said that there was a row of AEDs hanging in their office. The first thing new employees did when they joined the company was to practice cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, because of the high salary, many people inside wanted to change jobs. Go to their department. She lamented, &quot;The corporate culture is completely different from our previous company. We don&#39;t have to go through procedures or hold meetings. We just work! We are very motivated.&quot; Qingtian feels that the value has been impacted. &quot;Without people, there is nothing. Why are everyone so crazy? Why is this industry so crazy?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sense of value of &quot;hard work&quot; and &quot;self-realization&quot; that he always believed in in the past has gradually turned into &quot;self-exploitation&quot; and &quot;self-brainwashing&quot; in Qingtian&#39;s heart. . She has witnessed the success stories of the explosion of the Internet industry, and has also experienced anger and disappointment at the serious imbalance in the company&#39;s distribution of interests. She no longer seeks meaning in her work. &quot;The meaning of work to ordinary people is to earn money to support themselves and their families. If the family has a certain amount of accumulation, why not make some different choices so that both themselves and their families can live comfortably?&quot; Qingtian thought of the colleague who passed away. The last Douban broadcast complained about the relationship with her family, &quot;She never reconciled with her parents until her death.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because she was an only child, Qingtian had a close relationship with her parents, and because she had a failed marriage before, She does not plan to start a family anymore and wants to maintain the balance and happiness of living with her parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingtian lives in Guangzhou, and her parents live in the countryside of Huizhou. She often goes back to the village to stay. In the past, when I was working, I could only go home during the Mid-Autumn Festival and Spring Festival. What I saw was the golden rice and the remaining rice stubble. Now, she can fully witness the various stages of rice fields including irrigation, transplanting, heading, and harvesting. She would take her parents on trips, taking care of everything along the way and arranging visits to museums and natural scenery. Even if it was just a visit to the local vegetable market, the family would be very happy. She helped her parents take photos and edit videos, and discovered that they actually wanted to &quot;be seen.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents did not interfere with Qingtian&#39;s choices. She talked with her father about planting flowers and birds, calligraphy and painting, and told him that the richness of life now is five times that of the past. Occasionally, her mother would worry that Qingtian was getting further and further away from re-employment, but seeing that she was happy, she didn&#39;t say much and suggested that she study for a degree and experience more different experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only thing they worried about was that after they &quot;left&quot;, Qingtian would be left alone. This is also a problem Qingtian is worried about, but she has not found a solution yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O0LCKe0HfmalBlPeoiPfuD5lEnPky2BXcSD6JJJQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O0LCKe0HfmalBlPeoiPfuD5lEnPky2BXcSD6JJJQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251333&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What is your function? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the Douban group, the living conditions of older children who work full-time are obviously more relaxed and self-consistent than that of young people. Among the anxious and confused headlines, &quot;37-year-old children who work full-time are happy every day&quot; is particularly eye-catching. . Qingtian replied to this post and expressed his agreement. However, Qingtian believes that children who work full-time have two things in common: first, their families have good economic conditions and their parents have high pensions, and second, they have harmonious family relationships. The situation of the poster, the gardener, is not entirely consistent with this. She does not believe that having children full-time is an option only for a well-to-do family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener is from Dalian, Liaoning. In mid-2022, the gardener&#39;s parents retired, and their pensions totaled more than 7,000 yuan. At the end of the year, they all found another job and had an additional income of four to five thousand yuan. The gardener said that although the money was not much, fortunately the family of three did not have high material desires. The gardener kept accounts and statistics of expenses. Every month, family living expenses are about 1,000 to 1,500 yuan. Her parents’ pocket money adds up to 1,000 yuan. Her pocket money is 1,500 yuan, a total of three to four thousand yuan. The income is enough to cover daily expenses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On every working day, the gardener is responsible for buying vegetables and cooking. She would buy vegetables the afternoon before and cook at 9 or 10 a.m. As usual, she would prepare two green vegetables a day. The meat dishes would be prepared on Monday, such as braised pork, and she would eat a few pieces at a time and then cook them after eating. My mother would come home at 11:30 noon to pack rice to take away, my father would eat at work at noon, and my parents would eat the leftovers from lunch in the evening. In the afternoon, in addition to buying vegetables, the gardener will make bread and pastries and make snacks for his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My mother doesn&#39;t know how to cook. She hasn&#39;t been able to cook since she was a child, so my father cooked when I was a child. However, my father only cooks the same old food, and the food he cooks is not very delicious. .” The gardener believed that her parents asked her to cook because they felt that she was more suitable for cooking at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener has a sense of identity with this &quot;job&quot;, &quot;I have many benefits from cooking at home. I will give them scientific combinations according to dietary guidelines, such as fruits, vegetables, carbohydrates, and milk. If I hadn&#39;t done it, Their health may not be as good as it is now.&quot; She believes that she is different from most full-time children, and she is really taking care of her parents. A netizen replied to her post, &quot;I am about the same age and status as Luzhu (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Owner&lt;/span>;), but my mother mainly cooks at home. It&#39;s time to get ready to improve your cooking skills.&quot; The gardener asked her, &quot;Then what is your function?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have to reflect your value. You can&#39;t just get express delivery as your function, right? Like me , I take care of the family&#39;s finances, make future plans for the family, save money, pay mortgages, and buy things. I don&#39;t work now, and I will try my best to spend less money and live a better life.&quot; Buy Before putting things in her hands, the gardener would think about alternatives in life. For example, she used baking soda instead of dish soap. If she really wants to buy, she will first go to second-hand websites to find brand-new products, or make careful use of coupons on e-commerce platforms. &quot;When you are making money, calculating these is a waste of time, but when you are not making money, calculation is making money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even at home, the gardener lives a very disciplined life. He goes to bed at 9 o&#39;clock every night and goes to bed in the morning. Get up at 6 o&#39;clock and spend most of the day busy. She has never been a lazy person. Before becoming a full-time child, she changed more than a dozen jobs. After each resignation, she would try to find another job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of her previous jobs were clerical, such as travel consulting, hotel reception, office administration, etc. The reason for her resignation was almost always &quot;disagreement with the leader.&quot; &quot;I lacked emotional intelligence and spoke directly. When I first graduated, I didn&#39;t understand anything about society. My father was a worker and my mother ran a small business. They couldn&#39;t teach me anything. Later, I gradually became able to understand eye expressions, but I still don’t understand the need to be diplomatic in situations like the wine table. But I don’t want to change it. Having a high emotional intelligence may mean lowering myself.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, the gardener resigned from his last job. , planning to open his own bakery. She taught herself baking in her spare time, can make Chinese and Western snacks, and can even make birthday cakes. In November 2019, she rented a store. It took two months to renovate and it was officially opened in January 2020. However, it was blocked by the COVID-19 epidemic only more than 20 days after opening. It opened again in May 2020. In 2022, Dalian has been under strict epidemic control since June. There was no business until November. The gardener no longer renewed his lease. &quot;I quit. After three years of business, I lost hundreds of thousands.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I asked the gardener, not long after the store was closed, the epidemic prevention and control ended. Do you regret it? Although she regretted the timing of closing the store, she remained calm, &quot;I knew I couldn&#39;t make money, and I couldn&#39;t do it big because I didn&#39;t want to hire people. From selecting raw materials to making it and handing it over to customers, I had to do it all myself. &quot;She closed the store not only because of the epidemic. She found it annoying to deal with customers. &quot;In the service industry, you will meet a lot of weird people. I haven&#39;t done enough work, but I am a little tired of dealing with people.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The shop is closed, but the gardener&#39;s business is still running. She will take orders from some old customers through the WeChat store and earn back her monthly social security fees. &quot;Earning more than a thousand yuan won&#39;t affect my mood in life, and it won&#39;t waste much of my time. If it&#39;s too much, it won&#39;t work and I&#39;ll start to get annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I don&#39;t want to follow the crowd. &quot;Son&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The gardener&#39;s parents are very supportive of her decision to go home without working. They think that the three members of the family should perform their own duties. The mother cannot cook, the father does not cook well, and the two We are all people who can&#39;t stay at home and like to work outside the house. We just leave things at home to the gardener. Sometimes the gardener reported to her mother how much pocket money she had spent this month, and her mother comforted her, &quot;Okay, this money is not enough to find a cook from outside.&quot; She said to her mother, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to work, you Raise me.&quot; Mother said cheerfully, &quot;Fine, can&#39;t you raise me?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gardener&#39;s view, my father was simpler than my mother. Once she suggested, &quot;How about we take care of the whole house?&quot; Sold, the three of us will travel around the country together, and we will live wherever the place is good.&quot; My father said, &quot;Then you should act quickly.&quot; Sometimes the gardener feels that she is the person who thinks the most in the family, more like a Parents, &quot;The classic saying from both of them is, &#39;Don&#39;t think so much, just take it one step at a time.&#39; They have no plan for the next step. They support me in whatever I do and believe that what I do is right. Without my words, The two of them are still living in the town, and their lives are definitely not as good as they are now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener and her parents bought two small houses in the same community. She bought them first, and later saw that her father&#39;s provident fund was enough After collecting the down payment for a house, I suggested that my parents buy a house in the building next door. The parents do not know how to apply for loans or pay online, and the gardener is responsible for all procedures and loan repayment plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gardener is also concerned about the health management of her parents. She also arranges physical examinations for her parents every year. My mother was diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer during a physical examination. During the surgery and hospitalization, the gardener accompanied her throughout the entire process. Later, she also wrote a guide on caring for hospitalized patients on her personal public account, &quot;It is very detailed from beginning to end. I am a Virgo and I am very careful in my work. Even if the patient is paralyzed on the bed, I will not let her get bedsores.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Where can I find another child like me? I take good care of my parents, and I don&#39;t get married and have children. I don&#39;t want my parents to have to worry about and help take care of their children in their sixties.&quot; The gardener has no plans to get married, have children, or start a family, so he has always been closely connected with his parents in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to the family, the gardener has more time to return to herself. In her free time, she likes to watch movies and books. &quot;I can watch 60 movies a month.&quot; She especially likes Yang Dechang&#39;s &quot;Yi Yi&quot; and Sean Penn&#39;s &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, and her favorite novel is &quot;Blade&quot; by Maugham. She admires the hero Larry&#39;s uniqueness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Withdrawing from “following the crowd” and getting rid of outside voices and mainstream ideas, she was able to understand herself more clearly, “It turns out that I am a person who cannot handle intimate relationships; I am not a social person. I am very kind and sincere to my friends, but I also want to live a more independent life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/09/20/AnfmnE77VwgCr3DKzeklQ7SH0wCHSQ2p80KkNGZC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09 /20/AnfmnE77VwgCr3DKzeklQ7SH0wCHSQ2p80KkNGZC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251334&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Chen Zhitong/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Migratory birds returning home&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another understanding of &quot;full-time&quot; among full-time children is opposite to &quot;part-time&quot;. The focus is to describe the responsibility of &quot;children&quot; ” The time devoted to this role rather than the emphasis on professional and financial attributes. According to data released by the National Health Commission, about 90% of the elderly in my country choose home care, only about 7% rely on community support for care, and 3% live in institutions for care. When the elderly who live at home have care needs that cannot be met by the elderly care market, their children have to make a choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhechang is 42 years old, a native of Beijing, and has worked in other places for many years. Five years ago in Shenzhen, one day when I was at work, I suddenly received a call from my father. My father was walking in the park. He was tired and sat on the side of the road, missing his son. Jianjia burst into tears when she heard &quot;I miss you&quot; coming from the other end of the phone. He has not lived with his parents since graduation. Even though he works in Beijing, he has not had much contact with his parents. Later, he went to work in Tianjin and Shanghai, and then followed his ex-wife to Shenzhen. The marriage was not saved, but he was further away from his parents. &quot;I found that I was pursuing career and love, but I had been neglecting my parents. I began to want to return to Beijing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Xiaxia could fully make up his mind, he learned that his father had suffered a sudden myocardial infarction. On the news of being admitted to CCU (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Cardiac Intensive Care Unit&lt;/span>;), &quot;My mind was buzzing, my heart was numb, and I was slowly I&#39;ve been waiting for a while.&quot; Jianjia resigned immediately, bought a plane ticket and returned to Beijing, where he met his father in the ward. My father had a myocardial infarction that blocked 90% of his heart, and was accompanied by severe heart failure. His life was hanging by a thread. He could not undergo surgery immediately due to inflammation in his lungs, and he was so thin that he lost his appearance. &quot;He saw me and said, &#39;Do I have to tell you my bank card password this time?&#39; I almost cried again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that time, Jianjia cooked in different ways every day, He made chicken soup and sent it to his father to the hospital. He obviously felt that his father was in a much better mood. He also sent a text message saying that the patients were envious of him. Others wanted to eat dumplings. He talked to his children for several days before ordering a takeaway. A month later, his father was discharged from the hospital after surgery. Jianjiang also figured out what was most important to him. “It’s not about achieving great results in your career, because there will always be peaks and troughs in your career. It’s not about being intimate with your lover, because Marriage is just a combination of interests. Only your parents are the ones who will truly treat you well throughout your life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jianzian graduated from the Advertising Department of Peking University. The most widely circulated advertising work is the new product of Harbin Pharmaceutical No. 6 Factory. Cover with high calcium tablets. In 2014, he tried to write a script, but encountered a capital crisis and could not film the script after finishing it, so he went to work in a company again. Now back home, he has resumed writing screenplays. &quot;Although my income is much worse than before and extremely unstable, I finally have time to spend with my family.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao lives with his father. His father&#39;s retirement salary is more than 5,000, and the family&#39;s daily expenses are covered by The father is in charge. His average income from writing scripts is 5,000 yuan a month, and he is responsible for paying social security, car insurance, gas, property and heating bills, etc., which is about 30,000 yuan a year. He believes that he and his father help each other with financial expenditures, not as a nuisance, but as a full-time son and daughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was working before, he earned a lot, but he also consumed a lot. After the divorce, he basically didn’t have much savings left; now, the unstable income has reduced his desire to consume, and he doesn’t travel or go shopping. I stopped eating out, skipped unnecessary social interactions, and learned how to get haircuts. I did many services that would have cost money by myself, but I saved some money. &quot;My pension is definitely not as high as theirs, so I have to work hard to save money for the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father cannot fully accept the option of reducing the pension, and does not support him in writing scripts. Sometimes he will preach to him , &quot;It&#39;s not a problem to stay at home every day.&quot; Considering that his father has a bad heart, he didn&#39;t want to make him angry, so he hid in his room to avoid him when he was on the phone with the director. Once he couldn&#39;t bear it anymore and went away for a week. When he came home, he found that his father&#39;s voice was awkward when he spoke. He realized that it was because his father hadn&#39;t talked to anyone for a week. &quot;I suddenly felt his loneliness, and my heart felt soft.&quot; &quot;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I gave up a lot of things when I chose to be a full-time son, and I think it was worth it.&quot; Looking back on his past life, Jianzian found that he had not lived with his parents well since he entered kindergarten. When I go to work or go to school, when I get home, I just have a meal together and then go about my own business; let alone when I get a job or get married.&quot; Now, he walks with his father, studies recipes, and watches popular TV shows. TV series and chatting about news from the South China Sea and North China. What I like to do most is give my father a haircut and a pedicure. He gained an unprecedented sense of solidity, &quot;I have been in Lhasa for half a year, and my mood is far more impetuous than now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He turned these feelings into a line in the script:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Sometimes I really feel that we Northern Drifters are quite scary.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Why is it so scary?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Which Beipiao didn&#39;t leave their elderly parents in their hometown for the sake of their own career? As spring passes and autumn comes, the number of times they go home to visit their parents is less than that of migratory birds. Some media once calculated that a 25-year-old Beipiao will return home in a year. Calculating the frequency of home visits, he can only spend one month with his parents in his life.

After downloading a certain chat software, he entered the live broadcast room of female anchor K Bao and became obsessed with it after just one look. According to the rules of the platform game, only by becoming the &quot;big brother&quot; can you be qualified to meet the anchor. His monthly salary was only 6,000 yuan, so he took advantage of his position to secretly transfer public funds for rewards. After becoming the &quot;big brother&quot; in K Bao&#39;s live broadcast room, he became an offline lover with K Bao as he wished, and had a sexual relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2022, when the group company reconciled its accounts, it was discovered that the accounts managed by Liu Mingsheng had a large capital deficit. According to an investigation by the public security agency, he embezzled a total of about 123 million yuan in public funds from the company&#39;s accounts, rewarded K Bao with 90 million yuan, and also rewarded two other anchors with several million yuan each. In the end, most of the huge amount of approximately 123 million yuan misappropriated by him was recovered, with a total of 122.68 million yuan recovered. Liu Mingsheng was sentenced to 14 years for job embezzlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;you will die if you have too much fun&quot; energy is staggering. In fact, there are many cases of cashiers misappropriating public funds to reward anchors, and there are both male and female cashiers. Ru Yin works as a cashier for a real estate development group in Guangxi. Starting from 2020, she fell in love with a male anchor on the Douyin APP and rewarded him crazily. When she had no money, she used public funds. Police investigation found that her Douyin account was recharged with more than 5 million yuan in the second half of 2020, and more than 4.3 million yuan was used to reward male anchors, of which more than 1.44 million yuan was the company&#39;s public funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is that Li served as the cashier of a company in Zhuhai in the Jinan Region. From December 2018 to April 2020, he took advantage of loopholes in the company&#39;s financial management to transfer 48.264303 million public funds to his personal account for rewards. Female anchors, game recharges, entertainment consumption, girlfriends, etc., including live broadcast rewards of more than 20 million. After the incident, the &quot;big brother on the list&quot; was sentenced to 12 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A common feature of this type of incident is that the cashier’s income is not high, but the money he or she hands over is a lot. If an individual does not have good character and professional ethics, it is easy to fall into an imbalance of mentality, and the cashier knows the company’s policies best. Where are the financial loopholes, so once they &quot;calculate mentally but not intentionally&quot;, the company&#39;s financial system will be ineffective at least for a period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another direction worth thinking about is: What kind of industry is online live broadcasting, and whose needs do it mainly meet? What is the mentality of those people who squander their own money, their parents&#39; money, and even the company&#39;s money to reward anchors of the opposite sex? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online live broadcast includes several different business formats, one of which is the ascendant live broadcast of goods.如果将其仅仅看成一种新的分销渠道就错了，因为与线下渠道或其他“传统”电商渠道相比，主播卖的可不仅仅是货。尤其是那些做得比较成功的主播，同时贩卖“人设”、提供情绪价值，有类似明星-粉丝的关系存在，往往满足了异性粉丝对另一半的最好想象，甚至性幻想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或者，甚至可以这么说，那些红得发紫的主播，明明做好静好安暖或美美哒的“人设”就可以向粉丝收钱，竟然还额外附送一些还能用得上的商品，真是太“厚道”了。于是，沿着这条路径，“直播带货”的一部分会进化成“直播打赏”，既然不带货也能挣钱，那就不带货、不卖货，直接向粉丝卖“人设”就行了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，“直播打赏”也有多个不同的来源，受众与性质迥异，所以需要分开讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，其另一条进化路径是过去天桥杂耍、街头卖艺及卖惨乞讨从线下转到了线上，其主要受众或是草根阶层或是不特定公众，本文不再赘述。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一条进化路径是，分享欲与窥看欲的互联网化并进一步视频化。一些人把自己的工作、生活、爱好或技能通过视频与大家分享，有直播的，也有录播的，也不乏成功的案例，如钓鱼能手、套圈王、“手工耿”之类，让大家增加了对自己陌生领域的了解与知见，或让大家身临其境感受到自己向往的生活。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们这里重点讨论的“直播打赏”，有显著的主播-粉丝关系，并且一般是男主播-女粉丝、女主播-男粉丝关系，这就不可避免多少带有性意味&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“饮食男女，人之大欲存焉”“食色性也”，毋庸讳言，人的生命力很大一部分系于性能量或性欲望上。让无数中老年女性倾倒的“秀才”，让无数中老年男性倾倒的“一笑倾城”，让无数青年男女如痴如醉的明星，本质并无二致，说到是这些主播或明星的长相、气质与“人设”满足了异性对另一半最好的幻想，这才是这类“纯直播打赏”的发生学与动力学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁迅说，不满是向上的车轮。很少有人对自己目前的生活是完全满意的，对工作不满，对男女朋友或配偶不满，遂期望一种理想的生活，包括理想的配偶，也是人之常情。但是首先要明白自己的能力边界，明白自己在这个社会中是什么样的排序，这样就会对自己目前的生活是否“配得上自己”、人间是否“值得”有一个挤去水分的客观判断，自知者明。然后对于现状，该改变就改变，该接受就接受，这就是跟自己和解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而如果为了精神上的满足，把家中的大额财物甚至不是自己的财物打赏给异性主播，那实质上不是在提升而是在毁掉自己的生活。上述男女出纳挪用公款打赏异性主播正是此类情形。总之，每一个人应该把自己旺盛的生命力用在提升自己上，这样配得上的好东西就越来越多，这是正向利用自己生命能量的方法，而不是消耗自己的所有资源乃至生命力去满足自己的幻想。置个人的荣誉与前途不顾，只为“过把瘾就死”，枉费了人世间走一遭的好机缘。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中美成立经济领域工作组]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257436]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;为落实中美两国元首巴厘岛会晤重要共识，根据国务院副总理、中美经贸中方牵头人何立峰与美国财政部部长珍妮特·耶伦达成的共识，中美双方商定，成立经济领域工作组，包括“经济工作组”和“金融工作组”。“经济工作组”由中美两国财政部副部长级官员牵头，“金融工作组”由中国人民银行和美国财政部副部长级官员牵头。两个工作组将定期、不定期举行会议，就经济、金融领域相关问题加强沟通和交流。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《红色天空》：在侯麦与王家卫之间]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256843]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/qREaPt1m0u1fMC3ZO4Teszy6wrUZVg5tiIPhaaMY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/qREaPt1m0u1fMC3ZO4Teszy6wrUZVg5tiIPha aMY. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250592&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Concept-oriented Petzold&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among contemporary German film directors, Christian Petzold may be the most eye-catching of one. The previous &quot;Ghost Trilogy&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Abode of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Yela&quot;&lt;/span>;) and &quot;Immigration Trilogy&quot; &quot;Music&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), which has earned him a good reputation in the international film industry . So he struck while the iron was hot and continued to launch a series of works with the theme of &quot;Elemental Elves&quot;. &quot;Undine&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2020&lt;/span>;) with the theme of the water goddess is the first film in the series; it won the jury award at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival The grand prize of the group, &quot;Red Sky&quot; with the theme of the fire elf Salomanda, is the second installment in this series. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By sorting out Petzold’s creative trajectory, we can find some obvious characteristics. His works are highly intellectual, and he will provide almost essay-like explanations around certain specific themes. At the same time, he places great emphasis on the core position occupied by concepts. Under the guidance of such creative concepts, the fate of classical mythological characters overlaps with the situation of modern Germans (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Phoenix&quot;&lt;/span>;), the plight of the Jews during World War II also collided with the fate of Arab refugees in contemporary Europe (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;&quot;Transit&quot;&lt;/span>;), stirring up a wonderful chemical reaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But we also have to point out that although the concept of Petzold&#39;s film is charming, it is slightly rigid in terms of flesh and texture, and lacks some real and perceptible vitality. This problem is particularly exposed in Undine: an attempt to combine a water spirit from classical mythology with the life of a contemporary German industrial diver, which is very interesting on paper, but fails to translate into images In the end, it is easy to fall into the predicament of wildly swinging between the metaphysical and the physical, and end up relying on neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Petzold must have realized his mistake in Undine. Therefore, when filming his new work &quot;Red Sky&quot;, he sought a lighter brushstroke: the metaphysical mythological elements are hidden deeper, while the metaphysical daily life is pushed to the foreground. The plot is set during a summer vacation. Leon, a troubled young writer, is invited to his friend Felix&#39;s seaside holiday home to try to finish the novel in a quiet environment while waiting for the publisher&#39;s decision. But during this period of time that should have calmed him down, he passively got acquainted with the beautiful and lively girl Nadia, and her lover Devi who had a close relationship with her. Leon&#39;s heart was stirred up, but the approaching deadline (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Deadline&lt;/span>;) and the burden of intellectuals made him Nadia&#39;s emotions become tangled and twisted, creating a series of comedies and dramas in the lives of four people. At the same time, a wildfire is spreading inland, becoming the disturbing background sound of the entire story. No one knows whether this light vacation will eventually end in raging flames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like the titles of many of Petzold&#39;s previous films, &quot;Red Sky&quot; is also full of potential. It not only refers to the sky dyed red by wildfires on a concrete level, but also metaphorically alludes to the sexual tension that is about to emerge between the several protagonists, as well as the overwhelming sexual tension in the &quot;Revelation&quot; volume of the New Testament. Apocalyptic scene. But the film&#39;s story ultimately fails to live up to the full potential of its title. The huge destructive power of wildfires is almost wiped out by a shot of wild boars running in the forest and the off-screen deaths of two supporting characters; and &quot;Memento mori&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;will die&lt;/span>;)-style death warning also fails to be integrated with the character&#39;s desires. In the final analysis, &quot;Red Sky&quot; still tells the story of a self-centered male protagonist chasing the heroine and awakening during the pursuit. Whether it is his friends, publishers, the fire and death, or even the heroine herself, they seem to be tools that lead him to self-awakening. And there remains a huge gulf between Petzold&#39;s prowess in seductive concept-building and what can only be described as a barely above-average narrative articulation. Red Skies is an improvement over its predecessor, but there&#39;s a gap that still needs to be filled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Zh1Vsz896cTN46UvPe0CjDwWeYJydBhnwEzqf2Qb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250590&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hide And the master of melodrama&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with his meek performance in narrative and expression, Petzold&#39;s ability to write romantic relationships and set off the love atmosphere is outstanding. It is easy to forget that Germans have always been famous for their seriousness, whether they are romantic poets like Goethe and Holderlin or melodrama masters like Douglas Sirk and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He grew up nourished by the Rhine River. To a certain extent, Petzold is also the heir to the romantic mantle of his predecessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the valuable thing about Petzold is that his writing about love relationships not only has a German-style desperate romance, but also has a subtle temperament that is rare among European and American creators. Petzold&#39;s male protagonists always seem to be more interested in the souls of their admirers than in possessing their bodies, but they are always so shy and clumsy in their pursuit of each other that The end of happiness seems forever out of reach. In contrast, Petzold&#39;s heroines are always as erratic as wandering spirits, unable to be defined or captured. They are free souls who make no secret of their feelings for the person they love, but they always refuse to be defined as immutable symbols and never become objects. Therefore, in Petzold&#39;s film, the dislocation game of chasing and dodging has been going on. This game seems to have been going on since the birth of men and women, and it will continue until the end of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Red Sky&quot;, the setting of summer vacation and country holiday house, the lighter tone compared with Petzold&#39;s previous works, and the characters&#39; artistic and intellectual atmosphere The conversation will more or less remind us of those in Eric Rohmer&#39;s films, those satirical ridicules of hesitant straight men with good intentions, and those under the comedic tone, which are emotionless and emotionless. perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the other hand, Petzold’s talent for creating romantic situations, his intense love for female characters, and the emotional relationships between male and female characters in his films become more intense because of evasion and restraint. , will remind people of another film master who is good at creating romantic atmosphere-Wong Kar-wai. Perhaps Paula Bell, the actress in &quot;Transit&quot;, &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Red Sky&quot;, has quietly become Petzold&#39;s Maggie Cheung. The plots of these movies may soon disappear from our minds, but Paula Bell&#39;s bright smile and red dress will remain in our memories for a long time. Through the male director&#39;s way, we cannot fully understand what they mean. Thoughts and feelings, but still (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or - precisely because of this&lt;/span>;) eyes full of admiration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[餐厅员工发顾客打娃视频后赔1万离职，警方如此调解令人费解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257400]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to reports, on September 19, a Western restaurant stopped a mother from beating her daughter and posted the relevant video online. The employee, Mr. Jiang, resigned and left Changsha after compensating the other party 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surveillance video that Mr. Jiang previously posted online showed that the woman involved, Hu, was holding a shopping bag and yelling at the little girl. Later, she took her child to the Western restaurant where Mr. Jiang worked and asked her child to explain to her the process of causing trouble. At this moment, Hu lost control. He put down the shopping bag in his hand, lifted the chair next to him and tried to hit the girl. Mr. Jiang and his colleagues stepped forward to stop him. A nearby merchant revealed in an interview with a reporter from Hunan TV that when the mother and daughter passed by his store, the girl suddenly fell down and the ice cream in her hand spilled on the floor, causing her clothes to be stained. Immediately, Hu lost control of his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Jiang said that after the incident, Hu came to the restaurant many times, saying that he should not have spread the video online and threatened to die in the restaurant. After mediation by the local police station, Mr. Jiang paid the other party 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental losses and medical expenses, and then voluntarily submitted his resignation to his boss. Netizens expressed: &quot;Those who hit people are fine, but those who stopped them will be punished&quot;, &quot;I really feel sorry for this doll when I see this video&quot;, and some netizens said, &quot;It&#39;s really chilling.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The restaurant employee got into trouble when he prevented the woman Hu from beating her daughter in public and uploading the video to the Internet. This matter involves many aspects, including domestic violence, public supervision, privacy rights and law enforcement issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it must be clear that Hu’s behavior of beating his daughter in public is a typical act of domestic violence. It not only violates public order and good customs, but also violates relevant laws. According to Article 2 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, domestic violence refers to physical, mental and other violations committed by family members in the form of beating, binding, mutilation, restriction of personal freedom, regular verbal abuse, and intimidation. Article 5 stipulates that minors, the elderly, disabled people, pregnant and lactating women, and seriously ill patients who suffer domestic violence shall be given special protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the duty of the police station to deal with Hu’s illegal behavior as soon as possible. Article 33 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that if the perpetrator commits domestic violence and constitutes a violation of public security management, he shall be subject to public security management penalties in accordance with the law. It can be seen that when parents beat their children, law enforcement agencies cannot turn a blind eye on the grounds that &quot;honest officials cannot handle household matters.&quot; In this incident, Hu publicly beat his daughter, which caused a very bad public perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the restaurant employee Mr. Jiang’s behavior of publishing the video, from a legal perspective, he did not infringe on Hu’s portrait rights. Because this is an exposure of illegal activities in public places, Mr. Jiang is exercising the citizen’s right to supervise. Article 1020 of the Civil Code stipulates that the following acts may be reasonably carried out without the consent of the portrait right holder: other acts of making, using, or disclosing the portrait of the portrait right holder in order to safeguard public interests or the legitimate rights and interests of the portrait right holder. By exposing his video, Mr. Jiang obviously hopes to draw social attention to the phenomenon of domestic violence and jointly protect the rights of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a step back, even if Hu believes that his rights and interests have been violated, he should protect his rights and interests through legal means such as litigation, rather than through improper means such as making trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu made trouble in the restaurant many times. However, the police station did not hold him accountable. Instead, through mediation, Mr. Jiang was asked to compensate 10,000 yuan for mental damages and medical expenses. This move not only chilled Mr. Jiang&#39;s heart, but also sent a wrong signal: If illegal acts can be resolved through mediation, or even reverse compensation can be obtained, wouldn&#39;t it condone more people&#39;s willful behavior? In this way, the law loses its majesty and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a law enforcement agency, it should be based on the law, focus on protecting the rights and interests of minors and the courageous behavior of citizens, and have zero tolerance for illegal activities, so as to form a legal deterrent and guide social atmosphere. Improve the quality of citizens through legal education. Regrettably, the police station allowed the parties’ emotions to influence the outcome of the case, acquiescing to the woman’s behavior of “getting more and more unreasonable”. Such mediation is inconsistent with legal principles. Netizens generally questioned this mediation and expressed their simple view of justice. Law enforcement agencies should re-investigate the matter and hold the offenders accountable, rather than letting those who bravely act for justice lose money and jobs. Only in this way can people&#39;s faith in judicial authority not be damaged. After all, the majesty and credibility of the law are often reflected in the daily actions of law enforcers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如果你导弹打得不够准，是因为你人靠得不够近丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257374]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdvQehIu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdv QehIu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251331&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 13, 2023, Sevastopol, Crimea region, Smoke billowed out from the attacked shipyard &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ukrainian news said that the Ukrainian military In the early morning of September 13, 2023, 10 missiles and 3 unmanned boats launched an attack on the Sevastopol military base in the Crimean Peninsula, causing a fire at the Sevastopol Shipyard and two ships under repair were damaged. The losses include the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#39;s Ropcha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot; and the Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; which cost up to US$300 million and was commissioned in 2014. Rostov-on-Don). Satellite images of the scene showed that the two ships were severely damaged and were extremely difficult and expensive to repair. Considering that such a project was difficult to complete under the wartime system, they basically had to be scrapped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russia also admitted that it was attacked by Ukrainian missiles and that some ships were damaged. The situation announced by both sides basically confirmed the results of this attack. This is the largest loss suffered by the Black Sea Fleet since the sinking of the flagship Moskva after the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also sets a record for the first time in history that a submarine is hit by a missile. What’s even more amazing is that just two days after this attack, Ukraine announced that it had used missiles and drones to attack the S-400 air defense missile system on the Crimean Peninsula. This system has always been considered the strongest in Russia. Currently in active air defense weapons, Turkey even had tense relations with the United States and NATO in order to purchase this system. This time, it was beheaded by Ukraine behind enemy lines in actual combat, which was shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of continuous attacks with a combination of punches is obviously not the result of an accident, but a joint military operation between the Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense, in which the actions of the Ukrainian special forces can be said to be indispensable. without. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before launching the missile attack, that is, on September 11, the Ukrainian intelligence agency announced that the special forces had successfully seized two offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in the Black Sea and successfully removed Russian equipment from the platforms. military installations. The map shows that the two platforms captured by the Ukrainian special forces are about fifty kilometers away from the Crimean coastline. The Russian army has set up air and sea warning radars on them to control the Black Sea area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This attack did not attract much attention from domestic public opinion. Some media even believed that it was a political show after Ukraine’s counterattack failed, because the battle to seize the two platforms was not fierce and not too big. military value. However, in my opinion, the battle to seize the sea platform is the prelude to this attack, because Ukraine does not have stealth fighter equipment that can penetrate the enemy&#39;s air defense network, so it must try to shorten the reaction time of the opponent&#39;s air defense weapons, and these two This platform happens to be Russia&#39;s peripheral observation point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the start of the 2003 Iraq War, the U.S. military used special forces to successfully seize three Iraqi offshore drilling platforms in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it is to prevent Iraq from dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and polluting the environment like it did during the Gulf War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the operation that year, in addition to the British and American special forces, the Polish Thunder Special Task Force also assumed the offensive mission of a platform. This kind of battle to seize maritime platforms is referred to as VBSS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Visit, board, search and seize&lt;/span>;) in the field of special operations. VBSS The mission is often only accomplished by elite maritime special operations units. The complexity of such operations lies in the fact that it involves combat maneuvers from underwater to the surface, and also includes extremely close indoor combat. It not only requires a large amount of pre-war reconnaissance, but also requires a large amount of targeted actual combat training by operational units before they can make up their minds to implement it. This kind of maritime point-taking operation generally cannot be just a political statement mission, because the risks and costs are too high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the missile attack two days later that Ukraine&#39;s action to seize the Black Sea drilling platform is only part of its huge action plan. In fact, the follow-up actions are the key to victory. After the submarine and landing ship were attacked by missiles, Ukraine launched a missile attack one day later. The battle rhythm seemed not compact enough. But in fact, the U.S. special forces did not delay after seizing the platform. Another attack team quietly landed on the Crimean Peninsula under the cover of night, approached the submarines and landing ships in the shipyard, and used thermal imaging Shoot it from multiple angles. After the attack, these latent special operations personnel conducted reconnaissance and assessment of the bombing effects before quietly withdrawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because air-launched missile attacks involve issues with the angle of incidence, it is necessary to construct a three-dimensional image of the target, and the inspection needs to confirm its radar information or thermal imaging information, all of which require multi-angle technical reconnaissance. The United States may be able to rely on its powerful satellite and reconnaissance aircraft platforms for reconnaissance. For Ukraine, which lacks technical reconnaissance means, using special forces or covert operators to conduct close reconnaissance is a good alternative. And even for a country like the United States with strong technical reconnaissance capabilities, close-in reconnaissance by special forces is still one of the optional methods. For example, during the Gulf War, the United States sent multiple special operations teams into Iraq in order to find Iraqi Scud missiles. Conduct close reconnaissance from the rear. In addition, for collecting the signal characteristics of enemy air defense weapons, deploying special operations personnel for close detection is also a very feasible method, because with only a set of signal receivers, these lurking personnel can obtain the spectrum information of surrounding warning radars for a long time , and can also obtain more comprehensive signal intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that the emergence of drones can replace special operations personnel, but in fact it is people, not machines, who win wars. Only when the quality of people matches technical means can we defeat powerful opponents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10人遇难，强龙卷风突袭江苏后，救灾与保险赔付正进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257406]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/d0f40bac84.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d0f40bac84. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, the scene of the tornado disaster in Nancai Township, Suqian City.
