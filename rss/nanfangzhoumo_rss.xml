His unscrupulous self-exposure is due to his background in military life and his arrogant nature, just like his unbridled poetry and prose. At the same time, it also presents the true ecology of this special group of cadres&#39; children in the long river of history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border -box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The beginning of chaos&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Kashgar in early October , next to Ustang Boyi Road, a thousand-year-old street in Id Kah, musical instrument shops and carpet shops selling hot wapu and tambourines are lined up, and the craftsmen making copper pots are clanging and banging, surrounded by black The vat where the stove is brewing&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sheep&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The meat is sizzling. With the heat, the fragrance spreads far and wide. The tourists who flock here will definitely not let go of these antiques. They either raise their mobile phones to take pictures, or they want to eat two vats of meat, fresh and hot. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Forty-six years ago, Zhou Tao, a college student in Xinjiang, never imagined that a place he thought was a &quot;purgatory&quot; would now become a place of fascination and curiosity for inland tourists. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;When I heard that I was assigned here, my legs were weak. It&#39;s over, I collapsed.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before decentralization Although he had experienced the &quot;baptism&quot; of starving and carrying food on the Yili farm in the past 26 years, he always regarded himself as a son of cadres and his life was definitely going up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This earth-yellow town completely buried his blueprint with its loneliness and indifference. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The crowded Uyghur residential areas are all built with adobe and wood... The houses are like beehives, the roads are like spider webs, and the civil buildings are all yellow. You clearly walked in, but there were very few people around, you couldn&#39;t hear anyone&#39;s voice, and the doors facing the street were all closed, as if you had walked into an empty and silent mountain forest alone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It&#39;s like this every day. Ji Shuteng rides a bicycle from here to work at the prefectural committee and goes out under the city wall. From the gate of Daluo Dam, ride through the narrow dirt road on the side of the dam, pass through the road next to Abdul Kerim Street, then pass through the clanking streets of Ustangbuyi Street, and come to the cement-paved main street. On the spacious road, the car went straight down and arrived at the prefectural committee compound where he worked. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——&quot;Journey to the West&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;In the spring of 2018, 72-year-old Zhou Tao finally completed the autobiographical novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; in his attic. He originally named it &quot;The Beginning of Chaos&quot; to refer to the confusion of young people during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; who could not see the way forward. One day before the publication of &quot;Contemporary&quot;, he suddenly realized that when he and his companions were sent to a remote place, they were on the way to the west: and &quot;the west is the place where the sun sets, the place where snow accumulates, and the way to the west.&quot; It is a road with dusk clouds hanging low like a curtain, and people&#39;s hearts are always curled up in their chests. No one knows what void they will step on next. Maybe, if you are not careful, you will fall from the edge of the earth.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/e041c1723aae44d699deeaaa33e04203.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 863&quot; height=&quot;1265&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/e041c1723aae44d699deeaaa33e04203.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257101&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the book, he wrote about the career of Qu Ming, a &quot;revolutionary scholar&quot; who had ideals before and led the city later. Cheng Zhimin, the &quot;perfect political loach&quot;, and decent Uyghur cadres like Simayi Ahematijiang have described the origins of power factions and the law of the jungle in Kashgar, a border area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The main character in the book, Ji Shuteng, is handsome, has poetry and books in his belly, is arrogant, conforms to the customs at heart, is strong on the outside but is incapable of fighting the outside world politically. His ability, eyesight and life are all dependent on his wife. It is difficult for readers who know a little about the author to think: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Is this Zhou Tao himself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Literary critic and editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s Liberation Army Literature and Art&quot; Yin Shi saw the manuscript for the first time and was shocked. It was so direct! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“There was a lot of scar literature in the 1980s that exposed the problems of the era. Most of them were complaints from victims. When writing about a character or event, there seemed to be hidden dissatisfaction and slightness. The protest carries a very subtle criticism, but it is not clear and does not describe specific political life, political tasks, or political beliefs. When writing about the so-called villain, do not go deep into his heart. It&#39;s just a symbol.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yin Shi pointed out that in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Qu Ming, who went to Yan&#39;an to study Lu Yi as a teenager and received a red education, was in the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; During this period, he became a speculator and the strategist behind Cheng Qiang, hoping for the success of another &quot;revolution&quot; and a new distribution of interests. This was the main reason why Ji Shuteng gradually got rid of Qu Ming&#39;s influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao also wrote about the inner thoughts of Cheng Qiang, a &quot;rebel&quot; from a peasant background, his judgment of the political trends at the top, and his heroic and loyal to his inner beliefs. Method of suicide. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ji Shuteng didn’t like Cheng Qiang, but when Cheng Qiang became a prisoner, he was not happy at all. Cheng Qiang almost committed suicide by jumping off a cliff, which made him even more upset. He was shocked. &quot;He can&#39;t see others in trouble, just like he can&#39;t tolerate anyone being domineering... He loves freedom and advocates equality. Ji Shuteng also gradually sees another side of his nature. One person or some people bully or insult another person or some people, and This is not an ordinary thing, this is the kind of very horrific behavior; once this kind of thing begins, persecution, abuse, killing and destruction will follow.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; During their eight years in Kashgar, Qu Ming and Cheng Qiang shaped Ji Shuteng in his conduct as a person, and he was eventually surpassed by him. However, Ji Shuteng did not escape the more terrifying mental terror and spiritual torture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ji Shuteng was reported because he expressed his inner thoughts about his leader in a casual chat. Ji Shuteng started to write a review, and he immediately felt like a deflated rubber ball. He wrote in the examination that he must be &quot;reborn&quot; and so on, but he didn&#39;t want to actually shed his skin like a snake. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt, it doesn&#39;t hurt at all, just feel free to peel it off, it&#39;ll be fine!&quot; ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(wife) Zhuang Yan took off a piece and put it aside for him to see. He took off another large piece, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s such a big piece!&quot; He turned his face and saw that it was as big as half a tabloid. It was a piece of white paper with a tough texture. He said, &quot;Don&#39;t throw it away. It&#39;s better to put it in the paper.&quot; It says inspection directly on it. Human skin inspection is more profound than what’s on the manuscript paper!”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;—— &quot;Journey to the West&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to meet the distortion of history, people can even dehumanize themselves and cater to the atrocities of natural forces. Yin Shi believes that despite flaws in writing techniques and character creation, &quot;Journey to the West&quot; has the value of a &quot;scientific investigation report on human nature&quot; by unabashedly revealing the inner thoughts and showing the ups and downs and thoughts of cadres&#39; children. &quot;For a quasi-second-generation official like Zhou Tao, spiritual autobiography and documentary value are the first step, and self-examination is a further requirement.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/7dc37dba640ff1da5d7f0082e3868018.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;824&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/7dc37dba640ff1da5d7f0082e3868018.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257105&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;If you combine &quot;Journey to the West&quot; with Zhou Tao&#39;s autobiographical oral record &quot;A Man and Xinjiang&quot; published a few years ago, you can better understand the extent of this &quot;self-exposure&quot;. Among the latter, he spoke freely, peeling away the ridiculousness and patheticness of his father and family, as well as his own embarrassment, ugliness, and the dark side of human nature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such an individual is undoubtedly far removed from the traditional Chinese gentleman and Confucian scholar. It seemed that he was determined to tear off those masks that he had to keep and care about before he reached his seventies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/f37d4fae1864a9506df6526b7ff2e059.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 734&quot; height=&quot;984&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/f37d4fae1864a9506df6526b7ff2e059.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257104&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The descendants of cadres in Xinjiang in the 1960s, the one from the right in the front row Zhou Tao&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;A deep sense of superiority&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In After eight years in the ancient city of Kashgar, Zhou Tao finally had the opportunity to go to the Urumqi Military Region to engage in literary creation. After the troubled times, God gave him the most suitable arrangement for him who was both civil and military. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The rest of his life seems to prove that he has been on a smooth road since then. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao who left Kashgar, like Ji Shuteng in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, had no nostalgia for the yellow land where he had lived for a long time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Why are you so unsympathetic? The answer is: This is not my place in the first place.&quot; He believes that wherever a person grows up before the age of 18, that place will become His eternal home. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before the age of 9, Zhou Tao lived in Beijing. Before receiving re-education in Yili and being transferred to Kashgar, he lived with his parents in Urumqi - clearly &quot;higher&quot; than southern Xinjiang in his eyes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sense of superiority is innate. The first is appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has been born with white skin and big eyes since he was a child. Among the dolls with foreign children, he is also the most eye-catching one. The whole Zhou family has fair skin. He once asked his aunt, what is grandpa like? My aunt said, &quot;Your grandfather can&#39;t be compared to any of you. He&#39;s so handsome.&quot; Zhou Tao felt that his family&#39;s bloodline should be mixed, because his hometown in Yushe, Shanxi, is a mixed race area, &quot;where the Xiongnu, Qiang, and Jiedi gather.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xiao Qiao, a military writer who is nearly 10 years younger than him, said that Zhou Tao was born with a &quot;face and figure that make people doubt God&#39;s favoritism. Coupled with his humor, cunning, quick reactions and sharp words, This kind of person can easily make people jealous and at the same time create a desire for friendship.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beyond the skin, family background is the foundation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao’s father, Zhou Wenjie, participated in the Shanxi Anti-Japanese Youth Death Team in his early years&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;The non-party groups at that time were actually anti-Japanese groups led by the Communist Party. They later became regular troops&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, engaged in mass work, served as cultural teachers, and later became Chen Geng&#39;s subordinates. During the founding ceremony of the People&#39;s Republic of China, Zhou Wenjie, a battalion-level cadre, stood in the first row below the Tiananmen Gate. Later, he was admitted to the army as a diplomat and was assigned to the School of Foreign Languages. Before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he was a cadre at the fourteenth level. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao’s primary school classmates include many children of senior cadres. A sense of superiority was invisibly injected into Zhou Tao&#39;s mind during his childhood. He remembered that when his younger brother was born, the hospital made egg fried rice for his mother at noon. She refused to eat it and gave it to 4-year-old Zhou Tao. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of 4, Zhou Tao was standing on a hillside in Haidian District, just in time for work in the morning. He felt like a general. &quot;Looking at the gray, blue and black crowds of people under my feet, I suddenly felt a sense of superiority in my heart.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao will remember this idea throughout his life. Strange: &quot;How could such an idea come to mind at such a young age?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;That idea was the bud from the foundation of his thoughts throughout his life. The buds grow and are associated with him throughout his life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His classmate Zhao Nan once saw a beggar on the street and said, what if we end up in this situation one day? Zhou Tao replied: &quot;Even if we are reduced to this point, others will look different when we stand.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Many revolutionary children have that sense of superiority. In fact, compared to this Judging from decades of history, it is very superficial. The concept of &#39;the world&#39; is also very decadent.&quot; Yin Shi said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao was not aware of it. He wrote about the pride and stubbornness of Ji Shuteng&#39;s class in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There is a little guy who is only in the third grade of elementary school and can memorize the names, positions, and military ranks of dozens of marshals, ten generals, and more than sixty generals. The man was surprised and asked: &quot;Then what kind of general can you be when you grow up?&quot; The answer was: &quot;At least a general.&quot; When he grew up to sixteen or seventeen years old, he became more and more handsome, talented in sports and arts, just like the revolutionary career of his father&#39;s generation. There really is some kind of blood inheritance. But after entering society, most of them cannot adapt. ...As for the spiritual legacy of the Chinese revolution: the pursuit of social equality and the new culture of advocating altruism, they have completely disappeared. There is no doubt that Ji Shuteng himself is one of these people. He knows very well that he was &quot;fed by strictly selected food.&quot; He is also convinced: &quot;This is exactly how our generation is full of ambitions.&quot; Faith grows like a stone, water cannot be poured into it, needles cannot penetrate it, and it is difficult for anything else to penetrate into our minds.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Among such a group of stubborn leaders with high vision, Zhou Tao&#39;s unruly attitude is even more prominent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As evidenced by his father’s memories: “When Tao was fourteen or fifteen years old, he loved horseback riding and bicycle riding. Once, he went to Nanshan with a party school cadre and rode a Kazakh horse alone. The horse galloped on the mountain road, and the witnesses were horrified. The leader yelled and cursed before stopping.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has good physical fitness and once won the Xinjiang college men&#39;s table tennis singles championship. . But when I was in junior high school, I went to Beijing for a year of training, and I didn’t want to do it anymore. I deliberately trampled the ball and threw the racket on the wall. &quot;I felt particularly awkward after the head coach asked me to change the crossboard, because my personality is offensive rather than defensive. If I was asked to play defense, I wouldn&#39;t want to. If I didn&#39;t want to, I would destroy it and quit.&quot;&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although he is unrestrained and youthful, he also has a way of assessing the situation that is different from his peers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of fourteen or fifteen, he already understood that playing table tennis would not accomplish anything. It&#39;s not about physical condition or mind, it&#39;s about starting too late. &quot;If I were to be in Beijing, I would definitely join the national team. The conditions are sufficient.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is another thing that he doesn&#39;t mind. Wu Guomei, a middle school Chinese teacher, gave Zhou Tao a score of 95 for his composition and gave him great encouragement. Other students regarded note-taking as a chore, but he was the only one who found joy in taking notes. &quot;Why did I win as soon as I wrote prose? Because I had written it a long time ago, and the ten notebooks are prose.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Literature is talent, and it is also Zhou Tao&#39;s upward path. The clearest one. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;869&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257103&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1965, Zhou Tao won the Xinjiang college student table tennis singles championship&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border- box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;An Inhuman Year&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《Twenty &quot;Four Ploughshares&quot; was often requested by Zhou Tao to be placed at the top of his collection of essays, which shows that he attached great importance to this article. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;That came from the year he received re-education at Yili 9901 Farm. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When we went there, everyone sat in a big sedan and sang along the way, such as &quot;Prairie Pastoral&quot; and &quot;Red Plum Blossoms on the Red Rocks&quot;. There was constant laughter and laughter, and everyone was full of joy.

What&#39;s the difference between you and labor reform prisoners? There are no distinctions between men and women, and all of them are in tatters. The horse pens are covered with straw, and rats are running overhead in the middle of the night, killing some people. My ear was bitten off.&quot; The arrogant and ruthless instructor refused to allow the sick students to see a doctor.

The water is biting and his hands are red from the cold, but he will not give up until he rinses away the last bit of soap suds; he also thinks of the man who used to wear a military officer&#39;s uniform. People who wore uniforms, then Chinese tunic suits, cadre uniforms, and finally put on peasant black cotton-padded jackets; and thought of my father who was once graceful, then solemn, and finally became old and confused and became what he is now. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In prose, he blamed himself for always underestimating his father because of his failures in reality, ignoring his essential qualities as a person. of excellent quality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Paradoxically, from the way he speaks to the way he walks, from his body shape and facial features, to his habits and soul, no matter whether the social environment is favorable or unfavorable, he can never get rid of the influence his father injects into him. the genetics in one’s own body. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later he realized that if his father did not suddenly appear, he would probably continue along the life trajectory of a Wuling prince, until one day he suddenly discovered I have been left far behind by the changes in society. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The temperament has also been restrained. &quot;After his misfortune, I kept a low profile.

Five or six years ago, Marvin had eye surgery and his vision was almost zero. He usually wears sunglasses at home. Whether communicating with Zhou Tao or outsiders, he has his own aura. Zhou Tao injured his ear when he was shot when he was young. Now he needs to wear a hearing aid to talk to people. The backbone of the family can be seen at a glance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Sitting in the bright courtyard of the Urumqi Army Community, Zhou Tao cherishes his wife&#39;s kindness. &quot;She may have done it. She takes care of the inside and outside of the house. Don&#39;t look at her bad eyesight, she understands everything. She cut down all the trees in my yard and replaced them with crabapples and pomegranates. , dates, apricots, peaches, everything grows smoothly.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although Zhou Tao is crazy, he understands his shortcomings. He is outgoing and open-minded, but when encountering sudden setbacks, he easily becomes confused. The wife is not like that, she can always remain calm. &quot;I know how to look at myself, not others. Marvin is good at recognizing people, good and bad. She can see clearly. Her ability to do things is outstanding among women.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Marvin is also open to fame and fortune. Zhou Tao said that he had enough conditions to retire and move to Beijing, and the army could arrange a house for him. &quot;Mrs. Ma didn&#39;t go. She said she was staying in Xinjiang. She is determined and not easily swayed by vanity.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, after the autobiography was published, a lot of people A female military writer couldn&#39;t hold back her anger and wrote an article criticizing Zhou Tao for giving up love and choosing the &quot;most suitable&quot; one&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;the safest, The women who do not cause trouble&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; become partners, using the rhetoric of &quot;Chinese men&#39;s traditional &#39;ugly wife and thin hot bed&#39;&quot;, and finally summarizes and utilitarianizes the two women. Sexual judgment is tantamount to denying one&#39;s own guilt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao did not respond at all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Have you shown the description in the autobiography to Teacher Marvin?&quot; I asked him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;No.&quot; Zhou Tao smiled.

Relying on his literary talent and his relationship with his father, he successfully transferred to the Military Region Creative Office in Urumqi and concentrated on making a living through literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When writers Cao Yu and Xu Chi went to Xinjiang in August 1978, after reading Zhou Tao&#39;s poem &quot;North and South of Tianshan&quot;, they praised at a symposium that &quot;it is sentimental and interesting. real poetry&quot;. Zhou Tao was caught off guard by this great news and thought of Liu Shaotang, the former &quot;prodigy writer&quot; who sparked his literary dream. &quot;The teacher in high school was telling his story &quot;The Green Mule&quot; on the podium. He&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(Liu Shaotang)&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;Sitting in class with classmates and listening to lectures. What a feeling that must be!&quot; When I was 30 years old, I met an expert who appreciated me, and I felt happy in my heart. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next two or three years became the explosive period of Zhou Tao&#39;s poetry. Xiao Qiao remembers that almost every two days in 1981, a new poem by Zhou Tao would gush out of magma from the ground. &quot;Look at their dates, they are as dense as the footprints left by poets when they go out every day!&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao once collaborated with Yang Mu and Zhang Deyi to create &quot;New Frontier Poetry&quot;, It is not about war, but about reflecting the unique features of the Xinjiang region. For a time, their names occupied the pages of &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;, &quot;People&#39;s Literature&quot;, and &quot;Shanghai Literature&quot; one after another, and they were at the forefront of the literary trend. Liu Xiaowu, chairman of the Xinjiang Federation of Literary and Art Circles, objected to this on the grounds that &quot;frontier poems were originally about conquering the northwest, but now Xinjiang is part of the motherland, who are you going to conquer?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wait After starting to write hazy poetry, Zhou Tao once gave himself a direction - &quot;Guo Xiaochuan&#39;s voice, Wen Jie&#39;s color&quot;, but found that this combination &quot;doesn&#39;t work very well&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/0e32231c9649e4b49505957342ee2a0b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 984&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/0e32231c9649e4b49505957342ee2a0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257108&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1984, three military writers were at Kunming Airport, preparing to take a flight The helicopter flew to Laoshan.

At first, he even told writers who had not gone up the mountain about the dangers of going up the mountain to scare them; later, he witnessed with his own eyes soldiers who were blinded by Vietnamese army mines. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After getting used to it, the soldiers can sleep well at night. &quot;The helmets were lying beside the pillows, and their faces were sleeping like sculptures. They were all people who escaped from the hands of death.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Tiantian and Soldiers They ate and slept together and became familiar with each other. Zhou Tao did not hear any heroic words from their mouths. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;How does it feel to fight? The soldier said, &quot;It&#39;s so scary when the enemy&#39;s shells are covering it. I wish I could crawl under the ground and climb up quickly, regardless of my posture. There&#39;s no way to express the terror. It&#39;s absolutely irresistible to human will. If you can escape, That&#39;s pretty good.&quot; Zhou Tao imagined that it would be the same when our artillery fire covered the other side. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He wrote a long poem of 2,000 lines, &quot;Mountains, Mountains, Jungles.&quot; The poem not only contains the cruelty of war, but also has a writing perspective that transcends victory, defeat and cause and effect: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;“有点遗憾。被莫名其妙地忽略了。如果这首诗能在《人民文学》这样的刊物全文刊出，影响会很大的。”殷实等多位评论家和好友为周涛抱不平。作者自己倒是想开了，“写得太容易，很随便。只是在本子上开始写着玩，后来越写越长，一字没改，别人都不相信。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛说过，他惟一的敌人就是自己。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;写诗写得兴高采烈，但他对自己的要求是：我的诗，达到全国&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（顶尖）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;水平，就不写了。果不其然，他40岁生日那天得了全国奖，他便觉得，自己的诗歌生涯也到了头。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;下一个要攻的山头？散文吧。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛认为自己的贡献和独到在于“解放散文”：散文的写作“重要的不是化验和肢解，而是感受和拥抱”，他不喜欢“研究”，更愿意漫无边际地遐想、悠思、品味，所以他不在乎开头的突兀，不关心上下段的过渡和照应，而是以诗的逻辑、结构和笔法去写散文。他甚至口出狂言，“散文没有章法。我就是章法。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;于是在周涛的文字里，种种记忆、思想、情感和想象奔涌交汇，如越过堤岸的河水，在无际的草地上四处蔓延。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他反感“游山玩水”的说法，认为那只是“把山和水当作精神意义上的妓女罢了”。在名作《巩乃斯的马》里，他把观赏马的气韵、筋骨当成艺术享受；在《猛禽》里，他聚焦一只与老狼搏斗、利爪分别深陷于老狼骨缝和树干最后被奔跑的狼撕裂的鹰；在《过河》里，惊叹年逾八旬的瘦弱的哈萨克族老太太竟制服了不肯过河的烈马……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;无论是神山或者野马，或是人，在周涛激昂豪放的表达中，总会浮现出强烈的“夫子自况”色彩，自认强大并与强者引为同类的惺惺相惜。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/869c4630e5db9b2e0e06a7b6a78217b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;828&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/869c4630e5db9b2e0e06a7b6a78217b2.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;虽然二十多年前已有上述认识，但自那之后，他急切言说思想的习惯，至今未改。 《西行记》里依然可见一斑。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛的身上聚集着天之骄子的自得与时代笼罩在头上、害怕“丧失既得”的恐惧；他迷恋文学，以为它自由、公平，不像政治那样复杂。 20年前，以散文集首获鲁迅文学奖，他却没去领奖。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;原因？ “文学各种奖项和我心目中想象的距离太大。奖要公正，不能鱼目混珠，泥沙俱下，不能撒胡椒面，要奖给那些最值得奖励的人，不管那个人是谁，也许不是我。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他说曾经的80年代，民族目标明确，人人充满希望，整个时代是《祝酒歌》所渲染的情绪。但90年代初，他无可避免地产生了虚无的情绪，游离于社会，不再那么直接。 《博尔塔拉冬天的惶惑》，便写于那样的状态之下——然而读懂的人，终是少数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——《西行记》&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这让我想起周涛80年代创作的长篇散文《哈拉沙尔随笔》。在那篇文章里，他从同行人干裂的嘴唇，联想到多半个世纪以前，马仲英的回族兵和霍加·尼牙孜的维吾尔人血战，而今，往事遗迹却被干渴的北方之唇&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;无水的山沟&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;吃光了。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他在生活在焉耆的这支回族人身上，看到一种并非人人都能感到的“百年孤独”：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;隐忍、沉默的后面藏着可怕的强悍；怀疑、狡黠的不信任的目光后面有着最真诚的诺言和舍命相陪的友谊；屈辱的自卑感和深藏于心的强大自尊心的矛盾造成的痛苦；不被理解却又顽强地要保存自己所形成的隔阂；边远、贫困的落后生活方式与心比天高的自信力之间的大反差所导致的悲哀和固执心理，就造成了这种百年孤独。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他提出，“中华民族的历史不仅仅是汉族的历史，历代帝王、名臣、保国有功的武将中就不知有多少是少数民族。 ”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这样的着墨和观点，在他几十年的丰盛书写里，并不多见。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;和他有忘年之交的殷实犀利地指出他的问题：“他对新疆这片土地，对维吾尔族等少数民族表达得仍然不够。周涛在这点上也表达了一个汉人的精明。他没有从语言、从经典、从世俗文化，方方面面——他没有深入新疆。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在刚刚写就的《西行记》分析里，殷实直言：“如果他们每一个人&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（主角）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的内在世界，也都可以像姬书藤一样展开，特别是，如果对那个维吾尔族人物司马义·艾合买提江的个人精神世界、文化性格乃至民族属性，有深入挖掘和呈示的话，那么这部作品中的众声喧哗，包括不同&#39;声音&#39;之间的对话，将会构成多么巨大的张力。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;为何无法展开？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“语言障碍是一，不敢再真实下去是二。只能到此为止。 ”周涛回答我。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他表达过对张承志的钦佩，却也坦言后者在信仰上走向了极致。事实上，周涛在大学的专业正是维吾尔语，但不到半年，高等教育之路便被伊犁“再教育”拦腰截断。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;而他表达懊恼叹惜的角度是：“假如学完了四年维语，到南疆哪个公社当书记，再当县一级干部，对民族关系、人事各个方面了解多一些、再进入历史的研究和民族的考察，就可能组织长篇小说。但那半年我没有多大兴趣学维语，看不到这么远。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他在心理上很靠近哈萨克这样的草原民族，自比为“一个习惯了毡房和羊肉、热爱着草原和纵马的半游牧者”。而对生长于斯的新疆，他自认此地为故土，却也始终是以中原文化的根脉来观察和体验。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在文学评论者韦器闳看来，周涛极少描写市井生活，也不以表现百姓的喜怒哀乐和审美趣味为己任，而是极力张扬自己个人化的人生体验。于是他的写作也呈现出一种“贵族化”的倾向。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/97d629aae0ecf1617113532ed8d97452.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;回顾这大半生，周涛说自己介乎文武之间：生在军队里是武，这是打的底色；读书上学是文；当运动员从武；回来读书上学喜欢文学又从文：从文以后最终又跑到兵营里从文了。“可以说文不成武不就，也可以说文武两道都在滋养你，也都在制约你；制约也是滋养。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;到老，他在部队文职干部中算最高级别，享受军级待遇。反而是操持了一辈子的母亲，听到儿子涛说，“妈，我快当将军了”，回了一句，“你一天仗也没打过，当什么将军？ ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“喀什的八年教会你什么呢？ ”我问他。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他答：“不是你天生就怎么样，你那些个人的条件都必须在一个社会的大势之下才能得以施展和表现，否则一文不值。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“你是宿命论者？ ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他点头。“人各有命，运是社会给你的可能性。有胆无识是&#39;二杆子&#39;，有识无胆是书呆子。有胆识，还有运，才可能成大事。我和马文？不是运，是命。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在全家被政治运动分崩离析的年代里，他发出诘问：“从一个个由家庭中诞生出来的自在的少年，到成为被社会和自身条件嵌入某一职业的成人，命运啊，你将怎么打发我们？是对我们格外垂青呢还是特别冷漠？对后一种可能，我们当时是不愿意设想也不可能接受的。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;时光过去了50年，谜底完全揭开了。让他无限惊奇的是，今天的谜底，当初已经不断向他显示。他始终相信，那时候，一切都已注定。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

has ended. The rating is not high, but the popularity is not low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is adapted from the farming novel &quot;The Rebirth of a Little Landlord&quot;: a modern girl, Lian Maner, wanders into the ancient countryside and becomes a peasant girl. Together with the mysterious man Shen Nuo, she battles wits and courage with her best relatives to seek justice for her cowardly &quot;parents&quot;. Under limited conditions, he worked hard to get rich and worked hard. He gained not only his farming career but also his love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The secret behind the popularity of &quot;Tian Geng Ji&quot; is just two words - farming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/c7495f4ccca4d14862ab7149f37acf14.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/c7495f4ccca4d14862ab7149f37acf14.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256834&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Among the online articles that emphasize fast pace and strong narrative, farming articles that focus on stable happiness appear to be somewhat unique. The development of farming literature is divided into three stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born out of SLG (strategy) games in the early days, the protagonist, like the player, recruits troops and horses in a different world, completes tasks, and develops the economy or agriculture with the purpose of &quot;building walls high, accumulating food widely, and becoming king slowly&quot; , and continue to expand its own power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The middle period focuses on the literal meaning, allowing the protagonist to make a fortune in feudal society, and the narrative style becomes warm and peaceful. In addition to &quot;Rebirth of a Little Landlord&quot;, the original work of &quot;Tian Geng Ji&quot;, popular novels such as &quot;Daily Life of Farming and Raising Children in Ancient Mountain Houses&quot; and &quot;I Sell Hotpot in the Song Dynasty&quot; also belong to the category of farming literature in this period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The style of farming literature and painting in the later period is clear&lt;/span>; Strange. It integrates infinite flow, fantasy, suspense and other factors based on the basic thinking of &quot;farming&quot; to achieve the fusion of genres. For example, &quot;After rebirth as the Dragon King, I make a fortune from seafood&quot;, &quot;I rely on farming to save mankind in the interstellar world&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we want to find &lt;span>; a source for farming literature in traditional literature, then the closest source is local literature. Both of them focus on the rural landscape, but the background of rural literature is thick and usually carries narratives of suffering, while farming literature is written in a light and soothing vacuum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/49e2fb8f4e551fbc1fb45b218c4791fe.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/49e2fb8f4e551fbc1fb45b218c4791fe.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256831 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The road to film and television adaptation of Zhongtian novels has been relatively bumpy. Compared with other web novels with strong conflicts and many reversals, it is actually&lt;/span>; not that suitable for being adapted. onto the screen. What are now being adapted into &quot;farming dramas&quot; are generally medium-term farming dramas that are slow and steady, and are less difficult to shoot than early farming dramas and later farming dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chef Fang Holding a Pot in the Flower Room&quot; and &quot;&lt;span>;The Sparkling Chef in the World&quot; are relatively successful examples. There are no grudges or resentments, and they only revolve around women pursuing careers. The protagonist unfolds a small incision narrative. Both dramas weakened the farming attributes, amplified the food elements, and used delicious dishes to evoke the audience&#39;s empathetic experience. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/79d11908058c277cff63481c61f129db.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/79d11908058c277cff63481c61f129db.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256832 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The annual hit drama &quot;Do you know whether it should be green, fat, red and thin&quot; is adapted from the farming novel of the same name, which tells the story of Sheng Minglan, the concubine of the Sheng family, who uses her intelligence and talent to succeed in the big family. A story of surviving and overcoming the many challenges of life. The drama version deletes the time-travel elements in the original work, making the heroine&#39;s logic of acting according to the rules in a feudal society with strict hierarchies and distinctions between descendants and concubines more consistent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Do You Know&quot; while weakening the farming elements, highlights the family fighting and business elements, and enhances the dramatic conflicts. There was a discussion around the concubines of Da Niangzi, Lin Xiaoniang and Mo Lan.

If you click on any idol drama, you can get handsome men and beautiful women falling in love in any era and any industry; it is so annoying. Relatives who will not pay for their lives have also watched a lot of costume dramas and urban dramas in recent years, so it is inevitable that they feel the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that &quot;Tian Geng Ji&quot; was ultimately popular for the seemingly insipid farming line, rather than anything else. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can&#39;t help but be reminiscent of &quot;Farming&quot;, a phenomenal variety show in the first half of this year. 10 young guests spent 190 days on 142 acres of land. of sowing and harvesting. Maybe even they themselves didn&#39;t expect that there would be so many viewers willing to watch them farming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/97ce23d7460c454ac135cfad19543d0e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/97ce23d7460c454ac135cfad19543d0e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256837 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The nostalgia for farming is engraved in the DNA of the Chinese people. Ten years ago, the virtual vegetable growing game QQ Farm became very popular. Some people stayed up late at night and drove to see the sea. Some people got up early and went to bed early just to set the alarm clock and steal vegetables. Ten years later, people moved to WeChat farms, raising chickens, fish and pigeons in the status bar. Turn on your mobile phone, and all major e-commerce platforms have launched virtual services such as watering trees, planting trees, and operating orchards, and linked them to real benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chinese people, &quot;farming talent&quot; is an initial skill that can be obtained without &lt;span>; lighting it up. For thousands of years, Chinese society has been dominated by agricultural civilization, which has condensed the wisdom of the working people and given birth to a broad and profound Chinese culture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Tao Yuanming&#39;s poem &quot;Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Nanshan Mountain&quot; also symbolizes the Chinese people&#39;s pursuit and yearning for pastoral life. New. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Contemporary young people read Tao Yuanming and also pursue farming essays and farming dramas (comprehensive). If the utopian imagination constructed by the former is distant and ethereal, and somewhat unreal through the silk curtain of the times, then the comfort provided by the latter is within reach and approachable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/1f0b0900204242054072a0cdc952588e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/1f0b0900204242054072a0cdc952588e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256838 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the era of rapid development, everything&lt;/span>; is rushing forward like clockwork. Young people are rushing forward in the rapid current, but occasionally they also think about it. Take a breather after dinner and look for an emotional outlet. Therefore, slow-paced and beautiful farming dramas are an excellent way to relieve stress. And compared with radical entrepreneurial stories, farming also has a certain sense of security. Every time you work, you will gain, and the effort and reward are generally proportional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, Taiwanese health realism films had a binary opposition of urban or rural narratives, with implicit praise and blame in the beautiful rural scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, sixty years later, the &quot;farming flow&quot; actually also hides a certain creative tendency. The countryside is often a healing utopia, while the city is a heterotopia that confused young people want to escape from. . Through a small screen, urbanites can also become farmers remotely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the farming literature and farming dramas have shortcomings such as outdated narratives, stereotyped characters, and a slightly dull rhythm, they accurately hit a spreading and popular public sentiment. We might as well give them more room for growth, and I believe there will be more hits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贵人鸟转型卖吃的，国产运动鞋三巨头正在分岔路口]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259989]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/04/eaa4eb85be65a96bdaa301cfe2d17880.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;631&quot; height=&quot;841&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/04/eaa4eb85be65a96bdaa301cfe2d17880.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257037&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the most sought-after items in the fashion circle, the popularity of sneakers is receding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 22, Guirenniao issued an announcement stating that in view of the decline in revenue and continued losses of the sports shoes and apparel business since the judicial reorganization, and the increasingly fierce market competition, the company will end the sports shoes and apparel business that has been in business for 36 years.

A man in Shanxi broke off his engagement due to a temporary increase in the price of the bride&#39;s bride price, and used the bride price to resign and travel. On June 1 this year, Zhu set out with his luggage on his back. In five months, he visited more than 40 cities and spent more than 30,000 yuan. &quot;The main means of transportation are green trains, and it doesn&#39;t cost much to stay in a youth hostel.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu introduced that he and his girlfriend met through a blind date, &quot;We have been dating for almost eight or nine months, and I feel that When the time comes, we are ready to get married.” He said that a bride price of RMB 188,000 is the &quot;normal market&quot; in the local area. &quot;Ours is called a &#39;big package&#39;. This money includes wedding photos, three coins, etc. RMB 188,000. I have savings of RMB 168,000 and 2 I just borrowed it from a friend.&quot; Later, his girlfriend asked for an additional 30,000 yuan, &quot;I said I couldn&#39;t afford it, and I borrowed these from others,&quot; and they broke up after a quarrel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Frankly speaking, Zhu still hasn’t let go. Taking the green train and staying in a youth hostel, the five-month trip only cost more than 30,000 yuan, which is very economical. This is probably because this is the hard-earned money that I have saved and I don’t want to spend it lavishly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, he sympathizes with the hardships of his parents, saying: &quot;Every time I go on a blind date, I feel a little uncomfortable. I eat Haidilao with the girls, watch movies, etc., but my parents have never eaten Haidilao.&quot; &quot;Lao.&quot; His parents originally planned to help him pay the down payment for buying a house in Taiyuan. &quot;I also feel sorry for my parents. They have never been to many places and they are still thinking about buying me a house.&quot; I did not tell my parents about my resignation. &quot;I will tell you if I have the opportunity in the future, but I may not tell them for the time being. I am afraid that they will not accept it and say that I am not doing my job properly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that Zhu and his parents are both relatively traditional people in terms of values. They are down-to-earth, simple, have long-term considerations for life, and have a solemn attitude towards marriage and family. On the surface, 30,000 yuan was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back; in fact, Zhu was probably worried that once this case was opened, it would be endless in the future. The reason why his girlfriend asked for 30,000 yuan was that &quot;her best friends all paid back.&quot; In addition, I asked for another 30,000 yuan.&quot; There is no end to the comparison, and your married life may not be comfortable and harmonious in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, the origin of marriage or monogamy is: women have a 9-month pregnancy period, and there is a lactation period after the baby is born. It takes a long time for human children to reach adulthood, and It is necessary to acquire various survival skills, which requires a father&#39;s role to provide protection and survival resources for mother and child, and to teach his children through words and deeds; what men gain is to reduce the uncertainty of father and son (paternal uncertainty) through marriage, and to assume family responsibilities and social responsibility. The father in the sense is a product of cultural construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is Chinese or Western, traditional marriage values ​​and underlying logic are the same. However, after entering modern society, this set of values ​​was first impacted by individualism and then deconstructed by progressivism/postmodernism, making it increasingly unsustainable. Raising your own children gives you a continuous sense of gain and happiness, but it is indeed hard work, consumes money and effort, and also requires a sense of responsibility and the ability to delay gratification vs. spending money immediately to enjoy the present and carpe diem. Which one will the chic &quot;modern people&quot; choose? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, when some women complain about what they get from marriage, some men will also reflect on why they got married. When some women talk about having a boy or a girl and the so-called right of surname, they say to the man, &quot;Does your family have a throne to inherit?&quot; Some men will suddenly realize and ask themselves: There is indeed no throne in my family to inherit, so I will spend a lot of money. Is it worth getting married and going through all the hard work of raising children? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When more and more men and women ask &quot;What is the meaning of getting married, starting a family, and having children?&quot; this in itself means the weakening of the reproductive instinct and the decline of marriage and family values, which in turn means the value of the benefits of childbearing. Write down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, betrothal gifts are not the same thing as betrothal gifts in traditional society. Bride price is the price paid by lower-class men to enter the marriage market, but it has been rising and becoming more general in recent years. The marriage market is a regional and multi-level composite structure. The bottom market may have more men and fewer women, but the top market may have more women and fewer men. According to the logic of supply and demand, when there are more men and fewer women, the man will pay the bride price, but when there are more women and fewer men, whether Will it be the other way around? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you get divorced a few days after getting married, it is almost impossible to get back all the bride price; one party will add the other party&#39;s name to the real estate certificate and lose half of the house. &quot;Talk about feelings and hurt money&quot;, investors are facing increasing risks. In the marriage market, the investor, as Party A, will consider reducing transactions when faced with excessive requirements and costs. This is squeezing marriage from the cost of childbearing. Zhu broke off the engagement due to a temporary increase in the price of the bride&#39;s bride price, which is another vivid case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, the self-awareness of men and women is constantly strengthening, which is the so-called &quot;self-awakening&quot;. Since there is a female awakening, there will be a male awakening, and the awakening must eventually be two-way. There may be a sequence of awakenings, but equality is the final outcome and stable equilibrium. In a system that evolves over time, the transient state solution is a temporary phenomenon, and the long-term steady solution is the final result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, a female teacher in Zhengzhou’s resignation letter, “The world is so big, I want to see it,” became popular on the Internet. Public opinion praised her for her self-awakening, courage to pursue personal freedom, and living her life. Zhu&#39;s decision to break off the engagement and then use his savings to travel around China based on the same motivation deserves the same evaluation. As an adult, regardless of gender, if you don’t want to live a routine and step-by-step life, if you want to chase your dreams and be responsible for your own decisions, there is nothing wrong with that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To what extent will men and women awaken in the future? What will be the shape of a stable marriage and family in the future? It’s hard to say, but one thing is certain: it must be based on the principle of equality between men and women, and a new stable balance will be formed based on equality between men and women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any worthwhile marriage must be based on love and morality. Only in this way can home be a haven where people can relax physically and mentally, rather than a place where the spirit is exhausted. This requires all kinds of reciprocity: reciprocity in love, reciprocity in family responsibility, reciprocity in giving, reciprocity in providing emotional value... A relationship in which one party always gives and the other party always extracts cannot go far. Therefore, when you find that you are entering such a relationship, you need to stop your losses in time; or, after you find that you have entered such a relationship, you need to get out. Who can deny that this is an awakening? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[索南才让：写最后一代游牧人的故事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/RaZv85deQGOVAoK0hsyPdiKIWKD5XbflDNetMbJQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;687&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/RaZv85deQGOVAoK0hsyPdiKIWKD5XbflDNetMb JQ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256518&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking off the maroon or indigo Mongolian clothes, taking off the top hat, and putting on a polo shirt is like opening a portal and stepping into another world. The 38-year-old writer Sonam Cairang&#39;s figure is not considered tall and majestic among herdsmen. After leaving the bright clothes and running pastures, walking in the crowded city, even the slightly laborious raised tongue reveals a reserved and bookish tone. He habitually put on a polite, courteous, and gentlemanly face, and sat down at the dining table, reminding himself that there wasn&#39;t much red wine in the glass, but he still had to take a sip first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having just left his hometown in his twenties, the outside world’s default behavior of standing at the wine table for a toast and saying a bunch of toast words made him at a loss. He followed the example in panic for a while, and then lied that he never drank. When he returned to the grassland, he relieved his psychological burden and started drinking. The rule in the pastoral area is that no matter how hospitable the other party is, no one will stand up and thank the host with a glass of wine and say that I will return the invitation next time; nor will the other party be offended just because he said the wrong thing. In no particular order, everyone started making fists after having two or three glasses of wine, &quot;It&#39;s much simpler, especially direct and rough.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People living in grasslands, especially in alpine areas, can&#39;t be said to be indifferent in their emotions. In short, they are not that Rich.&quot; When grazing, it is common to go two or three days without seeing anyone to communicate or talk. The longest time, judging from Suonan Cairang&#39;s personal record, this silence lasted forty or fifty days. He was talking to himself in a desolate and vast environment, and he had developed a distant and overlooking gaze, making it difficult for him to be sentimental. &quot;Man develops this kind of character in an interdependent relationship with the environment. His attitude towards living creatures is different and more ruthless.&quot; Livestock fed by hand can be a tool for herders to travel far, or a Food to go with alcohol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sonam Cairang’s short story collection &quot;Looking for Signals&quot; published in 2023, these animals have also become the real murderers that drive the plot. During a dialogue at the Shanghai Book Fair in August, guest Han Songluo deliberately counted the ways of death that appeared in the book in advance, and recited at the scene in a tone like a bill report, &quot;One death from freezing, one sudden death, two deaths from being run over by a cow.&quot; times, and once fell from a horse to death...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compare the &quot;modern ways&quot; of death in Alice Munro&#39;s writings about those who fled the town, such as plane and train crashes, cancer, shipwrecks and drowning, etc. , Han Songluo classified the passages in Suonan Cai&#39;s book in which he sacrificed his life to contend with nature or interact with animals as &quot;pre-modern&quot;. The author explained that this is indeed an environmental test that plateau herders face every day. &quot;There are often floods and lightning in Qinghai. People are struck to death by lightning, thrown to death by horses, and various accidents occur.&quot; Han Songluo With emotion, &quot;I thought we were very far away from pre-modern society, but Sonam&#39;s words bring us back to this scene, where the relationship between humans, animals, land, and death is still maintained by instinct.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes. The conversation took place in the Miguel de Cervantes Library, next door to the fashionable Julu Road. Some viewers in the audience did not buy it and raised questions, saying that in such an environment, &quot;it is completely impossible to think of the grassland.&quot; , and also didn’t understand, “What does it mean to tell stories about the past?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suonan Cairang still responded in a low voice, “There is a lag in writing. What you feel at the moment cannot immediately become a work. After Only through precipitation and fermentation can we write about the grazing experience passed down from our fathers.&quot; As for whether it can convey a strong sense of foreignness, this is actually an important clue for Suonan Cairang&#39;s writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His novel collection &quot;In the Wasteland&quot; published in 2021 was once spotted by director Wanma Caidan, and his new work &quot;Looking for Signal&quot; was also shortlisted for the 7th Pingyao International Film Festival in October 2023. &quot;Migration Plan·From Literature to Film and Television&quot; section - the story must exude a completely different temperament from the city, which is why directors have successively purchased the copyright and tried to adapt it; but this kind of northwest ranch style is not the focus of his text, as the final A generation of nomads, he shouldered personal experiences, the memories of his father&#39;s generation, and the collision of life when he went out to work as an adult. After a few years, he returned to his hometown with mixed eyes. Therefore, he was never satisfied with recording the strange scenery on the surface, but stood in the Explore the spiritual changes of herdsmen from a broader perspective - facing the expansion of urbanization undoubtedly reveals more and more consistent ways of living and thinking, making readers unable to feel the &quot;grassland&quot; coming towards them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2008, he came to Beijing with 300 yuan in his pocket and worked in a factory that made urban sculptures. Before entering the factory, he bought two volumes of the Nobel Prize in Literature collection, as well as a collection of works that cost more than 100 yuan. A biography of Faulkner that cost almost half of his net worth. One time I didn&#39;t go back to my hometown during the Spring Festival. I was watching fireworks alone in an empty factory. I suddenly felt a force, as if Qinghai Lake was close in front of me. I pushed open the invisible door of my home. My father, who had drunk too much the day before, was lying on the sofa with his hat on. sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My hometown is the bloodline of my writing. Later I started to doubt it, and the thread of pulling became weaker and weaker. Only after I leave can I write about my hometown and understand it.” Now there are no sheep left in his family, and there are about 80 of them. The cattle are usually taken care of by his younger brother, and he returns to the ranch once a month. In order to maintain his creative state, he lives in Haiyan County, not far from the ranch, and retains some urban living habits. When he gets up every day, he jogs, makes coffee, eats eggs, and then reads a book for a while. After 8 o&#39;clock, Go to the studio and start writing for the day. When I write seven to eight hundred words a day, I no longer want to write, so I go do something else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The editor of the new book once concluded, &quot;Most of his novels are about stories about alpine grassland pastoral areas, but they do not make readers feel distant.&quot; The reason is Liu Xiaolin, vice chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Writers Association and a critic. After some analysis, &quot;he did not deliberately highlight the nationality and regional customs, lacked the quiet, simple and melodious pastoral mood of ordinary prairie novels, and did not examine the nationality in the binary opposition between the world and the local, tradition and modernity.&quot; The past and the future, and he has no intention of turning the novel into a national allegory. The usual thinking in the writing of these national literatures does not seem to affect him at all. He prefers to adopt a cold and calm narrative, focusing on the secular life of the grassland. , daily life such as grazing, drinking, and falling in love, showing the increasingly chaotic living conditions and life forms of the grasslands under the impact of modern civilization.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/01/l2VGmDF1AHXwd1npPJEKUFA3j1fCJQZKAIjXoWV6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;546&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/01/l2VGmDF1AHXwd1npPJEKUFA3j1fCJQZKAIjXoWV6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256523&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Suonan Cairang’s own ranch&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The last generation of nomads in their hometown&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suonan Cairang:&lt;/ strong>;&lt;span>;I especially like watching movies. Hong Kong police and gangster movies and TVB costume martial arts movies have been with me growing up. Every year except winter, there is a mobile tent video hall on the grassland. It is very popular. At night, the speakers start playing videos to attract customers. Grasslands are different from cities. The sound penetration is particularly strong and can be heard within a radius of more than ten kilometers. When we heard it, we felt so itchy that we couldn&#39;t sit still at home. We immediately ran to a heavily trafficked three-way intersection a few kilometers away and got into a mobile tent set up on the roadside. The chairs take up space, so in order to seat as many people as possible, everyone sits cross-legged, not even able to stretch their legs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before going to school, my uncle was a movie projectionist on the grassland. I sat on his carriage and followed him to more than a dozen villages to enlarge the film. When I dropped out of school at the age of 12 and returned to the ranch, I started watching in mobile tents until I was in my twenties. At first it was VCD, then DVD, and the price rose from 50 cents to one dollar. The shows are different every day, not just Hong Kong films, but also some classic films from the Mainland, as well as foreign films like &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sounds like a wonderful teenage period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The only thing I have not regretted until now is leaving school. At that time, conditions did not allow (study). My family was in a pastoral area. If I wanted to study, I had to go to the county town. The winter pasture was 40 kilometers away, and the summer pasture was 70 or 80 kilometers away. There was no boarding school in the county, so I had to stay with relatives, and there was no one to take care of me. In addition, I couldn’t read it myself, and my family was very happy when I stopped reading, because I needed help. Looking back later, I probably gained more outside of school than in school. I didn’t study in school. I only studied after I came out. Going to school and studying are two different things. School is about learning, not reading. The first book I came into contact with was &quot;Dragon and the Eight Parts&quot;. I took that book to herd sheep. It was winter, and it was a day full of yellow sand, but I had no time to pay attention to other things all day long. I don’t even know where my flock is. That was the beginning of my real reading. As for movies, I probably watched thousands of them in those years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These movies will be helpful for you to write novels in the future Impact? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think a big part of my writing is film, whether it is narration or observing the dialogue of characters. Or in terms of demeanor, it will definitely have an impact in a subtle way. Because when I watch a movie, I will be particularly immersed in it. I will remember the lines in a good movie. I can even imitate the expression, intonation, and speed of each character when they say those lines. The scene environment will also be in my mind. vivid in my mind. I really long for that kind of ability right now. If I&#39;m watching a movie and you&#39;re talking to me next to me, I won&#39;t hear you at all.

I was already married by that time, and tent movies were slowly disappearing. The boom is booming. After the advent of solar energy, many herdsmen bought a small black and white TV, a VCD, two large solar chargers and a battery to watch at home, as did my family. I often see that the battery is depleted. The electricity is used for winter pastures and settlements. Where other nomadic sites have electricity, it is still powered.

Without exception, they will envy us. Because they saw that all the men, young and old, looked very leisurely.

Watch movies and fall in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it still possible for teenagers to go herding now? No, they all went to study, and the perceptions of all the herdsmen changed.

Individuals will become truly nomadic, and nomadism is shrinking. This shrinkage is not only determined by ourselves, but also due to the adjustment of ecological policies. Qinghai is an important protected area. Everything is based on protecting the ecology and providing a good cycle, so grazing is not encouraged. There are many restrictions. For example, you cannot raise too many cattle and sheep. It depends on the carrying capacity of the pasture. If you have a thousand acres of pasture, you can only raise two to three hundred sheep. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yYMPeuFO6Ju7Wkz3NVTlS0taekLSKwGzQf6SdUMh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 683&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yYMPeuFO6Ju7Wkz3NVTlS0taekLSKwGzQf6SdUMh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256519&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Both roughness and delicacy are the truth on the grassland&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Looking back now , do you think not going to school is a good choice? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think my daughter can persist on this road for so long.

There is a big pot at the door of our house, filled with various vegetable leaves and leftover rice. Every night when the yaks return to their pen, one or two will come to eat. The two of them occupied that place. When other cows came, they would attack with their horns.

The wires connected from the old house to the new house were too long, and a pole was erected in the middle. One day, the two of them stopped eating, and they were The lingering, vibrating sound burst out of the chest like a vent, breaking the pole. I was so angry that the power pole fell down. Although no one was hurt, it caused me a lot of losses. The wires were torn off on both sides and all the insurance was burned out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When they are making trouble, they consciously know not to harm their owners, so they do not knock on the door or break in. Do you know what annoyed us most before? In summer and autumn, when it is almost dawn, at four or five o&#39;clock in the morning, the cows will eat slowly until they come to the tent. Because people move around and pour some water, there is salt in that area. You can&#39;t even drive them away. You can only take two or three steps outside. After a while, they come back and eat the tent&#39;s canvas edges, chewing them until you can sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bbhbALOhJpzgz4f89UXuCgxQvoW2yviZp3xM87IA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;617&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bbhbALOhJpzgz4f89UXuCgxQvoW2yviZp3xM87IA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256517&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Will herdsmen become more patient as a result?

So far, my country&#39;s world irrigation engineering heritage has reached 34. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Ministry of Water Resources that the tenth batch of the World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List was announced at the 74th Executive Council of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage held in Visakhapatnam, India. Chen Mingzhong, chairman of China&#39;s National Irrigation and Drainage Commission and director of the Department of Rural Water Resources and Hydropower of the Ministry of Water Resources, said that my country&#39;s world irrigation engineering heritage covers almost all types of irrigation projects. It is the most abundant type of irrigation engineering heritage, the most widely distributed, and the most outstanding irrigation benefits. nation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qimenyan Irrigation System is located in Shucheng County, Anhui Province. It was first established in the Western Han Dynasty. It uses the form of wetlands to &quot;form canals and ponds for storage&quot; and has played an important role for more than two thousand years. It plays an important role in irrigation, flood control and drought prevention. It currently irrigates 200,000 acres of farmland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hongze Ancient Irrigation Area is located in Hongze District, Huai&#39;an City, Jiangsu Province. It is a water storage irrigation area and consists of water storage, water intake, water transportation and drainage projects. Since the Eastern Han Dynasty, ancient people have diverted water for irrigation and farming. Water conservancy facilities have been built in the past dynasties, and the irrigation area continues to this day. Currently, the irrigation area controlled by the irrigation district is 481,300 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Huoquan Irrigation Project is located in Hongdong County, Shanxi Province. It has been clearly recorded since the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, and it still plays a role in irrigation, water supply, ecology, tourism and other functions. At present, the total irrigation area of ​​the project is 101,000 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baini Ancient Weir is located in Chongyang County, Hubei Province, and includes two ancient weirs, Shijian Weir and Yuanpi Weir. According to literature, the ancient weir was first built in the Five Dynasties and the Later Tang Dynasty. It still plays a role in irrigation, flood control, drought resistance, water supply and other functions, with an irrigated area of ​​about 35,000 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List was established in 2014 to sort out the development of irrigation civilization in the world, promote the protection of irrigation engineering heritage, summarize the wisdom of traditional irrigation engineering water control, and provide historical experience and inspiration for sustainable irrigation development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that along with my country’s four heritage sites, there are 15 projects from India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Thailand, Turkey and other countries that are included in the tenth batch of World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List.

The epicenter was located near Dahuai Town, Enping City, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, 3 kilometers away from the People&#39;s Government of Dahuai Town, Enping City, Jiangmen City, 13 kilometers away from the urban area of ​​Enping City, Jiangmen City, 37 kilometers away from the urban area of ​​Yangjiang City, and 156 kilometers away from Guangzhou City. As of 20:00, a total of 5 aftershocks had occurred, with the largest aftershock measuring 1.3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the earthquake was felt strongly in Enping City, Jiangmen City, and in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Macau, Hong Kong, Dongguan, Foshan, Yangjiang, Zhanjiang, Maoming, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai. No reports of casualties or property damage have been received yet, and the mood of the local people is stable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the earthquake, the Provincial Seismological Bureau launched a Level III emergency response and sent an earthquake field team (8 people) with the Guangzhou Earthquake Monitoring Center Station to Enping City to understand the earthquake situation and carry out intensive observations. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This earthquake is about 1 km away from the Cangcheng-Hailing Fault. Within 100 kilometers of the epicenter, there has been one earthquake of magnitude 5 or above. The largest earthquake occurred in Yangjiang, Guangdong on July 26, 1969. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake (63 kilometers away from the epicenter). Since 1970, the largest earthquake was the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Enping City, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province on September 18, 1989 (7 kilometers away from the epicenter). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the earthquake, the Provincial Seismological Bureau immediately launched a joint consultation with the China Seismological Network Center via video link.

Visual China/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, 2023, the State Council executive meeting reviewed and approved the &quot;Guiding Opinions on the Planning and Construction of Affordable Housing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A real estate expert involved in system design confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that the &quot;Guidance on Planning and Construction of Affordable Housing&quot; (Guofa [2023] No. 14) (hereinafter referred to as No. 14) was It was distributed to various cities at the end of August, mainly targeting megacities with a net inflow of population and cities with a permanent population of more than 3 million in built-up areas, a total of 35 cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Document No. 14 clarifies two major goals. The first is to increase the construction and supply of affordable housing, &quot;allowing working-income groups to gradually realize home ownership&quot;; the second is to promote the establishment of a new model of transformation and development of the real estate industry, return commercial housing to commodity attributes, meet the demand for improved housing, and promote stability. Land prices, stabilizing housing prices, and stabilizing expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is affordable housing highly valued, its relationship positioning and development model with commercial housing have also been further clarified. Some people believe that this is a &quot;new round of housing reform&quot; similar to the Singapore model. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Reform is gradual and forced”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the above-mentioned experts, a major focus of Document No. 14 is to launch allotment-type affordable housing. China has previously established a housing security system that integrates public rental housing, affordable rental housing, and shared property housing. The new allotment-type affordable housing will be connected with it to form an affordable housing system parallel to commercial housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Housing Policy Research Center of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Urban Planning, told Southern Weekend reporters that currently affordable housing accounts for 20%-30% of the existing housing stock, mainly for people with urban household registration, such as minimum living allowance and low-income families. Income groups, coverage is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the changes in the population structure and the increase in housing prices, new citizens, young people and other groups are facing severe housing difficulties, and the contradiction between the scope of housing security and actual needs has become increasingly prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are 300-400 million new citizens and migrant population in the country, and most of them do not have houses. The anxiety about owning property rights houses has risen to the level of class promotion.” Li Yujia once wrote an article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, during the real estate boom period, commercial housing and land prices soared, and local governments were not very enthusiastic about investing in the construction of affordable housing. There is a big gap between affordable housing and commercial housing in terms of location, quality, and public services, making it difficult to truly meet needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If we do not vigorously build affordable housing, we must tolerate the existence of urban villages, factory dormitories and other informal housing that are free from urban public services.” Li Yujia believes that this has led to the The housing pattern shows a &quot;dual split&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, commercial housing for middle and high incomes and informal housing for low and middle incomes dominate, with the middle form weak, and there is a ladder fault in housing consumption. In the &quot;first half&quot; of the real estate market, where urbanization is advancing rapidly, house prices are not high, and price increases are expected to be strong, this problem is not yet obvious. As real estate enters a downward period, the problem becomes more prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the end of 2021, measures to rescue the real estate market have continued. Various localities have successively relaxed loan restrictions and purchase restrictions, and introduced various policies to stimulate real estate consumption, but they have not had the same immediate effect as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reform is gradual and forced. The time has come. Otherwise, real estate may face the risk of &#39;stalling&#39;.&quot; Li Yujia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;combination punch&quot; of supply-side reform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The focus of Document No. 14 is the supply-side reform of real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts who participated in the design of the No. 14 system said that the important problem caused by the past real estate development model was the mismatch between supply and demand. The leading idea of ​​​​the new round of housing reform no longer starts from the demand side, but adjusts the supply. Structure, planning and construction of affordable housing, that is, allotment-type affordable housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning is that it is built and sold by state-owned enterprises and supplied at cost price. The owner has complete property rights, but it can only be transferred in a closed manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some houses are for new construction, and the land is allocated and supplied. The construction entities are local state-owned enterprises and urban investment companies, and private enterprises are also encouraged to participate in agency construction. Funds come from special bonds, bank loans, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts analyzed that selling at cost will allow the investment in such affordable housing to be recovered and avoid increasing hidden debts. This also requires that this type of affordable housing must be able to be sold so that it can be built to order and provide effective supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Revitalizing stock is also an important means of raising funds. Document No. 14 clarifies that in cities with a large inventory of commercial housing, existing commercial housing can be appropriately renovated or purchased to be used as affordable housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Document No. 14 also proposed that there is conditional support for the use of idle and inefficient industrial, commercial, office and other non-residential land to build affordable housing. If the land use is changed, the land price will not be paid back, and the original allocated land will continue to be retained. transfer method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts believe that revitalizing the stock is more important. Because new land is limited in big cities, allocable land is concentrated in the periphery of the city, making it difficult to meet the needs of job-housing balance. And under the downward pressure on housing prices, these areas will be more obviously affected, and the affordable housing constructed may not be popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, real estate has entered the era of stock. Li Yujia introduced that it will take more than five years to digest the general inventory in many peripheral areas of cities. According to a survey by the Ministry of Land and Resources, 40% of the country’s existing land is idle or inefficiently used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan of Document No. 14, this type of affordable housing is mainly aimed at working-income groups who have housing difficulties and low income, as well as groups such as imported talents needed by the city, and people who have been protected by the urban village transformation previously implemented The degree of overlap is high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the State Council executive meeting reviewed and approved the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Actively and Steadily Promoting the Transformation of Urban Villages in Mega-Cities&quot;. On October 12, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development disclosed that the urban village reconstruction information system has currently included 162 urban village reconstruction projects in the database, and the urban village reconstruction in super megacities is being implemented in three categories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia introduced that the renovation of urban villages is mainly aimed at affordable rental housing. It raises housing resources through demolition, reconstruction and inventory improvement. It is mainly to provide rental options for new citizens, young people, etc., and it is a rent-to-rent guarantee. house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The combination of the allotment-type affordable housing planning in Document No. 14 and the transformation of urban villages has formed a &quot;combination&quot; of real estate supply-side reforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The basic logic is that through government-led affordable housing, people with housing difficulties can enjoy urban public services and become citizens. Build &#39;rent before buy&#39;, &#39;small before big&#39;,&#39; &quot;Get on the bus first and then improve it,&quot; the housing asset ownership ladder will eventually become a property owner in the city.&quot; Li Yujia wrote in an article. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Challenges&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, whether the allotment-type affordable housing planned in Document No. 14 can achieve the expected results also faces challenges. One of the keys is closed circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1994, China promoted affordable housing and sold it to low- and middle-income groups at a price lower than commercial housing. However, because there were no closed circulation restrictions, many houses ended up being traded in the second-hand market, which not only created space for rent-seeking, but also gradually lost their protective role. Construction was no longer available in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Xinhua News Agency&quot;, at the conference call on planning and construction of affordable housing work held on September 4, 2023, Vice Premier He Lifeng emphasized that affordable housing must implement strict closed management. Not allowed to be listed for trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts involved in system design said that this means that this type of affordable housing will have restrictions on property rights and stipulate a closed period of a certain number of years. During the period, it cannot be transferred and can only be repurchased by the government. After the closed period, it can only be transferred internally among groups that meet the guarantee conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another key issue is whether the existing land can be revitalized and high-quality land parcels can be truly produced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts said that during the preparation process of affordable rental housing, attempts were made to revitalize existing land, but the results were not good. The reason is that the adjustment of land planning is restricted by the overall planning of the area, and whether the public facilities can be constructed after it is converted into residential buildings is also a big test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, land is an important asset in the eyes of all economic entities. Some enterprises and institutions that occupy high-quality land are more inclined to provide housing benefits to insiders. Can they use the land to build affordable housing and provide housing to the whole world? Social cost price placement is also an issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Achieving home ownership through affordable housing will be helpful to the future development of the commercial housing market.” The above-mentioned experts believe that if the placement-type affordable housing planned in Document No. 14 can achieve the expected results, It will meet the housing purchase needs of new citizens, young people and other groups, and further solve the dilemma of demand gap and high inventory pressure in the real estate market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[逃不掉的，侯孝贤说]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/oIlWQzZZTDpZ7S7fGr5ibXWqXIxgFpINyhNeGd65.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/oIlWQzZZTDpZ7S7fGr5ibXWqXI xgFpINyhNeGd65. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;New Wave of French Films&quot; produced two big figures, Godard and Truffaut, Taiwan&#39;s new films also have two heroes, one of whom is rooted in the soil. Hou Hsiao-hsien, and the other is Edward Yang, a programmer who returned from the United States. With a Western perspective, Edward Yang is good at capturing the urban feel, and his films are more genre-based. The urban feel of Taiwan at that time was a middle ground between rural and urban areas, and the unique flavor was very iconic in his shots. To this day, many aspects of society can still be seen in their movies. Speaking more broadly, if Edward Yang had not passed away prematurely, &quot;Taiwan&#39;s New Cinema&quot; would have had a different pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taiwan&#39;s new film begins with the 1982 platter film &quot;The Story of Time&quot;, which was screened across Taiwan. Among the co-directors was Edward Yang, who studied and worked in the United States and later returned to Taiwan to make movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Hou Hsiao-hsien, who had already made three romance films that were very successful at the box office, joined the following year. He and two other directors made another platter movie &quot;My Son&#39;s Big Doll&quot; - —At this time, Hou Hsiao-hsien obviously hadn’t found himself yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a filmmaker &quot;sees himself&quot;, to be more specific, it means that his attitude towards things and people can be reflected in the film, and he cannot deceive people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s style first appeared in &quot;The Man From Fengkuei&quot; in 1983. A very modern emotional state, akin to melancholy and alienation, is evident when viewed from a distance. The lives of several confused young people are observed from a distance with fixed camera positions and long lenses. The camera suddenly gained an attitude, a bit pushing away the audience and asking everyone to calm down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previous Taiwanese movies were not like this. In the early 1970s, Taiwan was dominated by martial arts films and Qiong Yao-style romance films; in the late 1970s, many pornographic or violent films appeared. Business was not business, and rurality was not rural; by the 1980s, a generation of young Taiwanese people were facing The pull between Chinese traditional spirit and Western modern culture sways with the wind in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/OdDvG7jpCBunuQg2L77akjJfKs0toKpp5rKL2M2Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/OdDvG7jpCBunuQg2L77akjJfKs0toKpp5rKL2M2Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Hsiao-Hsien Zeng said in an interview: &quot;A director can only make one movie. The method of attention can change, but the angle is the same... Edward Yang left Taiwan for the United States and came back after so many years. His memory compared with his current view. I grew up in the countryside in southern Taiwan. I read classical books. Natural growth and life are my vision...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of modernity in Hou Hsiao-hsien is mixed and rich, oriental Form, Eastern thinking, and the core point of view connects the West. At that time, he and several directors of the same age were discussing this matter, which attracted a lot of praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the best years of Taiwan&#39;s new films, the average annual film production could reach about 120. &quot;This film reform movement inspired by the new generation of film workers and film directors was short-lived in the 1980s. It has experienced ups and downs in a few years, and has reached a peak that is still unreachable for Taiwanese films, giving Taiwanese films a place in the history of world cinema.&quot; This is a summary of Taiwanese new films that I have read from a lot of information. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 24, 1987, the &quot;Taiwan Film Manifesto&quot; was released. At this time, the peak of new films had passed and everyone began to struggle. This declaration is divided into three parts: &quot;Our views on movies&quot;, &quot;Our concerns about the environment&quot;, and &quot;The changes we expect and our own determination&quot;. I went out of my way to see the worries and doubts of these young filmmakers back then, and they proposed: We believe that movies have many possibilities, and we must strive for space for the existence of &quot;another kind of movie&quot; besides commercial movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, new films as a trend have quickly dissipated. Since then, everyone’s creations have had to follow the market and personal destiny. For example, many filmmakers do not focus on the reality of Taiwan and do not seek funds from the country ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The same is true for Hou Hsiao-hsien&lt;/span>;). The advantage of doing this is that it will not be affected by certain policies in Taiwan. The disadvantage is that it will distance you from reality and indulge in memories. Suspicion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, Hou Hsiao-hsien is not my film inspiration. In 2015, I finally watched Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s movie &quot;The Assassin&quot; on the big screen in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote a paragraph after watching the movie:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;The Assassin Nie Yinniang&quot; does not tell how Nie Yinniang became an assassin, but how she did not become an assassin. First of all, the camera sets the atmosphere .When many directors take pictures of a group of talking people, Hou Hsiao-hsien pays attention to the people standing in the corner. He is behind the camera and does not lead us to see anything. Instead, he follows the movement of the camera to feel what is hidden inside. , there is always a pair of eyes lingering near the speaker.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, news came out that the director was suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and his family confirmed that he had fully returned to family life and was recuperating. In fact, there have been rumors in the circle about Director Hou suffering from dementia for several years. I think it&#39;s boring to say that a director like him has &quot;retired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acheng wrote about a scene in an article. He said that there was originally a braid-cutting scene in &quot;A Dream of Life&quot;, which required more than a hundred braids to be cut off at once. In one shot, it could only be filmed. once. Everyone was very nervous during the filming. As a result, the camera of a female reporter flashed as soon as the braid was cut. Everyone immediately looked at the little girl. No one dared to speak. The little girl was so frightened that she cried. Hou Hsiao-hsien said nothing. &quot;Anyway, the shot was in vain, so there&#39;s no way we can shoot it again.&quot; This quote comes from cinematographer Yao Hongyi, who has worked with Director Hou for many years. In fact, it quite reflects Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s attitude towards movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been news from time to time about Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s new film &quot;Searching for the River God&quot;, but I think it may not be seen. If you can’t see it, it doesn’t matter. He likes to say to young people who make movies: &quot;You can&#39;t escape what kind of person you are when you make whatever you want!&quot; In one of his movies, the young man, regardless of what kind of person he is, shot the movie under prohibited circumstances. A group of young people rode motorcycles and passed by the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, leaving him far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/SbJLfSLKF8mdame1OTbhxi33amRDigs5TW8L3lWS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/SbJLfSLKF8mdame1OTbhxi33amRDigs5TW8L3lWS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256540&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years In the future, when I revisit these vivid and somewhat joyful movie scenes, I will feel a kind of gratitude that is difficult for others to understand. There are already so many works by Director Hou that can be watched over and over again, isn’t that enough? It just so happens that this last film has a meaningful name - &quot;River God&quot; may refer to himself. Therefore, some people speculate that this movie may be done by the descendants he has trained for many years... This is because it is too unclear what kind of person Hou Hsiao-hsien is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from &quot;The Man from Fenggui&quot; in 1983, Hou Hsiao-hsien became more and more isolated on his path until &quot;The Assassin&quot; won the award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the movie road, such people are almost extinct. What does such a person look like? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even though he could blend in, he could keep up with the new era, he could incite young people...he didn&#39;t have any of it. I am reminded here of a quote by Truffaut: “If my films contradict the times in which I live, as I am sometimes accused of doing, it is perhaps because I sympathize with those who have to struggle to enter a world from which they are excluded. People of the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The confused young filmmakers will come to their senses sooner or later. The existence of Hou Hsiao-hsien means an &quot;ecology&quot;. There is at least a gap left in the world of movies, which is much more important than countless specific movies. The bigger the bubble, the more likely it will burst; no matter how weak the hope is, it is still hope. Maybe I&#39;m pessimistic, but sometimes optimism can be deceptive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if his friend Edward Yang was still alive, even if the new movies were still a hit, and even if art films finally opened up a market of their own, Hou Hsiao-hsien might have said: &quot;There is no one like him.&quot; He had already seen clearly that All true artists, in the end, will not be able to have anyone around them - at that time, they will become &quot;everyone&quot;, the so-called &quot;see themselves, see the world, and see all living beings&quot;.
