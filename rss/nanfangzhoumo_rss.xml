Visual China&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wild boar was eventually trapped in a river that was more than 3 meters wide and about 200 meters long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on November 29, 2023, this wild boar appeared in Jianye District, Nanjing City from about 5 a.m., which had caused a lot of commotion, and was finally driven by the police to this small road called Nanhubei. In the ditch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the left bank there is a low lawn first, and then there is a palm bush about one meter above. The wild boar is hiding under the palm bush for a while. Dozens of special police officers and auxiliary police officers stood ready with shields and explosion-proof steel forks. Two staff members who came from the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Conservation and Rescue Center were about 2 meters away from it and prepared anesthetic drugs urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many onlookers were already standing on the road on the right bank of the river. In the video shot by a netizen, a delivery man in the crowd heard an order notification on his phone, but his voice was pressed down, and no one left; another man was holding a bag of persimmons in his hand, standing still and watching; a woman was walking her dog Passing by, I couldn&#39;t stop looking towards the river and started to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Residents have never seen anything new like this, and neither have we.” Wei Zhennan, deputy director of the Yiyuan Community Neighborhood Committee in Jianye District, Nanjing, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Nanjing, wild boars are the most frequent wild animals. Nanjing municipal government departments have stated that they will formulate and improve contingency plans for wild boar police situations, do a good job in emergency response, and carry out scientific and effective hunting and driving of wild boars. Work. But for Wei Zhennan, he had never seen such a large-scale hunting of wild boars. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Catching wild boars&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Previous media reported that this wild boar appeared on a campus in Jianye District, Nanjing at around 5 a.m. on November 29. After the security guard found out, he was worried that the wild boar might hurt someone, so he called the police for help. After receiving the call, Nanjing Jianye police went to the scene to search for the wild boars. The wild boars began to rush out of the school and fled in all directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of Beilei Community in Nanhu Street told Southern Weekend reporters that it was six or seven in the morning when the wild boars arrived in the community, and they had not yet gone to work. &quot;I heard that they visited several communities.&quot; . According to media reports, a security guard in Beilei Community was knocked down and bitten by a wild boar and was sent to the hospital for six stitches. The above-mentioned staff said they had gone to express condolences to the injured security guard, but did not disclose the extent of the injury. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yiyuan Community, it was already past nine o&#39;clock in the morning when Wei Zhennan received a call from the property management company. The other party informed residents that wild boars were found in the area. &quot;I thought it was a small wild boar at the time.&quot; Wei Zhennan still found it strange. After checking the surveillance with the community police, he found that at 7 o&#39;clock in the morning, the wild boar was already wandering around the community. In the surveillance video, the wild boar was very muscular, weighing more than 200 kilograms, &quot;so the police quickly requested support.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time Wei Zhennan arrived at the hiding place of the wild boar, the police in Jianye District had already begun to raise alert and prepare to round him up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At nearly 11 o&#39;clock, Li Feng (pseudonym), an animal protection worker at the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Conservation and Rescue Center, received a call from the 110 police center and hurried to the scene. For Li Feng, this is part of his daily work. Every day he receives five or six calls for help from wild animals, involving birds, snakes, wild boars, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Injecting anesthesia into wild boars has certain risks. Under normal circumstances, Li Fengfeng works with his colleagues. One person injects the injection (using an anesthesia blowpipe to inject the injection from a distance), and the other person assists in preparing the anesthetic drugs. The optimal distance for injection is 3-5 meters. Li Feng explained that if it is far away, the injection cannot penetrate the pig skin and the anesthetic will take effect slowly; if it is too close, the risk to the staff increases. Wild boars react much faster than humans. Once, a wild boar was frightened after being injected with anesthesia, and the staff chased it for nearly two kilometers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time on the river bank in South Hubei, Li Feng held an anesthesia blowpipe, crouched under a palm bush, then slowly poked his head out, aiming at the wild boar. The first anesthesia needle was injected into the head and neck of the wild boar. The wild boar suddenly emerged from the palm bushes, knocked away the policeman on the side, and rushed wildly along the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crowd of onlookers immediately surged. The police and community workers quickly raised their voices and evacuated the onlookers. It’s okay.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the video captured by the media, the wild boar ran for hundreds of meters and then swam back from the river. Li Feng took advantage of the wild boar to swim ashore and subsequently injected three more anesthetics. Li Feng estimated that the anesthesia took effect in about half an hour, and the wild boar was blocked under the bridge tunnel and brought to the shore. However, because the wild boar choked on water after being anesthetized, it was dying when it came ashore and died on the way to Hongshan Zoo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After local media released a live video of the wild boar being captured, netizens suspected that it was the previous &quot;river-crossing pig&quot; that took 12 minutes to cross the Yangtze River and land in Nanjing on November 27. When crossing the river, Yao Chengyu, the duty leader of the Nanjing Maritime Safety Administration&#39;s Vessel Traffic Management Center, spotted it on the surveillance camera and watched it flexibly avoid many large ships and pass at high speed on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tang Xiaofan, director of the Party and Mass Work Department of the Nanjing Maritime Safety Administration, said that although there were many ships passing up and down the waterway at that time, compared to large ships of 70 to 80 meters, the wild boar collision would not cause damage to the ship. It is easy to die in itself. For the staff of the Maritime Safety Administration, it is rare for large wild animals such as wild boars to appear on the river. More common are finless porpoises, birds and other wild animals. In terms of wildlife protection, they mainly cooperate with the Nanjing municipal government departments in delineating ecological reserves, banning navigation in ecological reserves, and reducing water pollution in the Yangtze River. They do not need to deal with wild boar traffic accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After the rescue&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in November 2023 alone, there were many incidents of wild boars in Nanjing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, a woman in Jiangning District, Nanjing, encountered a wild boar while sitting in front of a restaurant and quickly fled into the restaurant. The owner of the restaurant said that the aunt in the restaurant who was harassed was not bitten. The wild boar quickly left on its own and they did not call the police. On November 10, the media reported that Mr. Zhou, a Nanjing citizen, collided with a wild boar while driving, and his vehicle was damaged. Mr. Zhou told Southern Weekend reporters that the wild boar injured its legs after being hit, and passers-by called the Hongshan Zoo Wildlife Conservation and Rescue Center to have it towed away. Later, Mr. Zhou’s friend asked about the wild boar’s treatment and learned that the wild boar could not be saved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called the Nanjing Municipal Public Security Bureau several times on December 1 to inquire about the wild boar police situation, but failed to receive a reply. On the website of the Nanjing Municipal Government, Southern Weekend reporters searched and found a reply posted on July 5, 2022, from the Nanjing Municipal Landscaping Bureau to the Nanjing Municipal People’s Congress meeting’s recommendations on the disposal of wild boars in rural areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reply mentioned that in recent years, due to the improvement of the ecological environment, the number of wild boars in Nanjing has increased rapidly, and their activity range has continued to expand. They are found in Laoshan, Niushou Mountain, Wuxiang Mountain in the suburbs, and even in the main urban area. Wild boars are out and about. News of wild boars leaving the mountains and forests and frequently entering tourist attractions, parks, traffic arteries, residential areas, shopping malls, campuses, etc., destroying crops, damaging facilities, and even causing personal injury, disrupting the normal order of production and life of citizens, has become a major issue affecting cities. One of the security risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From January to May 2022, the Nanjing Municipal Public Security Bureau received a total of 201 reports involving wild boars, covering multiple administrative districts in the city. They were mainly traffic accidents in which wild boars caused vehicle damage and injuries, and wild boar infestations. wait. Faced with this kind of police situation, the local public security organs will dispatch personnel to the scene as soon as possible to deal with it. If the situation is critical and may threaten the personal safety of citizens, after on-site assessment and other standardized procedures, the offending wild boar will be shot and followed up in accordance with the law. Work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng remembers that throughout 2022, the number of wild boars rescued by Hongshan Zoo was 32, and that number will be reduced by about ten in 2023. He thinks it may be related to the removal of wild boar from the &quot;Three You&quot; protected animal list. In July 2023, the State Forestry and Grassland Administration officially released the adjusted &quot;List of Terrestrial Wild Animals with Important Ecological, Scientific, and Social Values&quot;. Wild boars are not included in the list. This means that wild boars are no longer protected animals, and the hunting procedures for wild boars have been further simplified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng suggested that citizens should not panic if they encounter a wild boar on the street or in a park. If the wild boar does not hurt anyone, just stay away from it. If there is an emergency that injures people or disturbs residents&#39; lives, citizens can call the police or call the Wildlife Rescue Center. Hongshan Zoo will make an assessment after rescuing wild animals. The exotic species will be kept in the park, while about 40% of the native species will be released into the wild. &quot;This success rate is quite high,&quot; Li Feng said. It needs to be taken into consideration. Various accidents are prone to occur during the rescue of wild animals. For example, a wild boar accidentally drowned after being anesthetized in the Beihe River in South Hubei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng specifically mentioned a wild boar rescued from Bazishan Park in 2022. The wild boar has become so docile as a result of being raised by humans for a long time that people can even pet it. Hongshan Zoo was worried that it would not survive in the wild, so it has been kept in the zoo. &quot;Some tourists are not clear. They think that feeding these animals is to protect them, but in fact they are harming them.&quot; Li Feng and his team also rescued two wild boars that had been fed near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in 2023, but they were ultimately unable to be released into the wild. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the increasing number of wild boars, Nanjing has taken measures such as strengthening population monitoring and investigation, strengthening prevention and publicity and guidance of wild boar activities. In addition, the Nanjing Municipal Landscaping and Greening Bureau has also adopted wild boar population control methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned reply from the Nanjing Municipal Landscaping and Greening Bureau mentioned that Nanjing will launch a pilot wild boar hazard prevention and control work in the Zijin Mountain area starting from October 2021. After expert evaluation and demonstration, the wild boar population density in the Zijin Mountain monitoring area has exceeded the control standard. The Nanjing Municipal Greening and Gardening Bureau applied to the Provincial Forestry Bureau for a hunting quota of 60 wild boars, and issued an administrative license for hunting wild boars to the Zhongshan Cemetery Administration Bureau. From March 22, 2022 to March 15, 2023, it will be carried out in the Zijin Mountain area Wild boar population regulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng believes that in recent years, the public’s awareness of wildlife protection has increased, and citizens will take the initiative to call for help when encountering wild animals that are trapped or causing accidents. In 2022, Hongshan Zoo rescued about 1,200 animals. &quot;A wild boar is just a little wave.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[信用卡质效榜：股份行霸榜前四 城商行高度分化]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261776]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 17:34:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Heming, researcher at Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years later, the domestic credit card market will open up to the outside world again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, the international credit card organization giant MasterCard’s holding company in China, MasterCard, obtained a bank card clearing business license and stated that Within 6 months, it will expand its member institutions in China and authorize the issuance and acceptance of MasterCard brand bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a time when China’s credit card market is shifting from a race-and-spur rush to intensive farming. At the same time, China&#39;s credit card market as a whole faces the challenges of rising non-performing loan ratios and shrinking new card issuance volumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the second largest personal credit market after housing mortgage loans, how do commercial banks respond to the new situation of credit cards, a high-quality asset?

Based on this, the 2023 Credit Card Performance Ranking Index Evaluation System has been constructed. Consistent with the wealth management list, green finance list, digital finance list, data security list and life insurance efficiency list, the credit card quality and efficiency list indicator system designed by Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center is mainly based on quantitative and qualitative indicators, supplemented by external expert review and media factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the quantitative and qualitative indicators include three major dimensions: business scale and growth, risk management, customer service and product innovation, with 12 sub-indicators, each sub-indicator. Indicators are given differential weights based on their importance. The total weight of quantitative and qualitative indicators is 70%. Among quantitative and qualitative indicators, business scale accounts for as much as 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center also invited 7 external authoritative experts to conduct an independent real-name review and scoring based on the overall understanding of each bank&#39;s credit card business, with a weight of 15%. At the same time, in order to encourage commercial banks to improve the transparency of information disclosure in the credit card field, the Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center formed a media factor based on the feedback of 20 banks&#39; credit card business on a special survey, with a weight of 15%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73942&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70734&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/dc5c17a121.png&quot; img-title=&quot;Indicator system.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit card quality and efficiency ranking indicator system&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1799&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/dc5c17a121.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260532&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Credit card quality and efficiency ranking indicator system (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p >; &lt;h3>;Pay equal attention to scale, risk control and innovation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The various dimensions of the credit card quality and efficiency list and the set quantitative and qualitative indicators below are explained as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(1) Business scale is an important reflection of the credit card strength of major banks. There are six sub-indicators under this dimension, namely the number of credit card issuances and their changes, credit card loan balances and their proportions, the number of credit card users, and the amount of credit card transactions. The total weight of the six sub-indicators is 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(2) Risk management is a necessary dimension to examine the comprehensive strength of each bank&#39;s credit card. There are three sub-indicators under this dimension, namely credit card non-performing loan balance, non-performing loan ratio and their changes. The total weight of the three sub-indicators is 18%. Among them, in order to highlight the efforts and effects of banks in controlling the non-performing loan ratio, based on the credit card loan non-performing ratio indicator, a change rate indicator of the credit card loan non-performing ratio is set to directly reflect the results of the measures taken by each bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(3) Customer service and product innovation are inevitable choices for major banks to cope with the increasingly fierce competition in the credit card market. There are three sub-indicators under this dimension, namely bank card fee income, credit card complaints volume and their changes. The total weight of the three sub-indicators is 17%. Among them, the number of complaints about the credit card business and its changes can prove the customer&#39;s recognition of the bank&#39;s credit card business and is a negative indicator; bank card fee income directly reflects the use of the bank&#39;s credit cards in real transactions, thereby reflecting the bank&#39;s Credit card product innovation and customer service levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Joint stock banks dominate the top three&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Comprehensive analysis of the quantitative and qualitative indicators, expert reviews and media factor scores of 20 banks, Southern Weekend New Financial Research The center has constructed the 2023 credit card quality and efficiency list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73941&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70733&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/fa546ff341.png&quot; img-title=&quot;List.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit card quality list&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2237&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/fa546ff341.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260533&quot; style= &quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Credit card quality and efficiency list (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The credit card quality and efficiency list shows that China Merchants Bank, China CITIC Bank and Guangfa Bank took the top three overall scores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China Merchants Bank ranks first in quantitative and qualitative indicators, expert review scores and media factors, and is the only company to receive &quot;double perfect scores&quot; from expert reviews and media factors. Bank of. The bank won the championship with a large lead of 12 points, which reflects the competitiveness of the bank&#39;s credit cards in all aspects such as business, finance and reputation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;CITIC Bank narrowly defeated China Guangfa Bank with a slight advantage of 0.24 points. The two joint-stock banks ranked second and third in the credit card quality and efficiency list respectively. Together with Ping An Bank, which ranks fourth, in the 2023 new financial competitiveness sub-list released this time, the credit card quality and efficiency list is also the only sub-list in which a joint-stock bank has achieved the top four rankings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although external review scores and media factors have partially weakened the influence of scale indicators on the list, only from the perspective of quantitative and qualitative indicator performance, China Merchants Bank, CITIC and GF The score is still in the top three. Among them, Guangfa Bank&#39;s credit card loan balance accounts for as high as 48% of the bank&#39;s personal loan balance, far exceeding its peers. This proves that the credit card business has a huge influence on the bank beyond its peers. At the same time, despite the overall contraction in credit card issuance, China CITIC Bank and China Guangfa Bank still maintained positive growth in card issuance, which also shows the considerable strength of the two joint-stock banks in the credit card business. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The five major banks ranked among the top ten&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although they were not among the top three, the five major banks of the China Construction Bank of China, Workers and Peasants, all ranked among the top ten, still showing that overseas There are major banks with overall strength in the credit card business. The credit card business of major state-owned banks started early and has a huge customer base. It has always been significantly ahead in the scale of credit card business. However, in recent years, with the fluctuation of credit card asset quality and the stricter supervision after the implementation of new credit card regulations, a large number of invalid and inefficient credit cards issued in the early stage have withdrawn from the market. In the midst of this ebb and flow, the scale advantages of large banks in various countries are gradually being eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The credit card business is not as important to large state-owned banks as it is to joint-stock banks. Looking at the proportion of credit card loans in personal loans, the average proportion of credit card loan balances in the five major banks is 9%, while this indicator for the nine joint-stock banks is as high as 27%. In this sense, despite being at an overall disadvantage in entry time, asset size and customer base, joint-stock banks can occupy half of the credit card market, and their comprehensive competitiveness beyond their opponents is obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, the ranking of the five major banks in the credit card quality and efficiency list is appropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The leading city commercial banks are catching up&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The credit card scores of the five city commercial banks are highly differentiated. Among them, Bank of Ningbo’s comprehensive score is second only to ICBC, ranking 6th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the first half of 2023, the bank&#39;s credit card issuance volume increased by as much as 40% year-on-year, ranking first among 20 banks; at the same time, the bank&#39;s credit card issuance volume increased by 40% year-on-year. The bank&#39;s credit card non-performing rate is only 1.19%, the best among peers; while maintaining an ultra-low credit card non-performing rate, the bank&#39;s credit card non-performing rate is still on a downward trajectory, which is even more difficult. This reflects that leading city commercial banks are working hard to catch up in the credit card business and have made great progress in some indicators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to Bank of Ningbo, the other four city commercial banks all rank at the bottom, showing that they still have a clear gap with large and medium-sized banks in terms of comprehensive credit card strength. Affected by factors such as their short time in the credit card market, small business scale, and weak customer base, the four city commercial banks overall lagged behind in indicators such as credit card issuance volume and credit card loan balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[鸟兽、巫气与万物：一位北方作家来到大陆最南端]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261772]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/DA1pphxCP4G16cI6bvENaZqH1ZaKtpT80Myy4jIm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/DA1pphxCP4G16cI6bvENaZqH1ZaKt pT80Myy4jIm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260003&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Half is ocean, half is land&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Leizhou Peninsula, at the southernmost tip of mainland China, faces Hainan Island across the sea. The writer Sun Pin came here and stayed for two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we arrived on the island, Sun Pin kept walking and looking, identifying every plant and animal one by one. She talked with local people of different ages and learned some Leizhou dialect. &quot;Eating&quot; means &quot;exemption&quot; and &quot;problem&quot; means &quot;taking responsibility&quot;. She tried her best as a northerner to feel the temperament and character of this land and water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leizhou Peninsula is filled with &quot;witchcraft&quot; temperament. Tianhou Temple and Mazu Temple can be found everywhere, and there are various other gods in each village. &quot;Faced with such a huge thing as the ocean, human beings cannot help but be in awe and ask for its blessings.&quot; The worship of the ocean and the many gods it derives permeates many details of the daily life of people living near the sea. &quot;The folk customs here The folklore is very peculiar, and I was very curious about it, so I had this idea at that time and wanted to write about this land-sea junction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the novel collection &quot;The Magician of the Sea&quot; published in 2023, Sun Pin fictionalized a seaside village located at the southernmost tip of Leizhou Peninsula: Papaya Town. The first novel in the collection, &quot;The Magician by the Sea,&quot; tells the story of a northerner who comes here to look for her brother who has disappeared for many years. For Sun Pin, searching is a very fascinating process. &quot;You keep moving forward on a road. You don&#39;t know what kind of people and what kind of stories you will encounter ahead.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, this northerner met the old lady who asked her not to scare Jackfruit, &quot;Jackfruit is very attached to people and likes to be touched and praised most&quot;; she met Sister Mei who lived with many plants and animals, and saw her Taking the leaf cake to the grave in the woods, she believed that the ghosts of her family were living in the black cat; she also met a person who looked like a carp spirit. In order to make her believe her words, the carp spirit faced her before speaking. The Mazu statue enshrined in the house burns incense and worships the gods, &quot;If I tell you in front of Mazu, there will be no lies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In this small town, many boundaries are blurred. People, plants and animals, living people and dead people, and the ground and the underground can all travel back and forth with each other. All things have animism and live together in a big family...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; &quot;This place still has a barbaric temperament. On one side, it frequently draws out its swords to attack people, causing blood to splatter five feet away. On the other side, it believes in animism. Each village has its own gods, and each god&#39;s birthday is different. Similarly, the birthday of the gods is a grand festival for the whole village, collectively called the calendar. Thunder operas must be sung to the gods on the stage, fine wine must be offered to the gods, fresh boiled chicken must be prepared, and firecrackers must be set off all day long. , there is a lion dance, and there is an extremely grand ceremony for the wandering god, while the god just sits in his temple and quietly watches people wishing him a birthday.&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Magician on the Beach&quot;&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nature is the cause and life is the effect. Being with the sea all day long gives the folk life in Leizhou Peninsula an atmosphere of fantasy and mystery, and hidden behind this is the huge powerlessness and loneliness of human beings when facing the ocean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Sun Pin saw the sea for the first time, his reaction was no different from that of many inland people, &quot;It&#39;s so big that you don&#39;t know what is hidden inside.&quot; Regarding living on land For people on earth, land means a stable life, walking and living on land, building ancestral halls and ancestral temples, and reproducing from generation to generation. And what is life at sea really like? Facing the huge, mysterious and unknown sea, how should people settle their &quot;rootless&quot; sea life that is destined to wander? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the ferry back and forth from Xuwen Port to Haikou, Sun Pin took a total of more than ten boats and tried to chat with the crew. Crew members are often very silent, especially ocean-going crew members. One or two years of sailing at sea often cause them to lose contact with their friends on land, and people on land gradually forget their existence. &quot;This kind of life on board is separated from the land. They are a world of their own, a world on board.&quot; When talking to Sun Pin, a captain called himself a &quot;seaman&quot;. She noticed the particularity of this term. &quot;Not a crew member or a sailor, but a seaman.&quot; &quot;This distinction is no longer a professional one, but a separation based on the fundamental standpoint of human beings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This loneliness will eventually Leading to what? Sun Pin discovered that after catching expensive fish, some fishermen would take the money from selling the fish and go to the city center, find a hotel room, eat some delicious food, spend the money and then go back to fishing. She heard that many ocean-going sailors were like this. When the ocean-going ship docked for supplies, they would disembark and desperately buy things. Sun Pin tried to explain the origin of this compensation mentality, &quot;For example, fishermen may die when they go out to sea in a small boat. Under this kind of impermanent fear, once you have a chance to get rid of or relax, you will desperately want to compensate yourself. .&quot; &quot;Or it may be a very simple idea, spend the money as soon as possible, in case I die tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sea is silent, and the people in the sea are silent. The ship is like a natural prison. &quot;Because of the narrow space and its separation from the land, it is likely to become a prison, and the crew will become prisoners, enduring torture-like loneliness.&quot; &quot;But, can we change it?&quot; How can we understand it from another perspective? This closed and isolated space can actually be turned into a Thoreau-style cabin, a unique space suitable for philosophical speculation?&quot; In the second chapter of the novel collection &quot;Seagull Knight&quot;, Sun Pin fictionalized a The captain wears a suit, combs his hair every day, burns incense, drinks tea, and plays the piano. &quot;He still behaves elegantly in a place where no one is around, just like a ghost duke dormant in an old castle... He is sometimes very easy-going, sometimes very...&quot; He is gloomy and occasionally fierce. When he is in a good mood, he will talk about literature and art elegantly. There is something between noble and gloomy in him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She wanted to ask, when a person is in a In such a closed and lonely environment, how can we find a broader and richer spiritual space for ourselves? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ITb5ucIQFPiL5aDf64GMrGUJvfQR2x1szlqjhh0m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;820&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ITb5ucIQFPiL5aDf64GMrGUJvfQR2x1szlqjhh0m.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259996&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In The Crack of Civilization&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Two years ago, Sun Pin&#39;s collection of novels &quot;In the Name of Birds and Beasts&quot; was published. Fan Xiaozhe, editor of People&#39;s Literature Publishing House, edited Sun Pin&#39;s book for the first time. &quot;Whether she writes about the grand and lush plants in the south, the rich aquatic products in the ocean, or the uninhabited dense forests in the north, these things are just the material of Sun Pin&#39;s novels,&quot; Fan Xiaozhe said, &quot;and in the end all novels point to modern times. Civilization (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Modernization, urbanization&lt;/span>;) has an inner impact on people, and at the same time, they are looking back or questioning.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In &quot;In the Name of Birds and Beasts&quot;, Sun Pin turns his attention to the mountain people in his hometown of Luliang Mountain. There, modern urban civilization is constantly entering this &quot;barbaric&quot; land. Sun Pin created a mountain man named You Xiaolong. He walked out of the mountains and had a decent civil servant job in the town. But this profession did not provide him with a sense of identity. “His roots are still in the mountains.” In Sun Pin’s view, what You Xiaolong represents is the suffering suffered by some people in the process of urbanization. “They My soul has nowhere to rest, I can’t go back to my hometown, and the city doesn’t belong to me.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Don’t you think this is the epitome of a large part of the people in China?” Sun Pin’s voice came from the other end of the phone. came, &quot;Of course, urbanization is a necessary stage in the development of human society. But in fact, every step of development of the times requires the blood and tears of hundreds of millions of people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The focus on urbanization also continues Go to the third novel in the new collection of novels, &quot;Sunset Coral&quot;. In the novel, Sun Pin meticulously recorded the urbanization process of Papaya Town: in the 1980s, 100,000 talents came to Hainan, and all the people in Papaya Town became small traders; in the 1990s, the Wenzhou real estate speculators allowed smuggled cars to invade and devour the entire town. And when the tourism and vacation trend started in Hainan Island, Papaya Town rushed to operate a coral B&amp;B... Between the city and the countryside, Sun Pin once again chose the gap between civilizations as the perspective of her thinking. The protagonist &quot;I&quot; in the novel once walked from Papaya Town to the city. &quot;I originally went to pursue modern civilization, but I could never really enter the city.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From north to south, from the mountains and forests to the sea, in the literary geography Under the changes of migration, Sun Pin always paid attention to the spiritual state that is not limited by geography, that has a certain universal &quot;solitude&quot; - the personal spirit that is difficult to place in the gap between modern civilization and the turmoil of the times. Therefore, what Fan Xiaozhe said about &quot;looking back&quot; not only constitutes the writer&#39;s fundamental questioning of modern civilization, but also Sun Pin&#39;s inner connection with his own life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Sun Pin, the &quot;post-80s&quot; generation, she feels that every change in the times has an impact on her and her generation. She witnessed workers being laid off during her childhood. As a teenager, she became a &quot;hard-working problem solver in a small town.&quot; &quot;By the time I graduated, the sense of superiority that still existed among college students in the 1990s had disappeared, and college students had turned into grains of dust.&quot; When she was in college, she would still think, &quot;We have entered the 21st century, how can we still be there?&quot; What is the difference between formal and non-establishment work?&quot; After working for a short time, her thoughts changed. The cruel reality of society seemed to have taught her what life is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Everything I have experienced and every change in society has definitely had an impact on me. And in the process, I am constantly thinking about the impact of each wave of the times. &quot;Individual coercion,&quot; when these thoughts slowly accumulate, &quot;you just want to express it.&quot; Sun Pin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from university, Sun Pin successively published novel collections &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Salt&quot; and &quot;Crack&quot;. Many readers and critics noticed the pain of soul and spirit in his works. &quot;Because you can only write about the pain if you really feel it, so I put high-concentration emotions into my early novels,&quot; Sun Pin said. As the title of the novel suggests, these creations reveal a young man&#39;s confrontation with society and the world, as well as his irreconcilable mental state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at her creations when she was in her twenties, Sun Pin felt that they were very normal and in line with a young person’s state of mind at that time and her understanding of the world. “When I didn’t understand society well enough, I walked into it. &quot;Without society&quot;, what follows is the weakness and helplessness of individuals, as well as the rupture and impact when they suddenly fall from the ivory tower built by literature and education into reality and face life head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s just that I can’t still burn my emotions as hard as I did when I was 20 years old at 40 years old. My novels when I was 20 years old focused on the deep and struggling hearts of young women. As I grow older, I will try to understand more people and pay attention to the wider world, which is interesting. Writers burn themselves throughout their lives, but later on, what I burn is no longer just emotions, It’s about a better understanding of this vast world.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While editing “In the Name of Birds and Beasts”, Fan Xiaozhe felt that Sun Pin “began to become more open-minded.” She believes, “In “Pain”, “Salt” and “Crack”, she paid more attention to individual pain, but starting from “In the Name of Birds and Beasts”, she combined some natural things, plants, mountains and rivers, including their backs The history of the world was brought out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anthropological writing inspired her. In anthropology, Sun Pin saw a deeper and more contextual care for human beings. She wrote &quot;In the Name of Birds and Beasts&quot;, using anthropological methods to deal with the changes in the mountains, the history of vegetation and mountains, and deeply describing the evolution of the lives of mountain people between the city and the mountains and forests. This persistent gaze on human beings and the world in which they live is full of patience and &quot;the greatest respect for different people.&quot; And when she looked at these mountain people, fishermen and sea people with the same patience, these &quot;wild&quot; people in the eyes of urban civilization, she truly realized the unique vitality among them. In &quot;The Rider of the White Horse&quot; she wrote about all kinds of strange mountain people, the bachelor brothers who raised their adopted daughter together, the short man who ran a peasant university in the mountains... &quot;You see, their living conditions are actually very difficult. You can also use the word barbaric to describe them,&quot; Sun Pin said, &quot;but their language and their thoughts are full of vitality. That kind of vitality does not belong to cities and civilization, but it is equally sincere and moving.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/M1E2gOKlClUjsXDouWgXuwEBVlGv9k0TDRGcW43M.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/M1E2gOKlUjsXDouWgXuwEBVlGv9k0TDRGcW43M.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260004&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sun Pin collects scenery at the seaside of Xuwen&#39;s Bocheng Port&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Orientation A Wider World&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the &quot;Seaside Magician&quot; new book sharing event, writer Li Jingze said: &quot;Although Sun Pin&#39;s creation has changed a lot, I feel that her direction has not changed. There has always been an intention to establish a connection between people and all things, which is particularly important. A common situation in Sun Pin&#39;s novels is that as we walk, there are fewer and fewer people, and where there are few people, all things thrive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As he grew older, Sun Pin found that he was less interested in people. &quot;When there is a lot of disappointment in people or human nature, or when one cannot find deep comfort in the crowd, this complex relationship between people will gradually become a cramped space that will constrain people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She got to know the plants and animals, the rivers she passed by, and tried to communicate with people who didn&#39;t speak Mandarin to try to understand them. &quot;This itself is a very interesting process,&quot; Sun Pin said, &quot;because you are gradually understanding the world, and this is actually very healing for people living in high-rise buildings.&quot; When she came to the mountains from the city Like the ocean, regional changes affect the state of mind of those who are in it. &quot;You will become more and more tolerant.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This change in the state of mind in life ultimately changed her creation. &quot;My early novels were entangled in the relationships between people, and then I got a little tired of this kind of writing,&quot; Sun Pin said. &quot;It doesn&#39;t make much sense to continue writing like this. I want to make some attempts and adjustments. Moreover, I think every writer’s attempt must have a premise that makes himself feel relaxed and happy, and has the function of healing and nourishing the author himself. It is impossible for a person to say that I write to do hard labor and write about those things. Things that I don’t want to write, even if it can bring more fame to the writer himself.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Pin imagined himself becoming the fictional captain in “Seagull Rider”, trying to create a better , greater spiritual space - &quot;Because writing itself is the healing and placement of oneself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that moment, I thought, if everything is really animistic, then a person After death, you just leave human society, but enter a broader world. In that world, plants, animals, mountains, rivers, sun, moon, oceans, hurricanes, gods, dead souls, monsters, and elves are all They can communicate with each other. This kind of communication cannot be seen by living people, but some traces are revealed in those who are lonely and traumatized...&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The Magician of the Sea&quot;&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Escape and settlement exist at the same time,&quot; Sun Pin said, &quot;You can understand this kind of escape as a result of people&#39;s Escape caused by the powerlessness of reality and the material world, but at the same time, in the process of escaping, you also construct a new world for yourself, a world that belongs to all things, no longer limited to human beings, but in the world of heaven and earth. Time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Questions still exist. Fan Xiaozhe believes that Sun Pin&#39;s creations always deal with her inner confusion. &quot;First of all, she felt that communication between people in modern civilization is difficult, so she became confused.&quot; &quot;In &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Salt&quot; and &quot; &quot;In &quot;Split&quot;, she started from her individual feelings and constantly wrote about confusion.&quot; &quot;Later, she further inquired about the source of confusion. Is this a human problem or a social problem?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; At this stage, she did not look for answers among the crowd, but looked for them in all things.&quot; On the edge of modern civilization, in the depths of mountains, forests and islands that no one knows, those ships, sailors, mountain people, birds and beasts , are all self-consistent. &quot;In all things, her confusion was diluted and alleviated, or healed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Pin likes the &quot;elf-like temperament&quot; in Emily Dickinson&#39;s poems, and also likes Shen Congwen&#39;s poems. Writing, this kind of textual atmosphere is the state she yearns for, &quot;In him, there is no trace of integration between human beings and all things in nature, very comfortable and natural stitching and connection.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 17:25:12 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尼泊尔爆发抗议：君主与共和之争？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261760]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“Whistles sounded frequently at the scene, and a large number of police officers gathered together. They were wearing body armor, holding shields, and motorcycles. The sound of the car starting kept making a loud sound, and many people gathered around to watch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recalling the scene a few days ago, the Nepali Mata still remembers it fresh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 23, 2023, thousands of people came to Kathmandu, Nepal, to hold a large-scale demonstration. &quot;Restore the monarchy, abolish the republic,&quot; chanted protesters in Kathmandu, Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to local police estimates, about 9,000 people participated in the protest called by Durga Prasai, a former member of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and medical entrepreneur. Although police described the demonstration as &quot;largely peaceful,&quot; two workers suffered minor injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Addressing the crowd later that afternoon, Prasai urged his supporters to break through the security cordon and march towards Maitigal. Police then used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As political competition between the current republic and the pro-monarchy has intensified recently, the Nepali government has deployed about 10,000 security personnel from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and investigators to prevent the two groups from interfering. possible conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The capital is &quot;in chaos&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhu Ming opened a restaurant in Nepal. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Nepal is an overall peaceful country, but in terms of certain political needs, Nepal There would be riots from time to time. Nowadays there are local police on every main street to maintain order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young man Kariqi remembers clearly that the protest conflict took place at an intersection in the capital. People gathered and ran at the scene, and police sirens were heard continuously. “There was the sound of some kind of gunshots being fired, and there was an obvious Smoke Trail”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the local police fired 146 tear gas canisters and 5 rubber bullets to disperse Plase supporters in Barku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse, who claims to be a maverick and has been adhering to anti-government and anti-corruption stances in recent times, said in a speech at the rally that Prime Minister Prachanda failed to rule the country and the country was heading towards bankruptcy and demanded that &quot;He surrendered to the people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse also claimed that his supporters would continue to hold protests elsewhere and would ignore Kathmandu&#39;s ban. Earlier, the government declared the Baneshwar stretch of Maiti as a no-go zone for protests. He said his campaign would not stop until the monarchy, the Hindu state and the 1990 constitution were restored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse has long been considered a &quot;controversial&quot; businessman who is trying to overthrow Nepal&#39;s current government and calls the protests a &quot;national rescue operation.&quot; He said the protests were against the government&#39;s failure to curb anarchy, corruption and rising inflation. Prashay wanted to restore the monarchy and the Hindu state by abolishing the current federal, republican and secular institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also asked for the support of businessmen in the capital at the protest site, asking them to close their businesses from November 24. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youth wing of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist), the Rastiya Youth Party, and its student wing, the Nepal National Free Students Union, also participated in the demonstration in Tinkun. There are also many protesters who came to Kathmandu from the southern plains of Nepal. They are also &quot;victims&quot; of bank microfinance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse said that banks are trying their best to exploit borrowers&#39; money and called on people to give up their loans in banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, demonstrators supporting the current republican regime also took to the streets. They believe that only a republic can guarantee social justice and equality and &quot;allow everyone to have the opportunity to realize their dreams and pursuits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the scene of the conflict, pro-monarchy protesters and counter-protesters clashed. The anger of the protesters spread from Barku, the designated protest area, to various areas such as Tinkunne, Garigaon, Sundara, Thapatali, Fudong and other key points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Kathmandu police arrested a total of 261 protesters, set up roadblocks and water cannons on the streets, and installed closed-circuit television to monitor Praset&#39;s supporters around the clock. Police have also deployed additional sniffer dogs around the conflict site and on rooftops to ensure safety and prevent possible incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in order to prevent conflicts between rival groups, the police designated two different protest areas. But the opposition between those who support the monarchy and those who support the republic is huge and will lead to heightened tensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhu Ming said that the protests had little impact on local life. Because the protesters marched in designated areas, except for traffic closures during the march, other areas including the main business district and the World Tourist Center were not affected, and shops were open for business normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political systems in conflict&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nepal, nestled in the Himalayas, has a rich and colorful culture, natural landscape and political history. But its political system evolved over the centuries, from a feudal monarchy to a federal democratic republic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu, an associate researcher at the Institute of South Asia at Sichuan University, said that the current republic has indeed achieved certain positive results since its establishment, including the expansion of people&#39;s democratic rights and more protections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the beginning of the 21st century, Nepalese politics underwent major changes. In 2006, Nepal&#39;s civil war ended and the government and rebels signed a peace agreement. Two years later, in 2008, Nepal officially declared itself a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, the head of state became the president, and power was dispersed among the central government, federal state governments, and local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the Nepali government began to formulate a new constitution and established a federal system. Nepal is divided into seven federal states, each of which has a certain degree of autonomy and is responsible for managing its own affairs. This constitution-making process went through many political crises and protests, but was finally adopted in 2015 and became the current constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are mainly two groups of people who are dissatisfied with the republic.” Zeng Xiangyu said that one group of people are young people who have grown up with modern education and have more expectations for the country. Another group of people are those who have experienced the monarchy era. They believe that although the monarchy has many shortcomings, politicians can at least compete within a limited range and achieve general stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that modern politics in Nepal is still in the process of being cultivated. The current chaos is not due to problems with the political system itself, but due to problems with the politician class, which leads to the operation of the current system. There are many problems and there is a lot of dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Political instability has plagued Nepal since the end of the monarchy, with more than a dozen changes of government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that although there is currently no situation similar to previous civil wars in Nepal, the political arena has long been trapped in party disputes and the political situation has been unstable for a long time. Political parties continue to divide and change their policies, leaving voters disappointed. Voters hope to establish a stable government through elections and put the country on the right track, but politicians often use votes as bargaining chips in party political negotiations, causing strong dissatisfaction among voters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Politically unstable and economic development has slowed, millions of young people have left the country in search of work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu told Southern Weekend reporters that Nepal’s economic development has been slowing down and the people are in an extremely confused and trapped state. Many people who study abroad or are active abroad are unwilling to come back. Some young people prefer to work in the Gulf or India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recent protests have also shown the disputes and differences within Nepali society over the political system. Clearly, Nepali politics still faces some challenges and problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Ming sometimes &quot;chats&quot; with protesters. He said the protesters&#39; real demand was a return to the days of king power. &quot;Because only the king will think about the people.&quot; He said that the protesters believe that no matter which party they are, they represent their own interests and will be bribed by different international forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many political forces in Nepal, behind which are the behind-the-scenes interest transactions of various political parties.” Zeng Xiangyu believes that although this is a shortcoming of the current republican system, it is different from the previous fierce confrontation or civil war era. Than, &quot;It&#39;s always better&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Are the &quot;curry smell&quot; protests effective? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that conflicts and violent protests have occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kathmandu police said that on the afternoon of September 7, 2023, 47-year-old Shyam Sapkota attacked Yadav, co-general secretary of the Nepali Congress Party, in Kathmandu. He suffered deep cuts on the back of his neck and was taken to hospital for treatment by police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, a video circulated on social media showed Sapkota shouting for the restoration of the country&#39;s monarchy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu activists marched on the streets of Kathmandu, demanding the restoration of the monarchy and Nepal as a Hindu country, and the abolition of the federal system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Controversy over the constitutional system has always existed. It has been dragged on for many years and has not yet been completely resolved.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is noteworthy that Nepal is a multi-ethnic country, and there are tensions and differences between different ethnic and social groups. Some local people are dissatisfied with the federal demarcation and distribution of autonomy, which has led to protests and political unrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that as a federal country in Nepal, the relationship between the central government and the provinces, as well as how to name the provinces and where the capital is located, are all issues that have caused huge controversy. &quot;In the era of the king, there were As the controversial issue continues to this day, the controversy becomes even greater.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Nepal&#39;s political status quo remains turbulent. There are serious differences in political philosophy between supporters of the monarchy and the republic. This opposition is not limited to ideology, but also involves the people&#39;s views on the future of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Nepal&#39;s political parties, especially the mainstream political parties, are dividing and forming groups very quickly, and they focus entirely on political interests.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu commented that each political party does not regard specific policies that are beneficial to the country as its work Instead, he is keen on party struggle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the march, Zhu Ming asked those participating in the protest &quot;whether they will succeed.&quot; The answer he got was &quot;yes.&quot; But judging from the current results, &quot;there is a high probability that it has not achieved its goal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that Nepal’s political situation will not undergo major fluctuations due to this protest, and will continue on its original track. Several political parties are divided into groups, and for the sake of political interests, they will continue to &quot;you sing and I will &quot;Debut&quot;, there will be no major breakthroughs in economic and social development for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Democracy and republic cannot make mistakes.” Regarding this protest, Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) Oli said that individual people in power may make mistakes, but this does not mean that the entire system is defective . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oli said the restoration of the monarchy was unthinkable. Just as humans cannot go back to the Stone Age, we cannot go back to monarchy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The goals of the protesters are impossible to achieve.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that the monarchy is a thing of the past and does not conform to the trend of the times.

In the 1920s, my grandfather moved the family to Shanghai. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933)&lt;/span>; the sixteenth day of the ninth lunar month, I was born in &quot;Jianye Lane&quot;, Fululi Road, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(now Jianguo West Road)&lt;/span>; in the French Concession in Shanghai. October 30, 2023 is my 90th birthday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When my wife Zeng Hanying and I revisited our former residence at the beginning of this century, Jianyeli had become a dilapidated building and was about to be demolished and rebuilt, and the residents had all moved out. The guard asked about the purpose of his visit and allowed me, an old resident, to go in and walk around, leaving this photo at the door of the alley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 1946, I returned to Jiujiang with my parents and lived in the ancestral house bought by my grandfather on Dutian Lane. It was an old house with two front and back floors. When Jiujiang was liberated in May 1949, I was a freshman in Tongwen Middle School. In the spring of 1951, when he was about to enter his junior year of high school, he was ordered to study at the Central South Youth League School in Wuhan &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Jiangxi Province was then part of the Central South District)&lt;/span>;. When I returned from graduation in July, the Communist Youth League Committee asked me to stay in the student department and formally join the workforce. The pace of life slows down. I was not used to the life of a government cadre. At this time, the first unified entrance examination for colleges and universities across the country had passed. Suddenly I found that Shandong University School of Medicine had to recruit students separately, so I asked to resign and study further. The student minister agreed, but the organization minister believed that this was caused by bourgeois individualism, and he refused to obey the organization&#39;s decision and ordered him to &quot;resign&quot; from the group. This was the first political blow I suffered and became my “original sin.” People of insight believe that the ups and downs I experienced in the first half of my life were all related to this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being forced to &quot;resign&quot; from the group, he bid farewell to his parents, sadly left home, and went to Qingdao to successfully enter the School of Medicine at Shanda University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f4d1658ee.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1541&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f4d1658ee.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Registration photo for Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although I have never thought about studying medicine, I have to do this, otherwise I will have to wait another year. Later I discovered that this passively accepted major also protected me to a great extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I paid a heavy price to get the opportunity to enter a higher education, I learned from the experience and worked harder than ever before. At that time, there were no textbooks in the university, so I mainly relied on taking notes during class. I listened attentively, requiring myself not only to understand, but also to remember in class. After class, I compiled notes from memory, and then supplemented them with Chinese and foreign materials I read in the library, so I learned more than what I heard in class. of more. I was the first in the class in every test score in all courses during college. Mr. Lu Yunming, professor of Physiology, made an exception and gave me 110 points on the 100% test paper because my answer exceeded what he taught in class. Thirty years later, I returned to Qingdao to attend the school anniversary event, and Mr. Lu happily mentioned this to me. Importantly, I also started my medical translation career at Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/729c561658.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/729c561658.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;While studying at Shandong University, I took photos on the Qingdao beachfront. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the clinical course, I learned that there is a world-renowned medical masterpiece &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; in the United States. The teachers jokingly called it the &quot;Das Kapital&quot; of clinical medicine. I went to the school library to register and queue up, and borrowed this heavy masterpiece. While reading and studying, I was deeply impressed by its profoundness, systematic and rigorous discussion, and its emphasis on the connection between clinical and basic theory, so I came up with the idea of ​​translating it into Chinese. I think this is a very meaningful thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I want to do it in two steps: first translate a smaller book, and then move on to that big book after gaining experience. Later, I chose &quot;An Approach to Clinical Surgery&lt;/em>;&quot; (&lt;em>;An Approach to Clinical Surgery&lt;/em>;) written by Professor HC Owens of the United Kingdom for interns and junior residents. I felt that the content of this book was It&#39;s something I can control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, whether I wanted to translate &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; or tried to translate this booklet, it was still a secret of mine at that time. There was only one close friend in the same class&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Piren)&lt;/span>;Knowing this, he has always been optimistic about me and encouraged me, and even found a &quot;secret&quot; translation place for me, which is the small building on the roof of the third surgical ward. attic. It was a low, cramped small room covered with cobwebs and dust. I had to bend down to get in. The &quot;tables&quot; are stacked soap boxes, sitting on bricks wrapped in newspaper. I get up early every morning and hide here to translate books. There was no electricity in the attic, so candles were the only way to light it. My eyesight is not good. When I look closely, I often smell a burning smell, which means my hair is burning. I work until six or seven o&#39;clock and quietly return to the dormitory, keeping up with the rhythm of life of my classmates, washing, eating, and going to the ward together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/e53a0d5f09.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/e53a0d5f09.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260453&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photos from the time when I was secretly translating books in the attic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I kept a low profile and did a good job of keeping it secret. Until I finished translating this little book of more than 200,000 words, no one discovered my &quot;underground activities.&quot; In 1993, I returned to Qingdao to attend the anniversary event of my alma mater. Liu Jingru, my classmate who lived in the bunk below me, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(then the director of the Qingdao Municipal Health Bureau)&lt;/ span>;Admitted that he had no idea about these activities of mine at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/400851e4cb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/400851e4cb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1993, he returned to Qingdao Medical University to participate in the school anniversary event and took a photo with his old classmate Liu Jingru (middle), who was the director of the Qingdao Health Bureau at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; was published by Shanghai Health Publishing House in 1957, I had already graduated and was working in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cf8354f25c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1078&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cf8354f25c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260455&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After this little book was published, I went through many ups and downs and almost lost everything. This is a used book I bought online. I accidentally found it on a used book website. At least it is still good. There have been three reprints: Shanghai Science and Technology Press (1960, 1961) and Hong Kong Commercial Press (1970). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enter &quot;His&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The publication of &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; gave me great encouragement. I bought back the 9th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and began to It marches on. This translation is not an &quot;underground activity&quot;. My colleagues all know that I am doing it. But I was unlucky, and soon the anti-rightist movement came. Although I got through 1957, the year when I became famous, safely, because the hospital&#39;s anti-rightist goals were not fulfilled, in June 1958, I was still classified as a rightist for &quot;unreasonable opinions&quot; on Soviet medicine. By this time, the anti-rightist climax had passed, and I and two other right-wing recruits were not sent out. We stayed in the hospital to supervise labor and were given a monthly living allowance of 32 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, the hospital was suddenly ordered to move to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia to support the local Great Leap Forward. The pressure I feel is also increasing. Finally, on a bright and clear night, the translated manuscript of the 9th edition of &quot;His&quot;, about 400,000 words, was burned in a wasteland next to the hospital. Although I felt very miserable, I could still convince myself: now is not the time to translate books, and I must first try to take off this &quot;hat&quot; on my head. Science is always evolving, and a new version will come out when the time comes, and I will start over. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1960, I have been ordered to act as &quot;acting attending physician&quot;. Every morning, I lead the residents and interns on ward rounds. At this time, I am their superior. After the ward rounds, they return to the office and I sweep the floor, clean the tables, and empty the toilets for the patients. Whatever patients need me to do and I can do, I do it proactively. Because I am different from them, I am a right-winger under supervision. At that time, they were the enemies of the people, the &quot;reactionaries&quot;. So what I think about day and night and think about in my heart is &quot;taking off my hat&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking forward to the stars, looking forward to the moon, and finally looking forward to this day. In November 1961, the Party Committee of the Academy announced that I would be &quot;retired&quot;. At this time, the situation also changed a lot: the Soviet Union became the &quot;Soviet revisionist&quot; and the target of our criticism, and was no longer the &quot;big brother&quot;. I returned to my old business, bought the 11th edition of &quot;His&quot;, and started to study &quot;His&quot; again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as luck would have it, the &quot;Four Cleanups&quot; movement came again. The leader of the working group leading the movement warned me: Don’t relapse, as the “rightist” label can be put back on again after you take it off! These words hit home for me. I have to pull back from the brink! Finally, the re-translated 11th edition of the manuscript of &quot;His&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (also more than 400,000 words)&lt;/span>; was placed next to the hospital. The wasteland was set on fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A famous person once said that the most painful thing in life is waking up from a dream with no way out. When I am wearing the &quot;hat&quot;, I can dream about doing it again after taking off the &quot;hat&quot;. What path can I take now, what can I dream about? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life is sometimes cruel but also interesting: more than twenty years later, I was invited to return to Hohhot. When I was discussing with scientific and technical personnel in the Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Building, I discovered that this building is the same hospital where I used to work. Next, it was built on the wasteland where I burned manuscripts twice. I couldn’t help but tell them about this past event. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Upgrade again&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot; movement has not yet completely ended, but it has entered a decade of catastrophe. I was punished as a &quot;rightist without hats&quot; and upgraded to an &quot;active counterrevolutionary&quot;. I was sentenced to 12 years in prison, deprived of political rights for 4 years, and entered a labor camp. Fortunately, the authorities took advantage of my skills and allowed me to serve my sentence in the health department of the labor camp, avoiding regular labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1971, Cheng Dalu, a fellow prisoner who was released after serving his sentence, gave me a tightly wrapped &quot;gift&quot;. When I opened it, I saw that it was the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;! Cheng Dalu was an educated youth from Shanghai who was transferred to Shanxi. He was sentenced to five years in prison for &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; crimes. He was hospitalized here for a long time because of pleurisy. We get along well. He knew that I was determined to translate &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and kept it in mind. At that time, it was stipulated that people who lived in big cities and along the coast could not go home after release and had to stay in the factory >;Employment. So he could take advantage of the fact that every day after the prisoners went to work and there were no guards in the cell, he could send me books. Cheng Dalu only has a &quot;salary&quot; of 29 yuan per month, and he also has to support his younger sister who is sent to Anhui. But after he discovered the newly released &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; (photocopy) in a foreign language bookstore, he tried every means and sold his clothes to buy it for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/b574c980bd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/b574c980bd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1984, we met again after the robbery on Hechengda Road in Jiujiang (left in the picture). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly I saw the long-lost &quot;He&quot;, things have changed and people have changed, and the feeling in my heart is really indescribable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the prisoners go to work every day, they eat lunch at the construction site and do not return from work until 6 p.m. So I can read a book after I finish handling the affairs in the ward in the morning, and I can calm down by eight or nine o&#39;clock after I finish handling the patients sent by each team for consultation in the evening. I looked through the 13th edition of &quot;His&quot; and found that with the advancement of the times, the content is very different from previous editions. His Majesty himself has long since retired. There are 177 authors of this book. The chief editor is Professor Paul B. Beeson of Oxford University (later transferred to the University of Washington in the United States). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c79b574a0b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1437&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c79b574a0b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A signed photo given to me by Bison, chief editor of the 13th, 14th and 15th editions of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Translating books in prison&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but want to use this opportunity to translate books. I didn&#39;t do it impulsively or whimsically, but after careful consideration and serious consideration. Since I arrived at the labor reform team, I have been conscientious and cautious in my work, as if I were facing an abyss or walking on thin ice. I have never made any mistakes or had any medical accidents, especially using the microscopes that have been idle for a long time and the microscopes I found in the warehouse of the main factory. Analytical balances, photoelectric colorimeter, and laboratory were established to perform clinical and biochemical tests carried out in general hospitals at the time One year&#39;s reward)&lt;/span>;, so the leader trusts me very much. I think I can win the support of the leadership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to regulations, cadres are not allowed to come to see me for medical treatment. However, starting from the factory leader and political commissar Li Hengwen, they often come to see me for medical treatment. Of course, I have no right to refuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Political Commissar Li came to see me again that day. He was about fifty years old at the time, a veteran anti-Japanese cadre and former public security chief. He often suffers from a slow heart rate and the cause is unknown. After careful examination and examination, I thought it was a manifestation of coronary heart disease. At that time when supplies were in short supply and people were generally malnourished, coronary heart disease was still very rare in China. Large hospitals occasionally saw a few cases of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and the papers they wrote could be published in national academic journals. Doctors have little experience with this and have difficulty accessing foreign medical information. Later, hospitals outside the hospital also recognized my diagnosis, which also increased Political Commissar Li&#39;s trust in me and asked me how I came to have coronary heart disease from a slow heart rate. I took the opportunity to bring out the big book and said that it was what it told me and I wanted to translate it so that more Chinese doctors could read it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Commissar Li flipped through the big book but did not answer me. No words were spoken for a long time. I felt a little uneasy and should not have presumed to make this request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He closed the book and said to me: &quot;Since it is such a good book, you can translate it here. We support you. If the translation cannot be published, we will print it for you!&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That’s what he said, and I still remember it vividly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Learning &quot;Dumb Japanese&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In this way, I translated &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; for the third time in the labor camp, hoping to realize my wish as a student. Translating books in such a closed environment naturally presents many difficulties. Although there were many capable people among the reform-through-labor prisoners during that period, it was still difficult to find anyone to discuss the more professional issues. I remember that when I translated a piece of content about CT, I got stuck. Nowadays, CT is a household name, but at that time, CT had just come out. I couldn&#39;t guess from the two English words &quot;computerized tomography&quot; what this &quot;artifact&quot; for examination, referred to as CT, was , SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(literally &quot;computer-processed tomography&quot;)&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a message from prisoners in this city and ask their families to help find explanatory materials about CT. I finally found a copy and sent it in, but it was in Japanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There happens to be a Japanese expert in the ward: Mr. Luo Yuanzhen, professor of the Department of History of Shanxi University. Mr. Luo studied at Waseda University in Japan in his early years and married a Japanese lady &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (suspected to be a &quot;Japanese spy&quot;)&lt;/span>;. He is a &quot;future&quot; &quot;Convicted criminals&quot; were also sent as the detention center was overcrowded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Mr. Luo, who is separated by lines and is proficient in Japanese, cannot read the Japanese information about CT, saying that you can only read it yourself; if you don’t understand Japanese, you can learn it. I&#39;m still a little hesitant: Is it too much to learn a foreign language just to read some Japanese information? Mr. Luo said that it can be done quickly: learn &quot;dumb Japanese&quot; and just read books, not speak or write articles, it only takes a few months. In that environment, there was no choice but this. So the translation was suspended and I started learning Japanese with Mr. Luo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/0f3bf689c9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1467&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/0f3bf689c9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260458&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The Japanese teacher in prison, Professor Luo Yuanzhen (1906-1993), a professor in Shanxi University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After checking the room every day, I invite Luo to my room. span>; Come and learn Japanese.

The code is like a hill, trembling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The wish of the student period is finally completed, but Shaohua is no longer, and I am no longer young. I still translate books in such a situation, which is regrettable! Although I can feel a little gratifying, almost at the same time, at the same time, another kind of unspeakable sadness has penetrated my body and mind: Will I be forced to burn them again ... &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; At this time, the night was quiet, and the monitoring room was silent.

This is the twice of Comrade Xiaoping, and proposed the result of Mao Zedong&#39;s &quot;three instructions as the outline&quot;, and all walks of life must be rectified. I was arrested and sentenced in 1967. Based on this, I have been serving for 8 years, so I decided to change the sentence for 8 years. But they do n’t understand that I have been reduced for 1 year. The day of the judgment was September 27, 1975. Sit more and sit more. At that time, there was no state compensation, and I had nothing to say. The Labor Reform team decided to let people go, and allowed me to take away all the translation of all the 13th edition of &quot;He&#39;s Internal Science&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/bed71ffd4f.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 606 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/bed71ffd4f.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260459 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The 13th edition of the 13th edition of &quot;Hishei Science&quot; translated in prison is 3.4 million words in the book, and the Jiujiang Museum is now Tibetan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Back to the home of Jiujiang, depending on his mother.

This was a huge amount at the time. When I was waiting to be approved step by step, I went to the Inner Mongolia People&#39;s Publishing House to inquire about publishing for a manuscript. The editor Xu Cheng, who received my editor, is the deputy director of the head of the Technology Editorial Office. Xu Cheng was not interested in the manuscript of his friend. He asked casually: Is there any manuscript? I also said casually: &quot;Are you interested in the big manuscript?&quot; Hishene Science &quot;.&quot; I don&#39;t want Xu Cheng&#39;s eyes to light up, and it&#39;s coming. He asked the manuscript and my situation carefully and asked me to give him a little time. Twenty days later, Xu Cheng ran to me to sign a contract, saying that they decided to publish them in 10 volumes, and they were out for three years! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xu Cheng&#39;s words surprised me: A book of such a big book decided? We never know each other. How can he trust me? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this day, around this book, he has done a lot of work: he knows that I am a doctor and inquire about my name in Inner Mongolia. The ministry&#39;s &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; has been carefully read; two seminars have been opened, and one of them specially went to Beijing to open. Then report to the leaders and signed me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think more important reasons should be: reform and opening up, all of which are awake, people are eager to understand the outside world, but after these years of tossing, English talents are rare. Live, there is this ready -made translation. This is my luck, but it is actually my luck. Nevertheless, I admire Xu Cheng&#39;s professionalism. He was 12 years younger than me and graduated from the Department of Biology, Inner Mongolia in 1966. I will become a lifetime with him in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1499da72df.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 871 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1499da72df.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260460 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Xu Cheng (Tu right) talks about the press &quot;Hishene Science&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Back to Jiujiang, I immediately sent the first &quot;Book 5&quot; cardiovascular disease translation to Xu Cheng. At that time, printing was still the age of the lead. Choose this album first, not because I am a doctor of this major, but because Xu Cheng&#39;s marketing considerations: there are many patients with cardiovascular patients. &quot;>; (Later, it was true, and the first printed 10,000 volumes were out of stock after two months, and then added) &lt;/span>; &lt;/span>;. However, during the typesetting period, I received the 15th edition of &quot;He&#39;s&quot;, and the content has also changed a lot! The author has increased to 277, and the length of the book has also expanded to about 5 million words, and even the arrangement style is very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is another severe test for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I can take a more relaxed road: According to the requirements of the contract, I will post the completed translations one after another, and use the book for 3 years. This is not backward internationally. But after all, I do not publish a book for the book, but to pursue it as a career. If I can&#39;t dedicate the latest and best version to the reader, even if this book comes out, it will leave deep regrets. I experienced a fierce inner struggle at night. Dawn got up and wrote to Xu Cheng. The letter just sent it. I couldn&#39;t help but go to the Telecommunications Bureau to call him a long -distance call to explain the original committee. Please immediately notify the printing factory to stop the printing and recover the translation. For the manuscript, I decided to start from scratch and re -translate the 15th edition of the book to ensure that the 5th band of the first ranking of the first row within three months was about 500,000 words of translation. The 10 banks in the book will still be in about 3 years! &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Re -translation of the 15th edition &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; This is my fifth translation of &quot;He&#39;s&quot; to achieve the success of the early years. I know the difficulty and workload of re -translation of the book, but I think it is much more convenient to translate books in the labor reform team. In order to grab time, I have never had any holidays, and the lunch habit that has been developed over the years has also been eliminated. From the beginning of the morning every morning, Xingxing Yexian, work in desk. In February 1982, the 5th Substance of the Lena was published as scheduled. At the end of December 1984, a total of 4.7 million words were finally completed in the 15th edition of &quot;Hishene Science&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f1b522794.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;Height =&quot; 1441 &quot;Data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f1b522794.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260461 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Re-translate the 15th edition of &quot;He&#39;s Internal Science&quot; day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 1985, all the ten albums were all out.

The Ministry of Health decided to set up a &quot;Medical Translation Special Award&quot;. In February 1987, Minister Cui Yueli awarded me in the Ministry of Health. His wife Zeng Hanying was also invited to participate in the award ceremony due to the hard work during the translation and publishing process. This prize so far is the only one.

During the Republic of China, the Chinese Medical Association organized a group of domestic experts to collectively translate and publish the 7th edition of the 7th edition of &quot;Heri&quot;, but it is limited to the relevant content of the Department of Internal Medicine, not the whole book, so it uses the title of &quot;Hythi Science&quot;. In addition to the various systems of clinical medicine, the original book also includes related content such as surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology, eye, ear, nose and throat, and public health, medical statistics, clinical testing and radiation diagnosis, medical genetic and ethics. So the original book title is &quot;&lt;em>; Cecil Textbook of Medicine &lt;/em>; &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (&quot; &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot; &quot;FONT-FAMILY: Kai, Kaiti_GB2312, Simkai, Stkaiti;&quot;>; Heri Medical Textbook &quot;) &lt;/span>;.

Buyers still come, and there is endless stream. An old man rode from the suburbs to buy books early. He is an engineer, and he does not have a medicine at home. When I signed for him, I reminded him that this is not a science book, but he still insists on buying. In the future, when I did the work of the 17th and 18th editions of &quot;He&#39;s&quot;, the leader actually decided that the translation draft first serialized in a comprehensive medical journal, and the translation &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kai style_ GB2312, SIMKAI, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (added the publication space for this) &lt;/span>;, finished the year, and then published a bookmaker. After this decision was seen, the postal volume of the journal increased by nearly tripled that year! These are unimaginable and difficult to understand now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a world medical masterpiece, &quot;Hishene Science&quot; has intended to be a variety of text translations, Japan, Western, Portuguese and other text translations.

Medical insurance fund. Our bureau attaches great importance to it. Based on the data screening and analysis, on August 8, a provincial and municipal joint inspection team of more than 20 people was formed with the Wuhu Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau to station in the hospital to conduct an investigation on the hospital charges and medical insurance reimbursements during the hospitalization of the reporter’s father. Conduct a comprehensive verification. Through medical record verification, on-site questioning and data comparison, it was verified that 10 of the 15 issues involved in the report were basically true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, the hospital had problems such as over-diagnosis and treatment, over-examination, over-prescribing of medicines, repeated charges, fraudulent charges, and excessive charges, involving illegal medical expenses of 218,200 yuan, including illegal use of medical insurance funds. 187,000 yuan. In order to maintain the safety of the medical insurance fund and protect the legitimate rights and interests of patients, according to the medical insurance service agreement for designated medical institutions signed between the hospital and the Wuhu Municipal Medical Insurance Department, the Wuhu Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau first handled the matter in accordance with the agreement: First, the medical insurance fund used in violation of regulations was recovered in full , and a penalty of 56,074.41 yuan was deducted at the maximum rate of 30%; the second was to interview the relevant person in charge of the hospital and order him to make immediate rectifications; the third was to hand it over to the public security and health departments for further verification and processing.

This money was supposed to be used to prepare me for big things. But there are very few people who are as miserable as Zhu Dan and have no friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Zhu Dan revealed when participating in a program that he was defrauded of all his savings by a friend many years ago. She was deceived by her friend into being a debt guarantor and wrote her name on a blank piece of paper. As a result, she was forced to use all her savings to pay off all her friend&#39;s debts. Even if he won the lawsuit, the matter would end in Zhu Dan&#39;s misfortune because his shameless friend declared &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much this money is, many people are concerned about this issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the parties did not disclose specific figures, it is impossible to confirm. But this is not important, because we only need to know that this amount of money is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The important thing is that this incident happened while Zhu Dan and Yiwei Yiwei were in love, but Yiwei Yi chose to repay the debt with Zhu Dan. In the program, when Zhu Dan recounted this unbearable event in a calm tone with red eyes under the wind chimes, Yiwei Yiwei looked at her with a distressed and forgiving look, as if he were facing a child who had been wronged. This scene It’s very emotional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that many people have met people who do things without thinking, otherwise there would be so many &quot;easy to deceive people&quot; in the world. How stupid is Zhu Dan&#39;s hasty behavior? As one netizen said, your behavior as a human being should not be too outrageous, and you must have a basic bottom line. Zhu Dan&#39;s best friend sent her a piece of white paper, and she dared to sign it. It was difficult for a middle school student to do this. Even the judge couldn&#39;t help &quot;teaching&quot; Zhu Dan that he was legally illiterate. As long as he signed on the white paper, It is equivalent to admitting everything on this piece of paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said that he does not have such a wife, but he has such a mother. These words also touched the sensitive parts of many people&#39;s hearts. I have relatives and friends who are like this. They don&#39;t listen to anything they say, and they only wake up after being deceived. However, it doesn&#39;t take long for them to fall into new routines again. As the saying goes, &quot;Dangdang is different&quot;, some people just can&#39;t get out of this tragic scam &quot;reincarnation&quot;. What can you do? Anyway, I heard that in addition to some parents &quot;paying the bill&quot; for their deceived children, there are many examples of couples breaking up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I very much agree with what this netizen said: Yiwei Yi helped her pay off the debt. This behavior cannot be described as high-spirited and upright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Yiwei Yi seems to be indifferent to Zhu Dan, which is one of the reasons why some &quot;black fans&quot; have been criticizing Yiwei. Not only do they feel that Yiwei is not good to Zhu Dan, but they also habitually show off in public places. The &quot;poker-faced&quot; Zhou Yiwei got a lot of insults on his head. There are even rumors that the two are getting married. But now, many netizens woke up from the misunderstanding and discovered that Yiwei Yiwei is so good - &quot;I apologize for talking about Yiwei before. If he can avoid divorce after such a thing, I respect him as a real man.&quot; &quot;We endure hardships and enjoy happiness together.&quot; &quot;There are not many people who can repay debts together. And it&#39;s a man, even less.&quot; &quot;I thought he was quite shrewd, and it seemed like he was in love. I thought this kind of thing could only be done by parents to their children.&quot; &quot;Come out&quot; &quot;Yiwei Zhou is a relatively aloof but loyal type&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You know, at that time Yiwei could have broken up with Zhu Dan without having to sacrifice himself. Even if the two are already married, Yiwei Yi has every reason to ignore the &quot;bad debt&quot;. After all, even according to the marriage law, it is not his responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Dan was tricked by his friends, which is a typical example of being defrauded. According to legal principles, whether you have an obligation to repay debts caused by being defrauded depends on whether the debts are used jointly by the husband and wife. Unless there is evidence to prove that the debt belongs to the couple&#39;s common living use, the other party has no obligation and responsibility to repay it. Obviously, the occurrence of Zhu Dan&#39;s debt had nothing to do with Zhou Wei, nor was it the result of a joint discussion between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s ridiculous is that one netizen even commented that Zhou Yiwei actually used this matter to manipulate Zhu Dan and gain a useful slave. This is illogical. What can you do if you have tens of millions in your hand? What can you buy and eat? Do you have to give up half your life savings to someone else? Those who say this, and those who believe this, can also pay 10 million or 20 million for someone to treat you as a &quot;master&quot; and see if you are willing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is really sad to see people without knowing their surroundings. We should feel lucky to still have such a kind and loving man like Yiwei Yi in our sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of the old saying that &quot;husband and wife are originally birds of the same forest, and they fly separately when disaster strikes&quot;, acts of friendship are particularly noble. If a couple wants to maintain a long-term relationship, it is not enough to just have an emotional foundation. In a world that is difficult and full of changes, if there is a lack of moral support and a little noble personality from both parties, it is not surprising that the couple breaks up halfway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of our newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[阿童木会流泪吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261742]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/H4PoJ90PIQJmpKm7m3yKcQmBPcEXKYYenxj2YfGt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;648&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/H4PoJ90PIQJmpKm7m3yKcQmBPcEXKYYenx j2YfGt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260022&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recently launched animated series &quot;PLUTO&quot; by Netflix, the audience once again saw the familiar robot Astro Boy from their childhood.

In this reality, &quot;PLUTO&quot; appeared: the shadow of the post-war period shrouded the entire earth, and Persia, which had lost its country, created the giant robot Pluto and wanted to destroy him. Seven of the world&#39;s strongest robots, including Astro Boy. In the fictional story, &quot;war robot crisis&quot; replaces &quot;nuclear crisis&quot;, and &quot;robot sanctions&quot; replace &quot;nuclear sanctions&quot; in international politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Japanese cartoonist Osamu Tezuka released the special &quot;Astro Boy&quot; episode &quot;The Strongest Robot on Earth&quot;. From the 1950s to the 1970s when Japanese comics were on the rise, most cartoonists of Tezuka’s generation took a left-leaning political stance because of their experience in World War II. They were anti-war, respectful of life, and advocating equality in their works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, with the permission of Osamu Tezuka&#39;s son, cartoonist Naoki Urasawa created &quot;PLUTO&quot; based on &quot;The Strongest Robot on Earth&quot;. &quot;PLUTO&quot;, born in 2023, is an animated series created by Netflix on this basis. From the anti-war thoughts in 1964, to the Iraq War in 2003, to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in 2023, the three creations of &quot;PLUTO&quot; correspond to the war backgrounds of different eras. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has long allowed the world to accept the artistic language of comics. Tokiwa-so cartoonists headed by Osamu Tezuka have redefined the depth and breadth of comics. Their depiction and exploration of emotions have made their works Crossing the boundaries of the audience. Although &quot;PLUTO&quot; takes place in the context of a grand robot war, its setting is still classical: How can a robot become more like a human? On the one hand, humans are afraid of being replaced by machines; on the other hand, they are full of discrimination against androids - humans have emotions, and robots are just inferior species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Robot, are you really not sad? When robots cry, even they themselves are surprised. Who am I? Am I really grieving? Are these reactions emotions, or a set of codes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While watching this animation, I needed to press the pause button several times and stop for a while. Its perception and depiction of emotions are very innocent and beautiful, and sadness comes in an extremely light way. When Astro Boy is destroyed, will he be allowed to declare &quot;death&quot;? Or it can only be declared &quot;damaged and scrapped&quot;. Naoki Urasawa continues Tetsuka&#39;s exploration of &quot;the relationship between man and others&quot;, and still almost stubbornly depicts the possibility of &quot;understanding&quot; in a world full of fragmentation and disputes. For example, the robot North 2 went to the hometown of a stubborn artist to find the piano music in the artist&#39;s dream; the dinner between the robot Astro Boy and Dr. Pegasus; Ulan, who lost Astro Boy, could not face his own perception. The little robot keeps running around, trying to help sad humans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t seen such an animated work for a long time. The last time it gave me such an emotional experience was the animated film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Its English name is &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Those whispers in the machine body may be just ghosts that are difficult to define, but it happened after all, didn&#39;t it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 13:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[母亲起诉儿子返还购房款：对家庭是一个警示丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261756]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 11:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to CCTV&#39;s &quot;Today&#39;s Statement&quot; report, Yang&#39;s mother is a single mother, and her original condom was located in Dongcheng District, Beijing. The only house I have is my only son, Xiao Yang. She got 3.7 million from selling her house and transferred it to her son. She used it to buy a larger house in Tongzhou District, which she lived in and used as a wedding house for her son. Only her son&#39;s name was written on the property ownership certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2019, Xiao Yang got married, and Yang’s mother lived with Xiao Yang and his wife in the new house. Soon after the marriage, the daughter-in-law had conflicts with Yang&#39;s mother over daily trivial matters. The relationship between Xiao Yang, who firmly stands by his wife, and Yang&#39;s mother continues to deteriorate. After that, Xiao Yang and his wife moved out of their new house. Later, because his wife had another quarrel with Yang&#39;s mother, Xiao Yang became angry and blocked Yang&#39;s mother on WeChat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, in order to solve the problem of her daughter’s schooling, Xiao Yang sent a WeChat message to her grandmother: “Sell the house in Tongzhou and let my mother use the money from her original sale to buy another house, and I will save money. Buy a house.&quot; &quot;If my mother can&#39;t agree, I will go to court to sue my mother in one month. If it really goes to court, there will be no turning back on our mother-son relationship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Known After what her son said, Yang&#39;s mother said she was &quot;completely heartbroken&quot; and said she would be &quot;homeless&quot; if Xiao Yang sued her for obstruction. So Yang&#39;s mother sued Xiao Yang to return the purchase price of 3.7 million yuan for future pension purposes, and received the support of the court. This decision is in accordance with common law, or good customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a typical case of the conflict between the extended family orientation and the small family orientation. The current statutory legal framework talks about the individual standard and the small family standard: the division of property is based on the boundaries between individuals and small families, and small families implement the &quot;community property system&quot;; parents have raised their children to adulthood and have done their best to support them. Adult children have the obligation to support their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children who are minors must rely on their parents’ care, care and protection. Parents have custody and control over their children. When children become adults, they separate from their parents and form a nuclear family. If they get married and buy a house on their own, and do not receive support from their parents, nor do they expect to receive large amounts of property or inheritance from their parents, then the parents have not interfered with their children. A legitimate reason and effective starting point in life, children are &quot;independent&quot; from the extended family and gain the &quot;sovereignty&quot; of the small family. This is a normal intergenerational power transfer in a family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if on the one hand, the children get a large amount of support from their parents when they get married and buy a house, but on the other hand, they want to have a soft life and refuse their parents&#39; interference in their lives (whether it is &quot;suggestions&quot; or &quot;pointing fingers&quot;) Well, it’s actually the same thing), which essentially refuses parents to fulfill their “investor rights/powers”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as this case is concerned, the quarrel between the daughter-in-law and Yang&#39;s mother over &quot;daily trivial matters&quot; may have started because the daughter-in-law couldn&#39;t stand her mother-in-law&#39;s lifestyle, or she couldn&#39;t accept her mother-in-law&#39;s interference in the couple&#39;s lifestyle. The specific quarrel may have different rights and wrongs, but the underlying reason must be: the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are fighting for the right to speak or dominate the house or the family, or one party believes that the other party has usurped his rights to the things in the house or the family. power or dominance. This is the essence of many conflicts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a lot of poisonous chicken soups on the Internet nowadays, such as &quot;A husband must stand for his daughter-in-law, otherwise he will be a mama&#39;s boy.&quot; This is probably because the daughter-in-law or the person who acts as the daughter-in-law by herself is online more, while the mother-in-law is less online, and the former has a higher voice. bigger. After Yang&#39;s mother paid 3.7 million yuan to provide a wedding house for the young couple, after the conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the son did not reconcile the conflict, but blindly sided with the daughter-in-law, further intensifying the conflict, which shows that the son has nothing to do with his mother, who is an elder and investor. respect. There are many voices on the Internet who ridicule Xiao Yang for &quot;taking a wife and forgetting her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, it was originally a tough and feasible plan to &quot;sell the house in Tongzhou and let my mother use the money from her original sale to buy another house while I save money to buy another house.&quot; But at the same time, Xiao Yang threatened his mother with &quot;prosecution&quot; and &quot;mother-child affection&quot;, which made her a little confused. During the court hearing, Yang&#39;s mother requested that the 3.7 million be recognized as a loan, while Xiao Yang requested that it be recognized as a gift from his mother, which seemed to contradict his promise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court ultimately determined that the money was a loan. But even if it is a gift, it is conditional and can be withdrawn. Mother Yang gave the money to her son to buy a house and only wrote his son&#39;s name on it. What she really meant was not &quot;I gave this money to you unconditionally. The house I bought will be written on your name.&quot; You can name it whatever you want.&quot; Instead, &quot;Mom, I have given all my belongings to prepare a wedding room for you. I will live with you. You have to take good care of me when I grow old. I only write your name because I hope you can compare my feelings with mine. Not only do they have the right to live, they should also be respected.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xiao Yangs not only failed to manage intergenerational conflicts and despised the rights/rights of investors, but instead took the initiative to escalate conflicts and regarded their widowed mother as an enemy. Such a move is morally wrong, and it is unfair to weigh the interests and benefits. Sensible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s okay to adhere to individual orientation + small family orientation, and at the same time insist on living independently and rejecting large-amount funding from parents; if you accept large-amount funding from parents, you must respect the rights/powers of the investor, and even You must have the awareness to be a low-key child. Of course, high-profile parents may not intervene, but in this case, not intervening is a sign of affection, not a duty. &quot;Having both&quot; doesn&#39;t work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, this case is also a warning to parents. By raising the children to adulthood, the parents&#39; duty has been completed and the legal responsibilities have been fulfilled. You cannot hand over your old capital to your children casually, and your main assets must be in your own hands. If a child needs a large amount of financial aid, it can be lent in a clear way, stipulating the principal, interest and repayment plan, or at least it should be clear that the parents have the right to claim it back. Don&#39;t let the children feel that their parents&#39; love for them is unconditional and they can take whatever they want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parent-child love must be two-way. It is sad that many parents become the tools of their children, providing money and effort, and then being picked on and stabbed by their young couples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[霞浦：摄影与旅游之间的距离]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261748]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/1TJD3qtqOhvQJaFThYraZxJdd9xdF8ml83fADU1S.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1TJD3qtqOhvQJaFThYraZxJdd9xdF8ml8 3fADU1S. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259981&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tourists take pictures of the sunrise at the seaside of Huazhu Village, Sansha Town, Xiapu County&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Becoming a photography resort&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the sunset was about to dissipate, a group of foreign photographers returned At the B&amp;B on the mountain, we stood on the observation deck facing the coast and chatted. Looking down from the observation deck, there are still tourists taking pictures on the highway bridge at the foot of the mountain. Dongbi Village and Yugongting Village in Sansha Town, Xiapu County are famous for their sunset scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While waiting for the seafood banquet, a local member of the team introduced the owner of this B&amp;B to the photographers, Zheng Dexiong, the president of the Xiapu Photography Association, the person who famously photographed the Xiapu beach. His last introduction was: , &quot;The man who made Xiapu housing prices increase countless times.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts are more powerful than words. An abandoned rural self-built house in Sansha Town can be sold for more than 100,000 yuan a year. Rented to B&amp;B owners, if the property rights can be traded, the price of a house can be as high as several million. And B&amp;B owners just for a piece of land, they knocked down their houses and rebuilt them, decorating them carefully. The price for a sea view room per night in the off-season is four figures. The skyrocketing housing prices have become a difficult problem for Sansha people who moved away due to lack of local industries in the early years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After greetings, Zheng Dexiong sat back on the outdoor seat on the other side of the observation deck and was busy planning the shooting schedule for another upcoming photography group. There were two more shoots arranged by the local government the next day. meeting. Everyone who comes to Xiapu for research and inspection wants to meet Zheng Dexiong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Zheng Dexiong, no one focused on tidal flat photography, and almost no one realized that the beautiful scenery of Xiapu was rare enough to be displayed. Zheng Dexiong, who has been engaged in commercial photography since the 1990s, was convinced of the uniqueness of Xiapu scenery after seeing many photos of seaside scenery. In 2002, Zheng Dexiong began photographing the tidal flats in his hometown in his spare time. Two years later, at the suggestion of a friend, he held the first photography exhibition in Xiapu on the street of Longshou Road. He also submitted articles to many photography magazines. His works were repeatedly published and won awards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kasumigaura and its tidal flats are famous in the photography circle. Xiapu was rated as &quot;the first of China&#39;s top ten landscape photography holy places&quot;. Photography bases were built in small fishing villages along the coast. Fishermen who were engaged in seafood fishing returned to the shore, and young people who went out to work returned to their hometowns and started the tourism industry from scratch. . Zheng Dexiong remembers that 20 years ago, Xiapu County had only one short street and no foreign population. But now the city has expanded all the way to the seaside, and Taikang Road filled with food stalls is busy until late at night. In 2022, Xiapu, with a population of just over 500,000, received 7.2 million tourists. A few photos changed the fate of a county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s easy to say, but it’s not that simple. Over the past 20 years, we have actually invested a lot in transforming from private power to strong government support and from free services to a business model.” Zheng Dexiong objects to easy generalizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first started photographing the tidal flats, Zheng Dexiong walked along the more than 400 kilometers of Xiapu coastline. It turned out that there were no roads on the shore and it was a barren mountain. He had to bring a machete and a hoe to open a road while walking. When shooting at Shajiang Pier, in order to find a shooting point with a suitable height, he climbed up from the bottom of the mountain. When he reached the top of the mountain, he discovered that there was a stone road built by the village on the other side. Several of Xiapu&#39;s early famous photography spots were discovered by Zheng Dexiong in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Dexiong paid for the early foreign photographers who came to Xiapu with his own money, until he could no longer afford the money. On May 1, 2007, he opened the first paid photography group. A one-week trip for 20 people cost more than 1,000 yuan per person. The local government saw the power of photography in the tourism industry and began to hold national photography competitions and create logos for photography spots. More importantly, the government has taken the lead in gradually building and improving supporting infrastructure for photography spots, including roads, parking lots, and observation decks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, new photography spots are constantly being discovered. The 2017 edition of the &quot;Xiapu Photography Guide&quot; issued by the Xiapu Culture and Tourism Bureau lists 28 photography spots, and the number has increased to 33 in the 2021 edition. The infrastructure and tourism model around the photography spots have not yet been fully finalized, and both locals and tourists are adapting to the differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/xcAgdGZJ83aXw3hloXo7guXtXzsKDTWVPvIFJqAp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/xcAgdGZJ83aXw3hloXo7guXtXzsKDTWVPvIFJqAp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259979&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xiapu tidal flat scenery through Zheng Dexiong&#39;s lens&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Perfect Photo&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first people to profit from photography are the characters closely related to the shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Dexiong believes that shooting in Xiapu is a test of skills and experience. &quot;The ebb and flow, changes in light and shadow, the alternation of four seasons, and different labor scenes in each season.&quot; This also means that shooting in Xiapu is uncertain. There are too many factors, including weather, tides, and seasons. The absence of any one element will lead to deviation from the default. Weather and tides can be grasped by experience, while labor scenes out of season can only be reproduced through performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winter of 2005, a Taiwanese photographer came to Xiapu to take pictures, but the whole series was missing a picture of Xiaohao Village catching fish fry in spring. Considering that it was not easy to travel from Taiwan to the mainland, Zheng Dexiong asked local fishermen to cooperate in posing for photos. This is how the new profession of fishing model was born in Xiapu. To this day, even if no one buys fish fry anymore, the fishing models in Xiaohao Village still hold up a triangular fishing net frame every time they perform - this kind of special-shaped net is specially used to catch fish fry, and because of the award-winning photo shoot There are three fishing models, so the trio is also fixed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Three people make a good photo.” Every time they perform, Bao Xuexian, who is in her fifties, her aunt in her seventies, and her aunt’s brother-in-law will put on knee-length rubber shoes, wearing Put on your straw hat, carry your fishing net and bamboo basket, and walk on the Xiaohao beach after low tide. The photographer would stand on the top of the mountain behind the village and shoot with a telephoto lens from a distance. Bao Xuexian&#39;s uncle Lin Jisong was responsible for reception on the mountain and conveyed the photographer&#39;s instructions to Bao Xuexian and others via radio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance fee for a performance is 300 yuan, and the fishing model costs 100 yuan per person. More than half of the days a month, people will be invited to perform, but Bao Xuexian does not think that fishing models are an enviable job. &quot;Only those who can&#39;t make money become fishing models, and those who can make money go to cultivate oysters and grow seaweed.&quot; &quot;When there are no performances, Bao Xuexian and her aunt weave fishing nets and sell them for money. A two-layered large fishing net sells for 31 yuan, and a three-layered one sells for 42 yuan. They can weave up to two per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jisong receives guests at the top of the mountain, but does not participate in the distribution of performance fees. He has other income. Most of the people in Xiaohao Village were originally fishermen. Lin Jisong did not know how to fish. 24 years ago, he built a temple on the top of the mountain and made a living by collecting incense money. When fishermen go to sea, life and death are determined by fate, and they will worship gods before leaving. After the Xiaohao Tidal Flat became famous, the government built an observation deck on the top of the mountain, right next to the temple built by Lin Jisong. He felt that the angle of the path on the cliffside was better, so he paved a stone road and placed a few plastic stools. Anyone who goes to take pictures on the stone road must &quot;donate&quot; 10 yuan for the film fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Famous photography spots have regular fishing models, such as Jiang Lianshui in Beiqi Tidal Flat and Lao Cheng in Yangjiaxi. They have taken award-winning photos together and know better than novice photographers about how to take photos. &quot;They all know the angle, focal length, aperture, and speed.&quot; Zheng Dexiong found it very interesting. &quot;Initially, we went to the village to select models. There were no special criteria. They just had to be fishermen.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the government building In front of the roads and observation decks, outsiders who come to take pictures of Xiapu have to find local photographers who know their way around. Photography directors came into being, referred to as photography directors. With supporting facilities in place, photography guides are still needed because outsiders can’t figure out the tide schedule and the best time to take photos at photography spots. Nowadays, the threshold for photography guides is much lower. Not only members of the local photography association, but also taxi drivers, travel agencies and villagers have joined in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, Zheng Dexiong also proposed to the Culture and Tourism Bureau to provide centralized training for people engaged in photography and photography to improve their service awareness and photography skills. Later, there were too many people and it was difficult to coordinate. When he was out shooting, Zheng Dexiong heard the cameraman introducing him to the tourists. They stood face to face and neither could recognize the other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/GTBvngW7gqrVPIMUmksJuIhHm4SEcIpFR8OCw4jE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/GTBvngW7gqrVPIMUmksJuIhHm4SEcIpFR8OCw4jE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259980&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tourists vacation at a B&amp;B in Dongbi Village, Sansha Town, Xiapu County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;Advantage Judgment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the minds of photographers, different photography spots have different ratings. Zheng Dexiong believes that although Xiaohao Village has the most award-winning films, the scenery does not change much and is the same regardless of the season; Huazhu Village only has sunrise, and the location is best only in winter, which is relatively monotonous; Beiqi Village can be photographed in any season. However, the pole frames for planting seaweed have been moved from the coast to the edge of the inland sea, and the beauty of the tidal flat patterns and pole shadows can no longer be photographed. The coast of his hometown, Dakyo Village, is more suitable for tourism than photography, because there are only beaches in that area and no tidal flats, and tidal flats are the core of Kasumigaura photography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What Zheng Dexiong likes most is the east wall. The scenery changes endlessly throughout the year. In 2019, Sansha Town invested 20 million to build a light and shadow plank road to connect the photography spots along the east wall, making this area more popular. When the tide goes out a few days after the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, more people come to the road. I can&#39;t even stand on either side. The highway bridge where the Dongbi Photography Spot is located is on one side of Dongbi Village and on the other side is Yugongting Village. The two villages have become a gathering place for boutique B&amp;Bs. Zheng Dexiong and his students all stay here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what the photographer thinks, the villagers have their own way of judging their own advantages. Uncle Zhang, the owner of Huazhu in the countryside of Huazhu Village, was originally doing business abroad. In 2020, he returned to the village to run a B&amp;B. He saw the potential of Huazhu. “Huazhu is a scenic spot for watching the sunrise. It is a must-go spot for anyone who comes to Xiapu. You must watch the sunrise. , you will most likely have to stay the night before.&quot; Uncle Zhang currently has 6 rooms, and the price per night is 400 to 600 yuan. According to his statistics, the occupancy rate is about 80%, and it is fully booked almost every day in the peak season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another characteristic of Huazhu is that it is the Hokkien-speaking area of ​​this small town in eastern Fujian. Uncle Zhang talked about the history of Huazhu, starting from three hundred years ago, &quot;Our ancestors were Those who moved from southern Fujian didn’t have big boats before. Fishermen fished along the coast and came all the way along the coast. Maybe they came here to escape the wind and rain. Later, they saw the abundant seafood here and settled down.” Huazhu Village speaks Hokkien and lives in stone houses. , pronounced &quot;厝&quot; in Hokkien. When building the B&amp;B, the village committee required that the exterior appearance must retain the appearance of a house. Uncle Zhang plans to do a crowdfunding project to raise 8 million yuan to build 8 more B&amp;Bs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/UOC1TGi6Zn3AvbzELnYAgfV5g5HwSETROd1qh1iY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/UOC1TGi6Zn3AvbzELnYAgfV5g5HwSETROd1qh1iY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259978&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bao Xuexian’s aunt is in her seventies. When she is not performing, she makes money by weaving fishing nets&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yang Xin/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the light and shadow plank road was built on the east wall, Niulangang Natural Village was gradually lost, but they were not willing to lag behind. Niulangang Village is the opening point of Xiapu’s first boutique B&amp;B CaoMuRen Teahouse. It has always regarded itself as the birthplace of Xiapu B&amp;B and is close to the county seat and the entrance to the highway. The introduction reads: “It is surrounded by mountains and sea, with beautiful scenery and convenient transportation. The location advantage is obvious and the tourism resources are unique.&quot; In the summer of 2023, Niulangang Village began construction to build an asphalt road and a viewing platform on the mountain where B&amp;Bs gather, hoping to regain the limelight as the first choice for tourists in the off-season. However, the construction team still started work during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, which caused several negative reviews for surrounding B&amp;Bs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sightseeing route from Gaoluo Beach, Dajing Beach to Hawei Island is named Donghai Route 1. Although there are few photographers, it is the route recommended by everyone in Xiapu. According to the observation of Xiaona, a stall owner on Xiawei Island, the sea caves on Xiawei Island are the internet celebrity photo spots that occupy the high traffic volume of social platforms.

Xiaona has heard from many tourists that a three-day and two-night tour that includes transportation, food, and accommodation only costs more than a thousand yuan. “But the tour group doesn’t care about the weather and tides, and skips some spots if you can’t see them. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ttxFP6MudBOg1At6KJCYvZuBEW5ytgpsqAZwwxwM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ttxFP6MudBOg1At6KJCYvZuBEW5ytgpsqAZwwxwM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259977&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the planning of Huazhu Village, the appearance of the B&amp;B should retain the unique stone house style of southern Fujian&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yang Xin/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Uneven&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The most common thing Ou Shao of Beiqi Village hears from tourists is, &quot;Why is it different here from the photos?&quot; &quot;So when he sees tourists now, he will explain in advance, &quot;Be sure to pay attention to the weather when visiting Xiapu. The weather is good or bad, and taking photos is completely different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zheng Dexiong&#39;s view, photography spots and tourist spots themselves It’s just different. “Some tourists come to the photography spot and feel that there is nothing to see, because photography has requirements on time and light.” The aesthetic perspectives of photographers and tourists are also different. The photographer was on the highway bridge on the east wall. There are three types of landscapes you can take pictures of - the grand landscape of the sunset, the seaweed net on the lake and the lines of the tidal flats under the bridge, but tourists generally only look at the sunset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ye Yu, who sells coffee under the observation deck of Huazhu Village, remembers that no one in the village cared about the sunrise before. When fishermen go out to catch fish, they go out at high tide and return at high tide. They look at the tide table, which has nothing to do with sunrise and sunset. On New Year&#39;s Day in 2013, CCTV broadcast the sunrise live in Huazhu, which earned Huazhu the title of &quot;China&#39;s Sun Viewing Landmark.&quot; The sunrise footage captured by CCTV was posted on the wall under the observation deck, and a stone tablet was erected next to it: &quot; How blessed to be in the same time and space as this sunrise.&quot; Ye Yu remembered that the CCTV sunrise was filmed by the staff who set up tents on the top of the mountain and lived there for a month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beiqi Village was probably the first place to realize the different needs of tourism and photography. The Ou Shao family opened a B&amp;B in the village in 2013, and began taking tourists out to sea for sightseeing and fishing entertainment in 2020. So far, it has developed nearly ten projects, including tourist charters, fishing outings, parent-child trips to the sea, sales of dried seafood, and cage nets. &quot;The passenger flow here is unstable, so we can only develop more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ou Shao&#39;s family used to be fishermen, and their income from fishing was unstable. &quot;There are not so many fish now, and every May The fishing season is closed from the 1st to August 31st, and large boats can park on the shore.&quot; They considered daily fishing and tourism during the fishing season, and found that it was not cost-effective to only do it for three months. &quot;Do it all year round. If you do this, you will accumulate many old customers.&quot; So they concentrated on the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ou Shao’s father now goes out to sea to fish, always accompanying guests on a chartered boat. The price of chartering a boat is 600 yuan, and the catch is uncertain. “It’s okay to catch more or less. Some tourists are Those who have come from the inland have never seen the sea and find it very fresh.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More tourists choose to spend 30 yuan to take a 20-minute boat ride to see the seaweed that has been planted on the edge of the inland sea. The Ou Shao family built a new boat in May 2023, costing 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The cabin area was specially enlarged to accommodate up to 30 people. There are several families involved in the boat tour project in the village, including Ou Shao&#39;s relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ou Shao was soliciting tourists at the beach, an electric bicycle rode on the village road and he also talked to the tourists on the roadside. I asked Ou Shao, &quot;Is that your relative or a competitor?&quot; Ou Shao replied: &quot;It&#39;s my relative and a competitor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two of them stood guard in front of the entrance of the seaside parking lot, taking turns. Go up and ask the private car coming in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nRn68R4EnzQITldKMsR5Tb86hebJFP3gNZzks7Wm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nRn68R4EnzQITldKMsR5Tb86hebJFP3gNZzks7Wm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Uncle Zhang is making fire hoses for a B&amp;B by hand.

Xiaohao Beach is the earliest famous, but the surrounding areas The supporting facilities and B&amp;B design are lagging behind those of Dongbi and Huazhu on the same line. The B&amp;Bs in Xiaohao Village are concentrated in the new area on the edge of the old village. A large open space from the new area to the seaside is filled with sand, gravel, soil, fishing nets, construction waste and domestic garbage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The B&amp;Bs in Xiaohao Village are mainly self-built houses in rural areas. Villagers rent and sell spare rooms in their own houses. The decoration style of the rooms is basically the bedrooms of ordinary commercial houses. In order to reduce the difficulty of cleaning, a pile of public slippers are placed at the door of each B&amp;B for guests to change into. Such a room costs 300 yuan a night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Muhai B&amp;B is one of the few boutique B&amp;Bs currently in operation. It has floor-to-ceiling glass windows facing the sea and a small outdoor garden. The proprietress Wu Sister-in-law said that the design fee for the B&amp;B cost 60,000 yuan. . Sister-in-law Wu’s husband is a village cadre. When the houses in the new district first started to be decorated in 2018, he suggested that the villagers decorate them in the style of a B&amp;B, but the villagers were unwilling. Sister-in-law Wu said, “Someone asked at that time, and I bought it after all the hard work. If you decorate a house yourself and enjoy it, why should you let others live in it? By the time they want to think about a B&amp;B again, it will be too late.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister-in-law Wu&#39;s B&amp;B will open in 2021, and only 5 of the two floors have been repaired. In the peak season, the price of a suite and bathtub room is as high as thousands of yuan per night, but in the off-season, there are almost no guests. She believes that the supporting facilities around Xiaohao Village have affected the development of B&amp;Bs. “There used to be a parking lot that could park 70 cars, and the roads were beautifully built, but it was demolished in 2021 and has not been built yet.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2021, Xiaohao Village has been caught in a storm of accountability for illegal land occupation and illegal construction in rural areas. After investigation and verification by relevant departments, Xiaohao Village actually built 121 homesteads, of which 61 were built by non-village personnel. It also introduced commercial health care projects and occupied 16 homesteads. In March 2022, information released by relevant departments at higher levels stated that &quot;all illegally sold collective land has been taken back to the village collective, and the land will be restored to its original state after demolition.&quot; The villagers also don&#39;t know what will happen to this empty land filled with waste. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Natural conditions also restrict the development of some photography spots. Although the Xiawei Island Sea Cave is popular, it can only be revealed after low tide. Tourists who want to take pictures have to climb down the seaside rocks with bare hands. A warm reminder in the &quot;Xiapu Photography Guide&quot;, &quot;The reefs on the shore are easily slippery due to corrosion by sea water. It is recommended to wear non-slip shoes and walk slowly. Elderly people with limited mobility should not go there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sea caves are equipped with The rescue workers said, &quot;Every day, tourists slip off the rocks and fall into the sea.&quot; The scenic spot originally wanted to build a wooden boardwalk, but the rocks were severely corroded and broke when nails were hammered in, so they had to give up. &quot;Do you know why the scenic spot doesn&#39;t charge admission tickets? If it does, the compensation (if something happens) will be up to the sky.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is nearly 50 kilometers from the county seat to Xiamei Island, and there is a long stretch of road in the middle. It is a gentle mountain road. In recent years, a new road has been built close to the coastline. This road is open even before it is included in the map navigation. Just like the tourism industry here, it seems that it has not yet been completed, but the reception of tourists has already begun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我和物业博弈的这一年：解决问题有多难？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261740]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The fate that every new owner cannot escape is to deal with and confront the property. This is his homework and his of practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since I took over the house and became an owner in October last year, I have started to form a front with my neighbors and compete with the property management. Today, the team has collapsed, losing ground, and the rights protection has ended in failure. It&#39;s the same as the mental process of decorating, from being full of emotions to being discouraged, and finally giving up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the house was handed over for inspection, the quality of the house was worrying and many areas needed repairs. However, the developer did not do anything and delayed to solve most of the problems. Until now, the paint surface of the corner of my second bedroom is cracked. The seam is still there intact. This is indeed the developer&#39;s problem. The property management company can only help me communicate my needs, but they belong to the same company, and the property management company has collected property fees early. I have to discuss an explanation with the property management company. It is not unfair at all to take the blame. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of fighting with the property owners, each other&#39;s tactics also changed according to the other&#39;s actions, and they continued to see each other&#39;s progress and retreat. If the housekeeper responds politely and politely, I will also communicate politely. If I am tougher, she will get angry at me. More often than not, the housekeeper will use low-grade deception, but I can&#39;t expose her directly. I have to leave a little kindness so that we can meet each other in the future and everything can be discussed. She told lies and fully accepted my needs, saying that she would urge and reflect them, but my problems would not be advanced or solved. She treats me as a fool. If she can evade something, she will do it first. Later problems will be dealt with later. The rhetoric will always be dealt with in a unified manner later. In the end, he couldn&#39;t do anything perfunctorily and ran out of patience. The housekeeper simply stopped making excuses and played the emotional card. She admitted that the developers were rogue and the property management companies were rogue. She only received a salary of a few dollars a month, so how could she have the final say? Without pretending, I was moved by her words that were completely embarrassing, and I began to accept in my heart that this was the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before I paid the property fee, I had to ask the housekeeper to get the key when I opened the door of my house. The owner of the owner group once privately suggested that I replace the lock cylinder and argue with the property management company about when to solve the problem and when to pay. . I didn&#39;t want to take an extreme approach, and I was eager to get a property certificate to install charging piles, so I had no choice but to surrender. Once the money is handed over, it becomes even more difficult to ask them to do something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this year’s negotiations and observations, I found that one of the main job responsibilities of the property management company is to collect fees. As early as September, before the previous year&#39;s property fees were due, the housekeeper started a show of fancy reminders to pay the next year&#39;s property fees. Taking advantage of the fact that the owners were at home at night, the housekeepers divided their forces and went door to door to collect property fees. Everyone among the owners condemned this behavior of only enjoying rights without assuming obligations. A few days later, the property management company sent out a notice with bait, offering free rice and cooking oil if the property management fee was paid during this period. So, I often see the housekeeper walking in the community carrying grain and oil, and watching her retreating back, I wonder, if the execution of solving problems is so touching, why are we here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a year of fighting, my interest in fighting for the rights of my neighbors has slowly cooled down. Recently, there have been voices in the group that want to replace the property, but I no longer have such high expectations for the final result. Confrontation between property owners and property owners has become the norm. I am afraid that my property and I, as well as the domestic property management industry, still have a long, long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an employee of a state-owned enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to you Submission email: nfzmreaders@163.com)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
