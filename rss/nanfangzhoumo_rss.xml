Experts estimate that more than 100 million people will travel during this long holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-driving has become the mainstream during long vacations. For those car owners who drive to Xi&#39;an, Shaanxi, Mianyang, Sichuan, Xinxiang, Henan and other places, this year&#39;s journey will have a lot less worries: the traffic police departments in these places recently announced that minor violations of foreign tourists&#39; vehicles will not be punished during the holidays. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such &quot;flexible law enforcement&quot; measures are generally welcomed by car owners. The car is in a different place and the road in life is unfamiliar. Even if you have a navigation system, various situations will inevitably happen. If you are slapped with a ticket and fined for this, you may not be in a good mood for the whole day. There are no penalties for minor violations of laws by foreign vehicles. This will allow foreign tourists to relax and have fun without having to worry about getting into trouble or losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actions of the traffic police in these places are not illegal, but based on evidence. The Administrative Penalty Law clearly stipulates that if the violation is minor and is corrected in a timely manner without causing harmful consequences, no administrative penalty will be imposed; if the violation is for the first time and the harmful consequences are minor and the harmful consequences are corrected in a timely manner, administrative penalties may not be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the fundamental purpose of punishing traffic violations is to ensure safe and smooth traffic and improve traffic efficiency. If some minor violations do not cause traffic congestion or affect traffic safety and traffic efficiency, they do not need to be punished. If you use a high-power magnifying glass to see defects and you are punished for minor violations, it becomes a fine for the sake of fines, which is putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, tourism has become an important economic driving force in many cities. To attract tourists, in addition to unique attractions, the soft environment is also an important aspect of attraction. For example, this year&#39;s Zibo barbecue fire caused many tourists from out of town to come by car. There was no room in the parking lot, so some people parked their cars on the roadside. Faced with these illegally parked out-of-town vehicles, the Zibo traffic police did not come up and issue a punishment note. Instead, they called each one to notify them to move the vehicles. This practice was praised and attracted more people to Zibo to eat barbecue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, there were some places that had &quot;extremely strict law enforcement&quot; on foreign car owners. I drive this road, and when foreign car owners come, they have to find faults and fines. Some places even deliberately set up law enforcement traps to punish outsiders. In this way, foreign car owners are treated as &quot;water fish&quot;, and they will not come next time. Not only will they not come, they will also post online to appeal to others not to come. When such word-of-mouth evaluation spreads, there will naturally be fewer and fewer tourists, and the tourism economy will be out of the question. On the contrary, if foreign tourists are &quot;softly enforced&quot; and try not to be punished, so that tourists feel comfortable, they may stay here for a few more days. Next time they come, they will take the initiative to do voluntary publicity online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, foreign car owners who enjoy flexible law enforcement treatment must also consciously abide by traffic rules, try not to violate the rules, do not create congestion in the local area, and be decent in both directions. After all, only good traffic order can bring a relaxing and pleasant travel experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tourism environment is part of the business environment and a reflection of the overall business environment. There used to be some places that specifically targeted foreign investment merchants. In the early stage, they used various &quot;preferential policies&quot; to attract foreign merchants to invest in and build factories. After that, they started to &quot;harvest the wool&quot;. Not only were the original promises unable to be fulfilled, but they also had to eat all kinds of food. To get the card, &quot;beat the foreign businessmen to internal injuries and strip the domestic businessmen naked.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of business environment there is, there will be what kind of investment enthusiasm. From the tourism environment to the business environment, they are essentially a reflection of the level of local public governance. Paying attention to one&#39;s own reputation and reputation is the basic prerequisite for local public governance to become good governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“遛街子”累麻了，年轻人开始了“宅”式度假]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“不是我不够努力” ：被清退的编外人员，如何过难关]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258088]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/1hbW3iqPCOVYPyAfvKOHLi72oS4xe6bm0iRJwOfY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/1hbW3iqPCOVYPyAfvKOHLi72oS4xe6b m0iRJwOfY. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253009&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, a hospital in Zhejiang Province launched nursing skills training for nurses. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You are no longer from our hospital.&quot; One sentence announced that Chen Min has been a non-staff nurse for ten years The end of a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In front of two doctors, three bedded patients and their families in the ward, the dismissal notice came suddenly. Staying for a second longer makes you feel embarrassed. In September 2023, Chen Min recalled to Southern Weekend that after hearing the order to leave, she did not hesitate, returned to the office, took off her nurse uniform, took away the cup and notebook, and kept a group photo with the department. In the cupboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months ago, Chen Ming just turned 35 and became the first batch of labor dispatch workers dismissed from a second-class hospital in Hunan where she worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, she has shuttled between wards and departments, looking no different from other nurses. But somewhere invisible, there is always a thread named &quot;weaving&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using this line as the boundary, people like Chen Min who work in state agencies or institutions in the form of labor dispatch but are not within the establishment are called &quot;non-staff personnel.&quot; In addition, common non-staff personnel include “contract workers” hired by government agencies, hospitals, schools and other units who sign contracts with workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, information about “retiring non-staff personnel” that has appeared from time to time has attracted attention to this group. In 2022, Fangxian County, Hubei Province promoted the standardization of the clean-up of non-staff employed personnel, and stated that &quot;the clean-up of non-staff personnel involves a wide range of areas and a large number&quot;, and the clean-up process needs to &quot;effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of government agencies, institutions and non-staff personnel.&quot; In February 2023, a symposium on the clean-up and standardization of non-staff personnel held in Tongcheng City, Anhui Province mentioned that clean-up and retirement is not the ultimate goal, but to standardize and rectify the chaos of non-staff employment and improve government administrative efficiency and service levels. Provide employment assistance for retired personnel, and actively and steadily promote special actions to clean up and standardize non-staff personnel.&quot; In August, the Lichuan City Institutional Establishment Committee Office in Hubei Province stated that the city had eliminated 301 irregular non-staff employees. In Jianli, Hubei, Linxiang, Hunan, Harbin, Heilongjiang and other places, public information shows that the removal of non-staff personnel is also in progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave, some non-staff personnel are deeply frustrated, and some take the opportunity to step out of their comfort zones and look for a decent job again. News from Daoxian County, Yongzhou City, Hunan Province stated that as of September 20, 1,038 laid-off non-staff personnel had been re-employed in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Premonition of unemployment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The non-staff personnel interviewed had a premonition of being laid off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2022, Chen Min heard from colleagues about the news of eliminating non-staff personnel. At first, he didn’t believe it. Later, he searched online and found that other cities had taken action. But the news only circulated secretly in the hospital, and she never saw the red-headed document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 31, 2022, the contract signed by Chen Min with a third-party labor dispatch company expired. The hospital leader told her that &quot;the epidemic has just ended and there is no time to sign the contract, so she must go to work first.&quot; Just two or three days later, she was fired on the grounds that &quot;the state had issued a policy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, similar &quot;gossip&quot; spread in a hospital in Dengta City, Liaoning Province. Li Zhen, 28, has worked in the vaccination department of the hospital for nearly seven years. In this hospital with less than 400 employees, it only takes a few turns for the news to reach her ears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Zhen felt the signal even stronger. Salaries that cannot be paid on time, successive layoffs in other departments, rumors that leaders in charge of each department are fighting to keep their subordinates, the newly appointed dean twice went to the vaccination department and mentioned &quot;there are too many people&quot;... these have given rise to unemployment. The real feeling of pressing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more precise news came on the night of May 16, the day before she was dismissed. She heard from a relative who had an acquaintance working in the hospital that the layoffs might &quot;be your turn.&quot; A few.&quot; The next day, the leader in charge of the department called: &quot;There is bad news. You can&#39;t keep it this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhen said that in the memories of the old nurses at the hospital, there were more than 30 people working in the hospital. This is the first time that no one has been laid off in recent years. The hospital told her, &quot;The hospital now owes money and cannot support so many people. You should understand the hospital.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xiaodong, a professor at the School of Politics and Public Administration at China University of Political Science and Law, analyzed to Southern Weekend the existence of non-staff personnel. There are historical reasons for this and development, which were influenced by the thinking of “more people make things easier” and the increase in workload at that time. When public institutions like hospitals are saturated with workload and existing staff cannot complete the work, they recruit non-staff personnel to assist in the work. And the hospital&#39;s &quot;most of the funds for supporting non-staff personnel come from their own income.&quot; The main reason for dismissing non-staff personnel now may be related to its own profits and policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Hu Xiaodong mentioned that the &quot;Party and State Institutional Reform Plan&quot; released in March 2023 mentioned streamlining the establishment, but it was limited to central and state agencies and local party and government agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Non-staff personnel in some government agencies have been affected before. 29-year-old Lin Jiangtao has been working in a government unit in Yuxi, Yunnan for four years. At the end of December 2022, while he was on paternity leave, he received a notice of competitive employment from the unit. Due to economic layoffs, 36 people outside the establishment were required to undergo written examinations and interviews. Decided to stay or go. &quot;I probably understood it when I heard this. I guess I will be laid off this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uneasiness surged in Lin Jiangtao&#39;s heart. He recalled that at that time, he frequently looked at job information on local talent recruitment websites, viewed short videos on social media that taught people how to deal with middle-aged unemployment, and even asked a master to tell fortunes. Lin Jiangtao sent his birth date and work address, and the master told him that he &quot;may not be unemployed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For insurance, Lin Jiangtao hired a teacher to conduct structured interviews, which cost 1,500 yuan for two days. On December 29, 2022, the day before his birthday, he still received a text message that he was dismissed. He was competing for the last place in the induction examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The removal of non-staff personnel is related to the reduction of staff. Hu Xiaodong explained that the key to the increase or decrease of establishment is whether the use of establishment can improve work efficiency. Nowadays, non-staff personnel in government departments at all levels bear the actual work of many internal staff. “It is necessary to return the civil servant work performed or replaced by existing non-staff personnel to the civil servants themselves and return the responsibilities of civil servants.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Before the crisis&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After graduating from technical secondary school, Li Zhen once thought about working in Shenyang, which is 40 to 50 minutes&#39; drive away from home. As the only child in the family, her father was reluctant to let her go away, so he asked someone to find connections to get her to come to this hospital. Although the average salary was only more than 2,000 yuan a month, &quot;as long as she has a place to occupy herself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are eight people in the vaccination department, all of whom are &quot;contract workers.&quot; Li Zhen is mainly responsible for vaccine information registration in the department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost all children in the county are vaccinated at their hospital. During busy times, it takes three hours in the morning to register the information of about a hundred children. Over time, Li Zhen developed the habit of speaking and typing quickly. When I met the children and parents who came for vaccination, I blurted out three key questions in Northeastern dialect: &quot;Is the child sick, has he taken medicine, and is he healthy?&quot; In the time it takes a new colleague to enter the information of one child, Li Zhen can enter the information of three. As soon as he sees the child&#39;s age in months, he knows which injection should be given to the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you have free time, you can get off work early after finishing your busy morning. &quot;The job is easy, the salary is fixed&quot;, and there is also medical insurance and pension insurance paid by the hospital - this is already a good job in a small county. Li Zhen has no mortgage, car loan or children, and her husband&#39;s monthly salary is five to six thousand yuan. They live a stress-free life in a small county with low prices. With the idea of ​​&quot;leaving this place for retirement&quot;, Li Zhen never thought of leaving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the unemployment crisis, many people believed that non-staff work could be done &quot;until retirement&quot; because it was &quot;close to the establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for Lin Jiangtao. In his view, his job is no different from that of a clerk, &quot;delivering information, setting up accounts, and at most compiling information at the end of the year.&quot; Because of the nature of the company, I need to go to the company for safety inspections, and I don’t have to strictly stay on duty. There are also five insurances paid by the company. “I can’t find a more satisfying (job) than this.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Lingping&quot; was in the unit, two or three non-staff colleagues left because they were admitted to civil servants or public institutions. Lin Jiangtao felt envious, but did not act. It wasn&#39;t until he lost his job that he realized how &quot;fragrant&quot; the establishment was. If the time could go back ten years, he would like to advise his 19-year-old self to make a good life plan and consider taking a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the cruel reality is that even if Lin Jiangtao goes back to ten years ago and tries his best to take the exam, the result may not be satisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Min spent ten years preparing for the exam. From the time she got a part-time job, her life was spent working and preparing for exams. After get off work every night, her schedule is to go back to her room to read and prepare for exams. She is unable to respond to her colleagues&#39; calls to eat and play cards, and she cannot &quot;waste&quot; more time cooking or spending time with her family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the comfort Lin Jiangtao felt at work, Chen Min&#39;s work in the hospital was unstable. In the past ten years, she has been rotated through at least eight departments. The shortest one she stayed in was only half a year, and the doctors in the department were not fully recognized. The longest one was less than three years. When I go to some new departments, I even have to start from scratch. However, the transfer of colleagues within the staff will not be so frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her perception, hospital employees are divided into four levels based on employment forms. The highest level is within the establishment, followed by personnel agency, labor contract, and labor dispatch. Dispatched workers also have five insurances and one housing fund, but their wages are the lowest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference buried in daily work always reminds me that I am a &quot;non-staff person&quot;, and the age limit of &quot;under 35 years old&quot; for the staff examination is tightly pressed, which further intensifies Chen Min&#39;s pursuit of staff. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever there is a recruitment announcement in her hospital, Chen Min will sign up. On several occasions, she passed the written exam but was dropped again after the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many places require that the removal of non-staff personnel be actively and steadily promoted. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Survival and Emotion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After being fired, for more than a month, Chen Min is immersed in anxiety and relies on medication to maintain sleep every day. At a rehabilitation hospital near her home, Chen Min was diagnosed with moderate depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treating doctor advised Chen Min to learn to look away and not push herself too hard. Her parents-in-law also told her that it didn’t matter if she didn’t go to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who have accumulated some &quot;capital&quot; after working for many years, after losing their jobs, survival is not the first concern that arises, but emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the past few years, Chen Min considers himself devoted to his work. Her home is close to the hospital, only ten minutes&#39; walk. When she was not working the night shift, she also told the doctors and nurses after work, &quot;If you are too busy at night, just call me and I will come right away.&quot; Her WeChat ID is still left in the previous department for patients Appointments, consultations, return visits. Chen Min described her work as her lover, and the sudden unemployment felt like being separated from her lover. &quot;It will probably be difficult to get out of it within a year or two.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For retired non-staff personnel, a buffer period may be needed. Hu Xiaodong mentioned that for the sake of humanistic care, the unit should set up a buffer period to &quot;give them a buffer space from psychology to behavior. The unit can also help non-staff personnel who are about to be laid off find new jobs in accordance with laws and regulations.&quot; In addition, he also suggested designing a return-to-work appointment system. When these non-staff personnel are needed again in the future, units can give priority to hiring personnel with return-to-work certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to divert his attention and renew his suspended social security payment, Chen Min began to look for a new job. Health care centers, specialized hospitals, private clinics, confinement centers, and places related to nursing are the first to be considered. More than ten years ago, she applied for the nursing major because &quot;it was easy to find a job.&quot; Now the number of nurses has exceeded 5 million, and employers have more and younger choices. Chen Min said that because she was over 35 years old, she was either unable to register for the exam or was not accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao also encountered a similar situation. He saw a job opening at a vocational training company on the local talent recruitment website. On the day of the interview, his boss, who was in his forties, introduced to him what he had achieved in his twenties and asked him: &quot;Why are you still looking for a job at the age of 29?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao restrained his emotions. , replied calmly: &quot;Why can&#39;t you find a job at the age of 29? People who are 59, 69 or even 79 may be looking for a job.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first lost his job, Lin Jiangtao also had self-doubt. But soon, he told himself that when he was at a low point in his life, he must not push himself too hard or go against himself; when he encountered a suitable opportunity, he would take the initiative to fight for it, but there was no need to be too anxious. &quot;Looking for a job is like looking for a partner, take your time.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Step out of the comfort zone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From May to August, Li Zhen rested at home for three months. Not long ago, he went to Nantong, Jiangsu, intending to try home textile live broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are requirements for live broadcasts. You must dress fashionably and wear heavy makeup. You can&#39;t just wear sportswear and white shoes on the inside, a nurse&#39;s uniform on the outside, and light makeup like you do in the hospital. Even when he speaks, he pays attention to standard Mandarin. &quot;After speaking Northeastern dialect for so many years, it suddenly feels so awkward.&quot; Li Zhen stood next to the anchor, feeling a sense of discomfort that made her shrink back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in Jiangsu for half a month, Li Zhen returned to his hometown and spent 7 days learning to make milk tea locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, she and her friends opened a milk tea shop near the school. Although it was more tiring, she could adapt. The work is busier than before, but she thinks that the more work she does, the more she will get. &quot;Maybe by selling this extra hour, I can make more money. I think it is for myself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have taken bigger steps, such as Chen Min, who moved from the hospital to small restaurants and barbecue stalls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After looking for a job for more than a month and asking for more than 20 nursing-related positions, Chen Min still found nothing. After consulting teachers from her previous school, she turned to preparing for the Licensed Pharmacist Qualification Certificate. If she passed the exam, she could work in a chain pharmacy. &quot;It&#39;s relatively stable and there&#39;s no age limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But before that, I have to find a job to transition. Chen Min walked along the street from shop to shop until he saw a notice recruiting waiters at a small restaurant on the street, and worked as a waiter there. After being introduced by the restaurant owner&#39;s wife, I came to work part-time as a dishwasher at a nearby barbecue stall. The total of the two salaries is not much different from that of working in the hospital. Chen Min also paid social security again in the form of flexible employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Chen Min still has her own concerns about these two jobs. When looking for a job, she deliberately avoided being near the hospital because she didn&#39;t want to run into her former colleagues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When working in the hospital, the nurses wear the same uniforms and masks, with their eyes exposed. Most of the time, patients have difficulty even distinguishing nurses with different appearances, and they treat nurses with the same courtesy and respect. But after taking off her nurse&#39;s uniform and mask, she was still a little worried when facing the guests, food and dishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now her time is divided into four periods. She gets up at 7 a.m. to prepare for the exam, works as a waiter in a restaurant from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., then washes dishes at a barbecue stall, and returns around 12 p.m. home, and then continue reading until 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents-in-law still take care of everything at home for her, and her husband also supports her to continue taking exams and do what she wants to do. Occasionally, my 7-year-old son saw Chen Min reading in her room and brought her own books to keep her company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, Chen Min wrote: &quot;My failure to pass the establishment examination is definitely not because I didn&#39;t work hard enough, but I still believe that hard work will reward me in another way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Chen Min, Li Zhen and Lin Jiangtao are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>; Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[调停俄乌冲突，百岁基辛格的功绩与争议丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258084]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 24, 2023 local time, according to the &quot;Ukrainian Pravda&quot; report, Ukrainian President Zelensky During his recent visit to the United States, he met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Andrei Yermak, director of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, posted the above news on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger visited China two months ago and attended the Bund Financial Summit online on September 23. The centenarian is still playing his part on the international stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why Kissinger is still active&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The world today is facing huge risks, unlike any risks since the Cold War. Previous risks, whether the United States sent troops to Afghanistan or Iraq, occurred between world powers and small and medium-sized countries, and the risk of escalation is unlikely. But this time, it has become a confrontation between world powers and a strategic confrontation between nuclear powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Great Game between Russia and the West behind it have had a strong impact on the post-Cold War world order. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine marks a serious challenge to the post-Cold War world order. On the other hand, this is also the first indirect confrontation between Russia and the US and Western camps after the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yermak&#39;s account, Kissinger told Zelensky during the meeting, &quot;Before this war, I opposed Ukraine joining NATO because I was worried that it would set in motion the war we are seeing now. process (the outbreak of the conflict). Now this process has reached such an extent that the idea of ​​​​keeping Ukraine neutral in this situation no longer makes sense.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time Kissinger has mentioned Ukraine joining NATO. On May 17, The Economist published an exclusive interview with Kissinger. During the interview, Kissinger stated that he supports Ukraine&#39;s membership of NATO. He also said: &quot;Ukraine should continue to be protected by Europe, rather than becoming an isolated country that protects itself on its own.&quot; Regarding Russia, Kissinger said, &quot;If I talk to (Russian President) Putin, I will tell him , Ukraine will be safer if it stays in NATO.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Kissinger called on all parties to sit down and carry out diplomatic negotiations. He warned that there is now a risk that the great powers&#39; military relationships dominate their geopolitical calculations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict may therefore develop into a global conflict, and diplomatic negotiations will become &quot;increasingly important.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Sino-US relations have undergone qualitative changes since the Trump era. Conflict has begun to replace cooperation and become the key word in Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the relationship between the world&#39;s major powers, represented by the relationship between China, the United States and Russia, has become very dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Kissinger became increasingly worried about Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 16, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that Sino-US relations are on &quot;a cliff&quot; and &quot;the current trajectory of the relationship must change.&quot; Later, Kissinger also said that the Cold War between China and the United States is now &quot;walking on a mountain road.&quot; Kissinger believes that China and the United States &quot;both believe that the other side poses a strategic threat. We are moving towards a confrontation between major powers.&quot; This is a process that &quot;should not continue&quot;. Once a conflict breaks out between China and the United States, it will be comparable to World War I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Kissinger actively mediates the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and drags his old body to visit China, which is an attempt to stabilize Sino-US relations and exert his residual energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why Kissinger? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are many influential strategists. There are also many people who are worried about the international situation and are trying to improve Russia-Ukraine relations and Sino-U.S. relations. But why Kissinger and not someone else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Kissinger has a superstitious admiration and sense of mission for the United States. As a German Jew who escaped the Nazi regime, to hold a high position in the United States is an example of an American success story. This also makes him always grateful to the United States. He once wrote: &quot;The same generosity of spirit and lack of malice can be found anywhere else.&quot; This almost sentimental gratitude and admiration for the United States made him serve the United States at all costs in diplomacy and devote himself to Maximize the national interests of the United States. For this reason, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his personal beliefs and did not care about his personal success or failure, reaching the height of &quot;living and dying for the benefit of the country, how can he avoid it for the sake of misfortunes and blessings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, more than half of Kissinger’s diplomatic achievements are in Sino-US relations. Kissinger is an eyewitness and operator of America&#39;s transformation from decline to prosperity. If President Nixon had not accepted his suggestion, destroyed the Sino-Soviet alliance, and shifted the strategic focus of the United States from Asia to Europe, it would have been difficult for the United States to win the Cold War in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered American politics, the United States was experiencing its lowest point after World War II, and was experiencing triple crises in foreign strategy, economy, and society. The United States was trapped in the Vietnam War and was unable to extricate itself; it was in economic difficulties, and the U.S. dollar lost its ability and credibility to redeem gold; domestic society was in chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger left American politics, the United States had successfully transformed China from an enemy of the United States into a &quot;friendly non-ally&quot; of the United States against the Soviet Union. Although the U.S. dollar can no longer be redeemed freely with gold, it has been tied back to the oil trade, achieving an upgrade from the U.S. dollar to an international standard currency. The U.S. dollar has transformed from an intermediary in world economic and trade to a truly hegemonic currency and an international standard currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These all make Kissinger unique and a myth and legend in the diplomatic community. His status and influence in international politics, especially in Sino-US relations, are irreplaceable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Symbol of the Times&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On June 16, 2023, according to Xinhua News Agency, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that American politics is polarized , is currently &quot;overly focused&quot; on its own interests, and if its foreign policy fails to balance the interests of the United States and the world, the United States &quot;will become isolated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Sino-US relations turned from hostility to cooperation was that both countries had to deal with the threat from the Soviet Union. However, without Kissinger&#39;s insight and courage, it would be difficult for China-US relations to quickly restart in such a bad bilateral relationship. The symbolic effect produced by this overlapping interaction between individuals and times is something that no one else can possess. Kissinger has become a symbol, a symbol of an era, and is unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, it was a product of the times when China and the United States united to fight against the Soviet Union during difficult times. When Kissinger secretly visited China, it was the Soviet Union&#39;s rise and hardening period, and it was a difficult period for China and the United States. The handshake between China and the United States across the Pacific and across the ideological divide not only created a diplomatic legend, but also stabilized the world situation at the time and destined the outcome of the Cold War in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger came to China, he saw the strategic contradictions and ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, and wanted to contact China to jointly fight the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, China and the United States have become the biggest beneficiaries of the end of the Cold War. After the end of the Cold War, both China and the United States were able to get rid of security concerns, reduce security burdens, and focus on economic development. The rise of China in the world and the rise of the United States within the Western camp complement each other. It can be said that Kissinger&#39;s personal luck lies in standing at a turning point in Sino-US relations and the world structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a personal level, Kissinger is often called a realist, mainly because he puts strategic thinking ahead of ideology. This distinguishes Kissinger from the current strategic researchers in the United States who are guided by ideology. However, he did not take ideological factors into consideration. In fact, he calls his foreign policy principles &quot;liberal internationalism,&quot; which is equivalent to the neoconservatism of the George W. Bush era. It is the product of combining the emphasis on values, internationalist principles, and diplomacy based on national strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of this kind of liberal internationalism that he offended the two US presidents, Trump and Biden. On November 25, 2020, Trump fired Kissinger from his position as an advisor to the U.S. Defense Policy Council. However, he is also dissatisfied with Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan, believing it to be an irresponsible act that betrays the tradition of U.S. foreign policy dating back to President Wilson. One result of expressing this rhetoric is that Biden inherits Trump&#39;s approach to Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are many talents in the U.S. strategic field, and many of the younger generation of strategic people than Kissinger have also withdrawn from the stage. The young and middle-aged strategic talents in the United States are now leading the charge in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, age is a major advantage for Kissinger. Kissinger is 100 years old and has outlived all his friends and opponents. Kissinger is the only 100-year-old international politician in the world who is still active and has great influence. This makes Kissinger&#39;s role largely unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can Kissinger be copied? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Kissinger is a product of his times. Times cannot be repeated, and Kissinger cannot be copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the shape of Sino-US relations has changed. During the Cold War, the biggest external threat to China and the United States was the Soviet Union. For the sake of their own security, China and the United States have established a quasi-alliance system across the ideological divide, which is in line with their own interests. Now, as China has unprecedentedly entered the center of the world&#39;s power stage, Sino-US relations have become the most important bilateral relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the characteristics of diplomacy have changed. The realists represented by Kissinger advocate personal factors and are superstitious about secret diplomacy. This was already outdated by the end of the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger was obsessed with those passionate years throughout his life, and was intoxicated by the thrill and excitement of secretly boarding a plane from Pakistan to Beijing. In the post-Cold War era, especially in the era of highly transparent and open self-media, these individual heroic diplomatic behaviors are difficult to reproduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Kissinger’s influence in the United States has declined much faster than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the new era, many Americans are also reflecting on and challenging Kissinger&#39;s past contributions and achievements. The famous international relations scholar Hans Morgenthau has long said that Kissinger, like Odysseus in Homer&#39;s epic poem, &quot;has many facades.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are two descriptions of Kissinger: one is a liar. This person never tells the truth, always speaks ambiguous words, and almost never makes clear public comments on major events. This may be one of the secrets of his longevity in the world of international relations. Second, Kissinger is an amazing person with an excellent memory. He was an eyewitness and living dictionary of many major events. Christopher Hitchens&#39;s description of Kissinger is perhaps more accurate, calling him &quot;a stunning liar with an incredible memory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, there is something very dangerous. Compared with Kissinger, whose main achievement was during the Cold War, current American strategists basically grew up in a peaceful atmosphere. For them, peace is no longer the primary goal of international politics, but the premise or background of international politics, which does not need to be fought for or paid for. Therefore, we can see that compared with Kissinger&#39;s concerns about the prospect of conflict, many American strategists seem not to be concerned about the possibility of conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, there will not be another Kissinger, but the crisis that Kissinger is worried about will continue to be repeated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the American Studies Center of Fudan University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为啥没有诺贝尔数学奖：因为诺贝尔的妻子被数学家拐跑了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258076]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It was not until Nobel&#39;s death in 1896 that his family, friends and colleagues knew that the Swedish billionaire 94% of his property was donated to the foundation to establish 5 awards: Physics Award, Chemistry Award, Physiology or Medicine Award, Literature Award, Peace Award, and held the first award ceremony in 1901 - today, There is also a sixth award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was established by the Swedish Central Bank in 1969 to commemorate Nobel, so it is sometimes not regarded as the orthodox Nobel Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the five Nobel Prizes or the six Nobel Prizes, mathematics prizes are not included. As for why, you may have heard a legend: Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler kidnapped Nobel&#39;s wife, so Nobel hated everyone who studied mathematics and refused to establish a mathematics prize from the foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is actually a complete rumor. Nobel was never married and had no wife at all. In fact, if Nobel had a wife and children, he might not be able to donate his property to the foundation to establish awards. Therefore, in some versions of the story, it was not Nobel&#39;s wife who was abducted, but his lover.然而今天当我们去回顾诺贝尔的一生，会发现这位富可敌国的发明家，在感情路上并不顺利，他仅有的两位绯闻对象都和数学家没啥关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1833年10月21日，瑞典斯德哥尔摩的一个知识分子家庭诞生了一个男婴，被取名为阿尔弗雷德•诺贝尔，他后来成为著名的科学家、发明家、商人和诺贝尔奖的创始人。他的父亲老诺贝尔是一位建造学工程师，在岩石爆破领域颇有研究。阿尔弗雷德•诺贝尔后来走上炸药研制和工程发明之路，其实是家学渊源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而就在小诺贝尔出生的同一年，他的父亲事业不顺，因工程事故破了产。到他4岁的时候，老诺贝尔见留在瑞典赚不到钱，就决定去芬兰和俄罗斯闯荡。留下妻儿们守着一个小杂货铺，在斯德哥尔摩勉强糊口。小诺贝尔的童年因此过得颇为饥寒，也没能好好上学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好在老诺贝尔最后在俄罗斯闯出了名堂，他在圣彼得堡开了一家机械车间，并设计了一种新型简易水雷，为俄军提供装备：他让沙皇和将军们相信，水雷可以阻止敌舰迫近首都。 1853 年至1856年克里米亚战争期间，这些水雷成功阻止了英国海军袭击圣彼得堡。俄罗斯最早的中央供暖装置，也是在老诺贝尔的工厂制造。而全俄第一个装上中央供暖的，也就是诺贝尔家，这对“冬将军”的国度可是一个不小的震撼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着父亲在俄罗斯的成功，诺贝尔全家于1842年迁往圣彼得堡。原本连小学都没读完的小诺贝尔，终于有了机会接受一流教育。小诺贝尔对文学、化学和物理最感兴趣，给老师们留下了很深的印象：他异常聪明但体弱多病，喜欢独处和沉思，对英国文学特别着迷，尤其喜欢诗人拜伦和雪莱——学生时代的诺贝尔将雪莱主张的博爱与和平主义、不可知论与无神论，都奉为自己的人生圭臬。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是老诺贝尔更希望儿子们能子承父业，不满意小诺贝尔的文学志向。他于是决定送这个年轻人出国学习，以成为一名化学工程师。青年诺贝尔就这样来到了巴黎留学，师从著名化学家佩罗兹。在佩罗兹教授门下，他遇到了一位年轻的意大利化学家索布雷罗。三年前，索布雷罗发明了硝酸甘油，一种高爆炸性液体。索布雷罗认为这东西太危险，无法实际使用。然而诺贝尔对硝酸甘油很感兴趣，认为其在工程领域大有前途。等他完成学业回到俄罗斯，就和父亲一起启动了硝酸甘油的研发工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但彼时克里米亚战争已经结束，父亲的生意每况愈下，最后只得搬家回瑞典。诺贝尔的两个哥哥留在了俄罗斯，试图挽救仅存的家族企业。他们最后取得了成功，转向了俄罗斯南部新兴的石油工业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1863年，诺贝尔随父亲返回瑞典，集中精力开发硝酸甘油炸药。不幸的是，这些实验发生了事故，导致多人死亡，其中包括诺贝尔的弟弟埃米尔。瑞典政府下令，在斯德哥尔摩市范围内禁止炸药实验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但诺贝尔并没有放弃，将实验转移到了瑞典梅拉伦湖的驳船上。 1866年，他的实验终于取得突破：通过将硝酸甘油与一种叫做硅藻土的细沙混合，可以将液体变成糊糊，得以制成炸药棒。他还顺便发明了雷管，可以通过点燃导火索来引爆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与研究水雷的父亲不同，作为和平主义者的诺贝尔，将这些发明投入了民用领域，例如钻隧道、爆破岩石、修建运河等。炸药和雷管的发明，大大降低了工程成本，立刻风靡建筑行业。诺贝尔因此在90个不同的地方设立工厂，却仍然供不应求。他自己住在巴黎，但经常前往他在20多个国家的工厂，因此被维克多•雨果称为“欧洲最富有的流浪汉”。他还研发合成橡胶、皮革和人造丝，一生获得了355项专利，是名副其实的发明大王。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;密集的工作和旅行，让这位发明大王无暇解决个人问题，一直都是个单身汉。直到43岁那年，诺贝尔聘用了一位通晓多国语言、受过良好教育的奥地利女管家伯莎•金斯基——诺贝尔对她一见倾心，可伯莎却早已心有所属。在为诺贝尔工作了很短一段时间后，她决定返回奥地利与未婚夫完婚。尽管如此，诺贝尔和伯莎仍成了好朋友，之后几十年间一直互相写信。伯莎是著名的反战者，写有代表作《放下你的武器》。她对诺贝尔影响很大，不仅加强了诺贝尔的和平主义信仰，也是诺贝尔最后设立和平奖的关键。诺贝尔去世后，挪威议会将1905年的诺贝尔和平奖颁发给了伯莎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诺贝尔的第二段感情，缘起于1876年秋天的一次商业性旅行。诺贝尔来到奥地利，结识了贫穷而美丽的少女索菲亚。诺贝尔被她的坦率和美貌所吸引，索菲亚被诺贝尔的钱所吸引——很显然，这段感情从开始就注定悲剧。诺贝尔很爱护索菲亚，给她钱花，花费心血教导她，试图提升她的品德和知识，但无济于事。索菲亚越来越任性，在诺贝尔为她准备的巴黎豪华公寓里养起了情夫。诺贝尔几次决心分手，都经受不起索菲亚的纠缠，一年又一年地纵容着她的任性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从学生时代开始，诺贝尔就一直内向孤独，曾一度因抑郁症入院治疗。连续遭遇感情不顺，更是加重了他的病，以至于他曾写道：“只有在狗中，才能找到许多朋友。”晚年的诺贝尔饱受听力问题和心绞痛折磨，医生建议他服用硝酸甘油——这正是让他功成名就的炸药原料。诺贝尔在给亲朋的信中吐槽：“他们竟然给我开内服硝酸甘油，这似乎是命运的讽刺！”直到今天，硝酸甘油仍然是治疗急性心绞痛的特效药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1891年春天，就在诺贝尔去世前五年，索菲亚又给他写了一封信要钱，理由是自己怀孕了。但诺贝尔知道，孩子的父亲是一位年轻的匈牙利军官，二人正准备结婚。这对小夫妻婚后的主要经济来源，是恬不知耻地给诺贝尔写信索要巨款——而在诺贝尔的遗嘱里，他居然真的从剩下的6%里拿出了一大笔钱给索菲亚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于传闻中拐走诺贝尔老婆的瑞典数学家戈斯塔•米塔格-莱夫勒，他比诺贝尔小13岁，诺贝尔搬去法国的时候，他还在上学。戈斯塔终其一生和诺贝尔都没有什么交集，倒是和诺贝尔奖很有交集：他1903年被选为诺贝尔奖委员会的成员，并力排众议，坚持将诺贝尔奖授予居里夫妇两人，而非居里先生一人。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;《撞空》是2023年8月出版的长篇小说，书中的主人公是在广州市中心上班的职员，写下它的人笔名宥予，30岁出头，自然也被认为有过类似经验。他当然也上过一些不咸不淡的班，还经营过卖黄焖鸡的饭店。但动笔写这本在地感丰满的长篇小说时，距离他搬来广州不过两三年，他与故事里反复出现的几条街道也仅有几面之缘。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有求职打算，他揣着开饭店赚下的钱，决意来广州过一种低成本的创作生活。考察了几个区图书馆后，综合考虑了环境、人流量、房租，他租在了地铁线的终点站，每天朝九晚五地前往附近的黄埔区图书馆写作，根据四季的空调风口、窗外景观更换着馆内的心仪座位，听着巴赫的无伴奏大提琴组曲，构建着30公里外的上班族生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截然不同于需要长期扎根陌生环境才有把握书写的那类小说家，旁人费力揣度、如同覆上了紧实难拆的塑料膜的外部生活，在他眼里却像透明脆弱的气泡，一戳就破。逛街的时候，他感到自己的大脑不受控地像是突破了物理界限，扩散、降落到周围所有的东西上，建筑、椅子甚至一小片树叶上移动的光斑，都源源不断地向他输送信息。其充沛程度甚至会形成负累，导致每次外出回家后都几乎虚脱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开始写作之后，他终于找到一个途径来释放。偶尔谈及这份“困扰”，他仿佛试探着伸出食指揩拭柜壁的灰尘，看到一条笨拙而明显的痕迹时才明白，哦原来别人和我不一样。评论家李静充分感受到了他的“特质”，形容他像雷达一样对身边的处境时刻处在一种感应的状态。“而且他好像是完全不能忽略任何一种信息、任何一种处境，他能够随时在心灵中做出反应，并且把这种反应用特别精准、像诗一样的语言流淌出来。”她称他为“美杜莎的反面”，意思是他的目光所及之处，一切固态的物体都消融为活的、液体的或者气体的，成为了音乐、鸟、生命。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宥予回想起来，这种“特异能力”似乎与地点无关。读书时的河南老家，打工时的上海都市，他都无法摆脱这样的体验。时间上的划分更为明显，“得知母亲车祸去世的那一刻，我的听觉好像一下子变得不一样了。周围有好几十人，每个人都在说话，但是我都能听得到他们在说什么。我当时一下子就哭了，但其实心里并没有感到悲伤难过。死到底是怎么回事？周围很多人夸我懂事了，知道哭，反而给了我一种鼓励，让我哭得更狠，让我知道更该哭了。之前作为孩子，整个成人世界其实是有一堵墙围着，但在那之后你会感觉到堤坝一下子崩塌了，像洪水一样直接涌到了我的（面前）。我亲身体会到每一种关系的变动，不光是亲人，包括任何一个周遭环境里的人，所有的东西都在改变。这种改变令我特别清晰地意识到，如何拿出一个符合所有人期待的样子，但其实我心里知道我是在表演给所有人看。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生怕打扰到别人，他本就偏小的音量被压得更低。从一楼到二楼，我们换了三次座位，仍然难逃被音响、旁人交谈以及咖啡机动静合力淹没的命运。怀着焦躁的心情，我艰难打捞他的微弱回应——卖过保险，打理过宠物公司的天猫旗舰店，在软件销售公司负责售后工作有过亮眼表现，应付客户无穷无尽的谩骂时他极具耐心，却在老板提拔他带小组时果断辞职不干。他视工作为机械的表演，“只不过不信邪，还是要做一做，其实只是在回避写作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对提问，他很少直接回应，带着小说家的叙事节奏，不是兜个小弯那么简单，而是径直走向完全不相干的路线，在你不确定还会不会回来时突然急刹车——“我还是从头跟你说吧。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;回避写作&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你很早之前就很想写作了吗？去上海上班之前就已经想？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;说实话，真的是实话。我从认字开始就喜欢看字，但是当时我们那也都买不起书。课本之外，能看到字的地方我都看，比如化肥袋子、农药标签上的成分表，纸团啥的都打开。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最早看书应该是我妈妈去世后，她是在我上小学四年级时去世的。那时候我姐她们上初中，周末有几次带了书回来，有《呼啸山庄》，还有《简·爱》。那时候看不太懂谈恋爱啥的，具体情节也没记住，看完了就觉得这些人怪怪的，挺好玩的，和旁边的人都不一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;还记得当时看书的那种感觉吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;最清楚的感觉是《战争与和平》。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我一上初中——那时住校，每周日傍晚骑几公里的车到镇上的学校。一开始在学校吃饭是用饭票，得驮一袋小麦到学校旁给合作的面粉厂，再拿纸条找会计换成饭票。等上初二的时候好像粮食价格涨了点，我爸算算账觉得给钱可能更划算，就一个星期给10块钱，但他没算到我当时在长身体，饭量增加了。（我）就每顿都饿，那时候知道赚钱特难，也不说什么。偶尔去我大姑妈家还能蹭顿饱饭，所以我现在见到亲爱的大姑妈，心里还有那种饱腹感，觉得很踏实。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一次我们进到一个书店，到处都是盗版的李凉、古龙的书，托尔斯泰和雨果的则在角落里瑟瑟发抖。那时候肯定买不起，一块多也买不起，毕竟饭都吃不饱。最终不知道怎么攒出来几块钱，可能过了几个月，暑假前买了两本，一本是《战争与和平》，另一本真想不起来了。买回去之后翻开，第一页那个字密密麻麻，还有好多法语。那时连天下雨，铺天盖地。地面上全是黄水，树枝有时候会被刮掉，雨声交杂着夏末最后一批蝉声和鸟窝被吹散后幼鸟发出的惨叫。在这些声音下，我在堂屋的躺椅上看《战争与和平》，天黑也没太意识到。我爸不知道从哪儿冒出来，说天这么黑了，都毁眼了。因为当时电线给刮断了，我就挪到门口的廊子下，一直看到彻底没有光线之后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二天早上醒过来，又可以看到字了。那样花了三四天，就是大雨期间，把《战争与和平》看完了。很难说它到底给我的影响是什么，从此以后大脑里就会有另一个空间的感觉在，包括周围的一切，平原、树林、阴雨。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;那时候看完也想写点什么吗，有动笔吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有。到高中的时候写了一篇作文，班主任语文老师在后面批：“以后有没有兴趣在写作方面发展。”我当时想，我才不要在这个没前途的路上发展，觉得肯定会很难。我是前几天回想起来才发现，好多人都已经意识到我肯定是要做（写作）这种事情的，反倒是我自己一直在回避。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你之前有条件写作吗？可以不去上班就单纯写作吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;没有条件。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;对啊，所以也不能说是逃避。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那倒也是。做了几份工作后开了一个饭店，有点积蓄之后，我意识到我对上班这些东西发自心底没有兴趣。所有东西我只是这样：有一个任务来了就把它处理干净，能处理多好就处理多好，执行上没问题，但是我就没有（持续下去的）动力。我十来岁就意识到自己的不上进，对父亲期待的那种生活完全没有动力。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;开完饭店、来广州之后就没找工作了是吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我毕业后很长时间没看书——到广州之后，找了一些书来看，觉得哎也不难写，那我就试试，一写发现还挺难的。语言的节奏、叙述视角、切入角度，还有一个故事从哪个时间点进去更有力量等等，这些都是一点一点摸索。一般改完之后，很快又发现还是一堆垃圾。一遍一遍地再改，每周都要经历一次你觉得是垃圾到觉得写出了最好作品的那个极致的拉扯过程。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;最多的时候一个作品会改出几个版本？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;前两天有一篇刚定稿——其实我一直不舍得定稿。我小时候外婆会做黄酵母，会在太阳底下晒。她每次做都会有一块面团晒干集中在面缸里，下次再去发酵的时候，把那个面团拿出来用。我有两个中篇一直不舍得定稿，它们就是我那两个小面疙瘩。直到意识到那个人身上再没有一丝我的影子了，他真的变成他自己，我才放手。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《撞空》你也改过。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;也改了，不满意嘛，某一天当我决定写它的时候，就一下子，一个北方来的人的生活，带着他过去所有的那些东西（就来了）。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;小说主人公何小河还是有很多你的影子？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会有，最起码死亡的经历是有的。他的母亲、他也一样在广漂、他喜欢吃的东西……很多事确实是我的。但我和他不一样，而且我写《撞空》的时候特别警惕。因为离我们都太近了，一不小心就容易写出那种失意者的自怜，写出一种好像加了人工奶油般的浪漫，一种泛滥的温情。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我在写的时候不敢爱他们中的任何一个人，有一只眼睛始终在盯着自己。但凡写着写着察觉到要动情了，我都会停下来，然后在图书馆溜达溜达，再重新检查一遍，确认没有我的情绪进去再接着写。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;何小河对事情的看法感受有哪些跟你是不一样的？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;很多，我也没办法概括分析，我觉得他会收敛，为人处事上我比他更虚伪一点。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;他已经很虚伪了。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我比他更虚伪。有些事需要我公开表达的时候，我并不怕，但是我说完之后，会特别讨厌我说的每一句话。因为我很清晰地意识到，我说的时候，有四个我在起作用，一个是我期望中的我，一个是我想让别人看到的我，一个是我以为的我，还有一个更本源的我。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哪怕我知道更本源的我是什么，我也没法把我以为的我给抹除掉，然后我也没办法不去做想让别人看到的我。整个过程中我知道我的虚荣、我的虚伪、我的矫饰，还有我的真诚和坦然其实是同时存在的。可能这四个统一起来成为完整的一个时，那是真正真实的。假这样，我可能会没那么厌恶自己。我不知道别人会不会这样，你会有这种（感受）吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我可能没那么多，不至于厌恶我说过的话。你以前工作的经历中会需要经常对公众讲话吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;卖保险的时候，还有晨会、年会也要做主持。写作之后我本来不觉得大家会需要我来讲自己，可能只需要说我是怎么写的就好了。上一次在佛山宣传彭剑斌的新书时，和他们见面，意识到他们会对我产生好奇，为什么会这样？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尤其那时候是我第一次真正地见读者，看那一张张脸，之前我都是一个人在图书馆写。对谈结束后有一个女生来问我，她说她也在写，但是有点迷茫。那时候我意识到虽说我的回答未必有那么大的作用，但可能会有那么一点点小影响。这个东西让我觉得还挺恐慌，挺怕的。我就尽可能把我真诚的东西讲出来，才让我不那么恐慌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我以前其实不热爱文学，我之所以写是因为这的确是我能找到的我和世界和他人和自己相处的一个方式。我是遇到了（罗）丹妮还有（王）家胜（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《撞空》编辑&lt;/span>;）、剑斌他们，我发现他们是真的爱这个东西。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ZZhNQSFgRSF3aW6SyYg1ZYul5DeG8Hz4D6AbvSxY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1247&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ZZhNQSFgRSF3aW6SyYg1ZYul5DeG8Hz4D6AbvSxY.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;我在《撞空》快结束的时候挺空落的，当时就想到了一个长篇的题材，想用编年体写一个人的二三十年，但我在梳理的时候，发现里面有一个人拿出来好像就是一个很好的中篇。然后我就开始写那个，但那段时间图书馆也不让进，就在房间里写。当时还老犯鼻炎，后来又感染新冠，烧了五天痛苦死了。在那个过程中可能有两三个月写完了那个中篇，四万字左右。其实是不发表的东西，我不太愿意给别人看。写完之后，有一个朋友正好问我，她说她就想看点东西，问我有没有。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她上班，不写东西，也没看过《撞空》。我就把那个以母女为线的中篇故事给她看了。下午发的，到晚上的时候她看完了，说心里堵得厉害、憋得难受。之后她给妈妈打了个电话，两人第一次在电话里痛哭流涕，她第一次听妈妈说年轻时候的事，听她单纯作为一个女人的时候，她的爱、她的情感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没觉得我写得多好，或者说真起那么大作用，可能在那个时间点上确实让她有一个契机，终于愿意和母亲有那样一个沟通。如果我写的东西对这么具体的一个人稍微有这么一点作用的话，我心里是会有点慰藉的感觉。她和她妈妈从那之后，一直保持相对好的沟通方式。互相有了信任和支撑，想到这个我还很开心的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你还写过一个关于父女的故事，主角为什么选择广州西关的一个女人？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;一开始不是写“西关的女人”。一开始是做了一个梦，我梦见非洲的沙漠里有个叫赛里史龙洞的地方，里面有一条龙，那里的人以喝龙奶为生，醒来之后慢慢地就写出来一个男人生活在广州，但是他一闭眼就会有另一个身份，去赛里史龙洞的一个故事。写完之后我意识到它只是一个男人的自怜和矫饰，单独拿出来，最起码对我来说我是没办法接受的，是不成立的。最后我发现我要从他女儿的角度去重新写整个故事。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;别的很多小说也可能是由梦来的？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;醒来后稍微记一下的很多，但是写出来的只有这一个，因为现在精力不够，要写的东西非常多。今年下半年要写一个长篇，这篇好多人物从去年年底开始，不断地在我脑子里蹦出来，时不时我就看到他们在那待着，他们在想什么、在挣扎什么、在说什么话。偶尔还会冒出来一个新人物，他可能稍微说一句话，我一下子就看到他的童年，他的整个路径。我在写其他小说的时候他们还在冒，它是发生在2022年下半年的故事，也很近。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有受到现实生活的启发吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;宥予：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;会有。但我不会直接写很多大事，我在处理很多中短篇的时候也这样，我觉得直接写这个事没意思，我还是喜欢写一个事件可能过去很久了，但是在某个人整个生命中是怎么起作用的。就好像在水面上每扔一块石头进去，水波兴起之后，水波消散，那这个水面还是原来那个水面吗？那个波痕到底留下了什么？我还是更有兴趣去挖掘这些东西。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;当事学生韩永（化名）表示，公示时间为9月20日至29日，而他们于28日下午也就是公示期结束的前一天，才被告知“保研资格被取消”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保研事故”“保研资格被取消”，成了这起事件的热搜标题。但这起事件仍然存在诸多需要厘清的事实细节，不能简单地归之为“事故”乃至“黑幕”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;保研中的“推荐免试”与“成功录取”是两个完全不同的概念，这一点在媒体报道中被有意无意地模糊化，也让事件的走向有些失焦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通常而言，寻求保研的大四学生需要先争取本校推免资格，然后才能申请本校或是外校的预录取资格。同时，保研在录取方式上尚有“夏令营”“预推免”“九推”（九月推免）的分野，在接收单位上也有“内保”（本校）与“外推”（他校）的区别。夏令营与预推免的优先级比“九推”为高，“内保”的把握又要比“外推”更大，这些都是“保研界”里的细分赛道，每个赛道的游戏规则也有所不同，并不能一概而论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起“保研事故”中，“被取消资格”的学生参加的就是简称为“九推”的“九月推免”。根据西北师大官网9月16日发布的《关于做好2024年推荐优秀应届本科毕业生免试攻读硕士研究生工作的通知》，此次推免工作的时间表是“9月17日学生申请，9月17-20日学院推荐，9月20日学校审核”，然后就是“9月20日至29日，学校对拟推荐名单进行公示，公示期10天”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除普通推免之外，西北师大9月16日的通知还公布了此次“九月推免”的其他种类，比如“本硕一体化”专项、“辅导员”专项计划、“农村学校教育硕士师资培养计划”专项(简称“农硕”)、“研究生支教团”专项等推免招生计划。其中“辅导员专项”推荐工作由党委学生工作部负责，属于“高校行政保研”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据《纵览新闻》引述当事学生小红（化名）的说法，此次“事故”影响的学生有一百余名，他们主要申请的是“本硕一体化卓越中学教师”与“辅导员专项”两个推免项目。中新网的报道也显示，两名受访学生都是申请了“辅导员专项”然后被取消资格的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通知显示，“辅导员专项”由党委学工部负责推荐，学制为“1+基本学制”，大四毕业后要先专职辅导员一年；“本硕一体化”的选拔工作则限定了学院与接收专业、需要签订培养协议书，学制是“3+1+2”，也就是本科三年、过渡一年，教育硕士两年。至少从这份文件的字面意思来看，校方对这两个内部保研项目的招生录取工作，都有着较大的裁量权与决定权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题推到这一步，根据已有的信息，不难得出学校确实存在失误的可能，也就是学校工作人员“手滑”，让两个“本校内部保研”项目的推免研究生公示人数超过了推免计划名额，造成名额超额。关键在于，被取消资格的保研项目，其计划名额是怎么算出来的、是否包括在总名额里，学校又是否有权取消。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“博雅数据库”刊登的一份西北师大于9月16日发布的《2024届优秀应届本科毕业生推荐免试攻读硕士生名额分配表》显示，西北师大“2024届保研名额702人，较上届（641人）明显增加”，其中“辅导员专项”拟录取35人、“本硕一体化专项”则有100人之多。而这702人并不包括“辅导员专项”。是否可以说，“辅导员专项”本身就有些“编外”性质，所以校方有权机动处理？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“辅导员专项”与“本硕一体化”去年的名额分别是40人与60人。可见，今年“辅导员专项”的名额减少而“本硕一体化”的名额增加。在“事故”发生之后，赵琴（化名）接受中新网采访说“取消资格的是中间部分”，因为“农硕已经签约，木已成舟，只能取消我们的”。韩永也表示“我们学院所有辅导员专项保研的都被取消了资格”。这个细节也显示，“辅导员专项”的签约时间与正式入学都要更晚一些。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“公示人员超额”的失误究竟发生在哪一个时间节点？为何出现了人员超额的情况？受影响的两个保研项目人员名额，又是依据什么被判定为“超额”的？超额的项目只有“辅导员专项”“本硕一体化”吗？又或者说，校方确实对两个“本校内部保研”项目拥有较大的裁量权，有权在名单公示期取消变更招生计划？这些疑问的答案，都将决定“事故”的性质究竟只是工作上的失误，还是程序上的失信。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，校方应详细解答“发现人数超额”的具体细节，向外界公布此次受影响的几个“本校保研”项目的具体规则。这样，到底是失误还是失信，就一目了然了。&lt;/p>;

Residential surveillance shall be carried out by the local public security police station, or by an entrusted The people&#39;s commune and the unit where the defendant works shall be implemented.&quot; At that time, suspects and defendants were collectively referred to as &quot;defendants&quot;, and residential surveillance measures did not distinguish between &quot;residences&quot; where they lived. Judging from the application of this measure, residential surveillance is a non-custodial measure. Although the scope of activities of suspects and defendants is restricted, their personal freedom is not deprived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1996, when the Criminal Procedure Law was revised, residential surveillance measures separated a &quot;residential residence&quot; from the residential surveillance that restricts personal freedom, and was used for suspects and defendants who &quot;have no fixed residence&quot; The suspects and defendants are required to &quot;not leave their designated residence without approval&quot; and the scope of their personal freedom is narrowed to &quot;the designated residence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the semantic point of view of the legal provisions, &quot;not leaving without permission&quot; is a restriction on the person who is &quot;designated to live&quot;. The suspects and defendants still have personal freedom to &quot;leave&quot; the designated residence. The possibility, that is, not being completely deprived, probably belongs to a kind of &quot;house arrest.&quot; However, in practice, being &quot;resident&quot; is no longer the original meaning of &quot;residential surveillance&quot;, but has become a kind of detention, which is just different from being detained in a detention center like detention or arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the Criminal Procedure Law was revised again, and the conditions for release on bail pending trial and residential surveillance were separated. Only those who meet the arrest conditions and legal circumstances can be released on bail pending trial. Article 73 of the law stipulates: &quot;Residential surveillance shall be carried out after the crime has been committed.&quot; The execution may be carried out at the residence of the suspect or defendant; if there is no fixed residence, the execution may be carried out at a designated residence. For suspected crimes endangering national security, crimes of leaving terrorist activities, or particularly serious bribery crimes, execution at the residence may hinder the investigation, after the previous With the approval of the People&#39;s Procuratorate at the highest level and the public security organ, enforcement can also be carried out in a designated residence. However, it cannot be carried out in a place of detention or a special case handling place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the legislation has tacitly approved the use of residential surveillance in a designated residence as a form of surveillance. This hidden meaning can also be seen in the practice of various detention measures, and the applicable conditions for residential surveillance are closer to the conditions for arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, residential surveillance has changed from a non-custodial measure to a custodial measure, and the suspects and defendants who have been &quot;residenced&quot; are deprived of their personal freedom. Not only that, the place of residential surveillance has also become a place of interrogation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Become &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; a temporary “case handling place” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Article 73 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that “it shall not be used in places of detention, specialized It is not prohibited to turn a residence under designated residential surveillance into a temporary &quot;case-handling place&quot;. In fact, the measure of residential surveillance has become an investigative measure to obtain confessions due to the designated residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination of detention and interrogation means that for the case-handling agency, the interrogation conducted at the designated residence is subject to few external constraints, and the interrogation process is conducive to the control and regulation of the case-handling personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interrogation is conducted in a confined space outside a detention center. If the rights of criminal suspects and defendants are not to be infringed, they must submit obediently and provide the confessions expected by the investigators on a tap; or the investigators must comply with the interrogation. Standardize and consciously restrain the inertia and impulse of illegal evidence collection. When criminal suspects and defendants are not docile and actively cooperate, torture, torture, and corporal punishment and abuse can easily occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the place of &quot;residence&quot; is also a temporary &quot;case handling place&quot;, the case handlers in the pre-trial stage also become caretakers. Therefore, eliminating outside interference has become an inevitable choice. Not only are close relatives of people under such residential surveillance not allowed to meet with them, even lawyers are not allowed to meet with them, and they cannot even know where the criminal suspects or defendants are designated to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defense lawyer complained that the accused residents’ rights to lawyers were not even as good as those of criminal suspects and defendants when they were detained in the detention center, because criminal suspects and defendants could still meet with their lawyers in the detention center. , but they are not allowed to meet him while under residential surveillance, creating a reality that is obviously disproportionate to the principle of proportionality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the close relatives of the accused resident are not informed of their designated place during the pretrial proceedings. Article 161 of the Supreme People&#39;s Court&#39;s &quot;Interpretation on the Application of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; Paragraph 2 stipulates that the close relatives of the parties should be notified of the reason and location of residence. This is because after investigation, review and prosecution of the case, it is no longer necessary to obtain confessions from the defendant outside the court. Therefore, the details of the coercive measures taken have also changed. The accusation without the function of obtaining confessions is undoubtedly closer to the essence of residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The non-custodial nature should be returned&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the name, if &quot;resident residence&quot; is still a &quot;residential surveillance&quot; measure, it should be related to the custodial measure. Essentially different, not just a formal and meaningful difference in the form of a place of detention. In other words, people under residential surveillance should have a certain degree of personal freedom. If this freedom is completely deprived, it is a measure of detention rather than residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although nothing can be seen from the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law itself, in actual case handling, residential surveillance at a designated location has indeed lost its essence of residential surveillance and has become a detention measure. During the Republic of my country, the Criminal Procedure Law of our country already included &quot;residential surveillance&quot;. This measure existed as an alternative to detention, or as a measure to release from detention. The current residential surveillance is slightly different from the word order, but the nature of this measure is originally the same. Confusing residential surveillance with detention measures, even though there are differences in detention places, is still a flaw in the design of the criminal justice system or an act that exceeds legal boundaries in judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Personal freedom is a basic human right second only to the right to life and health, and is guaranteed by the solemn commitment of the Constitution. Personal freedom is not absolute. Personal freedom can be restricted or deprived for the needs of social defense, the need for litigation and evidence preservation, the need for the personal preservation of the person being prosecuted, and as a penalty measure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, deprivation of personal freedom—whether as a social defense measure, a litigation safeguard measure, or a punishment method—needs to go through legal due process, that is, it is decided by the judicial authority, which leads to the judicial monopoly of the power of imprisonment. Sexuality and inalienability, non-judicial authorities may not deprive personal liberty for the above purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the deprivation of personal liberty stipulated in the Constitution as a protective measure appears with the word &quot;arrest&quot;. &quot;Arrest&quot; in the Constitution cannot be understood as an arrest in various coercive measures in criminal proceedings. It should be understood in a broad sense, that is, any arrest substance, no matter what the name is, will be regarded as an &quot;arrest&quot; in the Constitution and must be carried out in accordance with the Constitution. The prescribed restrictions are implemented - approval or decision of the People&#39;s Procuratorate and decision of the People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deprivation of personal freedom as a protective measure in our country ignores the broad nature of &quot;arrest&quot; in the Constitution. In addition to arrest, there are many personal freedoms that have the same essence as arrest but do not appear in the name of arrest. Deprivation measures have caused the constitutional guarantee of personal freedom to become undistributed in practice. Zhiju refers to a detention measure that is not in the name of &quot;arrest&quot; and is not held in a detention place but has the same essence as arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The death of Bao Qinrui gives us the opportunity to examine the custodialization of residential surveillance and let us think: we should return residential surveillance to its non-custodial nature and avoid confusing its essence with custodial measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[史上首次，美国“三号人物”被投票罢免]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258082]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 19:26:21&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021854946024&quot; data-media=&quot;video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;史上首次美国“三号人物”被投票罢免.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/d9dca36avodtranscq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/sampleSnapshot/sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/bJQdQltDrtQA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/bJQdQltDrtQA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
