The Chinese team lost to England 1-6 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of November 20, 2023, the Chinese Football Association officially It was announced that Shui Qingxia will no longer serve as the head coach of the Chinese women’s football team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shui Qingxia, born in 1966, is a famous Chinese football star and the main player of the Chinese women&#39;s football team in its most glorious period. After retiring in 2001, Shui Qingxia took up the coaching position. In the women&#39;s football match at the Olympic Games in July 2021, the Chinese women&#39;s football team suffered a 2-8 defeat to the Dutch team. Shui Qingxia was appointed at a critical moment and officially served as the head coach of the Chinese women&#39;s football team in November 2021. In two years, she has brought victory and hope, as well as defeat and even despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2022, Shui Qingxia led the Chinese women&#39;s football team to defeat Japan and South Korea in succession, winning the Asian Cup again after 16 years. But by 2023, the women&#39;s football team has failed to meet people&#39;s expectations in the three major events of the World Cup, Asian Games and Olympic preliminaries. In the World Cup, the Chinese women&#39;s football team failed to qualify in the group stage and was defeated by England 1-6. They lost to Japan in the Asian Games and missed the finals. The same group failed to qualify in the Olympic preliminaries and bid farewell to the 2024 Paris Olympics in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning the 2022 Asian Cup, Shui Qingxia received overwhelming praise. It is generally believed that she is the best coach candidate because she comes from the women&#39;s football team, has a brilliant resume, is well versed in the laws of women&#39;s football and athlete psychology, and has been the coach of the local team for a long time. But after consecutive losses this year, what awaits Shui Qingxia is a flood of criticism. Some good people dug up netizen comments and media comments from different periods and found that the overlap rate between those who praised Shui Qingxia at the beginning and those who are now endlessly belittling her is quite high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This itself is a reflection of the impetuous side of Chinese football, which is true for managers, practitioners and fans. After Shui Qingxia&#39;s dismissal, many people believe that some players who have not been reused before will get more opportunities. But if you know a little bit about football, you will know that the plight of the Chinese women&#39;s football team is by no means a problem that can be solved by changing the coach or a few players. Its backwardness is all-round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mUZslvouVksauZg35GdBF6w1FVEv56vmyt2C6ZQk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mUZslvouVksauZg35GdBF6w1FVEv56vmyt2C6ZQk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 22, 2023, after the Group A match of the women&#39;s football group match of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese team players bowed to head coach Shui Qingxia (first from right). The Chinese team defeated the Mongolian team 16-0 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Shui Qingxia’s departure is A metaphor for the decline of the &quot;old women&#39;s football model&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;To be fair, although Shui Qingxia has many problems in selecting, employing and on-the-spot command, she can be said to be conscientious in her role as the head coach of the Chinese women&#39;s football team Responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back then, Shui Qingxia was an all-rounder on the court. She initially practiced track and field, and did not receive professional football training until she was 17 years old. However, due to her hard training day and night, she was drafted into the national team more than a year later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shui Qingxia once recalled that the training conditions in the 1980s were very bad. The training ground only had dirt with stones on it. When she was thirsty, she could only drink tap water. This is not an isolated case. Most of the Sonorous Roses of that year stood out under such difficult conditions and competed in various world competitions under difficult conditions. However, the development of women&#39;s football in the world has long passed the era when &quot;only relying on fighting spirit can lead to victory.&quot; Shui Qingxia&#39;s dismissal is itself a metaphor for the complete decline of the &quot;old women&#39;s football model&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the defeat to England in the 2023 World Cup, player Wang Shuang choked up and asked: &quot;I dare say that we have to train harder and pay more than those players in Europe. Why can&#39;t we always get what we want?&quot; Results?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of absolute strength and the laws of competition, it is useless to rely solely on hard work. Moreover, compared with the hard-working Chinese women&#39;s football model, &quot;enjoying the joy of football&quot; is the basis of competitive rules. As England player Lauren James said after that game: &quot;The game is like playing football in the street when I was a kid. We are enjoying football to the fullest.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, around the world, In an era when no one pays much attention to women&#39;s football, the Chinese women&#39;s football team can earn its own glory through hard training and fighting spirit. However, as the professionalization of women&#39;s football is advancing rapidly, major football powers are injecting men&#39;s football and market-oriented models into women&#39;s football, and operating women&#39;s football leagues based on the mature operating experience of men&#39;s football professional leagues and professional clubs, causing the Chinese women&#39;s football team to completely lose its past advantages. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/UaIoO4PJESvwEdtA8hA0cqoQzvJIM2eDQxVWYFbt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/UaIoO4PJESvwEdtA8hA0cqoQzvJIM2eDQxVWYFbt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258983&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 11, 2023, Chinese women&#39;s football team members trained in Adelaide, Australia, to prepare for the Women&#39;s World Cup&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concepts also need to be adjusted. Many people&#39;s judgment of women&#39;s football is still stuck in the Rose Rose era. This concept not only refers to performance, but also to the environment. For example, when talking about the plight of the women&#39;s football team, many people immediately said that the women&#39;s football team is too poor. It would be great if the unsatisfactory men&#39;s football team could allocate part of the money to the women&#39;s football team to solve their worries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement shows that you don’t understand football. The rapid development of women&#39;s football in the world in recent years often benefits from highly professional and market-oriented football leagues. What the men&#39;s football team provides to the women&#39;s football team is not only the club&#39;s operating model and advanced management, but also a steady stream of financial support. &quot;Raising women&#39;s football teams with men&#39;s football teams&quot; has long been the norm in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s football team is indeed unsatisfactory, and the Jinyuan Football Team in previous years has also been criticized. But anyone familiar with the history of women’s football knows that after the retirement of the Sonorous Rose generation, the Chinese women’s football team fell into a long-term trough. The “Little Indian Spring” in recent years also benefited to some extent from the abundant funds of the Jinyuan Football Era. Although the level of the Chinese men&#39;s football professional league is not high, it is still more professional than the women&#39;s football league and can provide a relatively complete structure and system, as well as financial support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also with this support that the income of Chinese female football players is not low, and the training conditions have also been greatly improved. The &quot;Global Women&#39;s Football League Research Report&quot; released by FIFA in 2021 shows that the average annual operating costs of Chinese Women&#39;s Super League clubs rank first in the world, close to US$2 million. At present, the income of players in the Chinese Women&#39;s Super League is not lower than that of their foreign counterparts, and overseas players even face the problem that the salary for playing abroad is not as good as at home. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to use the word &quot;hardship&quot; to describe their living conditions. The real gap in women&#39;s football is not in economic conditions, but in the backward understanding of the laws of football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/yTpRowYElStPUo5e8VN1DB5ZEoD3qWqc10RP8nSo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;663&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/yTpRowYElStPUo5e8VN1DB5ZEoD3qWqc10RP8nSo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258984&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 6, 2022, the Chinese women&#39;s football team defeated the South Korean team in the 2022 Women&#39;s Asian Cup final, winning the Asian Cup for the ninth time and standing in Asia again after 16 years.

Shui Qingxia once concluded that European players generally run and sprint at a high intensity of more than 700 meters in a game, and some good players can reach more than 1,000 meters, while the average Chinese women&#39;s football team member only reaches 300 meters. When faced with the opponent&#39;s pressing, it is difficult for the Chinese women&#39;s football team members to even look up and watch the ball being passed, and their past technical advantages have long since disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of Chinese women&#39;s football has always had many inherent problems, including limited popularity of grassroots football, an imperfect youth training system, and a low level of professional leagues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current Women&#39;s Super League is still very irregular, the schedule changes frequently, and it is impossible to cultivate a fan base. Data shows that the average number of spectators per game in the first 16 rounds of the Women&#39;s Super League this season is basically around 1,500, and many spectators are family members and friends of players, or employees of sponsors, and there are very few real fans. In comparison, the women&#39;s Premier League averaged 5,099 attendances per game last season, and the &quot;North London Derby&quot; between Arsenal and Tottenham attracted 47,367 people. Last season’s Women’s Champions League quarter-final match between Barcelona and Real Madrid attracted 91,553 spectators. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve results, the national team often adopts the outdated long-term training model, which in turn affects the league schedule and quality, making it even more difficult for players to receive the influence of high-level competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mKvr4Rzijkzh9uGFSE5nNW7whRPzZ1V0EtF8j8cN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/mKvr4Rzijkzh9uGFSE5nNW7whRPzZ1V0EtF8j8cN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258985&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 1, 2023, during the final round of the Asian second stage (Group B) of the Paris Olympic Women&#39;s Football Qualifiers held in Xiamen, the head coach of the Chinese team Shui Qingxia (Left) Coaching player Wang Linlin. The Chinese team drew 1-1 with the South Korean team and missed the chance to qualify for the Paris Olympics &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The league soil is not sufficient, so If there are not enough &quot;jobs&quot; provided, there will only be fewer and fewer girls willing to embark on the path of professional football. The situation of campus football is well known to everyone. Some time ago, there was a hot topic of &quot;giving ten minutes between classes to the children.&quot; If they can&#39;t even have ten minutes between classes, how many children can get the right to play football? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The past model of women’s football was a light league and a heavy emphasis on the world series. This is a kind of inertia of thinking. Its backwardness is not only because it has lost the soil of the league, but also because even if it is limited to the World Series, it is vulnerable because it despises the laws of modern football and sports science. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Women&#39;s World Cup, Chen Wanting, the coach of the technical research team, once lamented that it was difficult for her to see the video materials she needed in the Chinese Women&#39;s Super League. Because the video materials provided to her were only shots from the perspective of the television broadcast, not the entire scene. As we all know, fans watch the game from different perspectives than coaches watch the game. What the coach needs is full-field analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coaches cannot keep up with the development trend of women&#39;s football in the world, and it is difficult for players to improve their technical and tactical abilities. The old training model can no longer adapt to the needs of modern football. It involves running circles and practicing without thinking. On the field, facing the opponent&#39;s rapid transition of offense and defense, you will be at a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, the Chinese women&#39;s football team has always faced a situation of alternation between hot and cold. Every time there is a World Series, people call for concern and development of women&#39;s football. After the competition, there is silence again. Many people use women&#39;s football as a tool to crowd out and ridicule men&#39;s football. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is praising and beating Shui Qingxia, or using the Chinese women&#39;s football team to compete with the men&#39;s football team, it is actually meaningless. What the Chinese women&#39;s football team urgently needs to do is to calm down and truly understand and learn the development laws of world football. There is no other way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安部：缅北共向我方移交电信网络诈骗犯罪嫌疑人3.1万名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260984]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 11:23:02&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/21/7da4b29319035f4df2cd598d3cac1f3c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;7008&quot; height=&quot;4672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/21/7da4b29319035f4df2cd598d3cac1f3c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258936&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the current serious situation of telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar, the Ministry of Public Security has deployed public security agencies in Yunnan and other places to continue to promote border police We have cooperated with law enforcement and carried out multiple rounds of crackdowns.

Since November, in order to advance the crackdown in depth, our public security organs have further deepened police law enforcement cooperation between China and Myanmar and launched a fierce offensive against telecom network fraud crimes in northern Myanmar. The results have been remarkable and good news has been reported frequently. Ming Guoping, Ming Julan, and Ming Zhenzhen, the important leaders of the Kokang telecom network fraud criminal group in northern Myanmar who were publicly wanted by our public security organs, were successfully arrested and brought to justice. The first criminal Ming Xuechang committed suicide in fear of crime. A large number of overseas fraud dens were successfully eradicated, which dealt a severe blow.

So far, with the strong cooperation of all parties in Myanmar, a total of 31,000 telecommunications network fraud suspects have been handed over to us and have been successively taken back by the public security organs of the places involved.

On the left is the poster of the movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and on the right is the movie &quot;The Biography of Oppenheimer&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; which has been released globally (except Japan) since the summer of 2023 It is adapted from &quot;Oppenheimer: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Father of the American Atomic Bomb&quot; (CITIC Press, 2023) written by two Pulitzer Prize winners, Kay Byrd and Martin Sherwin. The movie can be said to be very faithful to the original work. There is almost no key dialogue between the characters that is not based on the original work. Of course, due to the time limit of the film, many conversations from different occasions were grafted into one scene. For example, President Truman said that Oppenheimer was a &quot;crying scientist&quot; in a text message to his acting Secretary of State Acheson, not in person in the movie, but Oppenheimer did say it to Truman in person. &quot;I feel like my hands are stained with blood,&quot; and Truman replied, &quot;The blood is on my hands, let me worry about it&quot; (p. 393). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, reading &quot;The Biography of Oppenheimer&quot; can help us understand many scenes in the movie. When Oppenheimer first met his devoted girlfriend Joan Tatlock (a child psychiatrist who committed suicide at the age of 29), Joan discovered that he was very familiar with the different schools of psychoanalysis. If we don’t read the biography, we may generally understand that Oppenheimer is amazingly knowledgeable in both arts and sciences, which is indeed true; but the biography tells us that Oppenheimer understood the different schools of psychoanalysis and his own treatment. It is related to his experience, which also explains the incident in which he gave his Cambridge tutor Blackett (the 1948 Nobel Prize winner in physics and a famous British socialist) a &quot;poison apple&quot; when he had a mental breakdown (p. 61). When the movie deals with this incident, Bohr, a Danish physicist and one of the founders of quantum mechanics, picks up an apple, only to have it snatched away by Oppenheimer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/7y9GAec50FgO29ZkMoUxJCO3Hqq0Uc4lSttAE4xP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;1125&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/7y9GAec50FgO29ZkMoUxJCO3Hqq0Uc4lSttAE4xP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258847&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Oppenheimer (1904-1967). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer had many mental crises in his youth. It was with his upper-middle-class Jewish family that related to family background. His father immigrated to New York from Frankfurt, Germany in 1888 and gradually became a successful clothing businessman. However, discrimination against Jews was widespread in Western society at that time. In June 1925, when Oppenheimer was preparing to study at the University of Cambridge in England, his Harvard undergraduate tutor wrote this recommendation letter to him: &quot;You can tell from his name that he is a Jew, but there is nothing common about him that is Jewish. Characteristics. He is slender, handsome in appearance, and has the air of a humble gentleman. When considering his application, I don’t think you need to have any concerns because of his Jewish background.” (Page 52) Oppenheimer’s friend La Isidor Rabi (who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance, which is now widely used in hospitals) later recalled: &quot;I don&#39;t know if he considered himself Jewish, I think he fancied that he was not Jewish. I I remember he once said to me, &#39;I find Christianity very confusing, its mixture of blood and grace.&#39; He said that was what attracted him&quot; (p. 98). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer&#39;s Jewish family background was obviously one of the important factors in his transition from an apolitical physicist to an active participant in political activities after 1936, because he had to rescue several Relatives who were persecuted by the Nazis helped them immigrate from Germany to the United States. But the more important factor that prompted him to care about politics was that California, where he taught at the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, was the home base of radical political movements in Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. In 1934, the famous author Upton Sinclair almost became governor with his &quot;Plan to End Poverty in California.&quot; In 1938, left-wing Democrat Cabot Olson was elected governor of California with the open support of the state&#39;s Communist Party. His campaign slogan was &quot;Building a United Front Against Fascism&quot; (p. 142). Oppenheimer&#39;s girlfriend, wife, brother and sister-in-law were all dues-paying members of the Communist Party of the United States. The ex-husband of Oppenheimer&#39;s wife joined the Lincoln Detachment funded by the Communist Party of the United States in 1936 and died on the battlefield defending the Spanish republican system. Kenneth May, a doctoral student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, was the head of the Communist Party of the United States in Berkeley (page 172). He went to Oppenheimer&#39;s house several times to discuss political issues. Years later, he proved that in democracy The &quot;May&#39;s Theorem&quot; about simple majorities is very important in mathematical theory. Haakon Chevalier, a French literature teacher at the University of California, Berkeley, became a good friend of Oppenheimer. In 1934, he translated into English the novel &quot;The Human Condition&quot; by French writer André Malraux (who later served as President de Gaulle&#39;s Minister of Culture), which was set during the Chinese Revolution in 1927. In the spring of 1937, Chivalier accompanied Malraux on a visit to California. (Page 147) In the subsequent hearings on Oppenheimer in 1954, the &quot;Chivalier incident&quot; became the focus of questioning Oppenheimer&#39;s &quot;national loyalty.&quot; This incident has been prominently shown in the movie and will not be discussed further here. Biography can be helpful in understanding the &quot;Chivalier Incident&quot; in the movie: Chvalier and many of Oppenheimer&#39;s Communist friends believed that the United States should be informed of the plan of the United States to try to build an atomic bomb before Hitler&#39;s Germany. The Soviet Union was the ally that made the greatest sacrifice in the fascist war. Oppenheimer agreed with this view in principle, but he firmly opposed personal leaks through the back door and believed that the US government should inform the Soviet Union (page 282). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/CmZwCvdycnQzIrLl2wwBY1fhuGbElNuCFWucs4Oy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;708&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/CmZwCvdycnQzIrLl2wwBY1fhuGbElNuCFWucs4Oy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258845&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (first from left) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course , we can criticize Oppenheimer for being too naive. However, most scientists who participated in the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; were deeply disturbed that the achievements of 300 years of modern science were mainly reflected in the creation of atomic bombs that could destroy mankind. On October 5, 1943, Oppenheimer&#39;s spiritual idol, the Danish physicist Bohr, escaped from Nazi-occupied Copenhagen by hiding in the bomb bay of a British bomber. After he came to Los Alamos, the site of the Manhattan Project, he persuaded Oppenheimer to turn his attention to the postwar consequences of the atomic bomb. Bohr believed that the Soviets must be informed of the existence of the nuclear bomb project and guaranteed not to pose a threat to them in order to avoid a postwar nuclear arms race (p. 319). In the spring of 1944, Bohr held private meetings with Roosevelt and Churchill, but failed to persuade the leaders of the United States and Britain to share plans for atomic bomb production with the Soviet Union. Despite this, most scientists who participated in the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; still regarded Bohr as God and Oppenheimer as a prophet of God (p. 326). Interestingly, Oppenheimer called the first atomic bomb test the &quot;Trinity Experiment,&quot; implying that man was becoming &quot;God&quot; (p. 679). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Oppenheimer participated in the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; and became its scientific director in order to build the atomic bomb before the Nazis, then he was already very reluctant to the decision to drop the atomic bomb in Japan (this The reason why he told President Truman that he had blood on his hands). By the summer of 1952, Oppenheimer was clearly and firmly opposed to the United States experimenting with a hydrogen bomb that was thousands of times more powerful than the atomic bomb. &quot;Opposing the development of the hydrogen bomb&quot; was one of the two accusations against Oppenheimer (the other one was the aforementioned &quot;Khiva&quot;) in the 1954 hearings held by U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss (the main scene of the movie). Lié incident&quot;). But in fact, opposition to the development of hydrogen bombs is the unanimous opinion of the Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, chaired by Oppenheimer, whose members include Nobel Prize winners in physics Fermi, Lawrence, and Harvard University President Conant (page 495) . The hydrogen bomb (fusion reaction), which is more terrifying than the atomic bomb (fission reaction), will definitely escalate the nuclear arms race. As Vannevar Bush, who had a great influence on the formulation of U.S. science and technology policy after World War II, said when testifying in support of Oppenheimer at a hearing in 1954: &quot;I maintain that that experiment (referring to the 1952 U.S. hydrogen bomb experiment ) made it impossible for us to reach the only feasible agreement with the Soviet Union, which was that neither side would conduct experiments again.&quot; (Page 626) George Kennan, the proposer of the &quot;containment&quot; strategy not shown in the movie, also opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. When he attended a hearing in 1954 to defend Oppenheimer&#39;s participation in the left-wing movement when he was young, he said, &quot;If the church only focused on his youth when judging St. Francis, he would not have become what he later became.&quot; In fact, as early as January 1950, after an in-depth discussion with Oppenheimer, Kennan wrote a report in the form of a &quot;personal note&quot; to Secretary of State Acheson opposing the development of the hydrogen bomb, and Acheson told Kennan He said that after writing this report, it would be best to consider resigning. After leaving the government, Kennan spent the rest of his life at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (p. 503). This also shows that the strategy actually implemented by the United States in the Cold War was not Kennan&#39;s &quot;containment&quot; but the National Security Council (NSC) drafted in April 1950 by Paul Nitze, who took over as director of the Office of Policy Planning of the State Department after Kennan resigned. - Document No. 68, which clearly rejected Kennan&#39;s &quot;no first use of nuclear weapons&quot; policy proposition. (Page 507)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The villain in the movie is undoubtedly Strauss. He not only fought against Oppenheimer as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, but also continued to fight against Oppenheimer as chairman of the board of directors of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. An interesting example is: Strauss opposed Oppenheimer&#39;s proposal to hire Kantolovitch, the author of The King&#39;s Two Bodies, because he refused to require the University of California to require teachers to swear an oath not to join the Communist Party, despite a later U.S. Supreme Court decision UC’s oath requirement is unconstitutional. Strauss was a self-made millionaire. In 1917, when he was 21 years old, he worked as an unpaid assistant to future U.S. President Herbert Hoover. He used this as a springboard to get the opportunity to enter a Wall Street investment bank ( page 427). He was extremely ideologically opposed to the domestic and foreign policies of Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. At the same time, he is extremely sensitive and has a pathological ego. A scene in the movie is that at his 54th birthday party, he wanted to introduce his son and daughter-in-law to the &quot;celebrity&quot; Oppenheimer, but because that day President Truman denied the objections of Oppenheimer and other scientist advisors. Oppenheimer was in a very bad mood over the hydrogen bomb suggestion and was very rude to Strauss&#39;s son and daughter-in-law. This was one of the reasons why Strauss held a grudge against Oppenheimer. But Strauss was cunning and knew that Oppenheimer, as the &quot;Father of the Atomic Bomb&quot; on the cover of Time magazine, would not be easily brought down completely. Therefore, he only held a meeting within the Atomic Energy Commission to discuss whether to revoke Oppenheimer&#39;s safety. Internal hearings on the permit, without letting Senator McCarthy intervene, because he believed that the extremely hysterical McCarthy might mess things up. Strauss finally got his wish, and the hearing revoked Oppenheimer&#39;s security clearance, but still said he had no doubts about Oppenheimer&#39;s loyalty to the country. Oppenheimer was able to retain his position as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, but he was completely eliminated from U.S. technology and defense policymaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Einstein appears at the beginning and end of the movie. Einstein is quoted in the biography: &quot;Oppenheimer&#39;s problem was that he fell in love with a woman who didn&#39;t love him - the U.S. government... The problem was actually very simple. Oppenheimer only had to go to Washington and tell Officials, they&#39;re all fools, then go home” (p. 596). Einstein also suggested that Oppenheimer leave the United States to conduct research in Europe, but Oppenheimer&#39;s response was: &quot;Hell, I love this country deeply.&quot; This is Oppenheimer&#39;s tragedy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 11:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[池田大作 “真正的成功的人生是什么呢？”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260976]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/20/LzbyXRcNYzMvh1Rfw8pMR2QZejt5jYRjMxY1i7mh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;865&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/LzbyXRcNYzMvh1Rfw8pMR2QZejt 5jYRjMxY1i7mh. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258930&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On April 24, 1979 local time, Daisaku Ikeda held a press conference in Tokyo, Japan , announced his resignation as president of the Soka Gakkai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1996, a &quot;nuclear weapon threat exhibition&quot; was held in San Jose, the capital of the Republic of Costa Rica in South America. hold. At the opening ceremony, just as the participants solemnly sang the national anthem in unison, suddenly, a series of children&#39;s voices came from the &quot;Children&#39;s Museum&quot; across the wall. That was the laughter of primary school students who were impatiently waiting for the opening of the exhibition. The bursts of laughter disrupted the guests&#39; speeches many times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The lively and energetic laughter of children is a symbol and embodiment of peace. These laughters are filled with the power of hope to fight against the &#39;nuclear threat&#39;.&quot; Daisaku Ikeda at the opening ceremony Listening to the children&#39;s voices, I smiled and said, &quot;This is the indicator of a sound society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daisaku Ikeda is the third president of the Soka Gakkai of Japan. He expanded the scope of the Soka Gakkai. scale and developed it into the largest religious organization in Japan. He also actively participated in politics and founded the Komeito Party in 1964. To this day, Soka Gakkai remains the main supporter of Komeito. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daisaku Ikeda’s greatest contribution was to promote the secularization of Nichiren Buddhism. For Ikeda, Nichiren Buddhism is a philosophy of life that actively integrates into the modern world and society and actively faces all challenges in it. Ikeda devoted his life to promoting culture, education, and peace, and won the United Nations Peace Prize in 1983. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, he proposed the initiative to normalize diplomatic relations between China and Japan in the 1960s. He was received by Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, and was awarded the title of &quot;Peace Envoy&quot; for Sino-Japanese friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aversion to war, the desire for peace, and the exploration of the dignity of life ran through Ikeda’s life until the end of his life. The Soka Gakkai of Japan announced on November 18, 2023 that Daisaku Ikeda, honorary president of the Soka Gakkai and founder of the Komeito Party, passed away on November 15, 2023, at the age of 95. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Dialogue is the foundation of peace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On January 26, 1975, a special rally was held in Guam. This was one of the bloodiest battlefields of World War II. Soka Gakkai members from 50 countries and regions around the world gathered here and established the International Soka Gakkai International, headed by President Daisei Ikeda. The place was chosen as the venue for the meeting as a symbol of the new peace movement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I was born in 1928, which was a war-torn era. In my young mind, I had already deeply realized that nothing is more tragic and nothing is more cruel than war, so I I made up my mind to never let such inhumane tragedies continue to happen in the future.&quot; In 2020, in an interview with Global magazine, Daisaku Ikeda recalled the origins of his desire for peace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1928, Daisaku Ikeda was born in Tokyo. His family made a living from seaweed farming. There are eight children in the family, and Ikeda ranks fifth. The era when Ikeda grew up was a period when Japan was moving towards war under the leadership of the military government. Japan was plunged into the abyss of world war, and all walks of life in the country - from families, factories, schools to religious groups, were forced to serve in the war effort. All opposition voices were brutally suppressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China. Ikeda&#39;s eldest brother Kiichi was drafted into the army, followed by his three brothers. Ikeda often mentioned Kiichi in his conversations and writings. He said that when Kiichi came home on a vacation, he described to him the brutal behavior of the Japanese army in China, and his tone was full of disgust. He also mentioned that after the war, the whole family was looking forward to Kiichi&#39;s return, but in the end they waited for the news that he had died on the battlefield. The scene of his mother silently accepting Xiyi&#39;s white urn was something he would never forget in his life. &quot;Aside from anger... I deeply understand how cruel, ignorant and meaningless war is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a boy, Ikeda&#39;s home was destroyed twice in air raids. He also personally experienced the Tokyo bombing on March 9-10, 1945, in which more than 100,000 people were killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of World War II, Ikeda was 17 years old. He described: &quot;The young people at that time were left with an indelible spiritual void. It was not just the country that was burned. The hypocrisy of the fanatical militaristic values ​​that had been instilled since before the war was exposed after the war. There was nothing left, so it immediately fell apart.&amp;nbsp;Many young people fell into the despair of &quot;not believing in anything&quot; because of this. This seems to be an inevitable conclusion.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such despair also occurs in Regarding Ikeda, he wrote, &quot;For those who once glorified war and sacrificed many young people on the battlefield, but after the war they transformed into intellectuals pursuing peace and democracy. No matter how they dressed themselves, I absolutely cannot believe the rhetoric of these powerful people.&amp;nbsp;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the turbulent international situation of the last century, Ikeda has always played the role of a messenger of peace. He firmly advocated: dialogue is peace fundamental. Since 1970, he has been engaged in dialogue activities with representatives from all over the world in the humanities, politics, traditional beliefs, culture, education and academia. He seeks consensus from dialogue and finds solutions to the complex problems facing humanity. More than 70 of these conversations have been published in books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During his lifetime, Ikeda co-authored &quot;Looking into the Twenty-first Century&quot; with the British historian Toynbee, co-authored &quot;Spiritual Lessons of the Twentieth Century&quot; with the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, and co-authored with Jin Yong Author of &quot;In Search of a Glorious Century&quot;. Since November 16, 1995, Ikeda and Jin Yong have met many times in Hong Kong, China and Japan, during which they even exchanged letters and never stopped communicating. Jin Yong once said: &quot;The conversations are impromptu, sometimes at the dinner table, sometimes during tea talks, sometimes while admiring the beauty of the landscape and the garden.&quot; They focused on many issues such as the return of Hong Kong, Buddhist philosophy, literature, etc. There was a serious discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1993, shortly after the end of the Cold War, a research institution was established on the east coast of the United States adjacent to Harvard University. Originally named &quot;Boston 21st Century Research Center&quot;, it was renamed &quot;Ikeda Center for Peace, Education, and Dialogue&quot; in 2009. The center invites expertise and scholars in various fields in the world to hold various seminars to explore the topics of peace, human rights, environment, education, culture and other topics, thereby expanding the network of peace and humanitarianism. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Promote China -Japan Friendship with the body of a grassic man. On the other hand, Ikeda made a speech that was considered &quot;bold&quot;. He called on the normalization of Japan -China diplomatic relations and proposed a specific step to achieve this goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, many Japanese regarded China as an enemy country, and China&#39;s status in the international community was relatively isolated. Ikeda&#39;s proposal attracted in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the same time, this suggestion also attracted the attention of some people in China and Japan who cared about the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Among them, Zhou Enlai. In addition, at that time, Matsuki Matsuda Matsuya Matsuda Matsushima, a member of the House of Representatives, who supported the restoration of normal relations between the two countries at that time, also contacted him after a speech at Ichian, urging him to visit China. However, Ikeda believes that the matter should be started by politicians, so it is recommended that the Gongming Party members organized a group to visit China. Sino -Japanese relations began to improve, and the two countries finally resumed diplomatic relations in 1972. In May 1974, Ikeda led the group to visit China, and for decades, he repeatedly led a group to visit China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In December 1974, when he visited China for the second time, Ikeda and his party received the reception of Deng Xiaoping, the then deputy prime minister of the State Council. Zhou Enlai, who was hospitalized for illness, also met all members of the China Group for the second visit to the China Group in Beijing regardless of the objections of the medical team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many years later, Ikeda&#39;s masterpiece still remembered at the time of the reception. &quot;Premier Zhou told me in the 21st century that the last 25 years of the 20th century were the most important period for the world. The world must stand on an equal stand and respect each other, mutual benefit and mutual benefit. Premier Zhou also clearly said with a bold voice, &quot;I hope to conclude the&quot; China -Japan Peace Friendship Treaty &quot;as soon as possible. &#39;&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The following year after the talks with Premier Zhou, in 1975, because there was no university in Japan at that time, Ikeda personally made a guarantor, so that the first six public -funded international students in New China were successfully went to the founding university founded by him to study. Price University is the earliest school in Japan to accept Chinese public students, and has successively accepted public expenses from China and self -funded international students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, the world was in a tense period when the super power confrontation, and nuclear weapons seriously threatened human survival. Ikeda said that he hopes to use the body of a grass to ease the tension at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda visited China, the Soviet Union and the United States in 1974 and 1975. It was interviewed by Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Soviet Prime Minister Koshin, and US Secretary of State Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He described the situation at the time: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;From 1974 to 1975, I visited China, the Soviet Union and the United States one after another, and directly talked to the heads of the country, and explored from the people of the people. The way to ease the tension situation. In addition to the opposition of the United States and the Soviet Union at that time, the Sino -Soviet is also in a state of tension, causing the world to face a crisis of a triglyization. &quot;&amp; Nbsp; &lt;br>; &lt;br>;&quot; , Visit the large -scale air defense hole built by Beijing citizens, known as the &#39;underground Great Wall&#39;, and felt the threat of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people. In September of the same year, I visited the Soviet Union for the first time. Ask him whether the Soviet Union had the intention of attacking China. Prime Minister Koskin asserted that the Soviet Union did not mean to attack and isolate China. &quot;&lt;br>; &lt;br>;&quot; In December of the same year, I took this information to visit China again. I visited China this time. During this time, I was fortunate to meet Premier Zhou Enlai. During the talks, we jointly confirmed the importance of working together to work together for world peace and prosperity. &quot; If you do n’t do a superpowers. Combined with the content of my previous conversation with Premier Koskin, I am convinced that the days of the reconciliation of China and the Soviet Union will not be too far. In fact, history also proves that my prediction is right. &quot;&amp; Nbsp; &lt;br >; &lt;br>; &quot;In January 1975, I visited the United States and visited the Secretary of State Kissinger in Washington, where Xiaoxue flew. During the talks, I told him that Premier Zhou eagerly hoped to conclude a friendly treaty in Japan as soon as possible. Agree. &quot;&amp; Nbsp; &lt;br>; &lt;br>;&quot; On the same day, I met Prime Minister Daping Zhengfang in Washington (the Minister of Tibetan). Explanation is fully agreed, and it will definitely work hard to achieve it. In August 1978, three years later, the &quot;China -Japan Peace Friendship Treaty&quot; was finally officially concluded. &quot; >; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In mid -August 1947, the defeated Japan is under the control of the allies. At night people can only see dim lights flickering in temporary shacks or bomb shelters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Ikeda&#39;s masterpiece later, at the time of the waste, the entire Japanese society is eager to change, and every street corner can hear the voices of democracy, and the faith of a generation collapsed. At this time, young people are eager to read the classics to enrich the spiritual world and build confidence. People started exchanging books and forming reading groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 19 -year -old Ikeda Make -ups met the instructor of life and the second chairman of the Price Association Tomoda Sheng. It was a Buddhist exchange meeting, and Toda City Sheng left a deep impression on Ikeda: hoarse and warm voice and stable behavior. The content of the speech is not like other religious leaders. It is very grounded, as if the highest truth exists in daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tomoda was rebuilding the Society of Prices at the time, which was the organization established with Mukou Chang Sanlang, who was also an educator in 1930. During World War II, Toda was arrested and jailed with Mukou. The Japanese military government forced its people to accept state Shinto ideology as a means of sanctifying its war of aggression. Under the oppression, the two still adhered to their religious beliefs and died in prison. The Society of Innovation was disintegrated by the military government during the war. Tomoda is convinced that placing the focus on the unlimited potential of everyone is the key to changing Japanese society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda and Tomoda met late, and since then, forgotten the year. Ikeda was deeply interested in literature since childhood and began writing poetry as a teenager. When he could not continue his studies based on various reasons, Tomoda from a scholars taught him himself. Ikeda quickly accepted the doctrine of the Price Creation Association and joined after 10 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Like Tomoda, Ikeda holds unswerving confidence in the Lotus Dharma, thinking that it emphasizes that everyone is pregnant with Buddhism and has unlimited potential ideas, but it can revitalize a decadent Japanese society after the war . The key is a &quot;human change&quot; process that began in the heart. In the process, when a person decides to take action for his life and happiness, the surrounding environment and community will change to good aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the company operated by Tomoda was on the verge of closure, Ikeda worked hard to manage the business. Due to the unable to receive a salary, the employees left Toda&#39;s company. Ikeda insisted that he did not go, and went around to negotiate with the company&#39;s creditors. &quot;For half a year, I have not received salary, leather shoes are dressed, and there is no formal clothing, and my body is weak. Nevertheless, I think that as long as I can guard Mr. Tomoda, it doesn&#39;t matter if you are suffering from the hungry ghosts and hell circles. Determine never regret it. &quot;Ikeda recalled this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In such a difficult period, Toda revealed to Ikeda the idea of ​​running a school -the education of a series of education from elementary school to university, and the educational education concept of His teacher Mukou Chang Sanlang School. At that time, such ideas seemed unrealistic, but Ikeda in his twenties in his twenties kept his words in mind. Twenty years later, Ikeda made the ideal of Tomoda into reality and founded the price -based education institution from kindergarten to universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1960, two years after the death of Tomoda, the 32 -year -old Ikeda was appointed as the third chairman of the Society of Price Institute. Fifteen years later, Ikeda made the International Society of International Prices. Today, the International Society of Innovation Price is an international organization consisting of 12 million members of more than 190 countries and regions. Ikeda wrote: &quot;Everything depends on people. Therefore, we must resolutely and thoroughly expand the good people&#39;s alliance.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; There are media evaluations, and Ikeda has led a &quot;Buddhist secular Buddhism worldwide &quot;Exercise&quot; establishes a complete education system based on religion and its values ​​to stimulate personal potential, to teach the importance of peace and contribution to society. The system runs from kindergarten to graduate school, with institutions including universities in Tokyo and California, USA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda has repeatedly stated that the relationship between the master and apprentice of Tomoda has affected his life. Unlike other religion highlights the importance of life suffering, Ikeda emphasizes a positive and optimistic side. He often says that by helping others gain happiness, he will also get happiness. For Ikeda, happiness is &quot;loyal to himself&quot;. He believes that only in this way can happiness be increased in infinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; The fundamental dignity of life &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;A great human change will be able to transform the destiny of a country or even all mankind.&quot; Ikeda took this sentence Write in the preface of the novel &quot;The Revolution of the World&quot;, this novel is the masterpiece of Ikeda, describing the history and ideals of the Prices Society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the decades of the development of prices, Ikeda&#39;s work is not easy. His wife Xiangfengzi recalled that whenever Ikeda returned home for a day, he was often exhausted, and he could hardly get off his shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda was invited to give a speech at the University of California Los Angeles College in 1974. The following year, he gave a speech at the University of Moscow with a &quot;new road to east -west cultural exchange&quot; and accepted a honorary doctorate awarded by the university. When the world was in the Cold War, Ikeda did not choose to stand in the political confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda values ​​the fundamental dignity of life and regards this as the key to peaceful peace and human happiness. He believes that to achieve world peace, it will eventually look at the inner change of everyone, not the reform of social and organizational structure alone. He is convinced that this seemingly long road is the only way to build a long -lasting peace culture. The philosophical thoughts held by the Incident Society can be attributed to the term &quot;human revolution&quot;. According to the meaning of this concept, a spontaneous change will have a positive impact on the environment outside the body and promote the growth of human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, academic institutions from all over the world have awarded the honorary doctoral degree and honorary professor of Honorary Professor, which have more than 300. His peaceful works are currently selected as university textbooks in Argentina and the United States, and more than 20 research institutes are committed to studying their philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ikeda founded a series of &lt;Span>; &lt;Span>; Increasing Education Institute &lt;/span>; &lt;/span>; from kindergarten to university. These schools are non -religious schools. The purpose of educational is: depending on the existence of each student, they are committed to discovering their potential for creating value, and instilling the concepts of peace, contributing society and global citizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of Ikeda, children&#39;s life is a mirror of society: adults If adults advocate panic and decadent life outlook on teenagers, it is equivalent to the tender buds of hope for the future of hope.

On November 15, 2023, the two sets were jointly issued by 13 departments including the National Health and Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Southern Weekend reporters compared the scheme released in 2019 and found that the new version of the plan has been further improved in the main goals. In the cancer prevention plan, the 5 -year survival rate of overall cancer increased by nearly 3 percentage points from the 2019 plan; the mortality rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was required to fall to 20.97/100,000 in 2022. In terms of prevention and control, it also emphasizes the movement forward and the integration of medical and defense, focusing on the whole process of health, and realizing people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;We all know that prevention is the most economical and effective health strategy. Both solutions adhere to prevention, strengthen the risk factors of chronic diseases The prevention of chronic diseases and high -risk crowds to the entire process management of early diagnosis, standardized treatment, and integration of rehabilitation services, &quot;said Guo Yanhong, director of the Medical Emergency Department of the National Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Expand the coverage of cancer screening and improve the HPV vaccine can be available. A major feature. As of 2022, the premature diagnosis rate of key cancer species in high incidence in China has reached more than 55%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Cancer screening mainly uses &quot;risk layering&quot;, organizing organizational screening for high-incidence areas and high-risk groups. Opportunity screening and standardized anti -cancer medical examinations, expanding the scope of screening. Zhang Yong, secretary of the National Cancer Center, suggested that residents with higher risk of cancer, such as family history with cancer, long -term smoking and drinking, patients with occupational exposure or patients with hepatitis B and pre -cancer diseases should be screened regularly for cancer. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Compared with the previous version of the scheme, the new version of the cancer prevention plan also mentioned that promoting conditions in regions with conditions include HPV vaccination into the local benefit of the people. The domestic HPV vaccine has accelerated the review and approval, improved the availability of the HPV vaccine, and various channels to ensure the vaccination of people with age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The &quot;Regional Exploration and Improvement Strategy of HPV Vaccine Promotion Policy&quot; issued by Kunshan Duke University Vaccine Delivery Research and Innovation Laboratory mentioned that if it can be vaccinated Further optimization in strategy can further enhance the policy influence of public health. For example, many places are suitable for girls with students or households, but for the lack of protection for migrants, or girls who drop out of school from middle school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The founding director of the Kunshan Duke University Global Health Research Center, and the person in charge of the research innovation laboratory of vaccine delivery, Tang Shenglan told reporters in the southern weekend that it is necessary to ensure that poor areas or poor people The only effective way to vaccinate the HPV vaccine of the age of the age is to include HPV vaccine into the national immunization planning, that is, it becomes a type of vaccine for free. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At present, there have been Guangdong, Hainan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Tibet, and Chongqing.

The impact of the lifestyle transformation. For example, in terms of diet, fresh fruits, vegetables, and milk in the diet of Chinese residents have indeed increased significantly, but the proportion of whole grains and beans continues to decline, while fat intake and energy supply have continued to rise. &quot;In short, it is less and less coarse grains, and more and more oils are eaten.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It is necessary to vigorously advocate a healthy lifestyle and promote the scientific movement; promote the construction of the food nutrition standard system, and strengthen the guiding role of food nutrition labels. In addition, we must actively promote the construction of smoke -free environment and continue to promote smoke control measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In medicine, time is the heart and time are the brain. This is because cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are chronic diseases of acute seizures. It&#39;s closely related to time. Therefore, strengthening the first movement and improvement of the emergency system is also one of the focus of the new version of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prevention plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In July 2022, the National Health and Health Commission issued a document to require county-level hospitals to accelerate the construction of the &quot;five emergency first aid centers&quot;, including chest pain centers and stroke centers. The new version of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease prevention plan mentioned that in 2030, the stroke centers of hospitals above the second level or above carried out venous thrombolytic technology. Places with conditions to effectively improve the efficiency of treatment by establishing chest pain and stroke &quot;first aid maps&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; At the public level, strengthen the equipment equipment such as automatic body tremor (AED) in public places, and strengthen inspection of the equipment to ensure the emergency time Can be available. &quot;We are pushing the international &#39;befast&#39;, that is, it is difficult to balance, unclear, unexplained, difficulty in arms, and not spiritual. First aid call, call 120 to the hospital. &quot;Wang Yongjun, Dean of Beijing Tiantan Hospital affiliated to the Capital Medical University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The new version of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease prevention and control scheme also requires that the scope of the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the community, explore the second-level prevention and second-level prevention and stroke patients of coronary heart disease and stroke. Rehabilitation therapy is included in the scope of family doctors&#39; contract services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The pathogenic foundation of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is atherosclerosis, which is very important for the same prevention and same treatment, early diagnosis and early treatment. Wang Yongjun also called for the establishment of vascular health management centers at the grassroots level, controlled high -risk groups of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases together, and established a diagnosis and treatment center for cardiovascular and brain diseases in large medical institutions. In the case of illness, the patient can see different experts at one time to solve the problem of common patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江苏无锡一纺织厂起火致7人死亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260982]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-21 07:55:40 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;pan>; According to the official micro-information of the Emergency Administration of Huishan District, Wuxi City, on November 20, 2023 At 30 minutes, a fire broke out in Diantian Run Textile Technology Co., Ltd., Qianzhou Street.

But it is not limited to cleaning, statistical data, and participating in the meeting (non -teaching). Of course, the most &quot;preparation&quot; and &quot;welcome&quot; various reviews and inspections. From the perspective of classification, these &quot;tasks&quot; are as thin as cattle. From the perspective of jurisdiction level, there are both provinces, cities, districts, and even streets. From the perspective of the jurisdiction, the educational authorities are both the competent educational department. There are other management departments, and there are even departments that &quot;can&#39;t hit one pole&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If you carefully observe these &quot;tasks&quot; that are as thin and thin, it is not difficult to find an interesting phenomen The longitudinal volume of the vertical curls is the pressure of &quot;layer layer&quot;, that is, the subordinates always automatically tend to &quot;get intensified&quot; to complete the &quot;task&quot;, and the closer to the management level, the more serious this &quot;transformation&quot; is. The horizontal volume is manifested in the competitive pressure of comparison. For example, if the department A organizes an inspection of a unit, the B will soon organize the inspection of a unit. Formism is like a infectious disease that completed in horizontal completion in the horizontal direction. After convergence, it was synchronized vertically, and the pressure was finally transmitted to the grassroots level. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The &quot;meaning&quot; of formalism &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Formatism refers to the phenomenon that managers pay too much attention to form and procedures in the process of administrative management In the interesting phenomenon of &quot;formalism automatically tends to be internal&quot;, it actually contains the problems of the &quot;administrative rights&quot; of the superiors and the &quot;false busyness&quot; of the lower level to the superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called &quot;administrative right&quot; refers The literaryism that requires &quot;ledger and leave marks everywhere&quot; requires that in simple procedures, the level of power is set up for all relevant departments, and the &quot;proceduralism&quot; that eventually make it tedious. In addition Various tricks such as pots. The most typical is the endless repeated &quot;inspection&quot; and &quot;review&quot;, which makes the process of the superiors the normal exercise of supervision of supervision of the subordinates into a obedience test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this case, the authority of the superior needs to be confirmed through this &quot;obedience test&quot; again and again, and the lower level can only choose the unconditional service to pass the &quot;test&quot;. The volume, because &quot;not as good&quot; in form means &quot;not as good&quot; in authority, which is unacceptable to the management department, so naturally, the departments mentioned in the previous article have compared with each other in form, competing with each other, competing with each other. &quot;Horizontal inner roll&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;Pseudo -busy&quot; is a response to &quot;formal rights&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the process of &quot;formal right&quot; through subordinates through subordinate tests, the grassroots are on the surface. The unconditional object in this obedience test is an unquestionable victim. But if you look closely at the grassroots reaction, you will find that they are not completely passive. &quot;Puppet busy&quot; is a negative response to &quot;formal rights&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The so -called pseudo -busyness refers to the excessive busyness that does not match the workload in the grassroots work, or simply pretending to be busy, but in fact, it has not achieved substantial progress or results. This kind of false busyness does not effectively promote work or bring substantial work results, because it is not a busy state that is based on endogenous performance, but is passive in the influence of the external environment. It emphasizes not the implementation and completion of the work itself, but to emphasize the working status of the worker, and tends to deliberately create and show a busy working state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, &quot;pseudo -busy&quot; is also divided into two types. One is the active pseudo -busy busy busyness of &quot;nothing to do&quot;, and the other is the &quot;&quot; Passive and busy. &quot; The purpose of the former is to reduce the frequency and scale of this &quot;obedience test&quot; through camouflage. The purpose of the latter is to pass this obedience test by high performance &quot;obedience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have mentioned earlier that &quot;formal rights&quot; are essentially a kind of obedience test. The superiors confirmed their absolute dominance to the lower level through some forms of no practical significance. The only reason for this is just to prove that they have the right to do so, and this meaningless behavior is usually named by the tissue and execution of the tissue and execution. And no matter what kind of test, the final performance is busy with the order of the subordinates as a superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After mastering this &quot;mysterious&quot;, it is naturally inclined to use &quot;pseudo -busy&quot; to pass the obedience test of the superior. If the degree of &quot;pseudo -busy&quot; is not as good as others, it means that obedience is not as good as anyone. This will inevitably trigger some inner volume of &quot;busy&quot;, that is, &quot;you are busy, I&#39;m busy than you&quot;. In the entire administrative agency&#39;s power level, the more you face the upward level of the grassroots level, the more departments you face, so the grassroots must be the worst place in the &quot;false busy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The primary and secondary schools mentioned at the beginning of this article, as education institutions, have many management levels, many management departments are not strange to be involved in &quot;extreme&quot;. And the reason for their &quot;volume&quot; is similar, that is, they are all at the lowest downstream of power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As mentioned earlier, whether it is &quot;formal rights&quot; or &quot;pseudo -busy&quot;, no matter how serious and meticulous his performance, it is impossible Bringing the corresponding governance effectiveness will become an important negative phenomenon in grass -roots governance, affect the output of governance efficiency, increase the burden of grassroots staff, trigger a sense of inefficiency, work burnout, and even more serious psychological problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (&quot;>; ( This article is only the personal point of view of the author, does not represent the position of our newspaper) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大学上课“务必前排就坐”，你同意吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260968]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the phenomenon of &quot;students not sitting in the front row&quot; inspected by colleges and universities in many places has triggered heated discussions on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 12, the official website of Changchun University stated that students should be educated and guided to &quot;must sit in the front row.&quot; Those who are absent from class or violate classroom disciplines and refuse to change will be punished in accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Changchun University Student Disciplinary Punishment Regulations&quot; Disciplinary Actions.

The so-called selling an official position to win a title has been around since ancient times, and history is endless. But what we are talking about here is not the behind-the-scenes operation in the house of cards, but the aboveboard state behavior. Starting from the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, the government sometimes publicly sold official qualifications to solve financial difficulties. In the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Jingtai, who ascended the throne because his brother Yingzong was captured by the Mongols during the Civil War, put the qualifications of students from the Guozijian, the country&#39;s highest institution (historically known as &quot;Jiansheng&quot;) on the market for the first time, starting an epoch-making revolution. great changes. Because as long as the supervisory students pass a certain period of probation and do not receive negative reviews, they can obtain official qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Ming Dynasty&#39;s move was far ahead of the previous generation, it was nothing compared to the Qing Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty only allowed donations from prison students and did not dare to directly sell formal official positions. In the Qing Dynasty, for donations, Beijing officials could donate to doctors of the fifth rank, while foreign officials could only donate to Taoist priests of the fourth rank. The so-called heyday of Kangxi and Qianlong, that is, the two dynasties of Kangxi and Qianlong, were precisely the critical periods for the development of donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donations in the Qing Dynasty were divided into two types: &quot;current regulations&quot; and &quot;temporary regulations&quot;. The so-called &quot;current routine&quot; refers to the donations that are offered all year round, mainly to donations to supervising students. During the Qianlong period, the annual income from this was about 3 million taels, which was close to one-tenth of the agricultural tax, which was the main part of the fiscal revenue. The &quot;temporary cases&quot; are used to raise specific funds caused by major events such as military expenses, Yellow River management project expenses, disaster relief funds, etc. Temporary donations mainly sell actual official positions, so they are also called &quot;real official donations.&quot; Legally speaking, those who are eligible to report temporary donations are limited to current officials and supervisory students who already have official qualifications, and ordinary people are excluded. But in fact, if ordinary people want to buy an official position, they can first donate a prison student according to the current regulations, thus perfectly avoiding the restrictions. The income from temporary cases can reach tens of millions of taels at a time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qing government’s donation information is open and transparent, prices are clearly marked, first come, first served, no one is deceived. There is no age limit for those who wish to donate. Newborn babies can also be donated to supervising children, or on this basis, they can donate to official positions. Because there are far more people qualified to hold official positions than there are bureaucratic positions, it is not possible to get an official position right away. You have to submit relevant documents from the Ministry of Personnel and wait in line to &quot;get on the train&quot; according to order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that they have paid for it, everyone hopes to become a Shangguan as soon as possible and get back their capital and profits as soon as possible. This brought additional business opportunities to the Qing government. Donors could add &quot;tricks&quot; to their donation, that is, priority in appointments, which was equivalent to walking in the VIP channel when queuing. There are many types of products, such as &quot;first use&quot;, &quot;use in case of shortage&quot;, &quot;first use first&quot;, etc., which can be chosen by customers with different needs, all with clearly marked prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This transaction of the Qing government has undergone some interesting changes as time has passed. On the one hand, official positions are constantly on sale. For example, in the 39th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1774), the price of a Taoist was 16,400 taels. In the second year of Xianfeng&#39;s reign (1852), it was reduced to 9,446.4 taels, almost cut in half. By the 27th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1901), it only cost 4,732.1 taels, which was more than 30% off. Low. This is because more and more people are queuing up and the backlog is getting worse. For example, in the 19th year of Jiaqing (1814), in order to raise the cost of regulating the eastern Henan section of the Yellow River, the imperial court launched the &quot;Eastern Henan Case&quot;. However, the &quot;Sichuan-Chu Case&quot; 16 years ago, the &quot;Work Relief Case&quot; 13 years ago, and the &quot;Work Relief Case&quot; 11 years ago The &quot;work balance case&quot; before, the &quot;donation case&quot; 8 years ago, and the &quot;earth excavation case&quot; 6 years ago are all still not digested by people who buy government offices. In this case, waiting in line means that the time it takes for the investment to pay off is getting longer and longer. In order to attract new customers, in addition to lowering prices, the imperial court also invented the method of &quot;suppressing the old with the new&quot; (three new and one old, four new and one old, or even five new and one old). For the government, the temporary cases that have ended have already put money firmly into their pockets. Of course, they cannot turn their backs and abandon the consumers who paid for them and are still queuing up. However, in order to recruit new people, the interests of old customers are expendable. Therefore, in the 19th year of Jiaqing, the imperial court announced the implementation of &quot;four new and one old&quot;, that is, for every five vacant official positions reserved for donors, the first four were designated for the East Henan Province, and the fifth was assigned to many previous Persons left unresolved by the case. In these cases, priority is given not to the buyers of the earliest &quot;Chuanchu cases&quot; who paid, but to the consumers of the latest &quot;Tufang cases&quot;. The fifth vacancy, which was the first official position reserved for the old case, was assigned to the top remaining donor in the &quot;Earthwork Case&quot;. As for the &quot;Chuan Chu Case&quot; 16 years ago, the person who finally made it to the top of the team had to wait until the 45th position to take his turn. Until the first year of Xianfeng (1851), more than fifty years had passed since the opening of &quot;Chuanchu Case&quot;, and there were still customers queuing up. It is unknown how many people who were excited because of the opportunity to spend money to buy an official position passed away in the long years without waiting for their dreams to come true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, as a VIP channel, the price of tricks is always strong. For example, in the &quot;Zhenggong Case&quot; in the 13th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1887), the magistrate&#39;s price was only 1,998 taels, which was half the price during the Qianlong period. However, the magistrate&#39;s &quot;Before the Deficiency&quot; trick required 3,808.8 taels, which was almost double the qualifications for the magistrate&#39;s appointment. . But the same goes for old tricks. For example, if the &quot;first in case of shortage&quot; purchased by &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; is still in the queue when the &quot;East Yun Case&quot; is implemented, its effectiveness will be greatly faded compared to the &quot;first in case of shortage&quot; in &quot;East Yu Case&quot;. In order to do everything possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of consumers and extract money from the hands of the people, the imperial court creatively designed an incentive mechanism of &quot;adding more money to pay for work&quot;. Assume that the magistrate of &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; &quot;in case of shortage&quot; sells for 5,000 taels, and the magistrate of &quot;Eastern Yudong Case&quot; needs &quot;in case of shortage&quot; for 7,000 taels. The person who originally bought the &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; in the county of &quot;in case of shortage&quot; can According to the standard of adding 30 taels for every one hundred taels, and paying an additional 2,100 taels as over-shift fee, you can be transferred to the &quot;first in line&quot; VIP channel of the magistrate of &quot;Eastern Yudong Case&quot; to queue up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, donors who have not bought anything actually have no hope of being ranked. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, &quot;pressing the old with the new&quot; also changed from sorting by new and old examples to sorting by new and old patterns. Moreover, the imperial court considered that no matter whether they bought an official position or passed the imperial examination in ten years, it was everyone&#39;s wish to become an official as soon as possible. Those who qualified for official positions through the imperial examination could also open a special channel as long as they were willing to spend money to buy tricks. In the late Guangxu Dynasty, the &quot;Selection of Wheels&quot;, which records the waiting list for county magistrates, contains more than 20 tricks, among which there are &quot;donating and accepting Jinshi first&quot; - a trick specially prepared for Jinshi to &quot;jump in line&quot;, and &quot;donating and accepting filial piety&quot;. &quot;Fangzhengxian&quot; - Xiaolian Fangzheng refers to a person who is qualified to serve as an official because of his outstanding conduct and special recommendation. If such a person does not spend money to buy tricks, no matter how he practices filial piety, no matter how upright his character is, I am afraid he will not be accepted. It&#39;s time to take the wheel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to raise funds, there were still many links in the appointment process of officials in the Qing Dynasty that could be solved with money. At least since the Han Dynasty, people who have just entered the ranks of the bureaucracy may need a period of time as a transitional internship period. After the probation period is completed, they can be officially appointed. In the Qing Dynasty, an internship period ranging from one to three years was generally required before becoming an official for the first time. If you have money, you can donate to get a free trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When appointing officials in previous dynasties, there were regulations to avoid the place of origin and relatives&#39; official appointments, and the same was true in the Qing Dynasty. However, in the Qing Dynasty, donations could also be waived for avoidance. Even if you designate the province where you want to be an official, or if you are not satisfied with the province where you are appointed as an official and want to change it to another province, you can do it through donations (the former is called a province, and the latter is called changing a province). In the Qing Dynasty, some official positions were under the control of local governors. Candidates could only be appointed within the province. They could also donate a sum of money to leave the province and then donate to another province to switch to another province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Officials appointed by the Ministry of Personnel, ranging from Taoist officials to Qipin Zhizhiguan magistrates (Taoist officials and above are appointed by the emperor), must appear before the emperor and be reviewed by the emperor himself (called an introduction, in fact Often just a formality) before being allowed to take office. As for junior officials such as junior deputies, who were not even close to sesame seeds, the emperor really did not have the time and energy to deal with them, so he commissioned the princes and ministers to check the appearance of each person (called inspection). The purpose of this was to show that the Qing monarch was &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;all employing people, listening to words, and having great power without any excuse.&quot; But as long as you pay for it, introductions and inspections can be dispensed with - even if it&#39;s just for money, you don&#39;t need authority! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to prevent donors from digging too much into the Qing Dynasty, it was originally stipulated that donors with backgrounds should not be recommended by local governors or central ministerial officials (that is, recommended, and the recommender is jointly and severally liable). He cannot serve as a capital official or local official (top leader). In the Qing Dynasty, they even risked their lives for money, and recommendations can also be donated! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for those who are entering the official service for the first time, officials who have resigned due to illness and want to return to their original posts after recovering from illness will have to spend a sum of money to replace them immediately, otherwise they will have to wait in line. If you want to change a position, you have to make two investments, first donate to fill the original position, and then donate to replace the position. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most amazing example is probably the &quot;temporary supervisor&quot;: &quot;Some people want to take the examination, but they are not qualified. By donating one supervisor, you can take the provincial examination, but if the supervisor can make a temporary donation in cash , it also requires dozens of taels of silver, and I am not sure whether it will be successful or not. I am a little reluctant to spend dozens of taels of silver in vain. Moreover, if all the procedures for this kind of donation to supervise students are completed, it will be possible. It took quite a while. So this temporary method was devised. First, a dozen or so taels of silver were handed over to the Imperial College, and the prison would issue a temporary supervisory license (commonly known as a supervisory license). With this license, you can Apply for the Provincial Examination in the Ministry of Rites. If you win the exam in the future, you will have to pay the full fee, and the prison will receive the official license. If you fail to pass, it will be considered as a matter of course, and you will make a cash donation until the next Provincial Examination.&quot; (Qi Rushan&#39;s &quot; Chinese family name&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/E9nBwpbi0PRujzZ6WJFwmdGjvoyB5H6l0WZ2LcK3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/E9nBwpbi0PRujzZ6WJFwmdGjvoyB5H6l0WZ2LcK3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258824&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Receipt stub from a donation to a prison student in the 17th year of Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1837). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donations are not only allowed in many aspects of examination qualifications, official qualifications and official appointment, but also after becoming an official Rewards and punishments are due based on performance - if you do well, you can be promoted, if you do poorly, you will be punished - or you can pay for it. In order to open up financial avenues, starting from the Kangxi Dynasty, not only current officials could donate money to be promoted, but also those waiting in line at the Ministry of Civil Service for appointment could donate money in advance. For example, in the Yimao donation in the 14th year of Kangxi&#39;s reign (1675), a candidate for the county magistrate (deputy of the county magistrate) could pay 300 taels for &quot;first use&quot;, or he could spend 1,000 taels to donate to the county magistrate&#39;s official qualifications. If he was willing to pay an additional 500 taels You can directly enter the &quot;first use&quot; VIP channel of the county magistrate. This system is unique to the Qing Dynasty. After current officials spend money to buy promotion qualifications, they can theoretically queue up at the Ministry of Civil Affairs only after their current term of office expires. Considering that this would dampen the enthusiasm of consumers, the Qing government also launched the donation of resignation, so that as long as you pay for it, you can leave immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can use money to get a promotion, you can be punished for dereliction of duty, or you can spend money to eliminate disasters. In the Qing Dynasty, depending on the content and degree of the fault committed by an official, there were three types of punishment: fine, demotion, and dismissal. Under normal circumstances, only “set-off” or “recovery” can reduce or reduce the penalty. The so-called &quot;offset&quot; refers to officials using the rewards they receive to offset punishment. There are two types of awards: &quot;Additional Level&quot; and &quot;Record&quot;. &quot;Additional one level&quot; or four &quot;records&quot; can be used to offset the penalty of downgrading by one level. &quot;The second record will offset the penalty for one year, and the first record will offset the penalty for half a year.&quot; &quot;Rehabilitate&quot; means that the punishment can be lifted after a certain period of time if the person behaves well. For example, the reinstatement period for those who were demoted and retained in office is three years, and the period for those who were dismissed and retained in office is four years. If you perform meritorious services during this period, you may be reinstated in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both &quot;Additional Levels&quot; and &quot;Records&quot; can be purchased publicly for money. However, the Qing Dynasty stipulated that for the &quot;increased level&quot; or &quot;record&quot; of donations to be used for offset, the payment must have been received before the disciplinary incident was reported. If you go to buy something after being punished, it will be too late. Therefore, before officials took office, they donated Naga level and records. Beginning in the 14th year of Kangxi&#39;s reign, officials were allowed to directly spend money to cancel the punishment after being punished. All officials who have been demoted and retained in office, or dismissed and retained in office (remaining in their original posts after being demoted or dismissed), except for a few exceptions, can donate to reinstatement officers. Officials who should have been demoted (reassigned work according to the downgraded grade) or dismissed, but who were retained in office due to leniency orders, can pay a 50% increase in salary upon reinstatement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to donating to restore the official position, you can also donate to restore the position corresponding to the grade of the original official. This is called &quot;replacement donation&quot;. Retired officials can also donate to a position lower than the original official, which is called &quot;reduced donation&quot;. After the donation is made, there is still an opportunity to donate again to reinstate the official or change the donation, which is equivalent to payment in installments. Officials who have been dismissed from their posts, even if they are &quot;never employed&quot;, can still become officials again through donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to buying an official position, donating money is clearly marked with a clear price and is straightforward. The price of being demoted and staying in office, from the first to the seventh rank, is twice that of a Beijing official. For example, a first-rank Beijing official is 450 taels, and a second-rank official is 410 liang. A first-rank foreign official is 900 liang, and a second-rank official is 820 liang. The eighth and ninth grades are subject to the unified price of Beijing and foreign officials. The price of donations for those who were dismissed and retained in office was not only much higher, but also more detailed. For the same grade, officials in the capital charged higher prices than officials in foreign countries. For officials who are demoted, transferred or dismissed, the price can be doubled compared to those who were demoted and retained or dismissed. In addition, depending on the specific circumstances of different officials, there is a complex price increase mechanism, ranging from an increase of 20% (20%) to an increase of one and a half times (150%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the Qing Dynasty, due to widespread financial difficulties in local areas, the imperial court often allowed each province to set up local donations. This resulted in an unintended consequence - inter-provincial competition. In order to expand revenue as much as possible, each province not only accepts donations from residents of other provinces living in the province, but also sets up donation bureaus (sales offices) in major cities outside the province to drum up business, even at the expense of small profits but quick turnover, &quot;reduced (discounted) donations&quot; , starting a price war. At one point, Sichuan and other provinces protested against &quot;dumping&quot; by Gansu and Shaanxi and demanded that the central government prohibit people from their provinces from going to other provinces to report donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Ciming, a famous scholar in the late Qing Dynasty and a native of Zhejiang, went to the Fujian Donation Bureau to apply for donations in the ninth year of Xianfeng (1859). The price was 9684 taels, and the actual receipt was 815 taels, which was less than 10%. This is a common practice in various provinces: &quot;Henan Province takes rate notes (notes issued by the Ministry of Household Affairs to settle military arrears) and adds 10% in cash, which is about 20%. Huguang, Sichuan, and Zhejiang account for about 10%. The third. Jiangxi and Guangxi account for about three-tenths of the tenths. Yunnan and Guizhou account for about two-tenths. Anhui fully collects rates, accounting for about one-tenth. The remaining provinces do not have more than 30%.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In Chengdu at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in addition to the Sichuan Relief Bureau (disaster relief) in the province, there were also the Xinhai Defense Donation Bureau (organizing the navy), the Feng (Liaoning) Donation Bureau, the Gui Donation Bureau, the Jiangnan Donation Bureau, and the Shandong Works Relief Donation Bureau (raising funds for Work-relief funds) and the Beiyang Salary and Donation Bureau (Beiyang Military Salary), etc. At that time, newspapers had just been born, and due to fierce competition, some discerning donation bureaus had already learned to publish advertisements. In this situation where there are many donation bureaus and a mixture of good and bad, there is also a phenomenon that some people conduct credit evaluations on different donation bureaus in publicly issued books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are so many types of tricks and there are so many donation bureaus, most people are easily confused, so an intermediary agency was born that specializes in handling donations, with a commission of about 10%. Many gold shops have &quot;transformed into a gathering place for donors and introductions&quot; and have dedicated &quot;donation counters&quot; to handle donations. Gold shops with donation counters are called &quot;public gold shops&quot;, while gold shops without donation counters are called &quot;mother gold shops&quot;. There will be competition among gold shops, and they will also use various means to deceive customers, which is no different from today&#39;s real estate agencies. Everyone knows the prosperity of Shanxi banknotes in the late Qing Dynasty, but few people have noticed that agency donations are one of the keys to the great development of Shanxi banknotes.

According to the Anhui Radio and Television Economic Life Channel, a 4-year-old boy in Hefei, Anhui, Wang Zien, had no one to take care of him and played alone on the street all day long. In order to settle Wang Zien&#39;s residence, the child&#39;s father, 18-year-old Wang, finally showed up. He said that he was only 14 years old when Wang Zien was born, and the child&#39;s mother was 20 years old at the time. The two parties broke up a few months after the child was born, and there has been no contact. He had to leave the child to his father to raise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident broke out, public opinion mainly focused on Wang giving birth to a child before the age of 14. He was still a child, which was too irresponsible, and the mother of the child was more likely to be suspected of abandoning the child. A lawyer interviewed by the media said that the mother should fulfill her parenting obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These angles cannot be said to be meaningless, but they obviously miss the point. The crux of the problem should be that boys&#39; sexual rights are not protected. According to Wang, he was only 14 years old when the child was born (I don’t know whether he was one year old or not, even if he was one year old, Wang was probably still under 14 years old when they had sex), and the child’s mother was 20 years old. It can be inferred that when having sexual relations, Wang was most likely under 14 years old, while the mother of the child was over 18 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What will happen if the genders are reversed and an 18-year-old man has sex with a girl under 14? I&#39;m afraid online public opinion has already exploded. According to the criminal law, sexual relations with a girl under the age of 14, regardless of whether the girl &quot;consented&quot;, will be severely punished as rape. If the circumstances are serious or cause serious consequences, the death penalty may also be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when the genders are reversed and adult women have sex with underage men, the situation becomes very embarrassing. The crime of rape cannot be applied because China&#39;s criminal law stipulates that the victim of rape can only be a female. Even if a man is forced to have sex, the other party does not commit the crime of rape. If the boy is under 14 when he is violated, he can be punished as child molestation. However, the penalty for this crime is only a fixed-term imprisonment of less than 5 years. Even if there are bad circumstances or serious consequences, the maximum sentence can only be 15 years in prison. This is not the same as the punishment for rape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the male victim is over 14 years old, he is no longer a child. Even if he is forcibly violated, criminal law cannot protect his rights. More importantly, in reality, if a minor male has sexual relations with a female, if the other party is an adult, judicial practice will not consider the male&#39;s sexual rights to have been violated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is obviously abnormal. Minor males should receive the same protection as minor females. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quite coincidentally, a case of an adult female teacher sexually assaulting an underage male student recently broke out in Taiwan. Xu, a female teacher who works as a fifth- and sixth-grade primary school teacher, repeatedly sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 14 in her class. She eventually became pregnant and gave birth to a child. The crime was later reported. The judge recently ruled that Xu was guilty of sexual intercourse and forced intercourse with a man under the age of 14, and sentenced her to 17 years and six months in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analyzing this case, we can find the differences between Taiwan’s criminal laws and mainland criminal laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, having sex with a man against his will also constitutes the crime of rape (called &quot;forced intercourse&quot; in Taiwan). According to the criminal regulations revised in Taiwan in 1999, &quot;Men and women who have sexual intercourse by force, coercion, intimidation, hypnosis or other methods against their will shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 3 years but not more than 10 years.&quot; In this case, The judge determined that the female teacher surnamed Xu had sex with a male student twice against the male student&#39;s will, so it constituted a crime of forced intercourse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as long as you have sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14, even if the child is voluntary, it still constitutes a crime (Article 227 of the Criminal Code of Taiwan, &quot;Any person who has sexual intercourse with a man or woman under the age of 14 shall be punished with 3 to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years but not more than 10 years”). In the above-mentioned case, the judge held that the female teacher named Xu had sexual intercourse with male students on seven other occasions. Although the boys were consenting, Xu&#39;s use of the girl still constituted the crime of sexual intercourse with men under the age of 14. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Taiwan’s criminal regulations also equally protect the sexual rights of minors of men and women over 14 years old but under 16 years old. “Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a man or woman over 14 years old but under 16 years old shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 7 years.” &quot;. That is to say, having sexual relations with minors between the ages of 14 and 16 is also a crime, but the penalty is lighter than having sexual relations with children under 14 years old. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mainland criminal law, the protection of men’s sexual rights is much weaker. The sexual rights of minor males over 14 years old (let alone adult males) are not protected by criminal law, and the sexual rights of boys under 14 years old can only be protected by the much weaker crime of child molestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another point in Taiwan’s criminal laws that we can learn from, that is, multiple crimes can be punished based on the number of crimes committed, and they can be punished simultaneously. In the above-mentioned case, the judge found that Xu had sex with male students nine times. Although they were only divided into two categories, she was still convicted of nine crimes, and finally she was punished for several crimes. In the mainland legal system, only different crimes will be regarded as multiple crimes, the same crime will be classified as one crime, and the number of crimes will only be used as a reference for sentencing. This may result in a lighter sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at history, before Taiwan revised its criminal laws in 1999, the victims of rape could only be women. If a man was sexually assaulted, the perpetrator could only be held accountable for indecent assault. However, Taiwan revised the relevant regulations more than 20 years ago to provide equal protection for the sexual rights of men and women. This is something the mainland can learn from. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
