Byatt passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his relatives at the age of 87. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Byatt won the Booker Prize for his novel &quot;Possession&quot; and made a sensation in the literary world. In the same year, she was awarded the Order of the British Empire, and in 1999 she was awarded the title of Dame. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The almost obsessive research ethos prevalent in contemporary English writing owes a great deal to Possession’s majestic, engrossing demonstration, a work of romantic literature from the archives; at the same time, The science fantasy of &quot;Morpho Eugenia&quot; has powerfully proven its immense instructive significance for young writers... No one can write about both Darwin&#39;s theory and the ancient inexhaustible theme of love. &quot;So brilliantly.&quot; Philip Henschel, a reporter from &quot;The Paris Review&quot; who once interviewed Byatt, recalled, &quot;Few writers have such strong intellectual curiosity; except for her, perhaps no one can view spiritual life so decisively. It is a pleasure to be enjoyed, and it is equal in absorption and release.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his 60-year writing career, Byatt also published &quot;Angels and Insects&quot;, &quot;The Children&#39;s Book&quot; and Her representative works include the tetralogy of female growth (&quot;Virgin in the Garden&quot;, &quot;Still Life&quot;, &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; and &quot;The Whistling Woman&quot;), as well as short story collections such as &quot;Eye of a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Matisse Stories&quot;. Her works have been It has been translated into 38 languages ​​and won many world-class literary awards. Confidently moving between literature, religion, science, art, and theoretical insights, Byatt is recognized as &quot;one of the most important writers and critics of our time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/muZTpXilvlTUurXYtz23y4l913KVOooAqwbWUI04.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; height= &quot;1542&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/muZTpXilvlTUurXYtz23y4l913KVOooAqwbWUI04.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259395&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Medusa&#39;s Ankles&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021, Byatt&#39;s last book , the short story anthology &quot;Medusa&#39;s Ankles&quot; was published. &quot;These stories are charming and sparkling, intoxicating and trembling. They comfort you and awaken you.&quot; The famous British novelist David Mitchell commented in the introduction: &quot;If you compare &quot;Medusa&#39;s Ankles&quot; to For an artist’s retrospective exhibition, the museum does not need to provide a tour guide, nor does it need to place exhibition labels next to the works - because these stories are just there, so perfect and bright.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;I don’t like it.

Byatt was born Ann Antonia Susan Drabble was born in Sheffield, England in 1936. Her father was a judge and her mother taught Victorian poetry. Byatt graduated from the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. He taught English literature at University College London in 1972. He resigned from his teaching position in 1983 to focus on writing. In the same year, he became a member of the Royal Society of Literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt is the eldest daughter in the family. Her parents and three younger siblings are also Cambridge graduates. &quot;I was lucky in Cambridge. A university English degree often makes people discouraged from writing. Graduating the degree greatly suppressed my desire to write and made me feel embarrassed. But at the same time, it greatly strengthened my desire to write. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/DOKvCJtmvmkSaQNItA7o6YMTBOWPfG8k5ZkQ6iQI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/DOKvCJtmvmkSaQNItA7o6YMTBOWPfG8k5ZkQ6iQI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259398&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Possession&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the publication of the novel &quot;Possession&quot;, Byatt&#39;s reputation was once shrouded in the shadow of his sister Margaret De La, who is also a writer. Under the aura of Boole, Byatt once admitted in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Let&#39;s put it bluntly: the response to my first few books was all confused...No one paid attention to what I was doing...She wrote I wrote a lot, and I wrote fast. In the long run, it had a positive effect on me. I didn’t have the anxiety most writers have about repercussions, I just had this simple fear of being thought of as someone’s sister.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In his 1967 novel The Game, Byatt tells the story of a pair of competing sisters (just two years earlier, Drabble had published a novel on a similar theme). Byatt explained that the inspiration for &quot;The Game&quot; came from a board game that her friend&#39;s sister used to play with imaginary fragments, &quot;much like Henry James&#39;s game of climbing stairs to find fragments of information.&quot; The novel is also a reference to Brown. &quot;I found the Brontë sisters&#39; solitaire imagination to be extremely terrifying.&quot; &quot;The Game&quot; also points to people&#39;s creativity in childhood. According to Byatt&#39;s recollection, when she was a child, she wrote about men in disguise sneaking into Adventures in a girls&#39; school, but &quot;most of those exercises were burned before I left boarding school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1958, Byatt married British economist Ian Byatt (first husband, divorced in 1969), and the two lived in Durham, a city in northeastern England. It is a place where the legacy of the Middle Ages still exists. In that era, if you were a woman, they would take away the benefits they gave you for getting married, but if you were a man, they would increase it. So, there I lost my benefits, and from some hidden In a sense, I am secretly happy about it, because I actually want to be a writer rather than a scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt gave birth to two children after marriage, during which she gave birth to her first child. The manuscript of &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot; that had been put in the drawer was taken out and &quot;rewritten over and over again in a slow and unpleasant way...At the same time, one or the other baby was placed in a small chair on the desk and rocked gently with one hand. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Byatt published her first novel &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot;. In her own words, &quot;a novel about a young woman at a university who wants to write a novel.&quot; In this debut novel, Byatt writes about a girl trying to escape from her controlling father. Tense family relationships and women&#39;s independent growth have since become important issues in many of her works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“I don’t want to belong to any group...I don’t like a spiritual guru, someone who asks you to follow or worship him. I like someone who asks you to think for yourself.”&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Is he &quot;possessing&quot; her, or is she &quot;possessing&quot; him&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Possession&quot; was conceived by me for 15 years. I gave up UCL for 11 years I wrote it in two months after I started teaching. It&#39;s the only novel I&#39;ve ever written that was generally coherent, with no one getting sick, no disasters, no awards, no book promotions. It had a terrible energy, and from the first sentence to the last, the whole book was in my mind.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to Byatt, &quot;early writing&quot; means Works before &quot;Possession&quot;. In 1990, when this work became a best-seller and won the Booker Prize, Byatt finally &quot;occupied&quot; an important position in the literary world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The creation of Possession began with the title of the book. I was sitting in the old-fashioned round table reading room of the British Museum, watching the great Coleridge scholar Catherine Coburn in the circular catalog area Walking around, round and round. I suddenly realized that her whole life was dedicated to this dead poet. I thought: Did he &#39;possess&#39; her, or did she &#39;possess&#39; him? Then I thought, This could be written as a novel, about the &#39;possession&#39; relationship between the living and the dead. It would be a fascinating story of possession.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Possession&quot; revolves around two contemporary people. The scholar&#39;s research unfolds: a pretentious young academic and a reserved feminist. While tracing the letters exchanged between Victorian poets, the two unearthed a secret love affair of that era. Falling in love in the process...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The word &#39;possession&#39; also has a very direct interest level that can be discussed: who &#39;possess&#39; the manuscript of a dead writer? Moreover, &#39;possession&#39; also applied to sexual relations. At that time , I was studying the letters of Browning and his wife, and I thought of two pairs of lovers, one modern and the other ancient - the Victorians, and having them embody &#39;possession&#39; in these senses.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The publication of &quot;Possession&quot; (full title &quot;Possession: A Romance&quot;) heralds the emergence of a &quot;new Byatt&quot;. She has great narrative talent, and the novel is full of humorous satire on the academic circle. , like a suspenseful detective story, or a touching (as its subtitle suggests) romantic legend. &quot;I originally planned to write an experimental novel, about literary theory and an ambitious biographical text... What changed everything was my reading experience of Eco&#39;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; and its ironic medieval detective story... The secret I found in it is: a great story that can put whatever you need to put in it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the text of &quot;Possession&quot;, Byatt also boldly inserts herself Poetry imitating the style of Victorian poetry. &quot;The novel required real poetry in form, but I don&#39;t write poetry. My editor at the time said: Don&#39;t be ridiculous, write it yourself! So, I went home and wrote a Victorian poem about spiders... I have always been fascinated by the poetry of Tennyson and Browning. I read it as a child because my mother was a Browning expert. Their rhymes sang in my head, and those Victorian verses just clicked in my novel. came out of nowhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time Byatt completed Possession, publishers on both sides of the Atlantic were deeply troubled and almost sceptical. &quot;They begged me to cut out those poems and writings about the Victorian era. The only American publisher brave enough to accept it reminded me: &#39;You ruin all the suspense with these cumbersome words.&#39; Early in the morning, I cried. . Later, the novel won the Booker Prize, to everyone&#39;s surprise (including myself), it became a bestseller, and people wrote essays using my imaginary poet. &quot;Possession&quot; was translated into thirty Multiple languages. I owe Eco a huge debt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;259392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matisse&#39;s story&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Still Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Byatt once said in an exclusive interview with the New York Times: &quot;I am not an academic who accidentally wrote a novel. In fact, I happen to be a moderately academic novelist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt&#39;s early literary creations were modeled after George Eliot and Iris Murdoch. Like the former, she regards novels as an ideal art form because &quot;you can absorb the whole world from them&quot;; influenced by the latter, she tries to portray characters who are entangled and struggling with various ideas; at the same time, following the example of her two predecessors, she admires Utter writes dense, detailed novels that are challenging to read even for her smart, patient fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The difficulty lies in the fact that sentences like this can be seen everywhere: a dense collection of unknown knowledge and the author&#39;s delicate and rigorous subjective feelings; specialized terms in the fields of classics, mythology and art are randomly picked up... ...long sentences contain alternating long and short clauses...familiar words have long-abandoned meanings or obscure meanings.&quot; Yang Xiangrong, the translator of Byatt&#39;s works, once &quot;complained&quot; that the translation of &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot; was difficult, But I was impressed, &quot;When I read it for the second time, I gradually fell in love with the complex and regular language style, the unremitting capture of subtleties, and the almost aristocratic style of writing in which the writer never creates simple sentences.

Byatt inscribed on the title page - &quot;Dedicated to me&quot; The son of Charles Byatt (1961.7.19-1972.7.22).&quot; &quot;I came up with the idea of ​​​​creating &quot;Virgin in the Garden&quot; around 1961, when my son was born. I suddenly realized that I had experienced a certain period. History.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt set the background of &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot; in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne. In the very short time span from rehearsal, performance to completion of a historical drama, Bo The three children of the Te family have undergone fundamental changes. The eldest daughter Stephanie got married and had a child, the 18-year-old second daughter Frederica lost her virginity, and the youngest son Marcus was deceived and became insane... They all experienced dangerous growth. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the novel, Byatt begins with &quot;National Portrait Gallery: 1968&quot;, &quot;I experienced the early 1950s. I lived in the 1960s, and I don&#39;t regard the 1960s as A time for a revolution, but as a time when I can look back on the history in which I lived... What is personal is not political, although the participants in politics are individuals. Politics is not personal at all.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In 1972, Byatt&#39;s son Charles, who was just over 11 years old, died suddenly in a car accident on his way to school. After losing her beloved son, she experienced landslides and ice cracks in her life. She wrote a sentence at the end of the prologue of the novel. A woman whose son was seriously injured in the collision said, &quot;That woman used to be a good teacher, but not anymore. She used to have many friends, but now she doesn&#39;t have them. She used to have a lovable body, but now she doesn&#39;t. She was scared and angry.

Stephanie gave birth successfully, but when she was looking forward to a new life, she was accidentally electrocuted. Death. The English title of the novel &quot;Still Life&quot; is interpreted literally - &quot;still life&quot; - that is, death. In the book, Byatt once lamented through the mouth of a character: &quot;Perhaps, we can also look at still life in this way. The so-called still life painting is synonymous with natural death.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have already conceived it. Stephanie&#39;s death in 1961. I thought I was going to write a series of novels in which I would make that death a central awareness, so that readers would feel the pain of a real death, as you did, rather than having to deal with a real death. A fictional death. Every two or three months I get a letter from a reader saying, how dare you do this to me. I sit down and cry all night long.

After 16 years, the injustice was overturned and the family was finally reunited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have spent most of my life writing to resist &quot;The Winter&#39;s Tale.&quot; That kind of deception is so bad! It takes away a woman&#39;s most fertile and sexually demanding years. Lock her in a cellar and say it would be nice if she came back as a sculpture, that would be a comfort. It pissed me off.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt admitted that when she was 30, she had I feel scared because &quot;spring comes carelessly, and I will grow old and die&quot;, &quot;But now that I have reached such an age, this fact makes me more gratified: even if I die, spring will continue to come... still There are rocks and trees...

Fierce, from competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; to now &quot;fighting&quot; to compete for the market. Is such low-quality competition really conducive to the long-term development of domestic jewelry companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259328&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Robbing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many consumers who don’t know much about gold brands have inevitably encountered such confusion: Why do so many gold companies have the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;? For example, Chow Tai Fook, Chow Sang Sang, Chow Tai Sang, Saturday Fook, Chow Jin Sang, Chow Pak Fook, Chow Fu Sang... In fact, the founders of many of them are not named &quot;Chow&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook is a well-known old brand. As early as 1929, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s founder Zhou Zhiyuan founded the first &quot;Chow Tai Fook Gold Store&quot; on Hongde Road, Guangzhou, mainly selling traditional gold jewelry. In the 1930s, due to the current situation, Zhou Zhiyuan moved Chow Tai Fook Bank from Guangzhou to Macau, and later opened a branch in Hong Kong. In 2011, Chow Tai Fook was listed in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Sang Sang is also an old brand, and the founder is also named Zhou. In 1934, Shunde native Zhou Fangpu founded Jinhang in Guangzhou. From the 1930s to the 1940s, Chow Sang Sang had opened many branches in Hong Kong and Macao. Chow Sang Sang was listed in 1973. It was the first listed gold and jewelry company in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang was established much later than Chow Tai Fook and Chow Sang Sang. It opened its first counter in Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing in 1999 and was listed on the Shenzhen Main Board in 2017. The founder of Zhou Dasheng, Zhou Zongwen, is from Fuqing, Fujian Province, but his surname is indeed &quot;Zhou&quot;, so there is nothing wrong with naming the gold bank Zhou Dasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Saturday Fu&#39;s surname is &quot;Zhou&quot;, which has caused a lot of controversy. In 2004, Li Weipeng and Chen Chuangjin jointly invested in the establishment of Saturday Fortune. In 2005, Chen Chuangjin transferred 50% of the equity held by Li Weipeng to Li Weizhu, Li Weipeng&#39;s brother. In other words, the founder and current head of Saturday Fortune is named &quot;Li&quot;. The name of Luk Fook will also cause consumers to confuse it with &quot;Luk Fook Jewelry&quot;. Lukfook Jewelry was established in Hong Kong in 1991 and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1997. It is more senior than Lukfook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some jewelry brands named &quot;Zhou&quot; that appeared after 2000 did not have founders named Zhou. For example, the founders of Zhou Jinsheng are surnamed Li, the founders of Zhou Baifu are surnamed Ye, and the founders of Zhou Fusheng are surnamed Zheng... The founders of these brands must be well aware of whether there is a motive for &quot;taking advantage of&quot; the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rush to surname &quot;Zhou&quot; reflects a dilemma of domestic jewelry brands: There is still a lack of domestic jewelry brands that are truly out of the circle, and consumers fail to understand some of the problems. Some brands generate real loyalty. Gold banks look similar, and consumers don’t care that much. This gives those who “fake” the brand an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259329&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Seize for the sinking market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are they competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;, China&#39;s major gold banks are also competing for the market. This time, the employees of Zhou Taisheng and Lao Fengxiang fought over soliciting business, which is a microcosm of the current situation of jewelry brands competing for the sinking market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Whether it is Lao Fengxiang, China Gold, or a group of gold banks named &quot;Zhou&quot;, they have opened stores in the sinking market. Some netizens posted that their hometown is a small county, but “seven or eight gold stores have opened on one street.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook&#39;s first quarter financial report of this year shows that in the first quarter, Chow Tai Fook opened 248 new retail points in the mainland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang&#39;s financial report shows that as of the first quarter of 2023, the number of Chow Tai Sang&#39;s terminal stores has increased by a net of 133 stores compared with the end of the same period last year, and by a net increase of 21 stores from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China Gold&#39;s 2023 first quarter financial report shows that China Gold added 21 direct-operated stores and 325 franchise stores in the first quarter; Chow Sang Sang also predicted in the financial report , the group will have a net increase of approximately 100 branches in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these branches are in third- and fourth-tier cities. For example, in 2022, more than half of Chow Tai Fook&#39;s new stores will be located in sinking markets, and the proportion of retail value in third-tier, fourth-tier and other cities has reached one-third. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why we target the sinking market is that on the one hand, the gold and jewelry market in first- and second-tier cities has gradually become saturated, and there is no shortage of gold banks and gold stores. Expand market share and begin to extend to lower-tier markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, in addition to investment and self-wear, a very critical part of the consumer demand for jewelry is wedding demand. In small counties, there are customary requirements for &quot;three golds&quot; (gold necklaces, gold rings, gold earrings) or &quot;hardwares&quot; (gold bracelets and gold headdresses are added to the &quot;three golds&quot;) for weddings. Gold consumption of 10,000 yuan is &quot;standard&quot; in many places. This is a big cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the sinking of gold brands has also brought new problems. The first thing to bear the brunt is brand management. Many new stores are franchise stores of the brand. The management level of the franchisees varies. Once a problem occurs, it becomes a brand problem and has an impact on the brand image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is even more embarrassing is that for consumers in the sinking market, whether you are the senior Lao Fengxiang, Chow Tai Fook, the much younger Chow Tai Seng, or the local There is no fundamental difference between some &quot;no-name&quot; gold banks. Consumers &quot;buy whichever one is cheaper&quot;. Anyway, they are all gold, so whoever you buy is not buying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, the &quot;business war&quot; of gold banks in the sinking market sometimes involves simply and crudely grabbing customers, which may lead to conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Need to work hard on craftsmanship and brand management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter Whether they are competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; or the outrageous conflicts caused by low-quality competition, they have jointly exposed the common dilemma of domestic gold brands: the brand premium is not high, consumers&#39; brand loyalty is not high, and competition is still in the &quot;reckless&quot; stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Precisely because the brand premium is not high, the profit margins of domestic gold brands are not high. No matter how the gold price outside rises, buying gold at a gold bank only adds a labor fee to the gold price. According to industry analysis, the retail gross profit margin of gold is 10%-20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for profit margins, they are even lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, Lao Fengxiang&#39;s first quarter financial report for 2023 shows that during the reporting period, the company achieved total operating income of 24.558 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company of 716 million yuan, and a profit margin of 2.9%; China Gold’s operating income in the first quarter of 2023 was 16.139 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company was 300 million yuan, and the profit margin was 1.86%...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In comparison Some foreign jewelry luxury brands, such as Tiffany, Bulgari, Van Cleef &amp; B., their retail gross profit margin is enviable and can reach 50%-60%. Obviously ingredients are ordinary materials cheaper than gold, but the price is stunning, and consumers are still rushing. The hat of &quot;people stupid money&quot; for consumers is just the self -consolation of the latter. Domestic gold brands need to face the existence of the gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Where is these luxury brands &quot;win&quot;? On the one hand, the technology and innovation of luxury brand technology have originality and original elements. For example, the &quot;four -leaf grass&quot; series of Van Cleef &amp; B. In recent years, domestic gold brands have also been explored in craftsmanship. For example, Zhou Dafu&#39;s &quot;ancient gold&quot; is loved by young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Unfortunately, the domestic followers are still too serious, and now almost every mainstream gold brand has the ancient gold series, and the distinction between the brands is again. Disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The other is the continuous cultivation of the brand image. Today, many gold brands are co -branded with young people&#39;s favorite brands, such as Harry Potter and Crazy Animal City. This is of course a way. . Consumers will buy joint models, but they will not become loyal users of the gold brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the final analysis, to enhance the brand power, we must avoid short-sightedness, avoid emergency effort, avoid follow the trend, sink to the cold bench, work hard on the craftsmanship, and work hard on the craftsmanship. It is not easy to enhance the brand&#39;s artistic and honorable sense of nobleness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Otherwise, &quot;蹭&quot; and follow the trend, blindly developing the market and opening up, it seems that the market share is very large. fee. In the end, even if the &quot;fight&quot; is fierce, consumers still buy the cheap one -you &quot;hit&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[儿童医院人满为患，国家卫健委回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261135]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-23 13:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; In response to the increase in the number of hospital outpatient diagnosis in some places, the number In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on November 23, the relevant comrades of the Health Commission were answered on an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, and they answered questions about some people, especially children&#39;s family care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Question: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Many local children&#39;s hospitals are full of people.

After looking at the collection of the library, I couldn’t help but wonder, just for the Chinese local chronicles, which library in China has so many original local chronicles from the early Qing Dynasty, where you can read them by hand, take photos for free, and each set of rare books has been specially protected. Protected and carefully collected, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Harvard&#39;s many libraries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Zhao Kui said that some of Harvard University’s chronicles were purchased by Yenching University when it was running a school in China in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, some were purchased from Japanese collectors after Japan’s defeat, and many were purchased by Chinese collectors. The income is directly donated by the family, which is the accumulated income of hundreds of years and generations of research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the amount of information, Harvard University’s openness is worth promoting in China. Foreigners who intend to visit the Harvard University Library can enter the library with valid documents after applying for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China&#39;s relevant laws and policies, public libraries must be open to the public free of charge. However, school libraries do not have this obligation. In 2017, the second draft of the Public Library Law was reviewed, and Article 47 stipulated: “The state encourages school libraries, libraries of scientific research institutions, and other types of libraries to be open to the public.” Article 48 of the Public Library Law that was finally implemented stipulates: &quot;The state supports school libraries, scientific research institution libraries and other types of libraries to be open to the public.&quot; From encouragement to support, opening school libraries to the public On the issue of openness, the attitude has become weaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that libraries in universities and scientific research institutions serve specific teachers and students, and students also pay fees to go to university. Therefore, libraries in universities and scientific research institutions should put the interests of teachers and students first. In the first place, there is no obligation to the public. From the perspective of resources and capabilities, school libraries have limited space. Now many university libraries are overcrowded and it is difficult to find a library. University libraries are unable to assume the responsibility of opening to the outside world. Opening up to the outside world will worsen the experience of teachers and students in schools. After it is opened to the outside world, even if there is access through ID cards, citizen cards, etc., it cannot be strictly managed like subway security inspections. There are great dangers and hidden dangers, which is not conducive to protecting students. In addition, there will be management issues, such as the problem of non-return after lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, these reasons are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, although students pay tuition fees, the running costs of the university cannot be covered by tuition fees. China&#39;s universities and scientific research institutions are all supported by state funding, including libraries, and state funding comes from taxes paid by each citizen. University libraries are also public libraries to some extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public&#39;s demand for the library is mainly for borrowing, which will not put too much pressure on the venue. In terms of management, the credit system is now very developed and can fully undertake the management of university libraries opening to the outside world. In addition to ID cards, citizen cards, and financial credit systems, social credit systems such as Zhima Fen are now very efficient. Not only can you borrow power banks and shared bicycles without a deposit, you can even rent a car without a deposit. These values ​​are more expensive than books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for security issues, borrowing itself is a screening demand. Those who have this demand are people with some education. Even if it is open, it will not be like a teahouse or bar, and the demand will not skyrocket and the pressure will not be Not big. Of course, there are always more risks when there are more people, but this risk is no higher than college students taking the subway or walking on the street, so the so-called safety issues are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is another very important reason why universities and research institutions do not open their libraries, that is, they can monopolize scarce information and academic resources, thereby gaining advantages in publishing papers and producing results. But obviously, academic libraries supported by public finance should not become exclusive academic resources. Someone said on Weibo that he went to the National Library and wanted to read the only copy of &quot;The Book of Fishing&quot; from the Ming Dynasty. He only saw it after asking for help. He was not allowed to take pictures. It took him three days to enter it on the computer and spent more than 500 yuan on the remaining part. Copying, and you also need to sign a &quot;no publication&quot; guarantee before you can read it. The original copies of the Ming Dynasty have long lost their copyright. The library should be responsible for disseminating knowledge, but it regards this as an exclusive resource. This phenomenon is more serious in universities and research institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The libraries of universities and research institutions are more professional than public libraries and have more comprehensive subject materials. If they are only used by one family, it will cause waste. If they are open to the public, they can exert greater value and make more people use it. Many people benefit, and it is also conducive to academic competition and innovation. On the other hand, university libraries are independent, which will lead to duplication of construction and is not conducive to the efficient use of resources. Opening up university libraries and sharing resources is conducive to the differentiation of university libraries into professional directions, which is also a good thing for universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which was nominated for Best Picture at the 70th Academy Awards together with &quot;Titanic&quot;, tells the story of the growth of a talented boy. In the film, a Harvard college student laughs at the male protagonist, and the male protagonist counterattacks: &quot;The education you spent fifteen thousand dollars on, I can get in a public library for only one and a half dollars.&quot; Open libraries are conducive to education. Fairness and fair opportunities allow more people who have not entered universities or scientific research institutions to easily obtain academic materials and promote the development of China&#39;s science, technology, and cultural knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2017, the Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Sports jointly issued the &quot;Implementation Opinions on Promoting the Opening of School Sports Venues to the Society&quot;, which aims to effectively alleviate the growing sports and fitness needs of young people and the general public. The contradiction between sports venues and insufficient supply of resources promotes the prosperity and development of national fitness. Objectively speaking, the operation of sports venues is a zero-sum game with little flexibility and an either-or for users. But the library is different. If it is just for borrowing, opening it to the public will have little impact on students and researchers. Therefore, since university stadiums can &quot;promote opening to the public&quot;, then there is no reason for university libraries to be closed and refused to be open to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The library is a public service with strong externalities. It can popularize knowledge, help innovation, and drive the country&#39;s technological and economic progress and social development. The more borrowings there are, the stronger the role of the library. It is a great thing for the country and individuals for libraries to operate at a higher intensity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the state should promote, encourage and even require libraries in universities and research institutions to be open to the public. Nowadays, libraries have a lot of electronic materials, which are open to the public. They do not occupy library space and do not put a lot of pressure on the network. Electronic materials in colleges and universities are open to the public, and this can be done immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这对错置的父女，治愈又温情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261059]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;There is a new movie recently.

He is the one who needs to be taken care of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This contrary narration method makes the film full of a childishness that pretends to be mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/f150d9df5aa87d07e290d3bffcacb8f1.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/f150d9df5aa87d07e290d3bffcacb8f1.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259125&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In our traditional understanding, fathers are often figures of silent giving. For example, in Zhu Ziqing&#39;s novel, the father left a deep shadow after turning over the tracks to buy oranges for his son; for example, the father played by Zhang Yi in the currently released &quot;Priceless Treasure&quot; is very willing to protect and pay for his adopted daughter, even if he faces jail, he still has to protect his daughter&#39;s safety. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A father from this perspective is always like a mountain, extending his hands when his children need them, and becoming a beacon when their children move forward. Likewise, as children, they should also go Understand their hardship and be grateful for their efforts. &lt;/span>;This is a profound expression of father&#39;s love, and also contains a spiritual expectation of parents for their children, hoping that they will be considerate and filial in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, &quot;Occasional Echoes&quot; misplaced the maturity of the little girl and her father in an exaggerated way, causing the father to confess that he was not sensible and did not know how to take care of him as soon as he appeared. child. The daughter, on the other hand, cleans the house the way her mother did when she was alive, so that every place in the house always looks like it did when her mother was alive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this contrary misplacement, the movie&lt;/span>; rarely restores the world of a child. There is the joy that only belongs to children here. She dances cutely downstairs to please the neighbors, rolls around on the grass with her friends, thinks she can steal other people&#39;s bicycles seamlessly, and thinks she is confident in bargaining with unscrupulous car dealers. This is a child who forces himself to mature and begins to explore the grand world, full of vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the film generously acknowledges that our parents can also be outrageous.

Selling tofu bread in a bun shop may indeed violate the regulations, but it does not necessarily require a huge penalty. Is there a more humane way? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the China Quality News Network, a subsidiary of China Quality Newspaper and Periodicals, which is in charge of the State Administration of Municipal Supervision, an administrative penalty published on the official website of the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau recently showed that the &quot;Beijing Wannan Wenxin Baozi Shop&quot; will be closed in 2022. From April 23 to July 27, 2023, &quot;1,169 orders of tofu nao (salty) were sold on a food delivery platform, priced at 6 yuan/order, with a value of 7,014 yuan.&quot; The Chaoyang District Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that the bun shop sells hot food beyond the scope of its licensed business items and violates Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Measures for the Investigation and Punishment of Illegal Activities on Online Food Safety and the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Food Safety in Online Catering Services 》Article 4 stipulates that he shall be fined 15,000 yuan according to law; his illegal income of 7,014 yuan shall be confiscated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undoubtedly surprising that the bun shop cannot sell tofu pudding. As a result, the penalty quickly attracted a lot of attention on social media. Many netizens made fun of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The clause quoted in the administrative penalty decision stipulates that food operators shall not operate beyond the scope of the food business license. But why is it beyond the business scope of a bun shop to sell tofu? This really leaves a lot of people scratching their heads. According to the Chaoyang District Municipal Supervision Bureau, selling tofu curd is exceeding the permitted scope of selling hot food, but aren’t steamed buns a hot food? Since you can sell steamed buns, it means you have a hot food business license, so why can&#39;t you sell tofu puffs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public administrative penalty information does not provide any further explanation. Then we can only look up more information. Judging from the industrial and commercial registration information, the business license of this bun shop was registered in 2018, and its business scope includes catering services and food sales. According to the Food Safety Law, food-related business activities require a food business license. Then I checked its food business license information and found that its licensed business item is &quot;manufacture and sales of hot food (limited to staple food products)&quot;. The &quot;restricted to staple food products&quot; in the brackets is probably the reason why this bun shop was fined. Although they are all hot foods, steamed buns are a staple food, so their production and sale are allowed, while tofu curd is not considered a staple food, so they cannot be sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, the punishment imposed by the Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau cannot be said to be illegal. However, its rationality is still questionable. First of all, why is the scope of the food business license of this bun shop so narrow? According to the &quot;Food Business License Management Measures&quot; formulated by the former State Food and Drug Administration, the food business license items applied for by catering service operators are divided into hot food production and sales, cold food food production and sales, raw food food production and sales, and cakes. Food and sale, homemade beverage production and other food and sale. Except for the specific varieties approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which should be clearly marked for the production and sale of other types of food, other categories do not need to be specially labeled. So why is the food business license of this bun shop marked as limited to staple food products? If regulations do not stipulate that different business licenses apply to staple food and non-staple hot food, is the license originally issued by the Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau suspected of not being administered in accordance with the law and improperly restricting the business scope of the business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be noted that information from the official website of the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau shows that the food business license of Wannan Wenxin Baozi Shop was issued on October 17, 2023. The penalty decision for operating beyond the scope was made on November 13. The illegal facts in the penalty decision show that Baozipu has been selling tofu nao on the takeout website since April 2022. So, when this bun shop applied for a food business license in 2023, why did it only apply for the production and sale of &quot;staple food&quot; hot food? Knowing that in addition to steamed buns, their store also sells tofu puffs, and that there is no need to apply separately for hot food business licenses for staple food and non-staple food, the store deliberately only applied for a manufacturing and sales license for &quot;staple food&quot; to limit its business scope and Excluding the tofu pudding that you are already selling, are you digging a hole for yourself? Were you misled when you applied for a food business license? Have the staff of the competent department fulfilled their duty of explanation? Is it even possible that when applying for a license, they deliberately misled them to only apply for a staple food license, and then investigated and punished them for selling non-staple food beyond the scope? Considering that he was investigated and fined less than a month after applying for the license, such a timing coincidence can easily lead to other suspicions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if there are no problems with the above process, imposing such a heavy penalty violates the basic principle of administrative punishment that the penalty should be commensurate with the offense. The Administrative Penalty Law clearly stipulates that if the violation is minor and corrected in a timely manner without causing harmful consequences, administrative penalties will not be imposed. Baozi and tofu are both hot foods, and regulations do not make any special distinction between the safety supervision of the two. The sale of tofu in the bun shop has not caused any food safety consequences. Even if there is any violation of law, the circumstances are very minor, and it can be given a warning and ordered to make corrections. At the beginning, more than 7,000 &quot;illegal gains&quot; were confiscated and fined 15,000 yuan. A total of more than 20,000 yuan. How long does it take for a bun shop to make money back? At a time when it is difficult to make a living in a small business, imposing such heavy penalties on small businessmen will of course arouse strong dissatisfaction among the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for small mistakes to be punished heavily. In 2021, a vegetable shop owner in Yulin, Shaanxi Province was fined 66,000 yuan by the market supervision department for selling 5 kilograms of substandard celery. After being exposed by the State Council Supervision Bureau, the deputy director of the city&#39;s Municipal Supervision Bureau admitted that the punishment was too severe and was not proportionate. A CCTV report found that among the more than 50 penalties imposed on small and micro market entities by the city&#39;s Municipal Supervision Bureau since 2021, 21 cases were fined more than 50,000 yuan, and the case value was only tens or hundreds of yuan. The Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau in Beijing imposed a heavy fine on Baozi Shop, which is comparable to the case in Yulin. Is this kind of supervision for supervision or for fines? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Food safety supervision is of course very important, but supervision cannot be for the sake of supervision, let alone supervision for the sake of fines. Under the current economic situation, providing good services to small and micro market entities and creating a good market environment should be the primary responsibility of regulatory authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“阿根廷特朗普”米莱：他承诺去做的和他将会去做的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261100]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/VYQXzpdI0T4ZMuFEFaFT7g8Rc2qZzVWbsN7BPZzu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/VYQXzpdI0T4ZMuFEFaFT7g8Rc2qZzV WbsN7BPZzu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259316&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, the candidate of the Argentine far-right electoral alliance &quot;Freedom Forward Party&quot; Milai greeted the people at a polling station in the capital Buenos Aires &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local On October 22, the results of the second round of the Argentine presidential election were announced.

Since 2017, he has become interested in politics.

More than 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. In the past 20 years, It has defaulted on its international sovereign debt three times in the past few years, and the latest time it even caused neighboring Bolivia and Brazil to refuse to deliver the pineapples and bananas they ordered as part of the contract to avoid defaulting on their debts. Argentina, nicknamed &quot;the only developed country to develop into a developing country in modern times&quot;, ranked sixth in the world in terms of economic aggregate at the beginning of the 20th century, but has now fallen to 66th. Argentines have long complained about this. Not only that, massive public expenditures, deteriorating social security, and the prevalence of nepotism known as &quot;political casteization&quot; have become the targets of public outrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was against this background that Milais, who appeared with an alternative image of &quot;wild hair and a big mouth&quot;, entered the political arena as an &quot;amateur internet celebrity gunner&quot; and shouted out a series of remarks that seemed shocking but were actually The alternative political platform of &quot;Directed Demolition&quot;: Abolish the central bank and the local currency and switch to the US dollar, which is intended to cater to the public&#39;s distrust of the local currency and central bank accumulated due to long-term inflation and local currency establishment, and the public&#39;s belief that &quot;strong medicine may be able to eradicate inflation and &quot;Wealth shrinkage&quot; is expected; the abolition of more than half of the ministries and commissions is intended to cater to public dissatisfaction with nepotism and bureaucracy; the withdrawal from the &quot;BRIC&quot;, the freeze of large-scale engineering projects, and the privatization of public service enterprises and educational institutions such as schools, radio and television facilities, and electricity ization is intended to cater to the public’s strong desire to reduce public expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for other &quot;alternative propositions&quot;, they are mostly put forward to highlight their &quot;core values&quot; or attract core supporters, such as advocating anti-abortion and anti-contraception, opposing energy conservation and emission reduction, and drastically cutting social welfare and Medical privatization, etc., are all in line with its &quot;basic color&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At one point, he also proposed that &quot;everyone has a gun&quot; and even allowed his die-hard supporters to insult the current Pope Francis, who is also an Argentinian. This was also his &quot;true performance.&quot; As for the drug liberalization policy, which is very different from the &quot;Trump replicas&quot; of most other countries, it was &quot;condescendingly&quot; proposed to cater to the tastes of some low-level people in Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most analysts point out that although the majority of the Argentine public may not really believe that Millais can &quot;cure all diseases&quot;, given the negative impact of left-wing Peronism in the past Having won 10 out of 13 general elections, the left wing has already overdrafted the trust and patience of voters, while the traditional right wing has failed to reverse the situation in the last two elections. Therefore, &quot;since other methods don&#39;t work, we might as well try strong medicine.&quot; This kind of &quot;maybe it might work&quot; thinking quickly became popular, and allowed Millay, who had participated in a &quot;copycat&quot; Rolling Stones band and was familiar with the way of pop success, to win the presidency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts pointed out that after Millais suddenly emerged in the primary election, the government used a propaganda machine to &quot;demonize&quot; him in a panic, which was counterproductive. Some works intended to arouse public panic about Milley&#39;s administration (such as claiming that Milley&#39;s public spending cuts will cause the Buenos Aires metro ticket to rise to 1,100 pesos, while the current price is only 56 pesos) have actually done the government a disservice because The public can easily associate this with the soaring prices, and be led away by Milley&#39;s propaganda that &quot;the government spends money indiscriminately like this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some local observers pointed out that Millais carefully created the image of a &quot;political outsider&quot; and successfully attracted a large number of grassroots votes under the banner of &quot;understanding the sufferings of the people&quot; and &quot;opposing nepotism&quot;, but his The image of &quot;grassroots spokesperson&quot; is carefully created by a group of the richest people in Argentina: billionaire Eduardo Eurnekian is one of Millay&#39;s most important supporters, and the media network &quot;A24&quot; he controls is Millay&#39;s The main shaper and promoter of successful political public relations images, and successfully &quot;killed&quot; the mediocre public media in a series of dazzling combinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The right-wing’s decisive choice after the first round is a tactical key: Patricia Bullrich, also a far-right but “relatively less right” candidate, won the primary election as “ The slogan &quot;Anti-high crime rate&quot; competed with Millais&#39;s snipe and clam, and won 23.81% of the votes in the first round, ranking third after Massa and Millais. After the first round, Milley decisively stopped his criticism of Burridge, who quickly announced his support for Milley after weighing the pros and cons. In fact, Milley&#39;s vote share in the second round (55.7%) was the same as in the first round. The combined votes of Millais and Burridge (53.90%) were about the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cdRisNIh3HwbGLwcb0IvcmMiztRxeqzryQU7RPLV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cdRisNIh3HwbGLwcb0IvcmMiztRxeqzryQU7RPLV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, Massa, candidate of Argentina&#39;s center-left ruling coalition Fatherland, gave a speech after voting at a polling station in Tigre, Buenos Aires Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Civil and military officials and the &quot;prime minister in black&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Because of the political party to which Milai belongs It is too small and the core team is not large.

However, core cabinet members will still try to arrange confidants and like-minded people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among them, the foreign minister has been identified as Diana Mondino, who co-founded the &quot;Free Progress Party&quot; with him. She and Milai were both &quot;Argentine Olympic team members&quot;; she was convicted of helping Argentina in 1996. Mariano Cuno Libarona, a celebrity lawyer and TV commentator who became famous after winning a drug-related lawsuit, will become the new attorney general.

After turning over half the ministries and the central bank, this is not only overkill. As a smaller ruling party, it is not conducive to discussing the personnel of the allies and arranging allies. Before the second round of voting, he had a low profile that he would &quot;keep the contract signed with Chinese companies&quot;, and many analysts pointed out that his &quot;national Olympic&quot; economic and financial strategy relies on overseas financing, but in the United States, regardless of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, None of the interest in Argentina, who has long been reputable for Golden aid (Interestingly, the congratulations to his elected Trump, who admired him, publicly opposed to continue to provide financing for Argentina for convenient American politicians), messed up The relationship with China, China, China, China may not have any benefits for Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, he has publicly threatened to visit the United States, for the first time after being elected, and worship a number of Jewish leaders (he once claimed to convert to Jewish religion), but recently lowered the tone because the latest people have The tone shows that the mainstream public opinion in Argentina is very interested in the US dollar, but it is too close to the country to make the country too close to Israel, especially to make the president&#39;s &quot;Jewishization&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Almost destined commitments that will not be fulfilled include attacking the Pope (apologized before the second round of voting), &quot;everyone holding a gun&quot; (the first round of voting is discarded because of the reversal of the polls), the medical and private ownership Hua and large -scale reduction of public welfare (the polls have been sharply reduced after the strong reversal), and &quot;to give Malaysia Island to Britain&quot; -The campaign of most allies within the alliance to publicly oppose it. Several Malaysian war veterans reacted fiercely, and public opinion feedback was not ideal. He has rarely mentioned recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are also some promises to observe or be observed. The most prominent is &quot;abandoning the local currency to use the US dollar&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Some analysts believe that, given that Argentina has long been cited at home and abroad at home and abroad, and Argentina companies and ordinary people have actually begun to use the US dollar, the &quot;currency dollar&quot; resistance is actually not as big as imagined as big as expected. In addition, the public&#39;s complaints about &quot;the government has made a rising and poverty through the money printing&quot;, and this move is also expected to gather popularity in a short period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But most analysts, such as the chief emerging market economist William Jackson and Zurich&#39;s investment group manager of Zuri Larose, chief emerging market economist, believes that the situation believes that the situation is that the situation It is not that simple: Argentina is the third largest economy in Latin America. The abandonment of the US dollar in the US dollar means giving up the control of independent fiscal and financial policies, the &quot;financial colonization&quot; of its country, and allowing the Federal Reserve to control Argentina&#39;s economy. For setbacks, the public emotions are easily reversed in the Latin American environment, which makes the initials of the policy that put forward this policy into a shortage situation. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Not only that, because of the poor credit reporting of Argentina&#39;s international credit, it is unknown whether the Fed that has become &quot;priority in the United States&quot; in recent years. They also pointed out that &quot;currency dollars&quot; may control the rise, but they cannot solve Argentina&#39;s fiscal predicament, and the latter is the foundation of Argentina&#39;s economic and financial predicament. In fact, in the speech, Miller did avoid the slogans that had repeatedly shouted before and again before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is unknown whether the privatization of the public service industry and the privatization of large state -owned enterprises, because refusal to fulfill the promise offending many voters and continue to bear heavy financial burdens, but it will definitely cause &quot;smashing&quot; but it will definitely cause it. The violent social turmoil, how to choose, is difficult to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are two recognitions that are not listed in the campaign commitment, but they must do: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One is to try the reorganization of international debt again. Therefore, the sound of not the same thing is because the left wing is also doing this when the left wing is in power; Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is likely to be sent to court and even prison after steps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many analysts believe that, given that the party affiliated to Miller is only 10%of the seats in the Argentine Senate, only 5%in the House of Representatives, and the &quot;Common Transformation Alliance&quot; is still a minority of parliament, and rice is also rice, and rice is also rice, and rice is also rice, and rice, and rice, and rice Laiben was also very unrealistic in the parliament (it is said that he only participated in the co -signs of a draft law during his time as a member of the parliament), and many of his too radical and highly controversial campaign commitments will face different degrees of &quot;discount dumping&quot; in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 09:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[融创完成900亿元债务重组，保交楼压力仍在]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261096]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A real estate project in Sunac Beijing.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 18 months, Sunac China (01918.HK) fully resolved the debt risk of approximately 90 billion yuan, and completed all domestic and overseas debt restructuring. The real estate industry ushered in the first large-scale real estate company to complete debt restructuring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 20, 2023, Sunac issued an announcement announcing that all conditions for overseas debt restructuring had been met and it officially took effect on that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement, creditors’ existing debt of approximately US$10 billion will be replaced with new notes, mandatory convertible bonds, convertible bonds, and shares of Sunac Services (01516.HK) at a consideration of 57 respectively. US$1 billion, US$2.75 billion, US$1 billion, US$775 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, three products: new notes, mandatory convertible bonds, and convertible bonds are expected to be listed on the SGX on November 21; Sunac Services shares have been transferred to the account of the plan creditors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the second half of 2021, more than 50 listed real estate companies have initiated debt restructuring. In May 2022, Sunac defaulted on its debt and completed domestic debt restructuring at the end of that year. &quot;In the next stage, the company&#39;s focus will be on the Baojiao Building.&quot; A Sunac insider told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Sunac can still be saved”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Information provided by the above-mentioned insiders shows that after the restructuring of Sunac’s overseas debt, it has reduced its debt by approximately US$4.5 billion (over 30 billion yuan) scale, the annual debt repayment pressure has dropped by nearly 2.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the debt restructuring, Sunac’s first extended note matures in September 2025. At the same time, the company has the right to extend it for one year. After the extension, it will mature in September 2026, providing the company with Breathing window in the past 3 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the company can choose to pay interest in kind in the first two years. In the first year, the interest can be fully capitalized. In the second year, the company can choose to support only 2% cash interest (the remaining part of the interest is capitalized), which reduces The company’s overseas cash repayment pressure within two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned insiders said that the restructuring plan won the support of more than 98% of the creditor&#39;s rights and more than 99% of the creditors at the creditors&#39; meeting in September 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng, president of the China Urban Real Estate Research Institute, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the debt conversion of real estate enterprises usually requires the help of third parties, such as the intervention of financial institutions, central state-owned enterprises, overseas capital, etc., and the pledge of equity, land, etc. , protecting the principal and interest income of creditors. This way you can get an extension and avoid liquidation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the overseas debt restructuring telephone briefing on March 29, 2023, Sunac Executive Director and CEO Wang Mengde introduced that some loan extension projects are actively seeking support from banks and other financial institutions, and introducing AMC ( Asset management companies) and other third-party funds solve difficult-to-extend financing such as trusts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sunac’s official WeChat account, six banks led by Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China Huarong (02799.HK), and CITIC Trust jointly injected capital into Sunac’s Shanghai Dongjiadu project, with a scale of over 12 billion yuan, the first Funding will be completed in January 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned insiders said that since 2022, Sunac has received a total of 19 billion yuan in bailout funds, and has carried out extensive cooperation with AMC, obtaining more than 20 billion yuan in new financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng believes that Sunac&#39;s successful debt restructuring reflects the fact that creditors and third-party institutions believe that &quot;Sunac can still be saved&quot; after evaluating its assets and debt situation. Confidence in the real estate market. Compared with other explosive real estate companies, Sunac&#39;s debt scale is relatively small and its asset quality is higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in his view, Sunac’s debt restructuring has limited reference significance for other real estate companies. Since the assets and liabilities of each real estate company are different, it needs to be evaluated on a &quot;one house, one policy&quot; basis. For example, Country Garden (02007.HK), Sino-Ocean Group (03377.HK), Gemdale Group (600383.SH) and other real estate companies that are also facing debt pressure have failed to apply for extension. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The annual guaranteed delivery target is 300,000 units&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the completion of debt restructuring only means that Sunac has eliminated short-term debt risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after the window period ends, Sunac still faces challenges. &quot;As long as the real estate market does not recover and the company does not receive payment from sales, there may be a default on debts such as commercial bills,&quot; Xie Yifeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that Sunac is currently only extending domestic and overseas bank loans, bonds, etc., but the scale of commercial bills to pay for the project is still large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunac’s 2023 interim report shows that as of June 30, 2023, the company’s trade and other payables were 274.1 billion yuan, and contract liabilities were 292.6 billion yuan. This means that Sunac owes nearly 600 billion yuan to suppliers and owners of uncollected properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng analyzed that in an environment where real estate is down and the market is cold, in order to solve this level of debt risk, companies can only adopt three options: extension, using housing as payment, or introducing new shareholders to cooperate in development. Way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The primary focus of the next step is to speed up sales collection.” Xie Yifeng said that once there is a problem with sales collection, it is easy to have problems such as arrears in project payments and commercial invoice defaults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 22, 2023, Sunac issued an announcement that the company was included in the list of persons subject to enforcement for dishonesty, which showed that Sunac had eight breaches of trust, involving a face value of approximately 6.6175 million yuan, interest losses, litigation costs, etc. , the reason is that commercial bills of varying amounts have expired and have not been paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng believes that after debt restructuring, real estate companies still need to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. While developing financing channels, we should deal with negative assets, reduce scale, reduce land acquisition, and reduce pressure on the capital chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Sunac insiders said that the company’s consideration is to invest more funds and manpower in the guaranteed building in the window period of 2-3 years after the debt restructuring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As of October, we have delivered 205,000 units, ranking second in the industry.” He said that the company’s goal in 2023 is to deliver 300,000 units, and the task in 2024 is equivalent to this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in the last two months of 2023, Sunac still has the task of delivering nearly 100,000 houses. The insider admitted that &lt;span>; the company is still facing delivery pressure and is using multiple financing channels to ease financial pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[直击人性底线，大逃杀王者回归]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261053]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;Eleven years ago, &quot;Hunger&quot; The main trilogy of &quot;Game&quot; (four films in total) has become popular all over the world, with a cumulative box office of nearly 3 billion.

There is a saying: &quot;If you knew me before, you might forgive me now.&quot; If you know the young Snow, you may have a little more understanding of the old Snow. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The prequel did not whitewash Snow, but it did catalyze the audience&#39;s pity for him, especially under the performance of Tom Bryce, the 18-year-old Snow Appear handsome, proud and lovable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/baf3f171b7660a5eb3dfa2f5f3ee1907.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1035&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/baf3f171b7660a5eb3dfa2f5f3ee1907.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259109 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Snow is the son of a general in the capital, but after his father&#39;s early death, the family fell into a dilemma. He, his cousin and his grandmother depended on each other in an empty mansion, and their lives were stretched thin. Under the empty noble title. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The opening of the movie is an important day when the school awards scholarships. With excellent grades, he is bound to win. As long as he gets the money, he can go to college. But he can wear school uniforms on ordinary days, but not on important days. He lacks a piece of clothing that he can use. Fortunately, my cousin was very ingenious. She first treated the yellowed old shirt with a curtain bleaching agent, and then used small pieces of bathroom tiles to make new buttons. Snow, who goes out with his head held high, is as confident and arrogant as Scarlett who sews clothes with curtain cloth in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/92320b533d447c6d8c7ddbe810700e0f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/92320b533d447c6d8c7ddbe810700e0f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259111 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He talked with his classmates from the aristocratic school and explained that he was sweating because the driver failed to take him to the school gate, and that he skipped tea and snacks because he had eaten steak early in the morning. (and threw away half of it), and together with his classmates from the old-money class, he despised the upstart classmates who moved to the capital from the second district. In just a few minutes, an image of a person who hides his inferiority with arrogance, is determined to win everything, and is accustomed to bluffing appears on the page. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Unfortunately, things did not go as smoothly as Snow had imagined. The rules of the scholarship were changed, and the talented people were assigned as mentors in the Hunger Games. Only those who led the tributes to win the game could receive them. scholarship. Due to personal grudges between his parents, Snow was assigned to a lesser tribute - Lucy, who seemed completely unlikely to win. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/472fb5140a0ad446ff37759721516cf0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/472fb5140a0ad446ff37759721516cf0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259113 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Snow is good at accepting facts, observing world affairs and perceiving people&#39;s hearts. He quickly formulated a battle plan: perform in front of the camera and use public opinion to build momentum as much as possible. We may still remember that in the main story of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, Katniss and Pete pretended to be a couple to gain support from the people of the capital. The essence of reality shows has always been &quot;show&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Snow personally&lt;/span>; picked up Lucy at the train station, gave her roses, held hands with her in the zoo cage, and gave her food supplies. Encourage her to sing for the camera. Lucy, who was born as a minstrel, is also well versed in the rules of performance and is good at using singing to express emotions and ridicule rules. They are a perfect partner in the true sense, so it is very natural to have a little illusion of love under the suspension bridge effect. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/799efcc36f7d301c4a587e684443f2f6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;950&quot; height=&quot;633&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/799efcc36f7d301c4a587e684443f2f6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259114 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; is divided into three chapters. The first two chapters focus on the Hunger Games themselves, but the end of Lucy&#39;s game is the beginning of Snow&#39;s game. , he faces the fate of his unscrupulous game. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Snow always lands on &amp;nbsp;top&quot; (Snow/Snow always falls on top) is Snow&#39;s personal creed, and this motto also implies his It&#39;s his destiny, so he will deviate from the track for a while, but once he has the opportunity, he will definitely find a way to turn around. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/45eb4ec796af6d3bace886ead45e02d0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/45eb4ec796af6d3bace886ead45e02d0.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259112 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is not comprehensive enough to summarize &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; as &quot;the history of Snow&#39;s transformation&quot;. The slogan on the title page of the novel &quot;From a handsome boy to a president, Snow The description of &quot;what a price was paid&quot; is also worthy of scrutiny. Judging from the information conveyed in the film, Snowburn is an ambitious, ruthless, paranoid, sensitive and powerful egoist. In the process of betraying his friends and abandoning his lover, he gradually tore off the mask of elegance and respectability, buried the compassion of the young man, and finally returned to his true self. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/d84e8f7ed303a2dcec5795c8f77bd148.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1036&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/d84e8f7ed303a2dcec5795c8f77bd148.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259115 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The successful portrayal of Snow is the biggest highlight of &quot;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. His character arc in one movie even exceeds that of Kegnis in four movies. The latter is already a character carefully portrayed in commercial blockbusters. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Otherwise, however, &quot;Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; is lackluster. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Let’s talk about the controversial heroine first. New actress Rachel Ziegler is good at singing. She won the Golden Globe Award for &quot;West Side Story&quot; and is also a new version. The heroine of &quot;Snow White&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;, she sang well, but her acting skills were &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;speak&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; barely watchable&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , and the gap between her and the male protagonist in the affectionate scene is extremely obvious&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;It’s not that the audience &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is harsh, but compared with Jennifer Lawrence, she does still have a long way to go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/23d52c2f9a95d02fa380f7b0c909cbac.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;245&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/23d52c2f9a95d02fa380f7b0c909cbac.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259116 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/68fdf8e7c843b4f6df1bb52a55e95b42.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 545 &quot;height =&quot; 243 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/68e7c843b4F652A52a52.gif &quot;Data- Key = &quot;259117&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;(The picture shows a comparison of the same action)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;About the game Setting, obviously the 74th Hunger Games depicted in the first part of the sequel is the best. Both the pre-game preparation and the actual combat are full of ingenuity, allowing the audience to feast their eyes on the visual spectacle. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10th Hunger Games in &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; was quite simple. It was still an indoor game in a stadium, which made the action scenes that the series is proud of completely absent. No room for display. After watching the game, all I remember is that a group of tributes finished the game in a hurry, offering their heads one by one without any highlights. Audiences looking for the thrill of a battle royale game may be disappointed, because the movie is quite restrained in its presentation of spectacles such as killing and violence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/86f56582524ffc2bd8dc4cc7acd95bc6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/86f56582524ffc2bd8dc4cc7acd95bc6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259118 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the other hand, the reflections on reality shows and the discussion of revolution in the main trilogy are nowhere to be found in &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. This may be the filmmaker&#39;s strategy to avoid repeating itself, but it also blocks the possibility of the text digging deeper into derivatives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/9a1b5b6d556ed3df4774259cc065da4c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/9a1b5b6d556ed3df4774259cc065da4c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259119 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Therefore, if you are looking for the critical and gaming experience of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series in the movie, you may be disappointed. But if you are interested in character stories, you can still watch it. &quot;Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; does have some subtle touches in this regard, which makes people suddenly moved by the foreshadowing of fate. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;When old President Snow sees the rebellious girl Katniss from District 12 singing &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, will he think of his youth?
