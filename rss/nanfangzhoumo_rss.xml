Recently, videos of young people from many places “commuting to get off work in electric wheelchairs” have appeared on social media, sparking heated discussions. Suddenly, accessibility became an issue of public concern and in urgent need of “management.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I really don’t understand how the topic ‘Young people focus on electric wheelchairs’ became so popular.” Zhao Hongcheng, an accessibility evaluation video blogger, expressed his doubts. As a former product manager of a major manufacturer, Zhao Hongcheng expressed his doubts. , she thinks this is obviously a marketing tool for businesses, &quot;Can you go out 100 meters in an electric wheelchair? Can people drive here? Open your eyes and take a look at the barrier-free facilities here. Let people who should go out first be able to go out. , and then think about how to &#39;manage&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/uGJx4Wh4nUQk9YhMNtxKakJusCqNwtUHVsim7EIP.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/uGJx4Wh4nUQk9YhMNtxKakJusCqNwtUHVsim7EIP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250533&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/250873&quot; title=&quot;The story of wheelchair girl Zhao Hongcheng &quot;Accessibility&quot; drama: Do I make you nervous? &quot;>;Wheelchair girl Zhao Hongcheng&#39;s &quot;Accessibility&quot; drama: Do I make you nervous? &lt;/a>; 》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Hongcheng contracted polio when she was 1 year old and was in a wheelchair when she was in middle school. Today, she is quite skilled in wheelchair driving. She has been releasing videos on city accessibility assessments since 2019. After resigning from the Internet industry two years ago, she turned into a full-time video blogger. The video she produced, &quot;Black and Red List of Barrier-free Facilities,&quot; was once on Weibo&#39;s hot search list. So far, she has released more than a hundred urban accessibility assessment videos, covering Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Macau, and Taiwan, showing the daily life and travel obstacles encountered by people with disabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Disabled Persons&#39; Federation shows that as of 2022, the total number of disabled people in China will reach more than 85 million, accounting for more than 6% of the total population. However, they are rarely seen in public places. On June 28, 2023, the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress voted to pass the Barrier-free Environment Construction Law. This law will come into effect on September 1, 2023. On March 1, 2023, the &quot;Shanghai Barrier-free Environment Construction Regulations&quot; came into effect. More and more people are aware of the importance of barrier-free environment construction, but it is not easy for the city&#39;s supporting system to keep up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a Shanghai accessibility evaluation video, when Zhao Hongcheng and her husband went to watch a talk show, they asked the theater staff about the location of the accessible toilets. The staff suggested that you can use diapers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Hongcheng believes that for-profit cultural and artistic venues such as art exhibitions and theaters are the &quot;hardest hit areas&quot; for accessibility. &quot;It seems that as a disabled person, you can confidently make demands when traveling on the subway, but in terms of cultural enjoyment, your confidence will be much weaker.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the evaluation video, Zhao Hongcheng still tried Go swimming, go to Disney, go to Universal Studios, and document it on video. The inconvenience of legs and feet should not ultimately constitute difficulties in the entire living system of the disabled group because the city&#39;s supporting facilities are not in place. She hopes to promote the construction of barrier-free facilities in the country, and also hopes to bring people with disabilities, a long-marginalized social group, into the spotlight, be seen and have their own voice. &quot;Sometimes when I go out and walk on the street, I can find out from many people&#39;s expressions and questions that I am the first person in a wheelchair they have seen in their lives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 In May, the one-man drama &quot;Where is the nearest barrier-free toilet?&quot; based on Zhao Hongcheng. ” was staged at the Shanghai Grand Theater. It is the first domestic drama adapted from real people with disabilities. The first row of seats under the stage has been opened up as barrier-free wheelchair seats. Audiences in wheelchairs are seated in every performance, including 20 audience members in wheelchairs in one performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the stage, Zhao Hongcheng uses a dramatic performance to present her travel difficulties. Her daily travel is sometimes like an urban adventure: car horns, bus announcements, chaotic voices, and cars passing by. Amidst the noise, she drove her wheelchair around the city, not knowing which direction would be less obstructed. No matter how early she left her home, she was always late. Those praises for &quot;self-improvement&quot;, the prying eyes of strangers, the &quot;good intentions&quot; of others doing good, and the selective ignorance on more occasions... &quot;It seems that I always need to be constantly grateful.&quot; said Zhao Hongcheng, the lead actor in the drama and the prototype of the story. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Of all my expectations for this drama project, the most important point is that I need to make this happen. I want a story about people with disabilities to be staged in the theater.&quot; Successive dramas After the performance, Zhao Hongcheng felt that he finally had his own voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This drama will be performed in Beijing on September 16. Zhao Hongcheng still pays attention to all information about barrier-free access on the Internet, and directly expresses his attitude towards some inexplicable pity, &quot;Give up being condescending and give up false concern, we should be friends!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打开神圣的脑袋，然后看到酸奶？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258555]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/guTmGuLhlDxsn6PvXLncoSm5LIiFtvTXlHrYe9hK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/guTmGuLhlDxsn6PvXLncoSm5LIiFtvTXlH rYe9hK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254029&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2019, a craniotomy in Texas, USA. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I sometimes think of a boy I met in the hospital. He leaned at the window to check in and tried to pay a hefty deposit using WeChat. I asked the middle-aged woman behind me if I should line up behind her. She didn&#39;t quite understand and seemed a little timid. She was guarding a wheelchair that looked like an Iron Throne. There was a long metal rod sticking out of the back of the chair, and something seemed to be hanging on the top. There was a lot of luggage piled on the seat of the chair. The owner must have been transferred from out of town for medical treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The child was unable to pay the fee for a while, but fortunately the staff did not get upset and suggested him to check the limit in a business-like manner. His bones were obviously deformed, his back was severely twisted, and his skull was covered with a metal band. Thick metal wires are twisted at different locations on the hoop, and the one in the middle above the head is particularly tall. Looking at his back, he looks like an adult suffering from bone disease. After he paid the fee and turned around, I determined that he was a child slightly over ten years old. The woman and him should be mother and son, and the extra-sturdy wheelchair was probably made especially for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a while while waiting to be admitted, I met the boy again. Because of the epidemic, the seats had to be spaced apart, so they were almost occupied, so I walked around to him. He pointed to the only empty seat next to him and made a friendly &quot;please sit down&quot; gesture. A child at such a young age is subjected to severe torture and yet appears to be sensible and self-respecting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With his mother by his side, he can take care of his daily life, but the paperwork involved probably won’t be of much help. The boy has to try for himself and slowly digest the good, evil and bleakness of the world. During the nucleic acid test, we talked about the child and became sad. I said he might be an astronaut, and now he has an antenna that can receive signals from outside. Hopefully it was a passable good-natured joke and he was actually memorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we were admitted to the hospital, I never met him again. It was only after I was discharged from the hospital that I determined that those steel brackets were specially used to help correct the bones. A few days ago, when I was about to finish reading &quot;Craniotomy: A Collection of Medical Stories that &quot;Turn on the Nerves&quot;&quot;, I found an illustration of a headband vest in the book, which was very similar to the system I saw two years ago. The Chinese version of this book was published in August 2023, and the original English version was published about a year ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Weird thing in my head&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The hospitalization was upgraded to a craniotomy at another hospital. I had a very large &quot;left middle cerebral artery aneurysm&quot; in my head that was compressing the left temporal lobe, which is responsible for language. I always think of the title of Pamuk&#39;s book &quot;The Strange Thing in My Head&quot;. The &quot;strange thing&quot; that belongs to me is like a pigeon egg. Its size and location are very rare. I don&#39;t know when it started growing secretly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am now particularly interested in patients, stories and social news about cerebrovascular diseases. People with cerebral hemorrhage are always racing against time, experiencing severe headaches they have never experienced before, and the most unfortunate people are experiencing the last days of their lives. In the news, people around them often don’t realize what is happening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above are the reasons why I am particularly interested in &quot;Craniotomy&quot;. The author, Jay Wellens, is the chief physician of pediatric neurosurgery who has performed thousands of various surgeries. There are only 250 practicing physicians in this subspecialty in North America. He has mastered the art of performing neurosurgery on fetuses in the womb, helping them live healthy lives from birth. If the boy I met was so lucky, he would no longer face endless pain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Craniotomy&quot; does not have a strict main line. From time to time, he recalled his father who suffered from ALS. He was in his last year of medical school and &quot;about to embark on an extraordinary residency career&quot; when he discovered his father was ill. His father passed away suddenly a year later, which naturally made him empathize with the patients&#39; families. Nothing is closer to human nature than life and death, and fragmentary stories also contain huge spiritual power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of his 15th year of practice, Dr. Wellens rescued a three-year-old boy who suffered a gunshot wound. He studied creative writing and calmly described the tragedy of the scene:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the emergency, the breathing tube was fixed OK, the infusion tube has also been left in place. The boy&#39;s head was covered with half-coagulated blood, which pooled under his head and dripped to the ground like wax. As the crowd gathered around him, the bloody footprints became larger and larger. People came and went, holding bulging intravenous blood transfusion bags or saline, and syringes filled with medicine, all trying to help him stabilize. blood pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emergency rooms are always cruel. The child&#39;s head is beyond recognition and blood gushes out from several points on the edge of the bone. Wellens devotes three-quarters of a page to describing the tense situation, and it takes him only two seconds to see it all. It is a brain with a sophisticated structure (the author describes it as &quot;sacred&quot;). The feat in the eyes of readers is taken for granted by doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wellens participated in an operation to treat newborn twins who were joined at the back of their heads. They were born extremely premature and one of the children was in critical condition due to intestinal necrosis. The doctors decided to perform emergency separation, cut the skin, opened the skull and dura mater, and everything went well. But on the third hour of the operation, they suddenly suffered a massive hemorrhage, and eventually all blood flow stopped. He would always remember crying as he resewed the twins back together to give his parents a chance to hold them again. &quot;We should have sacrificed one to save the other, but we wanted to save both, and both died.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Wellens also wrote about mentors who died young and angry patients. Family members, testimonies for victims of quackery, and paranoia about their children’s medical conditions. Along with some less dramatic scenes, he draws inspiration from everyday life. On the one hand, it reflects his wisdom, on the other hand, it is simply the power brought by medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two stories that impressed me deeply. They are both humorous and moving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wellens often answers questions from adults and children: What does the brain look like? He would answer: &quot;Like yogurt. Creamy vanilla-flavored yogurt.&quot; Then add: &quot;Like very thick yogurt, the kind where the spoon can stand upright in it.&quot; Everyone&#39;s reaction is likely to be: Oh, this topic That&#39;s it for now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, he went on to expertly describe the land flowing with milk and honey he saw after the craniotomy:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is a sight that not many people have seen before. It will seem strange at first, and the surface of the moon was no different to its early visitors. But unlike the lunar surface, which is a barren gray, the surface of the human brain is awash with color and luster, full of dimension and depth. It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the sudden brightness. The surface of the brain is very smooth, indeed cream-colored, with only a faint hint of yellow. It shines under the reflection of the microscope...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another story happened when he was chief resident. He often goes to the department director late at night to &quot;check the list&quot; to understand the patient&#39;s condition and then arrange the next treatment plan. One night, he saw the director outside the office carefully flipping through an anatomy textbook and reviewing the parts for tomorrow&#39;s surgery. Next, he also reviewed anatomy during the final hours of the night before surgery. &quot;This has become a ritual.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Lost Day&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Including anesthesia time, my own surgery took about fourteen hours , there will always be a shallow trench left on the left side of the head. I call this day &quot;The Lost Day.&quot; So I read craniotomy cases very carefully, looking for clues that lasted more than ten hours. I didn&#39;t understand before how the skull opened and in what direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the endearing things is what Wellens said: &quot;I removed my first aneurysm and passed the rite of passage as a surgical resident.&quot; I couldn&#39;t fully understand what he explained again and again. nervous system. However, when I saw that the Latin name of dura mater means &quot;strong mother&quot;, the shock of discovering the truth was beyond words, like a wake-up call. By the way, the English words &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;patient&quot; come from the Latin words &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;patient&quot; respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing I heard when I woke up was the intern doctor chatting with his colleagues, saying that I was a reporter, and talking about their overtime wages. The operating table was a little bumpy as it left the elevator, and I fell asleep again. When I woke up, I was in the ICU, a hall-like place with curtains, and occasionally people walking around. When the nurse was about to leave work, I bled a lot. I fell asleep and woke up alternately. Early in the morning, an elderly doctor took off my oxygen tube. There are equipment such as shadowless lights set up above the hospital bed, much like an operating room. I asked a nurse on patrol if the equipment was real. She turned her head and looked up, but did not answer the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are these all true? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next step was edema from surgery. My appearance was beyond recognition and frightened some people close to me. I couldn&#39;t use my phone anymore, and I couldn&#39;t type a grammatical sentence into my phone. Over and over, each five-minute round, I surrendered in frustration. Emoji has become one of the greatest inventions in the world. These simple and crude symbols have become the only communication channel between you and the distant place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, I started watching the second season of &quot;Secret Forest&quot; on my iPad. Sometimes I even felt that I could understand Korean, but I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between reading the subtitles and listening to the dialogue. Don’t forget, this season is about the struggle between prosecutors and police that may be difficult for Korean viewers to understand. I often mention this hallucination for fun. Needless to say, it was really a surprise at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days after the surgery I read the autobiography of neurologist Oliver Sacks, and in those pages it seemed like he was coming out. I turned the autobiography to the cover and showed it to Sun Liyong, the visiting surgeon, to show how amazing my recovery was. But I gave up halfway and never opened this book again after I was discharged from hospital. I have long been fond of Sachs’s books that explore the mysteries of brain nerves, and I should continue to read them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I opened the book, it turned out that what I read was the third chapter &quot;Wolf Boy&quot;. The beginning of the paragraph is unruly:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In broad daylight, I am the friendly Dr. Sachs in white robe;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But when night falls, I will take off my white robe, put on my motorcycle leather jacket, and remain anonymous.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sneaking out of the hospital like a wolf, wandering the streets, or riding the winding roads up Mount Tamalpais,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then, under the moonlight, we drove all the way to Stinson Beach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After discharge, there will be language training and hyperbaric oxygen inhalation. The oxygen chamber is like a submarine. Administrators and doctors can see people taking oxygen through small round windows. There was a bald man who would laugh involuntarily, laughing endlessly, contagiously making everyone laugh. There was no sound when he laughed. Think of the scene in the movie where the sound suddenly disappears and everyone only opens their mouths but cannot hear the words. I can&#39;t remember how the man stopped. He was usually silent and had not yet recovered from his stroke. It was his wife who spoke, telling how his cerebrovascular disease recurred many years after its onset. She and the other wives have always shown extraordinary steadfastness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I took oxygen, I often went to a New Element restaurant to eat salads and drink juice, and got to know the staff. However, this comforting restaurant closed down during the epidemic. There were sixty nails driven into my head, the shape of which looked like staples. After a while, a serious and professional nurse removed them, thirty pills at a time. After tearing off the tape on my head, I shivered for about half a minute, probably like a calf trembling when it is born. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first scene of aphasia became increasingly blurry, and the &quot;strange thing&quot; was discovered a year later. The words in my head were very clear and grammatical, but what came out of my mouth was just a meaningless sound of Ulu Uru. Does it sound like a crow? During the period when my aphasia became more and more frequent, I whispered &quot;Eat grapes without spitting out grape skins&quot; from time to time to test whether I could speak normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long after surgery, fear occasionally strikes. It is invisible and fades quickly. Anyway, those brave young people in &quot;Open Skull&quot; are definitely my role models. When I see aneurysm patients in books and in real life, I will secretly identify them as the same kind. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;His soul also slowly lost consciousness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Jerome Groopman recalled in his book review for The New Yorker The work of doctors. From pediatrician Perry Klass&#39;s memoir about the life of a medical student, &quot;Not Completely Benign Surgery,&quot; to British surgeon Henry Marsh&#39;s self-analysis of the mistakes he made during his more than thirty years of practice, &quot;The Doctor&#39;s Choice.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, &quot;Craniotomy&quot; written by Wellens when he was practicing medicine for more than 20 years can be placed between these two books. Interestingly, Marsh is also skilled in neurosurgery and adheres to the self-requirement of &quot;Strictly Do No Harm&quot; (that is, the English version of the book is titled, Do No Harm). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Undoubtedly, the brain is the key to human beings. Medicine, on the other hand, clearly connects life and death, humanity, and pain, and its connections to other things are less straightforward but not unexpected, such as literature. The combination of medicine and literature is so fascinating that Wellens begins the book with a quote from &quot;The Dead&quot; in &quot;Dublins&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;He listened to the snow falling softly everywhere in the world, falling softly, just as they fell towards their final destination, falling on all the living and the dead; his soul also slowly fell. Slowly lost consciousness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the aforementioned conjoined twins who tragically died, Groopman thought of Richard Selzer&#39;s short story &quot;Imelda.&quot; Seltzer, a surgeon and author, was &quot;one of the first physicians to understand the power of writing and reading novels in medicine&quot; and had mentored John Irving. In the novel, a cold, arrogant and perfectionist American surgeon goes to Honduras on a charity mission and plans to operate on Imelda, a girl with a cleft palate, but the girl dies of anesthesia complications before the operation. The doctor sneaked into the morgue at night and completed the operation on the corpse so that the mother could bury her daughter after treatment. Doctors are left devastated and unable to recover from unsatisfactory results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, Wellens accepted the encouragement from his mentors and friends, got over his frustrations, and understood human limitations. You can&#39;t do everything, but you can understand your limitations and do better. In addition to serving as an attending physician, he also obtained a master&#39;s degree in epidemiology. “This degree opened up a whole new dimension in my life, and I started to study the disparities in care received by children in neurosurgery based on race, socioeconomic status and gender.” At the same time, he also focused on the proliferation of guns, vaccine skepticism and many other social issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rita Cullen, professor of internal medicine at Columbia University, proposed the concept of &quot;narrative medicine&quot;, which is medicine practiced by clinicians with narrative abilities. Narrative competence is the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by stories about illness. Groopman singles out two doctor&#39;s short stories, Chekhov&#39;s &quot;The House Call&quot; and William Carlos Williams&#39;s &quot;The Girl with Acne,&quot; that explore the interaction between patients and their surroundings. Of course, Chinese readers should more easily think of Lu Xun, who &quot;abandoned medicine to pursue literature.&quot; Doctors keenly observe and accurately express the truth of the world, inviting the public to think, and extending individual changes to the entire society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day when I was writing this book review, I accidentally discovered Dr. Sun’s Douyin account that popularizes medical knowledge, and I watched it one by one for a long time. In addition to short videos about clinics and cases, he also blessed college entrance examination candidates and talked about the long road medical students will face. When I was about to leave the clinic after a follow-up consultation, he mentioned the German drama &quot;Charité Hospital&quot; he had watched. On the eve of returning to the bustling corridor, I seemed to have received an Easter egg from the doctor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2024国考明起开始报名，共计划招录3.96万人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258599]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 10:43:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the National Civil Service Bureau that registration for civil servants to be recruited for the 2024 examinations of central agencies and their directly affiliated agencies is about to begin. It plans to recruit 39,600 people. Candidates can log in to the &quot;Special Website for Civil Servants Recruited for the 2024 Examination of Central Agencies and Their Directly Affiliated Agencies&quot; from 8:00 on October 15 to 18:00 on October 24 (http://bm.scs.gov.cn/kl2024) Register online and the public subject written examination will be held simultaneously on November 26 in all municipalities, provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals and some larger cities across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recruitment of civil servants in this examination mainly has three characteristics: First, political standards should be put first and the political requirements of newly recruited personnel should be highlighted. Among them, the content of the written test and interview highlights the political attributes of civil servants, focusing on testing the ability to use the party&#39;s innovative theory to guide analysis and problem solving; testing comprehensively understands the candidates&#39; morality, ability, diligence, performance, and integrity, focusing on understanding political quality and moral conduct , compliance with laws and regulations, etc. Politically unqualified candidates will not be hired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that recruitment policies and recruitment plans are tilted towards grassroots front-line workers and college graduates. Set up 26,000 plans specifically to recruit fresh college graduates, serve and promote the employment of college graduates. Nearly 27,000 plans have been supplemented to directly-affiliated agencies at the county (district) level and below. The application conditions for grassroots positions in difficult and remote areas will be appropriately adjusted based on actual conditions such as academic qualifications, majors, working years and experience, so as to further enrich the grassroots civil servants. More than 3,000 targeted recruitment programs have been set up to serve grassroots project personnel and retired soldiers who have served in the military for more than 5 years as college graduates, encouraging and guiding talents to flow to the grassroots and actively participate in national defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to adhere to classified examinations for recruitment. The examination content is set according to the characteristics of different job categories and different levels of agencies. The interview method and content will be determined by the recruitment agency based on the nature and characteristics of the position being recruited, with emphasis on reflecting the performance requirements. Some recruitment agencies test and evaluate candidates&#39; professional abilities. 9 departments organize written examinations of professional subjects during the written examination stage, and 40 departments organize professional ability tests during the interview stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the National Civil Service Bureau reminds candidates to register with integrity, prepare with integrity, take exams with integrity, and keep promises with integrity. This recruitment does not publish or specify exam tutoring books, nor does it hold or entrust any institution or individual to hold exam tutoring training classes. Regarding civil servant examination training, websites or publications in the society, candidates are requested to be vigilant and treat them rationally to avoid being deceived and prevent damage to their rights and interests. The National Civil Service Bureau will work with relevant departments to strengthen management and supervision, crack down on cheating in exams, investigate and deal with violations, and create a fair, just, safe and orderly exam environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州野生动物放生规定来了，随意放生或负刑责！这些动物在列]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Guangzhou Wildlife Release Management Regulations&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Regulations&quot;) will be implemented on November 1, 2023 Effective from date. It is understood that the &quot;Regulations&quot; combine the actual conditions of Guangzhou to establish a practical management system for the release of wild animals to protect biosecurity and the ecological environment. It is the first local regulation in China to specifically regulate the release of wild animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set specific penalties for the illegal release of overseas wild animal species, the random release of domestic wild animals that may or has caused serious consequences, and the release of domestic wild animals in other places outside the release area. . Before citizens can legally release animals, they must register information three working days in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The legislation aims to scientifically regulate the release of animals&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Prevent the invasion of alien species&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote >; &lt;p>;The No. 1 Central Document in 2023 proposed to severely crack down on the illegal introduction of alien species, implement key actions to prevent and control major harmful invasive species, and strengthen the standardized management of the trade and release of &quot;exotic pets&quot;. This is also the first time that the word &quot;release&quot; is mentioned in the No. 1 Central Document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Releasing animals to pray for blessings is a traditional Chinese folk culture. However, in modern society, due to the diversity and complexity of released species and their source areas, inappropriate release behaviors have brought many problems to the environment, ecology, biology, society and people themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/741a7c92d83c7e54f97f570272efd5d7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/741a7c92d83c7e54f97f570272efd5d7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253993&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula). Image source: Scientific fish release expert team of China Fisheries Society&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the release of alien species of wild animals may harm the local ecosystem. If non-native wild animals are released into the local environment, the new species may compete with native species for food and living space. Alien species with strong reproductive capabilities or ferociousness will threaten the living space of native species and harm the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/8648eebe1467d4bd9bdabcac4172d2be.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/8648eebe1467d4bd9bdabcac4172d2be.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253991&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The short-capped fat carp (Piaractus brachypomus), commonly known as freshwater pomfret. Image source: Scientific fish release expert team of China Fisheries Society&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, poisonous, ferocious or unquarantine wild animals may cause personal and property damage to others after being released. If poisonous, ferocious or unquarantine wild animals are released into the wild environment, they may attack humans or other animals, and the viruses and bacteria they carry may also spread through waters or other channels, causing harm to other people&#39;s personal property and the ecological environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, wild animals that have not been trained for rewilding can easily lead to death when released into the wild. If wild animals that have not been trained for rewilding are released into the wild or into a wild environment that is not suitable for survival, they may not be able to survive and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee, in 2022, the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee conducted a law enforcement inspection on the implementation of the “Wildlife Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China”. During the law enforcement inspection, it was found that release activities are common in some places, but there are no corresponding management regulations. In particular, there is a lack of effective management measures for the release of invasive alien species such as alligator gar and scavengers, which seriously damages the balance of the local ecosystem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that the current national laws and regulations on ecological protection and wildlife protection, such as the &quot;Biosecurity Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Wildlife Protection Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, only allow the release of wild animals. Principled provisions have been made, but there is a lack of operable norms. In order to scientifically regulate the release of wild animals and prevent the invasion of alien species, special legislation is necessary. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress will include this regulation into the 2023 legislative work plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Releasing wild animals at will may result in fines or even criminal liability&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Citizens must register information three working days in advance to legally release wild animals&lt;/strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;In order to standardize the release behavior and prevent the invasion of alien species from damaging the local ecosystem, the &quot;Regulations&quot; clarify that overseas wild animals cannot be released unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to let the public know clearly which animals cannot be released, the &quot;Regulations&quot; also lists some of the more common exotic wild animal species, such as alligator gar, leopard catfish, Tilapia tilapia, Freshwater pomfret, mosquito fish, Egyptian frogfish, Thai dace, giant snapping turtle, red-eared turtle, American bullfrog, etc. Not only this, but other overseas wild animals not listed here cannot be released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/f0308e5e31f51a3c1bcbf2b0304c521a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/f0308e5e31f51a3c1bcbf2b0304c521a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253992&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Red-eared turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans).

Causing personal or property damage to others or endangering the ecosystem. The list of local species suitable for survival in the wild at the release site will be formulated and published by the Guangzhou Forestry Department and the Guangzhou Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department and updated in due course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Releasing wild animals at will is an illegal act, and one must bear corresponding legal responsibilities.” The person in charge of the Legal Affairs Committee said that for the act of releasing wild animals at will, laws and regulations distinguish three situations and stipulate them respectively. The first is to stipulate penalties for illegally releasing overseas wild animal species. It will be handled mainly in accordance with the relevant provisions of laws and regulations such as the Biosafety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the Wildlife Protection Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the &quot;Regulations&quot; set specific penalties for situations where the random release of domestic wild animals may or has caused serious consequences.即规定可能或者已经造成他人人身、财产损害或者危害生态系统的，由相关部门责令限期捕回；逾期经催告仍不捕回，可能或者已经危害生态系统的，区林业部门、区农业农村部门应当代为捕回或者采取降低影响的措施，所需费用由放生的组织或者个人负担；已经危害生态系统的，处一万元以上十万元以下罚款；造成他人人身、财产损害的，放生的组织或者个人依法承担相应的民事责任；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，《规定》对在放生区域以外的其他地方放生境内野生动物设定罚则。即未在规定地点放生的，由区林业部门或者区农业农村部门处二千元以上一万元以下罚款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，《规定》也对合法的放生行为提出指引。法工委负责人表示，市民进行合法放生，须遵守三个方面的规定：在放生前，市民需根据相关部门公布的当地物种名录，选择适宜放生的动物物种。同时，需要提前三个工作日将野生动物的图片、种类、数量、来源、放生时间和地点等信息上传至野生动物放生信息管理平台，根据相关部门信息反馈和科学规范的放生指引做好放生。在放生时，市民需前往政府划定的野生动物放生区域按照指引、登记信息放生。 &lt;/p>;

title=&quot;“灵活就业”的毕业生，和一轮针对性核查&quot;>;“灵活就业”的毕业生，和一轮针对性核查&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;创业的想法最早是在2017年，热带的一个午后蹦出来的。那时我正在仰光最大的集市，它的名字曾在1948年变为昂山市场，殖民时期用的外文名不知所终。名字的更换并没有带来建筑风格改变，殖民时期的赭石色屋顶和用光滑鹅卵石铺就的小道，很容易让人联想到乔治·奥威尔在缅甸担任警官的岁月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;整个市场的柜台被木头、琥珀、翡翠、红宝石和一种金色的珍珠占据。当时，实习报社的师兄带我到一位同时拥有华人和缅族血统的木材老板的店铺，她和他的丈夫经营的木头，除了本地的缅甸花梨木外，小叶紫檀和老山檀都来自隔壁的印度邻居。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我无法想象这么多名贵的木头为何会被允许砍伐，但她曾用蹩脚的中文向我形容，在印度和缅甸的边境上，有一片茂密、紧凑的紫檀林，密集程度足以满足中国人的需求。毕竟，西方人往往被昂山市场的民族服饰笼基和青年画家的画吸引目光，这些店铺都在市场的外围，那些赭石色屋顶下随意搭着的大棚里。只有中国人会深入市场的核心寻找宝藏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些勤劳的缅甸人就把这些木头加工成筷子和珠子，即便在阳光下仔细观察，会留意到很多珠子就像鹅卵石一样，细一些，或者胖一些，并不是漂亮的圆形。但架不住它便宜，只要带回中国，那价格可以翻上几番。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回国前，我把行李箱清空，很多用不到的书和药品，都留给缅甸的朋友。最终，我塞了满满的一行李箱木头回国，并在一个月内迅速卖掉，带着几个同学小赚一笔，又在之后的半年陆续进了两三次货。直到缅甸出台严格的木材进出口法令。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生意的魅力在于谈判，讲价是一门博弈的艺术。这个过程能让人极其放松，尤其当顾客反复琢磨你的商品时，你会觉得前期的研判和寻觅物超所值。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很快，三年的读研生活，又让我琢磨卖茶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时我在成都，当地浓厚的喝茶传统让我自认为发现了一片蓝海。把老家的普洱茶拿到成都，专门给一些茶馆做供应商也不错。除了上课，我每天都在成都各式各样的茶馆里闲逛，交朋友，开茶会，在随意翻阅了几本茶相关的著作后，还大摇大摆地上起了茶课。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾想，未来的人生就这样吧。每天的工作是和客户聊天，然后给你的产品琢磨一个又一个的故事，偶尔，春节和中秋的时候，提前给客户们准备好伴手礼，一一拜访，控制好茶叶的品质，以及警惕竞争者的出现。这个圈子的人大多内敛，有人暴富，但没人在花钱上大手大脚，大部分过着清贫的生活，生活的标准可以很低。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最重要的是，做茶有一种清贫的自由，哪怕是生意很一般的茶馆老板，春茶季还是会到各地的茶山游历一番，住在茶农家。茶农接待客户的费用，都超过客户买茶的费用，但到了下一个春茶季，茶农照样还是每天捉鱼杀鸡，招待客人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来在一家文化公司求职时，我向人力表达可以低欲望地生活，遭到人力驳斥，要是没啥欲望，那你对公司而言就是低效率的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从2022年以来，陆续做了几篇和就业相关的稿子，在与意图灵活就业，甚至慢就业的大学生们交流时，我都能看到曾经的自己，那种始终对人生的可能性保持向往，不希望被一个标准的、现代的公司体系所吸纳的意愿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且，新闻背景的学生大多都知道，新闻机构的招聘往往是在大四或者研三的下学期才陆续开始。当你周围想去互联网大厂的同学在秋天就拿到录用通知时，一个坚定从事新闻工作的人，会陷入无所事事的烦忧之中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在那年秋天结束之前，我在琢磨的事情，都还是做自己喜欢的事儿，做能让人生无限可能的事儿。在一封给某个文艺气息极为浓郁的初创公司投简历时，我还写下这样一段话：找工作自然需要一点自我催眠的功力，特别当同寝室的一干人等，已经跑到深圳做年薪30万元、号称5年内能在市区买房的老师；或者到月薪两万的房地产公司做销售，我一直默默地对自己说：不着急。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但事实上，春天来临之前，这种不着急已经消失殆尽了。我第一次感受到同辈压力是在一个夜晚，宿舍老友回校相聚，当其他人得知我甚至还没有收到面试通知时，已经找到工作的他们不自觉地吸了一口气，眼神里流露出怜惜。我希望他们马上停止这样的眼神，于是和他们说，新闻机构的招聘还没开始呢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来我想了想，这句话是说给我自己听的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但我相信，现如今，如果仅仅看部分高校灵活就业的数据，那么同辈压力可能已经不复存在了，当你周围的人在灵活就业或者慢就业，毕业就是一次漫长的休假，收假的权力一小部分掌握在自己手里，另一部分被一个抽象的、摸不着，姑且可以称之为“社会”的存在所掌控。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于真正意图灵活就业的学生而言，他们更多是被一些来自1980年代，或者2010年代的创业神话所包围。不久前，一位00后朋友很认真地咨询我，如何通过短视频卖茶，这是他毕业后的愿望，但他对短视频的剪辑手段、起号方式、剧本结构、对标账号都不了解。当我把这些都介绍一遍之后，他表示，太复杂了，有没有简单一点的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老家的云南长辈们有一种极为传统的想法，那就是毕业之后，哪怕找不到好工作，也得到小公司找一个临时的工作，不然的话，用云南话来说，人就飘着了。灵活就业或许能一夜暴富，慢就业或许也能收获人生无限可能，但真实的世界瞬息万变，在经历三年网课之后，被一个组织体系纳入其中，何尝不是一个了解真实世界的途径？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于我，当年认识的那位缅甸木材老板最后一次给我发信息时，她说要去印度，去现场看那片一望无际的紫檀树林，压低进货成本，这已经是五年前的对话了。在拿到工作录用通知之前，相熟的几位成都茶馆老板，则已纷纷转行，他们分别喜欢上了精油、推拿和旅行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是灵活就业需要面对的现实世界吧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七堇年：时间不多，玩了再说]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258583]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/dmLaXWsd6pjuYLL4Gpq3kyJRZS9iLevOWd5FyXOJ.jpg&quot;

I have been publishing works since I was in high school, and I am still living a seemingly unemployed life in my thirties. I always feel embarrassed when faced with inquiries from strangers. When she went to the barber shop and lay down to wash her hair, sooner or later a routine question came from the top of her head: &quot;What do you do?&quot; Sometimes she answered the teacher, sometimes she said it was sales, she said whatever came to her mind, but she couldn&#39;t tell the truth, and sometimes she said it was sales. There are no pre-programmed complete answers. Once the other party asked, she was helpless and allowed the sound of running water to flow by awkwardly. If you can’t answer it, I won’t make it up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The funniest time in my memory came from a fellow traveler I met when I was paragliding. The other person asked you what you were doing? Qi Jinnian answered in Sichuan dialect, &quot;I work in publishing.&quot; Since the pronunciation was similar, the other party then asked sincerely, &quot;How much does the best kitchen board cost per meter now?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This encounter made me even more sad. Qi Jinnian is convinced, &quot;Publishing or books are something that is far away from normal people, let alone saying that you are a writer. I would think it would be too weird to tell others that you are writing.&quot; She lives her life like a covert spy. In bustling Chengdu, I write in the morning, read in the afternoon, and sometimes go to the gym to exercise, and then come back in the evening to watch movies and read books. I don’t cook, but it’s hard to tell my friends from out of town about restaurant recommendations. She is used to blanching vegetables over high heat, and then ordering takeout from a limited number of restaurants that suit her taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/6L3eeOGIdCZDmkV3LLsj1DToDa7r7e0VcFk0hvY7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253688&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hiking everywhere&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It doesn’t matter whether you stay home or not , &quot;We really don&#39;t care.&quot; She is more concerned about the world outside the dozens of square meters of space. When the weather is nice, I go paragliding alone, and during holidays I go caving and rock climbing with my teammates. She joined the Shanshui Nature Conservation Center a few years ago and also threw herself to different Hengduan Mountains during the COVID-19 epidemic. The older she gets, the more animalistic nature emerges in her heart. Her yearning and primitive desire for nature have become a stronger attachment than emotion. She jokes that she has transformed into a &quot;part-time human being.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Irish female writer Claire Geoghegan (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;translated one of her short story collections &quot;Fostering&quot;&lt;/p>; span>;) wrote a passage, which happens to be very suitable to describe her. &quot;Writing is a strange profession, especially at my age. They mentally calculate how old I am, trying to remember what happened when I was born and who died. They can&#39;t be sure, but I&#39;m definitely not a little girl anymore. I You should do something else now, and tie yourself to an unmarried man with a stable income and a good car.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Qijing Nian, writing is not a dream planned since childhood. When I was less than 20 years old, my work &quot;The Bed Is the Tomb of Youth&quot; sold a million copies, and things happened suddenly. Thinking about it now, she really wants to have the life of a sports star. When she meets a child who is good at climbing in the rock climbing gym, she will feel jealous and then get upset, &quot;What did I do when I was a child? 9 to 12 years old is the most suitable for rock climbing. He is very light in weight and of the right size. If he has this kind of hobby, that would be great!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She sincerely envied Federer&#39;s life. &quot;When he retired, he was probably only in his thirties. After you have reached the pinnacle of your career, your life is actually still very long.&quot; It is obviously difficult for writers to end abruptly at this age. In September 2023, her collection of travel essays &quot;Crossing the Wandering Road&quot; was published. She had not published a book for the previous three years. During this period, she had to face the social expectations of editors and readers. She and artist Chen Xiaoyi traveled together in the Hengduan Mountains. Along the way, the two occasionally discussed the invisible publishing rhythm of each other&#39;s work. &quot;Artists like them also have to hold solo exhibitions or participate in group exhibitions every year to maintain a career.&quot; Online status. Otherwise, you will hear suspicion from the outside world, saying, &quot;What is this person still doing?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/X9MaAJCMB12UFxk9962T9eNT5XwhqxiQYCT8kNjt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/X9MaAJCMB12UFxk9962T9eNT5Xwh qxiQYCT8kNjt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253691&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ice Climbing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee Provided/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, this kind of sound would make her panic, but then she figured it out, &quot;Creation is really not like knitting a sweater, just knit it one piece at a time, right?&quot; Some people can, but for me, I am indeed writing slower and slower now. It takes as much time to revise as it does to write. &quot;Crossing the Waves&quot; took at least a year to revise, and I kept looking for the structure again and again.&quot; Objective Difficulty Increase, there is also some subjective psychological resistance. &quot;I have passed 35 years old, and my growth has changed a lot. This kind of creative pace is also a kind of discipline given to me by society. Rather than writing a book every year, what I am more worried about now is how to take advantage of my health. When you are good, you can experience more various sports and life. In fact, the older you get, the more you shrink. Because writing can last a lifetime, but if you want to do some outdoor sports, or even just climb a mountain, By the time you are sixty or seventy years old, your body will be incomparable to what you were in your twenties and thirties.&quot; Her most ideal life state is to &quot;travel around the world in the first 30 years, study in the next 30 years, and concentrate on writing in the last 30 years.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The following is her self-report:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Destiny is like raindrops&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I set foot on My professional writing path started relatively early, and I think it has been well-known to many readers.

During the three years of the epidemic, I think everyone may have had a difficult time, and everyone has their own understanding.

Today, when you should go to farm, just farm. If you need to harvest matsutake, just harvest matsutake, or dig up cordyceps. As for tomorrow, you don’t think too much about it.

Anyway, this is the biggest feedback that entering the mountains gave me. In the past, I seemed to be a person who was more or less out of place in real life. First of all, my freelance career may be different from the life of many office workers (when I get together with other freelance friends, we never talk about social security); in addition, my peers around me may have already gotten married and had children, which is very important to me. It&#39;s very far away, but if you live in such an impatient society, you will often have a lot of doubts about your position.

Feeling uneasy like that - when a person chooses to write for a living and choose freelancing, she has chosen a narrower and more difficult path. Fortunately, the past few years in the mountains have given me many epiphanies about this step-by-step approach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I went mountaineering for the first time, the guide told me that mountaineering is a process of dialogue with oneself. , in fact you are really tired when you climb, you don’t have time to think about anything, just like a walking robot, walking on flat ground may be very tiring carrying things, not to mention when you are at high altitude, you will be very out of breath as soon as you get up. tired. Many high mountains in Europe may only be 3,000 meters high, but the altitude of a county in Litang in western Sichuan may be as high as 4,000 meters, which can easily cause altitude sickness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My mind is blank, and the easiest thing to think of is &quot;Why should I suffer this here!&quot; &quot;That process is not actually a conversation with myself, but a flow experience in which the sense of time is lost.

Step forward to the place where you will rest tonight. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But looking back, these processes have brought me a very rich experience.

After forty or fifty times the problem has not been solved. The man said that his children have gone to college and he and his wife have to go to work, but a female neighbor downstairs always says there is something going on at home. To this end, the man laid carpets at his house, gave away the cat, and paid attention to details in his life, but the neighbors still refused to give in. The local police station dispatched police several times, but the neighbors still ignored it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conflicts often arise between neighbors over trivial matters. For example, some people love to keep pets, but their playful and noisy pets may affect others. According to reports, neighbors downstairs reported that there was a lot of noise in the man&#39;s home. The man had sent away the cat and laid carpets to minimize the impact on the neighbors. If they believe that the disturbances in the man&#39;s home still have an impact on his life, he can report it to the property management and neighborhood committee and ask them to mediate and resolve the matter. You can also file a lawsuit in court based on this, but you need to provide real evidence of the other party&#39;s infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the method the woman adopted was to go to other people&#39;s homes, smash the door and curse. In the video, the woman also kicked the door with her feet and took out a stick to smash the door. According to the man involved, his door was severely damaged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the woman smashed doors and cursed for nearly a year on the grounds that other people&#39;s movements interfered with her life. This not only had a serious impact on the man&#39;s life, she was also suspected of damaging other people&#39;s property, and her behavior also affected other neighbors. Because of this, the unsettled man called the police. However, despite forty or fifty calls to the police, the woman&#39;s behavior was still not effectively stopped, reflecting the mishandling of the incident by the local police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 9 of the &quot;Public Security Management Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that for minor violations of public security management such as fighting or damaging other people&#39;s property caused by civil disputes, the public security organs may mediate and deal with them. If the parties reach an agreement through mediation by the public security organ, they will not be punished. If no agreement is reached after mediation or the agreement is not fulfilled, the public security organs shall impose penalties on the perpetrators of violations of public security management in accordance with the provisions of this Law, and inform the parties that they may file a civil lawsuit with the People&#39;s Court for civil disputes in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the man originally called the police, the police believed that the woman’s behavior was minor and they could just mediate the matter. However, the neighbor did not accept mediation and continued to harass and even damage other people&#39;s property. Obviously, his behavior does not fall into the category of minor circumstances, and the police should punish him in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to this matter, the police should do at least two things in handling this matter. First of all, in the initial mediation process, it is necessary to declare to both parties their respective rights and obligations within the scope of the law. The man has the right not to be harassed. If the female neighbor thinks that the movement in the man’s home interferes with her life, she can Submit this to the court. At the same time, the police should explain the legal basis for the mediation method in this matter, and warn the female neighbor what legal consequences she will face if she cannot accept mediation and continues to smash the door and other behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, when mediation fails again and again and the vicious cycle of the man calling the police and the woman refusing to accept mediation continues to smash the door, the police should resolutely follow the law enforcement authority granted by the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and punish It imposes penalties. Calling the police 40 or 50 times in a row failed to stop the woman&#39;s behavior, not to mention making the man involved feel helpless in safeguarding his rights according to law. It was also a huge waste of police resources. At the same time, in the woman&#39;s eyes, the police repeatedly sent out police but never further restricted her behavior, which made it easier for her to be arrogant and &quot;the law can&#39;t do anything to me.&quot; Perhaps it was precisely because of the inaction of the local police time and time again that the woman&#39;s behavior escalated, from cursing to smashing the door. If left unaddressed, the woman&#39;s subsequent behavior may turn into violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For such incidents, decisive punishment of the woman after police mediation fails is the key to protecting the rights of the victims. If the police fail to hold people accountable in a timely manner and in accordance with the law, it will only encourage illegal behavior and even lead to further deterioration of the situation and cause more social problems. At the same time, this will also mislead others, making them mistakenly believe that there are no legal red lines for such behavior and they can do it arbitrarily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no precedent for the police to deal with such incidents decisively and hold the offenders accountable. According to a report by Time Video in May 2023, in a community in Chaoyang District, Beijing, knocking sounds on the walls of residential buildings were often heard in the middle of the night, causing residents to have trouble sleeping. After investigation, the police identified the resident Liu. According to Liu, he had conflicts with his neighbors because of the poor sound insulation of the house. In order to retaliate, Liu chose to knock on the wall. Because Liu&#39;s behavior disturbed the people and lasted for a long time, he was suspected of provoking quarrels and causing trouble, so he was administratively detained by the public security organs in accordance with the law. If the police do not deal with Liu, I am afraid that residents will still be harassed by him for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding incidents of neighborhood nuisance, it is often the case that &quot;the public says the public is right, and the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right.&quot; Some parties involved may not have a sufficient understanding of the law. These factors may affect the effectiveness of police mediation. However, this does not mean that the police can relax the enforcement of the law, especially not to treat people differently based on their gender, age, etc. If the above incident involved a man breaking down the door for nearly a year and the woman repeatedly calling the police, will the police tolerate the continuation of such incidents? In fact, the police treat all cases equally and use facts instead of other factors as the basis for law enforcement. This can only reflect judicial fairness, maintain order and fairness in the entire society, and allow offenders to understand the seriousness and inviolability of the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多名培训机构人员组织研究生考试作弊获刑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258489]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 11, 2023, the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court prosecuted the defendant Zhang and others for using wireless Transmission method, in the 2021 and 2022 National Master&#39;s Degree Admissions Examination, the first instance verdict was issued on the cheating case of candidates in the examination.

Article 2, Item (1) of the &quot;Interpretation&quot; directly stipulates that &quot;organizing cheating in the admission examination of ordinary colleges and universities, the admission examination of graduate students, and the recruitment examination of civil servants&quot; is directly defined as &quot;serious circumstances.&quot; The defendants in this case clearly knew that the candidates were participating in the national master&#39;s degree admissions examination, but still participated in it and organized cheating, which is a &quot;serious circumstance.&quot; According to Article 284-1 of the Criminal Law, anyone who organizes cheating and the circumstances are serious shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years, and shall also be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a practical point of view, the crime of cheating in exams has the possibility of re-offending to a certain extent. In order to prevent criminals from &quot;returning to their old careers&quot;, this case is based on the provisions of Article 12 of the &quot;Interpretation&quot; and Zhang is punished in accordance with the law. The nine defendants were declared occupationally prohibited, that is, the nine defendants were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examinations, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; at the same time, the defendants who were sentenced to probation were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; at the same time, the defendants who were sentenced to probation were prohibited from engaging in occupations related to education, examination, and training within five years from the date of completion of the sentence or the date of parole; A prohibition order is issued in accordance with the law, which means that he is prohibited from engaging in activities related to education, examinations, and training during the probation period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ten years of hard work, but one day of hard work&quot;, examination fairness is a bottom line that cannot be touched in society. Cheating in exams not only undermines exam fairness, but also affects social fairness and seriously harms individual candidates and national interests. &quot;The French Open will be open without any omissions,&quot; organizers should not take any chances. They also hope that every candidate will strictly abide by the law, take the exam with integrity, refuse to cheat, and use their hard work to obtain satisfactory answers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[透视银行半年报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258551]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Commercial banks are not only the transmission system of macro-control policies, but also an excellent window for observing the micro-economy.

The experience of Mr. Su Jing, the author of &quot;Thirty Collectors of Modern Books&quot;, is also very legendary. For details, please refer to Zou Zhenhuan&#39;s &quot;The &quot;Paradigm Shift&quot; of Chinese Book Publishing - Reading Su Jing&#39;s &quot;Casting to Replace Engraving: Missionaries and the Changing Situation of Chinese Printing&quot; 》, I won’t go into details here. Going back to &quot;Thirty Modern Book Collectors&quot;, when the Taiwanese biographical literature edition was published, only two biographers of the thirty names recorded in the book were still alive. One of them was Zhou Shutao (1891-1984) who passed away the following year, and the other It was Pan Jingzheng (1907-2003) who passed away 20 years later. It is unknown whether Mr. Zhou Shutao has seen &quot;Thirty Collectors of Modern Books&quot;. However, Mr. Pan Jingzheng did read the Taiwanese version of &quot;Thirty Modern Book Collectors&quot; and commented on it in a letter to Mr. Shen Xieyuan. In 1995, the first issue of Nanjing Normal University&#39;s &quot;Cultural and Educational Materials&quot; compiled an album of information on Pan Jingzheng. In addition to Xu Xiaoman&#39;s article &quot;Mr. Pan Jingzheng, the bibliographer&quot;, the other two articles were &quot;Pan Jingzheng&quot; signed by &quot;Shu Lu&quot; &quot;Biography of Mr. Jing Zheng&quot; and &quot;Catalogue of Writings of Mr. Pan Jingzheng&quot;. From Mr. Pan Jingzheng&#39;s letters, the author quite doubts that &quot;Shu Lu&quot; is a temporary pen name created by Mr. Shen or him and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently sorting out the remains of Mr. Shen Xieyuan, I found more than ten handwritten notes from Pan Jing and Zheng Zheng to Shen Xieyuan, mainly written from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Most of them were written with brushes and paper. , seal, which are identical to the letters collected by &quot;Pan Jingzheng&quot; (edited by Wang Guichen and Wang Dawen), the first volume of the &quot;Scholar&#39;s Ink Collection&quot; published by Guangdong Education Press in June 2022. I would like to select Shutong and briefly reveal his abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;一&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Previously, the author wrote in &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/255656&quot; title=&quot;Old friends smile more than the trees in the courtyard: Shen Xieyuan and Qu Fengqi As mentioned in the article &quot;An old friend smiled more than the tree in the atrium: A brief account of Shen Xieyuan and Qu Fengqi&lt;/a>;&quot;, Gu Tinglong, Pan Jingzheng, and Qu Fengqi all once collected the &quot;Er Golden Butterfly Hall Seal&quot; for Mr. Shen Xieyuan. inscription. Letters from Mr. Qu Fengqi were also forwarded through Mr. Pan Jingzheng. In an existing letter from Mr. Pan Jingzheng dated October 13, 1982, he once mentioned a sentence: &quot;It belongs to the seal of Uncle Bazhuo, and is compiled into short words for correction. If it is not applicable, throw it into the toilet for correction.&quot; This was related to this matter. Mr. Pan Jingzheng inscribed &quot;Er Jindie Hall Printing&quot; and first filled in the words &quot;Unforgettable&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Before the wind and rain, I am afraid of chasing after others and looking for claws, and check the confusion. The wealthy family destroyed the painted building, and the swallow curtain replaced the beam. The lonely traveler&#39;s thoughts, caressing the broken bag. Early calamity dream. A hundred years old, the shadow of two golden butterflies has gone through many vicissitudes of life. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The long grace is protected now, and the iron pen is overflowing with fragrance. Wherever you hit, look at the pear. It’s a good companionship and the fragrance of the heart. I only feel ashamed and graffiti, which detracts from my appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Repost &quot;Unforgettable Meaning&quot;.

He relied heavily on sound throughout his life, and he continued to do so until he was old. Mr. Wei Li obtained a kind of &quot;Inscriptions on Letters Written by Qing Dynasty People in Inkstones&quot;. Mr. Pan wrote a line of words for almost every letter, which is a good proof. Especially in his later years, Mr. Pan Jingzheng preferred to write lyrics in rare ancient books instead of inscriptions and postscripts. This tendency of using rhyme instead of prose is somewhat similar to that of Gu Wenbin, the owner of Guoyun Tower. Gu Wenbin said that rhyme is better than prose, so he exploits his strengths and avoids his weaknesses. The reason why Mr. Pan Jingzheng is like this, I think, he considers himself a poet with romantic feelings and literary temperament from beginning to end. The poem &quot;Unforgettable&quot; is prefaced by Zhu Wenfang Yin - &quot;I am also a lyricist in Wuzhong&quot;, which can be called a portrayal. Mr. Shen Jin recalled that the title of Mr. Pan Jingzheng&#39;s article was &quot;A Piece of Ice Heart in a Jade Pot&quot;, which was really appropriate and can be said to be insightful. There is a long postscript after the poem &quot;Unforgettable Meanings&quot;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My friend Shen Junxieyuan came from his old home in Yuyi to acquire the work of Mr. Zhao Shushu. The inscription is eighty-two, the dress is in a bow, and the treasure is left in the office of Qian Wu Hufan&#39;s uncle. Compared with Shanghai, it is a metaphor, which means &quot;Hongzhao&quot;. Most of the prints in the book were engraved by Shen Yunchu and Wei Jiasun, and some were engraved and consumed by themselves. There are two seals carved by the ancestor of Zheng&#39;an, one is a large square seal with three characters &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; and the other is a rectangular seal with three characters &quot;Hanxueju&quot;, both of which are exquisite works. Shen, Wei, and Mr. Xiang are all in perfect agreement, and all the seals should be perfect. I have collected fifty or sixty stones of Mr.&#39;s seals, and they have all been returned to the Shanghai Museum. The collections of Shen and Wei are no longer traceable. Hundreds of years of vicissitudes, gathering and dispersing smoke and clouds, make me feel sad. The word &quot;Yuan&quot; is added to &quot;Wu&quot; to repay one&#39;s fate. In his declining years, his writing and writing are desolate, and I feel ashamed. In the eighth month of Renxu, Zheng Shi, Pan Jing, Wu County, was seventy-six years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/ItRTBT8LILpgcO8CZQa2l3odtDKoYp1KAZoIShjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 756&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/ItRTBT8LILpgcO8CZQa2l3odtDKoYp1KAZoIShjL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Mr. Pan Jingzheng mentioned above that the fifty-six stones of the seal carved by Zhao Zhiqian for Pan Zuyin in the Pan family&#39;s collection have been returned to the Shanghai Museum. This is proved by the fact that the seal used by Pan Zuyin is on display in the Seal Hall of the Shanghai Museum. The seal &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; is clearly visible, which is true. In the past, the Suzhou Museum held a special exhibition &quot;Planning the Ancient World: The Collection of Pan in Suzhou during the Qing Dynasty&quot;. They tried to borrow the giant seal &quot;Pang Xizhai&quot; for the exhibition but failed. They had to replace it with a seal titled &quot;Wuxian Pan Boyin&#39;s Life and Authentic Appreciation&quot;. Breathless. As far as the author knows, there are at least four giant seals of the Zhai name used by Pan Zuyin. In addition to &quot;Pang Xi Zhai&quot;, there are also three seals of &quot;Pangu Lou&quot;, &quot;Zheng&#39;an&quot; and &quot;Plum Blossom Happy God&#39;s Pavilion&quot;. According to Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s recollection, after Mr. Pan Jingzheng wrote the postscript for &quot;Er Golden Butterfly Hall Yin Cun&quot;, he gave a piece of paper with the seal number of Pan Zuyinzhai as a gift, which was not found in the &quot;Yin Cun&quot;. It was bound. I wonder if it is still in the book? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard from Mr. Shen Xieyuan more than once before that in addition to the ink ink of Mr. Pan Jingzheng in his collection, there are also two handwritten lyrics written by him. It was not until September 2012 that I had the opportunity to see them in Shen Zhai, Xitang North Lane. However, within a few years, these two pieces were scattered among the people. Now that I think about it, I still feel very regretful. The two poems are self-composed, one horizontal and one vertical. The vertical ones are made of plain paper, and are signed: &quot;The book &quot;Qingmen Yin&quot; was presented to Xueyuan&#39;s brother-in-law Jiaozheng. In the first month of Wuchen, Pan Jingzheng was eighty-two years old.&quot; Also sealed are the four seals of &quot;Xingyang Zonglao&quot;, &quot;Prime Minister Shaozai&#39;s great-grandson Hanlin&#39;s grandson&quot;, &quot;Pan Jingzheng&#39;s seal&quot; and &quot;original name Chengbi&quot;.

Obviously, &quot;Eternal Life&quot; is four years earlier than &quot;Qingmen Yin&quot;, but both are later than &quot;Unforgettable&quot; in 1982. However, among the three, &quot;Longevity&quot; was written to celebrate Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s 60th birthday, so its significance is naturally extraordinary and comparable. Although the three poems were created at different times and have different names, they all use the word &quot;Linlang&quot;, which makes people sigh involuntarily. This is a coincidence, but I believe it is not an accident! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;二&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The relationship between Mr. Shen Xieyuan and Mr. Pan Jingzheng may have started in the 1940s and ended after 2000, about half a century ago, but the existing Pan Jingzheng Mr.’s letters only include part of the last twenty years. The earliest one is from January 16, 1976:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xie Yuan About my brother: I have learned from you over a long period of time, and have a deep connection with you. But the daily life is Sui Sheng, the business is diligent, and the talisman is chanted. My brother is recovering from his illness, and he is still working in the ancient books group in the picture above. Recently, the 721 University has been established, and he is looking for some teaching materials in terms of editions. I know that your library has compiled a book called &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot;, and I would like to make great efforts to find a copy for you to study. You need to pay a certain amount of cost and postage. Please let me know and send it to you immediately. You are welcome. I hope that my brother will be able to show me what kind of studies he has recently devoted himself to, and that he will be able to make some achievements in order to enlighten his ignorance. I also heard that Nan Tu compiled a &quot;Bibliography of Rare Books&quot;. Was it the result of great efforts? Return to Yuwu and beg and send it to our apartment at No. 1, Lane 181, Xikang Road, Shanghai. Because there are so many departments in the library, there may be a loss in mail delivery. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, in the suicide note of Mr. Shen Xieyuan, I found a set of mimeographed copies of &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot; from Beijing China Bookstore. It has the same name as the book Pan Zhazhong requested. Is it this book? , cannot be determined at this time. Since the original signature does not have a year, we relied on the records in &quot;Haineng Baichuan&amp;nbsp;Knowledge Navigation: Collected Works to Commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Shanghai Library&quot;. On December 26, 1975, after three months of preparations, the Shanghai Library established the &quot;Seven 21 &quot;The university offers four classes: basic library knowledge, English, Japanese, and ancient books. The ancient books class has been out of work for one year. &quot;Most of the ancient books students have stuck to their majors and have become the ancient books management and research team of the Shanghai Library. For example, Chen Xianxian became an ancient books expert at the Shanghai Library, and Yan Zuozhi became the director of the Ancient Books Research Institute of East China Normal University. &quot;. Regarding the situation of the &quot;721&quot; University, I once called Mr. Shen Jin who was far away in the United States. According to his recollection, there were 15 students in the ancient books class at that time, and the class leader was Zhu Binyong, who later worked in the library of Fudan University. The teachers who teach include Gu Tinglong, Pan Jingzheng, Qu Fengqi, Ruan Henghui, Chen Shiming, Chen Bingren, Ren Guangliang, Wu Zhi and Shen Jin. Among them, Mr. Pan Jingzheng teaches the most frequently. The course lectures he is responsible for include &quot;Engraved Editions of Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties&quot; and &quot;Manuscripts&quot;. &quot;History&quot;, &quot;School-based Lecture Notes&quot;, &quot;Stone Carving Lecture Notes&quot;, &quot;Dharma Notes Lecture Notes&quot;, etc. It is unknown whether the mimeograph version of &quot;Knowledge of Ancient Book Versions&quot; was used for reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that as early as 1957, when Xinhua Bookstore in Jiangsu Province held a training class for managers of Xinhua Bookstores in the province, Mr. Shen Xieyuan was invited to teach the history of Chinese books. In May 1965, he was invited to teach the ancient part of Chinese calligraphy history to a training class for amateur university library staff in Gulou District, Nanjing City (mainly librarians in colleges and universities). Since then, related activities have been suspended due to various reasons. In 1975, Jiangsu Province re-organized a study class for ancient books staff, and he was invited to teach about the Song and Yuan editions. After entering the 1980s, he was invited to teach ancient book editions in 1985 as a national training course on ancient book restoration commissioned by the National Library Administration and organized by the Shanghai Library. In June 1986, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture commissioned the Nanjing Library to hold a seminar on the regulations for recording Chinese ancient books in Jiangsu Province, and he was invited to give lectures on the cataloging of ancient books. Since then, he has taught edition bibliography courses to students majoring in related majors at Nanjing Normal University and Nanjing University. Although we have not seen the complete lecture notes left by Mr. Shen Xieyuan during this period, among his belongings, we still found some manuscripts of lecture notes on edition and bibliography, some written with brushes and some with hard pens, and they are not too long. It is very large. If I have the opportunity to sort it out in the future, it can be used as a supplement to the &quot;Collected Works of Shen Xieyuan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time that Mr. Shen Xieyuan and Mr. Pan Jingzheng were invited to teach versionology in the ancient literature major of Nanjing Normal University, Mr. Pan Jingzheng was hired as a part-time professor by the Ancient Books Department of East China Normal University and taught graduate students. On February 2, 1983, Mr. Pan Jingzheng wrote in a letter saying:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I would like to ask the director of Tianzhen Museum on my behalf. I was given a volume of the great work &quot;Yangzhou Poetry Bureau Examination&quot;. Since my brother is giving a lecture for postgraduate students, I can use it to supplement the materials. I am particularly grateful if I can send it immediately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is to ask Mr. Shen Xieyuan to ask Mr. Pan Tianzhen for the article &quot;Miscellaneous Examination of Yangzhou Poetry Bureau&quot; newly published in the 1983 issue of &quot;Library Science Newsletter&quot; as a reference for teaching edition science . On January 17, 1990, Mr. Pan Jingzheng sent a letter to inform him that &quot;after my retirement this year, I will not be able to go out. Recently my blood pressure is high and I have to take a rest. Four people have graduated from the Normal University this year and they will no longer be Feng&#39;s wife.&quot; &quot;Exactly.&quot; It can be seen that when he retired from the Shanghai Library, he no longer served as a graduate tutor at East China Normal University. At this time, Mr. Pan Jingzheng was already eighty-four years old. Among the graduate students taught by East China Normal University, the student that Mr. Pan Jingzheng admires most is Lin Shenqing, the editor of &quot;Seals of Ming and Qing Bibliophiles&quot; and &quot;Seals of Chinese Bibliophiles&quot;. The publication of the 1989 edition of &quot;Seals of Ming and Qing Bibliophiles&quot; was the result of strong recommendation from Mr. Pan Jingzheng. Among the letters written by Pan&#39;s inkstones and friends, only &quot;The Letters of Zhang Taiyan&quot; have been compiled and published in the 17th volume of &quot;Xue Ji Lin&quot;, and the letters of Guo Moruo have been included in the article &quot;The Posthumous Letters of Guo Moruo and &quot;Guanzi Collection&quot;&quot; Library Journal, Issue 3, 1999, the authors are all Lin Shenqing, which shows that Mr. Pan Jingzheng held him in high esteem. Unfortunately, Lin died young and was unable to complete the collection and research of the letters written by friends in Yanlou. , which is regrettable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Pan Jingzheng, like Gu Tinglong and Qu Fengqi, are very supportive of Mr. Shen Xieyuan’s collection and arrangement of Huang Pilie’s inscriptions and postscripts. He once mentioned in his letters that &quot;it will be beneficial to write Huang&#39;s postscripts. I hope Mr. Gu can help me with my essays such as those on the Bo.&quot; It is undeniable that &quot;the previous letter of courtesy is based on the information of Huangxunpu. Because the matter is too long and nothing has been gained, it cannot be replied.&quot; If you see anything, you will be notified in a letter, such as the letter on October 18, 1981:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xie Yuan My brother asked: I sent you a copy ten days ago, and I want to go to the record room. The information on Xicheng Garden published in Taiwanese publications has been borrowed from Yang Junkanen of the Academy of Social Sciences on behalf of him, and was copied by Comrade Shen Jin, who agreed to receive it that morning. If you are sincere, I would like to order &quot;Jiangsu Library Work&quot;. I hope that I can arrange it on my behalf. It is best to start from the first issue last year (it has been published to the seventh issue now). Because it is issued internally, there is no way to place an order here. If you need a certain amount of money, please ask for instructions and it will be remitted immediately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person mentioned in the above letter as &quot;the information on Xicheng Garden has been included in Taiwanese publications&quot; should be Hong Kong scholar Luo Bingmian&#39;s &quot;Research on Huang Pilie&quot;. This article was included in the 1976 edition of Taiwan Food Publishing House. Luo&#39;s &quot;Collection of Qing Dynasty Scholars&quot;. In Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s case, there is a copy of the article, which has been bound into a volume with a kraft paper cover. There is a &quot;Shanghai Library Reproduction Fee Receipt&quot; in the volume, and the payment unit is filled with &quot;Shenjin&quot;. Next to it is Mr. Shen Xieyuan&#39;s ink note &quot;Printing on behalf of &quot;Research on Huang Pilie&quot;&quot;. On September 18, 1981, he copied 57 pages of A4 paper for a total cost of 14.25 yuan. It seemed very expensive at the time and the price was not small. It can be inferred from the time and the person who made the printing that Mr. Pan Jingzheng was referring to this immediately when he mentioned copying. It can be seen from the letter that Mr. Pan Jingzheng borrowed Luo&#39;s &quot;Academic Treatise on the Qing Dynasty&quot; from Yang Kangnian of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Yang Kangnian is the same age as Mr. Shen Xieyuan and also graduated from Wuxi National College. However, he graduated a few years earlier and the two were not classmates. For his life, please refer to Ma Jun&#39;s &quot;Information&quot; published in &quot;The Paper·Private History&quot; on August 6, 2017. &quot;There is a Yang Kangnian in the room&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after, Mr. Shen Xieyuan sent Mr. Pan Jingzheng and Mr. Qu Fengqi respectively the &quot;Yongfeng Township People&#39;s Travel Chronicles&quot; compiled by Gan Ru (Luo Jizu) published by Jiangsu People&#39;s Publishing House. Both elders believed in it. Thanks. Mr. Pan Jingzheng’s letter of thanks was written on November 24, 1981:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My brother Xieyuan: To the letter, I also express my gratitude to you for the gift of &quot;Yongfeng Township People&#39;s Travel Chronicle&quot;. I am deeply sorry to express my gratitude to Qiong. I have also received the journal of the society and would like to express my gratitude on my behalf. If the order for 1982 is awarded, the order fee will be remitted immediately. I feel so relieved and refreshed. Attached are two lost poems by Xun Weng, whose dates can be traced.

There is no doubt that without these two words, they can only be attached to after this year. This is what Mr. Pan Jingzheng specifically mentioned in his letter.

One is father, marriage and family; It is private property rights and market economy. Because these two constitute the two indispensable cornerstones of human civilization. Our ability as humans to enter a civilized society really depends on this. This article explores the origin and evolution of these two species from the perspectives of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Father&quot; is a product of cultural construction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Scholars in the pre-Qin era realized that in the distant &quot;ancient&quot; period, there was no such role as a father. &quot;Zhuangzi: Robber Zhi&quot; states that &quot;in the days of Shen Nong, the people knew their mothers but did not know their fathers.&quot; &quot;Lu&#39;s Spring and Autumn Annals: Reliance on the King&quot; said: &quot;In ancient times, there were no kings. The people lived in groups and knew each other.&quot; &quot;The mother does not know the father&quot;, that is, there was no father&#39;s role in the &quot;ancient&quot; period, so there was no stable dual family and the corresponding ethics between various relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Wu Fei said that in &quot;Etiquette·Mourning Clothes Biography&quot;, &quot;Shang Jun Shu·Kaisa&quot; and &quot;Lu Shi&quot;, as well as &quot;Jiao Shi Yi Lin&quot;, &quot;Baihu Tong·Hao&quot; and &quot;Lunheng&quot; in the Han Dynasty • Documents such as &quot;Qi Shi&quot; and &quot;He Tu Ting Zuo Fu&quot; all record the situation of &quot;knowing the mother but not knowing the father&quot; in ancient times (Wu Fei: &quot;The &quot;Disintegration&quot; of Human Relations: Anxiety about Family and Country in the Tradition of Moral Theory&quot;, Sanlian Bookstore , 2017, pp. 163–166). As a kind of collective memory, as well as field observations of &quot;savages&quot; in the pre-Qin era, we all realize that the role of fathers comes with the development of civilization. This is a consensus among people since the pre-Qin and Han Dynasties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of the Later Han Dynasty·Xunli Biography&quot; also noted from the perspective of field observation that the people of Luoyue in the south at that time &quot;had no wedding ceremony laws, and they had no suitable match due to their promiscuity and lust.&quot; This state of no stable duality obviously does not produce the role of a father (in a social and cultural sense). Through civilized discipline and education, biological men in nature are transformed into fathers who fulfill family and social responsibilities, thus forming a stable family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a stable family structure, bloodline inheritance is clearer, which can encourage fathers to be more actively involved in family and parenting responsibilities. With the father&#39;s active participation, the child&#39;s survival probability is higher, a stable parent-child relationship is formed, and the child can be with the child for a longer period of time. As a role in this pole of civilization, knowledge that requires longer education and accumulation, including hunting, martial arts, farming, and even a large amount of &quot;tacit knowledge&quot; such as managing a tribe, will be taught to students in the original &quot;family learning&quot; way. child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To borrow the terminology of the Austrian school of economics, the emergence of the father&#39;s role and the dual family, as well as the imagination of the patrilineal ancestral community formed on this basis, are actually the product of super overcoming time preference. In an era without father figures, people consider the time dimension more briefly and often make judgments based on moments or short-term passions. The emergence of the role of fathers and the continuation of stable families and families have made the lines of time extremely long, and people&#39;s investment and gaming models also tend to consider the longer future. At this point, savings become more valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People saved grain and raised livestock instead of consuming it immediately. Through savings, children can obtain stable property inheritance. The continuation of private property allows people to &quot;have perseverance and perseverance&quot;, overcome time preference, and develop the virtue of accumulating the future. Whether it&#39;s working hard to save wealth, or doing good deeds to build a family&#39;s reputation, these are the foundations of civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blood relationship between children and their mothers is natural and does not need to be demonstrated through cultural imagination, but the father is a product of cultural construction and imagination. To imagine community through &quot;patrilineal&quot; requires both the ability to imagine beyond time and abstract cultural construction. Through this model, people who were destined to forget each other in the past can be formed into an imaginary community, creating a close division of labor and collaboration. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Patriline and Aristocracy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Once this kind of family organization is produced, it is destined to have an extremely powerful advantage among the scattered people everywhere who &quot;know their mother but not their father&quot;. Many archaeological materials can show that the first to establish a stable dual family order was the earliest aristocratic class. Not only did they create the means of imagining and sustaining community through the patriline, but they also created the earliest surnames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;生&quot; in &quot;surname&quot; is a phonetic symbol. The ancient sound of the word &quot;surname&quot; is in the heart mugeng part, and the archaic sound of the word &quot;生&quot; is in the birth mothergeng part. The dental sounds overlap and the pronunciation is basically the same. Therefore, the word &quot;surname&quot; is not interpreted literally as &quot;born by a woman, representing the maternal line.&quot; The &quot;female&quot; is only used to label women in the paternal family, and &quot;surname&quot; is used for men in the family. The &quot;生&quot; in the surname is just a phonetic symbol, and the &quot;surname&quot; is just a function of distinguishing between patrilineal families with the same origin and non-intermarriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paternal surname creates a long family tree, which can connect different distant family branches, forming a greater ability to mobilize and cooperate. Therefore, it can be seen that early nobles often prohibited civilians from establishing surnames and did not allow them to establish family trees. For example, in ancient Hawaii, &quot;ordinary civilians were not allowed to record their lineages, and they were prohibited from approaching the supreme chief who was a professional person who recorded the noble lineage. This made the chief and the A sharp separation line was formed between civilians&quot; (Chen Chun: &quot;Exploring the Origins of Civilization and Early States: A Comparison of Chinese and Foreign Theories, Methods and Research&quot;, Shanghai Bookstore Press, 2007, p. 246). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The aristocrats and civilians in the Shang Dynasty&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an archaeological point of view, many people in the early days did not have stable paired families, and it was a common phenomenon to not know their mother but their father. For example, in tomb K82.5 at the Wajiaping site of Lintao of the Qijia Culture, an adult woman was buried with a baby under her breast, and the remains of a seven or eight-year-old child. The Qinghai Minhe Lajia F4 abandoned house burial tomb of the Qijia Culture also contains a single woman buried with a child in her arms (Li Xinwei: &quot;Rediscussing the Abandoned House Burial in Prehistoric Period&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot; 2007 Issue 5, No. Pages 50-56). These single mothers buried alone with their children are a vivid portrayal of the early era of &quot;knowing your mother but not knowing your father&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Xiajiadian Dadianzi tombs, there are no couples buried together, and mothers and young children are often buried together. For example, in tomb M30, a mother was buried with two young children, and in M205, a mother was buried with a child. Young children were buried together, M358 was buried with a mother and a child, M675 was buried with a mother and children, M787 was buried with a mother and two infants, and M1246 was buried with a young child (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Dadianzi: Lower Xiajiadian Cultural Sites and Cemetery&quot; Excavation Report&quot;, Science Press, 1998, pp. 228-231). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the ancient sarcophagus burials of southwestern Yi, there are also tombs in which couples are buried together (Luo Kaiyu: &quot;Research on Sarcophagus Tombs in Western Sichuan and Yunnan and Eastern Tibet&quot;, &quot;Acta Archeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1992, p. 426 ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering early civilization, nobles had stable couples buried together, but civilians still did not have stable couples buried together. For example, the couple&#39;s tombs M303 and M225 of Da Sikong in the Yin Ruins are side by side, 2 meters apart, and they are buried side by side. They are both from the fourth phase of the Yin Ruins, and there are rammed earth buildings on the upper floors (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Excavation Report of Da Sikong M303 in the Yin Ruins &quot;, &quot;Acta Archeologica Sinica, Issue 3, 2008, p. 388&quot;), this noble tomb has a clear dual relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Xianwu pointed out that two-thirds of the tomb owners in Yinxu did not have a legal spouse during their lifetime. There were not many truly monogamous families. Most of them still lived in unstable couples and incest marriages, so they died. Afterwards, there were no exclusive spouses buried together (Meng Xianwu: &quot;A Review of the Excavations of Tombs in the Southern District of Yin Ruins&quot;, &quot;Central Plains Cultural Relics&quot; Issue 3, 1986, p. 80). Some scholars also pointed out that the phenomenon of &quot;burial in different caves&quot; for stable marriages is rare in the Yin Ruins. Throughout the pre-Qin period, single burials of men and women were the main burial method (Yang Baocheng: &quot;Research on Yin Ruins Culture&quot;, Wuhan University Press, 2002, pp. 80-83). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From these comprehensive points of view, the common people in the Shang Dynasty still mainly lived in a state without stable couple marriages, while the aristocracy showed a relatively stable couple family. In other words, aristocratic families in the Shang Dynasty had a clear role of &quot;father&quot;. The genealogy of the Shang king family in &quot;Historical Records·Yin Benji&quot;, as well as the genealogy of the Shang king family presented in the oracle bone inscriptions, and even other signs of noble genealogy found in the oracle bones, such as the famous &quot;Shang Sanjubing&quot; family tree inscription, are all It shows the ability of the aristocracy at that time to construct a community organization in the cultural imaginary way of patriarchy. Although the ties of the ancient clan society had not yet been completely disintegrated at that time, in the oracle bone inscriptions, the children of the Shang family referred to their biological father&#39;s brothers of the same generation, that is, uncles, as &quot;father&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot;. In addition, the Shang king and queen of Yinxu were also buried in different family cemeteries. &quot;This is probably related to the fact that the blood ties of the clan have not been completely disintegrated.&quot; (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;1976 Northwest Xiaotun, Anyang&quot; &quot;Excavation Briefing&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1987, page 374). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But no matter what, the Shang royal family and other aristocratic families can actually identify their respective biological fathers, and the later the father dies, the more the son succeeds, and the situation of brother&#39;s succession is decreasing. . Among the sacrifices, the sacrifices for the biological father are also more solemn. This also shows that the role of &quot;father&quot; in the culture of the royal family and aristocracy of the Shang Dynasty has become more and more clear, while in contrast is the vague civilian class, the mainstream living situation among which is still knowing one&#39;s mother but not knowing one&#39;s father. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zhou Civilization and Confucius&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By the Zhou Dynasty, the situation of the civilian class had not changed much, while the civilization level of the aristocratic class had further evolved and improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, it was said that &quot;propriety is not inferior to common people&quot;, that is, the aristocratic class maintained the father and stable couple marriage family structure through civilized &quot;propriety&quot;, while the common class continued to know their mother and their father. For example, among the Jin tombs in Chengcun Village, Linyi, Shanxi, among the third-level civilian tombs, couples are rarely found buried in the same cave. &quot;This shows that the burial custom of couples being buried together in caves has not become popular among lower social classes&quot; (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, etc.: &quot;Linyi Chengcun Cemetery&quot;, China Encyclopedia Press, 2003, p. 258 pages). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars pointed out that compared with the Shang Dynasty, it was more common for couples of nobles in the Zhou Dynasty to be buried together in tombs (Zhang Mingdong: &quot;Inspection of Joint Tombs in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Ancient Civilization&quot; Volume 7, Cultural Relics Publishing Society, 2008, p. 185). This also shows that with the development of ritual and music civilization, the civilizational achievements carried by &quot;rituals&quot; more generally covered the families of the aristocratic class at that time. Stable and clear pair marriages, as well as the role of the father, were the further development of civilization in the Zhou Dynasty. important results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This background actually helps to understand more deeply why Confucius, who lost his father since childhood, had to hold a grand funeral ceremony at the Five Fathers Road after the death of his mother Yan Zheng, and then put her there. He was buried in Fangshan and buried with his father (&quot;Historical Records·Confucius Family&quot;). Because through this act, he can publicly show that he is the child of the aristocratic Kong family, not a &quot;savage&quot; class without a father, but a low-level nobleman with clear parents buried together in the tomb - a scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an orphan, Confucius never met his father. In fact, what has the greatest influence on him is precisely the maternal family with natural blood connections, that is, his grandfather Yan Xiang and his mother Yan Zheng are in these maternal families. Among the students of Confucius, there were the &quot;Eight Faces of Confucius&quot;, namely Yan Lu, Yan Hui, Yan Xing, Yan Gao, Yan Zu, Yan Zhimu, Yan Kuai, and Yan He. Among them, Yan Lu was probably his mother&#39;s nephew, that is, Confucius&#39;s cousin in his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui, as the son of Yan Lu, was Confucius&#39;s nephew in his mother&#39;s family. Confucius&#39; feelings for Yan Hui were often intertwined with the deep emotions of his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui also regarded Confucius as someone as close to him as his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of natural emotions, Confucius actually had the closest relationship with his mother&#39;s family, but he knew that the civilized class could not only know its &quot;quality&quot; but not its &quot;culture&quot;. &quot;You love his sheep and I love his etiquette.&quot; Although my father is far away, he is a symbol of etiquette and civilization. Without the symbol of father, he would remain at the level of knowing his mother and not knowing his father. Therefore, Confucius chose to publicly bury his mother and father together, declaring that he was the successor of Uncle Liang He, the official of Zouyi, and inherited and continued his father&#39;s &quot;Kong&quot; surname. The origin of the patrilineal imaginary community can therefore be traced back to the monarchs of the ancient Song Dynasty, and even the more distant Shang royal family, and all the way back to the emperor Ku and other figures in the ancient mythological era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucius&#39; recognition of his ancestors opened a path to encourage the common people to imitate the nobility, to go beyond knowing their mother and not knowing their father, and to establish a clear father&#39;s family like the aristocrats. Confucius not only recruited a large number of elite children of civilians, but also spread aristocratic knowledge to them. Confucianism in later generations also encouraged civilians to learn etiquette, become civilized people, become qualified fathers, and imitate the nobles in establishing surnames, family trees, and family temples. The establishment and recognition of the father&#39;s symbol is an important springboard to civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small communities and private property rights&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By clarifying the role of the father and the cultural construction of the family, it provides an accumulated foundation for the development of communities and private property. The family is the foundation of private property rights, and private property rights are an important cornerstone of civilization. Only on this foundation does it make sense to save and develop for the future. It is on the basis of private property rights that the principle of &quot;differentiated love&quot; can bring into play the interactive effect of communities of different circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Private property rights are not actually &quot;private&quot; as understood by Yang Zhu&#39;s atomic individuals. In a private property society, various forms of property sharing are actually practiced within families. The traditional primogeniture system in Western Europe retains the integrity of family property, although the second son can only receive an annuity provided by his elder brother, or even has no property and can only go out to explore the world. However, the family property is not &quot;privately owned&quot; by the atomic individual of the eldest son, but is the custodian between the ancestors and descendants of the blood community, so the property still belongs to the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the Chinese are more inclined to divide property. In addition to other scholars, according to the law of the Song Dynasty, &quot;a woman can marry half of a man&quot;, and daughters can also get the right to inherit family property. On the one hand, Confucians encourage the formation of clan communities with more levels of property distribution without dividing families, or by establishing family common property trusts such as &quot;Fan&#39;s Yizhuang&quot; and &quot;clan fields&quot;, &quot;sacrifice fields&quot; and &quot;school fields&quot; that are common in South China. &quot; and so on, maintaining various forms of common property of small communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of private property rights is mainly the defense mechanism that must be in place when facing public power representing the greater community. That is to say, the property rights of small communities such as families and families cannot be infringed on in the name of a large community or a society of strangers. In the face of public rights, private property rights are embodied as &quot;private&quot;, but within small communities, they are mostly represented as &quot;public&quot; with various tender feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the British Victorian era, which was criticized by some people, while the market economy and industrialization were highly developed, family values ​​remained strong, providing warmth and a haven to escape the cruelty of society. The song &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; written by John Howard Payne in 1822 has been popular in the English-speaking world for more than a hundred years. It sings: &quot;Home, home, sweet, sweet home! There is no place like home in the world. A better place”. The popularity of this song just shows that the high development of the market economy at that time did not destroy family values. On the contrary, it highlighted the &quot;privacy&quot; of the family as a small community and its positive role in protecting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The development of market economy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the basis of private property rights, especially with the further development of the industrial and commercial economy, there is a need for rich exchanges and cooperation between strangers from all over the world. At this time, the market economy based on private property rights was nurtured and developed, and through various business models such as games and cooperation based on property rights, the lowest-cost method of cooperation between strangers in a complex society was realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a free market economy, various small communities can divide labor and collaborate more effectively. As the market order expands, the number of groups it absorbs further increases, the division of labor is continuously refined, efficiency increases and costs decrease, forming a positive-sum game effect, and people benefit together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the collaboration model of the market economy, people have also learned to trade and collaborate in ways that go beyond traditional small communities. With the improvement of life and the abundance of commodities, more ordinary people have the opportunity to have access to the culture and art of past elites at low cost. Ludwig von Mises said: &quot;If an argument is needed, it is only necessary to point out how serious music has become popular in the past few decades, especially among those who are busy in business. That&#39;s enough. There has never been a time in history when art has been brought so close to the hearts of so many people&quot; ([Austrian] Ludwig von Mises: &quot;Socialism: Economic and Sociological Analysis&quot;, Translated by Wang Jianmin et al., China Social Sciences Press, 2008, p. 406). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, classical books were extremely expensive in China, and there were many records in the literature of &quot;poor families without books&quot;. According to the &quot;Book of the Northern Qi Dynasty: Du Bi&#39;s Biography&quot;, his grandfather was the governor of Huainan and his father was the county magistrate, but his family was still &quot;poor and without books&quot;. &quot;Yan&#39;s Family Instructions Encouraging Learning&quot; specifically emphasizes, &quot;If you can always keep hundreds of volumes of books, you will never be a villain for thousands of years.&quot; As long as the family can keep some precious books, there will not be a class decline, but it will be able to continue. Stay in the elite class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the advent of the Song Dynasty, driven by the market economy, commercial book engraving began to rise and flourish, and a large number of high-end classical books began to enter the lives of ordinary people. Su Dongpo mentioned: &quot;When I met the old Confucian Mr. Yu, I said that when I was young, I wanted to get &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Han Shu&quot; but could not get them. Fortunately, I got them. I wrote them by myself and read them day and night, for fear of not being able to catch up. In recent years, people in the city have turned around. The books of hundreds of schools of thought were copied from each other, and thousands of pieces of paper were passed down every day. The books written by scholars were numerous and easy to produce&quot; (&quot;Li&#39;s Shanfang Collection Secretary&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, it is precisely because &quot;city people&quot; &quot;copied&quot; driven by commercial interests that caused the rapid popularity of classical books, and a large number of classical books entered the world of ordinary people. In the past in Europe, Stoic books and Rococo art were limited to a limited number of aristocratic elites and out of reach of ordinary civilians. However, with the development of market economy and industrialization, production costs have been greatly reduced, and ordinary workers can also hang a print of a Leonardo da Vinci or Van Gogh painting at home, or collect an industrially produced classical book. The market economy allows the aristocratic culture and elite rituals and music that were once aloof to enter the families and lives of ordinary people more efficiently, raising the average level of civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that from the perspective of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history, the emergence of the stable dual family, the role of &quot;father&quot; (in a cultural sense) and the marriage system, as well as the emergence of the marriage system based on this Private property rights and market economy are the two cornerstones of a civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
