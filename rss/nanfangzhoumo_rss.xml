Take compulsory measures. Trading of the company’s shares on the Stock Exchange will be suspended from 9:00 a.m. on September 28, 2023, and will continue to be suspended until further notice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A criminal law expert told 21 A reporter from Century Business Herald said that the content of Evergrande Group’s announcement was very clear. According to Evergrande Group&#39;s announcement, the company should have received a definite notice, and the notice characterized Xu Jiayin as &quot;suspected of illegal crimes&quot; and compulsory measures were taken. It is common sense to guess that when there is notification from relevant departments, the coercive measures taken are likely to be different from the &quot;residential surveillance&quot; that has been misreported by overseas media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned criminal law experts said that in the context of the early stage of the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s investigation into Evergrande Real Estate and the public security departments taking criminal coercive measures against suspected criminals such as Du Mou of Evergrande Fortune, Xu Jiayin was suspected of illegal crimes. The results should not surprise many people. Public opinion has previously focused more on “when” to take action. Judging from the current public information, the issues he is involved in are likely to be related to multiple crimes. They are very complicated and may take quite some time to clarify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior observer in the field of corporate governance told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that Xu Jiayin had previously publicly declared high-profile slogans such as &quot;No one is allowed to lie flat&quot; and &quot;I can have nothing&quot; in 2021, but comprehensively considering all aspects, Judging from the information and reports, in fact, Xu Jiayin and his company said one thing and did another, tried to &quot;sit down&quot; at every turn, and threw the burden of resolving various problems and contradictions on society, leaving a mess that is difficult to clean up. From this perspective, it is no exaggeration to say that public opinion criticized him verbally and writingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned observers pointed out that at this cusp of great pressure from all parties, Xu Jiayin was shouting slogans to deceive creditors, but at the same time he had a &quot;silent technical divorce&quot; with Ding Yumei. Due to the agreement of Evergrande Group to be listed in Hong Kong through the &quot;small red chip&quot; structure, among the more than 90 billion Evergrande Group has previously distributed in accumulated dividends, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are 100% controlled by Xu Jiayin and Ding Yumei respectively. The offshore company received most of the dividends through China Evergrande (03333.HK), and transferred them overseas before and after the accident. Through the &quot;technical divorce&quot; operation, it eventually fell into the pocket of &quot;overseas ex-wife&quot; Ding Yumei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior partner of an accounting firm who is familiar with cross-border restructuring pointed out to the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that at present, Evergrande Group’s overseas debt restructuring may be due to Xu Jiayin and some senior executives being suspected of illegal crimes. The situation faces major changes. But whether it is domestic or overseas, whether the reorganization is successful or liquidated, I believe there are sufficient legal channels for domestic and foreign creditors to safeguard their rights and interests and pursue the responsibilities of Xu Jiayin and others. At the same time, the regulatory authorities are also likely to investigate Xu Jiayin and other executives&#39; illegal violations. The crime and subsequent investigation will be investigated and held accountable in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刑事自诉小慧君诽谤立案：孙灏羽的“好运”可以复制吗？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257796]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;There is new progress in the &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; rumor-mongering sexual assault incident. Chidu Company founder Sun Haoyu recently posted on social media that the procedural issues in his criminal private prosecution case against Xiao Huijun for defamation have been resolved and will be heard soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, the well-known cross-dressing blogger &quot;Sien Xiaohuijun&quot; publicly accused her former boss Sun Haoyu of sexually harassing her online. Fortunately, Sun Haoyu later obtained evidence to prove that the so-called sexual harassment was just a rumor created by Xiao Huijun in order to terminate the contract with the company at a low cost. Including Xiao Huijun and several other contract anchors under Chidu premeditated and planned this rumor and slander incident in a group. After obtaining the evidence, Sun Haoyu filed a civil lawsuit against Xiao Huijun and others, which was supported by the court. The court clearly stated in the civil judgment that the evidence proved that the alleged sexual harassment was fiction, and ordered Xiao Huijun and others to apologize and compensate for losses to Chidu Company and Sun Haoyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Sun Haoyu filed a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting that Xiao Huijun be held criminally responsible for spreading rumors and defamation. Initially, the court in Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence believed that it had no jurisdiction and ruled to dismiss Sun Haoyu&#39;s lawsuit. The higher court ruling published by Sun Haoyu this time determined that the court at Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence had jurisdiction and ordered the court to open the case and accept it. At this point, there is no obstacle to filing a criminal case against Xiao Huijun for defamation, and the next step will be to enter the formal trial process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From being rumored to be sexually assaulted, to winning the civil lawsuit and the court confirming that &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; spread the rumor, to finally filing a criminal private prosecution case, the journey has been difficult. In view of the frequent occurrence of similar rumors on the Internet, many netizens hope that Xiao Huijun&#39;s case will deter those who try to follow suit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been constant incidents of accusing others of sexual harassment or even sexual assault through online essays. However, many of them are difficult to distinguish between true and false, and some have been deemed by judicial authorities as lacking evidence or even being slanderous. For example, a female employee of a well-known large factory alleged that she was raped by a male leader, but police investigation showed that there was no rape. Recently, another host was also accused of rape, and police investigations revealed that the woman suffered from schizophrenia and experienced hallucinations and delusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these online essays alleging sexual assault, many netizens often choose to believe the parties involved for the first time. The reason is often that &quot;women will not use their innocence to slander others.&quot; However, many facts prove that in the face of interests, nothing is impossible. For example, Xiao Huijun did not hesitate to sacrifice her &quot;innocence&quot; in order to terminate the contract with Chidu Company at a low cost. There are also some people whose motives for slander are difficult for ordinary people to understand, and they may simply have mental problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xiao Huijun accused Sun Haoyu of sexual harassment, many netizens believed it to be true. Sun Haoyu and Chidu Company were bullied online and threatened offline. The company&#39;s door and front desk were smashed many times, and Sun Haoyu was always crowded when he went out. Followed by taking pictures and cursing. An MCN organization that was originally at the top of the industry has almost come to a standstill and is now unknown in the industry. A well-known host was at the peak of his career, but after being accused of sexual harassment, he was put into hiding, and his career and reputation were ruined. Although they won the lawsuit, their careers struggled to recover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is extremely difficult for these men who have been falsely accused to defend their reputations. In civil litigation, it is difficult to obtain evidence recognized by the court. Sun Haoyu was lucky. Someone in Xiao Huijun&#39;s &quot;Blood Battle Chidu&quot; small group found his way back and provided the chat records Sun Haoyu needed. Zhang Heng, another well-known online article author who was falsely accused of raping an underage female fan more than ten years ago, has been unable to obtain the identity of the false accuser through legal channels, let alone prosecute. The accuser just wanted to make a famous person look bad, but he &quot;hidden his fame and achievements&quot; and didn&#39;t even reveal his true identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the civil lawsuit is won, the compensation received is very little, and the defendant&#39;s apology is often light and perfunctory, and the amount of communication of the apology is also very different from that of the false accusation. , it is difficult to clarify the facts and restore reputation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To deter rumors and defamation, the rumor makers must pay a greater price, such as criminal liability. However, the criminal law stipulates that spreading rumors and defamation is generally a private prosecution crime, and the victim needs to collect evidence and file a lawsuit. It is even difficult for victims to collect evidence for civil lawsuits, and it is even more difficult for criminal evidence that requires stricter requirements than civil lawsuits. Sun Haoyu was just lucky. He got the evidence and the verdict of winning the civil lawsuit, and he had more confidence to file a criminal private prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sun Haoyu’s good luck is difficult to replicate. In order for those who make false accusations and framers to be punished, the threshold for turning false accusations and frame-ups into public prosecutions needs to be lowered. As long as the victim makes a complaint, the case should be turned into public prosecutions and the police will investigate the case and collect evidence. In this way, we can intensify the crackdown on rumors and slander, protect the interests of victims, and maintain online order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会：赛场内外，同样精彩]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257834]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of 17:00 on September 27, 2023, the Chinese delegation It is far ahead in the medal list of the Hangzhou Asian Games, with a total of 124 medals, including 69 gold medals, 39 silver medals, and 16 bronze medals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 24, 2023, Li Bingjie, who won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final, displayed her medal.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252480&quot;>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final championship Li Bingjie shows her medal. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou will be held from September 23 to October 8, 2023, with a total of 15 competition days.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past &quot;May Day&quot; and the approaching &quot;National Day&quot;, Dr. Sun from the emergency department of Zibo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital went on two missions during two consecutive long holidays. In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out. Just like that, half a year passed in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After this summer vacation, the streets have indeed regained some calm, but after a marathon, it is full of people again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“There will definitely be a wave of traffic during the National Day holiday. This is what it means to hold a marathon at this time.” On September 24, the last weekend before the National Day holiday, this internet celebrity city held its first marathon Marathon. Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal. They queued for an hour and a half, and many people in front of the store were carrying Marathon on their backs. The pre-game package looked like a contestant who stopped by for the tooth festival. &quot;Zibo people are very welcoming, and the barbecue is very affordable and delicious.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After several months of &quot;turbulent&quot; drama, Zibo Barbecue has experienced a fierce evolution from explosion to crazy expansion, and then to a brief period of calm. Many interviewees said that after the summer vacation, the market showed obvious signs of calming down. However, whether it will return to its original shape before the epidemic or maintain an average value of warm but not cool, people are still waiting and watching, and it is difficult to tell. Conclusion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, the interviewees agreed that at least during this National Day Golden Week, Zibo will still see a peak of tourists. For this reason, businesses and citizens are eager to try to seize this possible &quot;last wave of traffic.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;Barbeque shop owner: Give it a try again on National Day&lt;/h4>;&lt;p>;The obvious &quot;turning point&quot; occurred after the summer vacation. &quot;You can see it all at a glance&quot; on Badaju Street, which is booming. The popularity of Zibo barbecue has dropped after half a year. &quot;It was still very busy in July and August, but after September, it subsided a bit quickly.&quot; Standing at the fork in the traffic flow, whether to advance or retreat, the owner of a barbecue restaurant in Zhangdian District, Zibo City was a little undecided. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Boss Shan’s shop was featured in the documentary &quot;A String of Life&quot;, coupled with the super popularity of &quot;Going to Zi for Barbecue&quot;, the business has been really booming for a long time. &quot;It was a bit broken at the time.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a charity organization with strong fundraising capabilities, the China Children’s Charity Aid Foundation (referred to as the Children’s Charity Society) has recently fallen into disarray. In the midst of the donation turmoil. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, Ke Mouxiao was accused of using the Children&#39;s Charity Society&#39;s &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Assistance&quot; project (hereinafter referred to as 9958) to defraud families of seriously ill children out of nearly 1,000 yuan. 10,000 life-saving money was detained by the police. The Children&#39;s Charity Association publicly stated that Ke Mouxiao was not its staff and had only served as a volunteer in the Hebei Langfang Team Cooperation Organization of the 9958 Project. But the controversy has not yet died down. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many parents of children who were deceived said that they participated in the &quot;matching donation&quot; initiated by Ke Mouxiao and transferred the funds to Ke Mouxiao. They expected that within a period of time Afterwards, a return higher than the principal amount will be obtained, and the excess will be donated by the enterprise. Because this kind of &quot;matching donation&quot; is a normal operation mode in the charity sector, and families of seriously ill children are accustomed to it, there is no doubt about the authenticity of the project initiated by Ke Mouxiao. (For details, please see Southern Weekly’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/256685?source=131&quot;>;China Children’s Charity Association volunteers are involved in nearly 10 million yuan in aid, and families with serious illness are in trouble again. Matching donation scam&lt;/a>;》)&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the &quot;matching donation&quot; that parents of children with children are accustomed to, is it a arbitrage donation in a gray area? According to relevant laws and policies, it is illegal for charitable organizations to induce parents of children with self-raised funds to participate in matching donations or donate for their own use. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Does the Children&#39;s Charity Association know about such &quot;matching donations&quot;? Southern Weekend reporters discovered that deficiencies in the management and operation of charitable organizations provide a breeding ground for the alienation of matching donations. The more money is raised, the more matching donations are made - with the same goal, the people who need the money most take their money out of their pockets, boosting the charity&#39;s fundraising figures. &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;“Who dares to do it if you can’t get the money back?”&lt;/h4>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It’s the 99 Charity Day in September every year. Li Shan (pseudonym) from Guangxi I want to raise more life-saving money for my daughter who is suffering from leukemia. He decided to participate in &quot;matching donations.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;99 Charity Day is a national charity event jointly launched by Internet companies and hundreds of charity organizations, enterprises, and celebrities. September 9, 2015 is China’s first Internet Charity Day. In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers introduced a popular foreign method-matching donations. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Matching donation is a matching donation. After a donor donates a sum of money to a charity organization, another donor (usually a company) will randomly or according to Donate a certain percentage of money to the same charity organization. The original intention of the matching donation model is to encourage the public to participate in donations. According to its original intention, the donation amount including corporate matching should not be used for the donor himself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Charity Law also clearly stipulates that when a donor and a charitable organization agree on the purpose and beneficiaries of donated property, the donor&#39;s interested parties shall not be designated as beneficiaries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan has never heard of the above regulations. On the eve of the 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan opened a &quot;Donate Together&quot; charity matching donation project for each of the three charity matching projects launched by the Children&#39;s Charity Society: &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot;, &quot;Girls in Need Guarantee Plan&quot; and &quot;Aiding Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot;. ” fundraising link and named it after his daughter, who has leukemia. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Donate Together&quot; is a charity game launched by Tencent Charity Platform. Users click the corresponding button on the public welfare project homepage and fill in the target amount and sponsor information to generate a link. Donors open the link and enter the amount to donate. Subsequently, this donation information and the corresponding matching donation will be recorded in the initiator&#39;s &quot;Donate Together&quot; and can be publicly queried. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the public information and execution plan of the project, the recipients of &quot;Sunflower Protecting Children in the West&quot; are children in need in the western provinces under the age of 18. &quot;Girls in Distress&quot; The &quot;Guarantee Plan&quot; will provide long-term assistance to girls in need across the country, and the goal of &quot;Assisting Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot; is to allow children in need to go to school with peace of mind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I really don&#39;t understand this.&quot; On September 17, 2023, Li Shan listened to a reporter from Southern Weekend introduce the above three projects and said that he neither I don’t know who these projects are aiding, and I don’t know whether my behavior counts as a donation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But before that, in the three days from September 7th to 9th, Li Shan raised more than 210,000 yuan for these three projects through &quot;donate together&quot; , including several &quot;donations&quot; worth 3,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan. According to the rules, Tencent will donate more than 22,000 yuan to this end. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan explained to Southern Weekend reporters that these &quot;donations&quot; were all his own money. &quot;The people who &#39;donated money&#39; were some relatives and friends. I gave the money to them first and then asked them to donate it to the project.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Shan said frankly , for the more than 200,000 yuan he &quot;donated&quot;, he had no intention of using it to aid children or girls in need in the west. &quot;We are all short of money ourselves.&quot; He believes that the money &quot;donated&quot; and matched by enterprises will eventually come back to him. &quot;Who dares to do it if he can&#39;t get (the money) back?&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that during the three days from September 7th to 9th, a total of 12,000 people participated in the above-mentioned activities in the form of &quot;donate together&quot; For the three projects, they &quot;donated&quot; a total of more than 8.86 million yuan.

Although two young cosplayers (cosplay enthusiasts) did not win the ticket, they still decided to stay at the entrance of the e-sports center and spend an unforgettable night watching the TV broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/oupRK0i3RNd0s4DHvrfOBnDXXiOnYwvQj7Qvj2sZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/oupRK0i3RNd0s4DHvrfOBnDXXiOnYwvQj7Qvj2sZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 26, 2023, the final scene of the Honor of Kings Asian Games held at the Hangzhou E-sports Center. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 25, 2023, the Hangzhou Asian Games e-sports event King of Glory Asian Games version half In the final, CCTV Sports and CCTV5+ channels broadcast the game. This is the first time that CCTV broadcasts the Asian Games e-sports competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coser Yifeng is also a fan artist. She chose this job because of her interest in e-sports. &quot;Ever since (e-sports) entered Asia, I have been explaining (e-sports).&quot; Yifeng told Southern Weekend reporters that three days ago, she and her father watched the opening ceremony of the Asian Games together. When the e-sports players entered, She excitedly pointed it out to her father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game of King of Glory is participated by two teams, red and blue, with 5 people in each team. The two teams start teamwork and competitive confrontation on the King&#39;s Canyon map. Cosplayer Lu Zhian said that people around her, including male friends who participated in youth training, were biased against the competitive strength of female players, which gave her the idea of ​​&quot;proving&quot; herself. By watching professional players&#39; e-sports competitions, she learned some game strategies and techniques, and thus improved her rank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A male audience born in the 1980s began to pay attention to e-sports events in 2006 because of &quot;DOTA&quot;. &quot;DOTA2&quot; is one of the e-sports events at the Hangzhou Asian Games. He is also a football fan and talked to Southern Weekend reporters about the similar teamwork and competitiveness between the two, especially the thrill of a desperate comeback at the decisive moment of the game. Going into the game, he was confident of the outcome. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 26, in the final of the Asian Games version of the e-sports e-sports King of Glory in Hangzhou, the Chinese team defeated the Malaysian team 2-0 and won the first e-sports gold medal in the history of the Asian Games, and was included in China’s Medal table. The 31 Chinese players participating this time have an average age of about 24 years old. They have played more than 11,000 games in total and have won more than 60 championship trophies in various competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is almost a game without any suspense. The cheers at the scene reached their peak when Chinese players appeared on the stage. They came from leagues and clubs that were more professional than their opponents. The sound of cheering accompanies every &quot;attack&quot; in the game. In the second game of the final, the Chinese team even changed players and flattened the opponent&#39;s &quot;base&quot; more cleanly and quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/Wn5XEdjfBQOfaV0ZIS9ZBKA5CRLQ7yBofH6lKUdb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/Wn5XEdjfBQOfaV0ZIS9ZBKA5CRLQ7yBofH6lKUdb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252655&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the evening of September 26, 2023, in Hangzhou, members of the Chinese team took the stage to greet the audience after winning the first e-sports gold medal in the Asian Games. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first final night of the Asian Games e-sports. When the winner is decided, Hangzhou It seems that the enthusiasm in the e-sports center has not yet had time to be fully unleashed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sports in the Digital Age&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;E-sports has a history of at least forty years. In 1980, the &quot;International &#39;Space Invaders&#39;&quot; competition held in New York, USA, was considered the world&#39;s first formal e-sports competition. The champion at that time later became a video game programmer. With the launch of the WCG (World Electronic Sports Competition) after the millennium, Esports, or &quot;electronic sports&quot;, began to become an international event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaodong, dean and doctoral supervisor of the School of Leisure Sports and Management of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, told Southern Weekend reporters that in primitive society, people had invented sports activities such as running and swimming; in agricultural society, people had horse riding, bows and arrows, etc. Activities; In industrial society, people began to ride bicycles, race cars, etc.; &quot;The digital age will definitely use numbers as tools and new sports will appear.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 16, 2023, at the &quot;Asian Games TALK Guangzhou Station&quot; event held at the Guangzhou Library, Xu Deqing, director of the Propaganda Department of the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, responded to Southern Weekend Reporter’s question about e-sports. Xu Deqing believes that e-sports is a culture of youth, teamwork and innovation. &quot;E-sports is different from games. E-sports is defined as a contest of intelligence, just like chess and Go. It is a contest of intelligence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the forty competition events at the Hangzhou Asian Games, e-sports are classified as &quot;intellectual events&quot; along with bridge, chess, go and xiangqi. The &quot;World Brain Games Federation&quot; once defined &quot;brain games&quot; as &quot;a sport or game that is related to the mental abilities of the participants rather than their physical advantages.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin, associate professor and master’s tutor at the Department of Physical Education and Research of Peking University, recalled a scene from 20 years ago. In 2003, the State Sports General Administration listed &quot;e-sports&quot; as the 99th official sports event in my country. At that time, e-sports was still a new thing, and she and her students discussed &quot;whether e-sports is a sport or not&quot; in class. Opponents accounted for the vast majority. In fact, it was not just e-sports, but also chess sports. These sports lacked physical movement and were not well accepted as &quot;sports&quot; at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Qi Xin has clearly felt that the outside world&#39;s perception of sports and e-sports has changed significantly. Peking University has a student-organized e-sports association, and more and more students are participating. According to Qi Xin&#39;s observation, the personal abilities of these students have been developed, such as thinking ability, reaction ability, overall view, willpower and team spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, she met a former professional e-sports player at an event. She listened to the player talk about competitions and training, and her impression of e-sports gradually changed. &quot;In addition to talent, you also need to undergo hard training the day after tomorrow.&quot; Qi Xin said that when the players compete, they are the same as traditional sports athletes. There is nothing else in front of them, only the competition, even if they encounter physical and mental problems. In the difficult situation, he will try his best to win at that moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“People are gradually realizing that competitiveness is also the core content of e-sports.” Qi Xin listed to Southern Weekend reporters, “In a game, what will be improved physically and mentally, and what will be negative? Appear? How to stimulate team enthusiasm and creativity in e-sports competitions, and cultivate the sports spirit of not admitting defeat, not being discouraged, and fighting tenaciously? These are important research topics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin believes that if e-sports Athletes can gain a certain degree of social visibility and recognition like well-known athletes in other sports fields, and they can even participate in college teaching in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from traditional domestic sports, e-sports events have always been promoted from the bottom up by game manufacturers, e-sports clubs, etc.: e-sports games appear, clubs enter, live broadcast platforms rise, and events gradually improve. Finally entered the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the news of e-sports entering Asia came, Wang Guoji felt it was &quot;a bit sudden, but not unexpected.&quot; Wang Guoji is the chairman of the e-sports working committee of the China Cultural Management Association. He explained that although e-sports developed from online games, it is quite different from games: &quot;Online games and e-sports, hobbies and professionalism must be clearly understood. Be aware of it and make a clear distinction. It does not mean that today, when Hangzhou holds the Asian Games and 7 e-sports events have become official competition events, online games are fully endorsed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;We are doing A serious matter&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders believe that the entry of e-sports into Asia will bring the e-sports industry into a more standardized direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin told Southern Weekend reporters that the difference between &quot;playing e-sports&quot; and &quot;playing games&quot; lies in &quot;sports rules.&quot; E-sports needs to abide by strict sports regulations, which Qi Xin calls &quot;edges and boundaries&quot; to ensure order and control of e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jing, a staff member involved in the Asian Games e-sports project, said that e-sports projects are gradually becoming &quot;serious&quot;, and the competition format and rules are closer to traditional and formal sports projects. &quot;This is a problem for many manufacturers.&quot; It is a big challenge for the competition team.” In order to adapt to the rules of the Asian Games, some e-sports schedules have been changed. For example, the original five games that decided victory were reduced to three. At least three months in advance, e-sports players must start closed training and implement a diet plan to ensure that they pass doping tests. And these are still unimaginable in the league. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rules are indeed more detailed. Sun Jing said that in 2006, the e-sports management rules totaled about 5,000 words; now, the latest version of the rules has about 120,000 words. &quot;The process of the game, various foul situations, and the details of each event are all broken down in detail,&quot; he told Southern Weekend reporters. &quot;It is still far from the rules of football and basketball, but it is already comparable to the rules of some traditional events. It&#39;s relatively close.&quot; For example, when confirming the start of the game, &quot;the rules state that within 5 minutes of the start of the game, if an irreparable bug is triggered, the game must be replayed.&quot; The industry discussed this for a long time before determining which moment should be counted. &quot;Game start&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the relaxed age requirements for athletes in some traditional sports, such as the current Asian Games, where 13-year-old Cui Chenxi won the women&#39;s skateboarding street finals, the industry has stricter age requirements for e-sports athletes. high. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial E-Sports Association requires that to meet the requirements for registered e-Sports athletes, you must be over 18 years old, complete nine years of compulsory education, and obtain a full-time junior high school diploma or above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters visited the Hangzhou LGD E-sports Club. Club manager Marseille said that they would not consider minors to become players. The professional age of e-sports players is between 18 and 25 years old, which means that the opportunity to become a professional player is fleeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Club professional testing often dissuades many young people with e-sports ideas. This test tests people&#39;s reaction, instant memory, hand-eye-brain coordination and other abilities through computer and equipment. After multiple rounds of tests, only six people passed all the tests, but after entering the youth training team, they still faced many difficulties. The elimination rate from the youth training to the second team is 67%, and the elimination rate from the second team to the first team is 50%. Some youth training players will leave the club and find another place if they cannot prove that they can participate in higher-level competitions within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Pan Jie, CEO of LGD E-Sports Club, said that there is a very detailed evaluation system for talent selection, which not only examines online practical performance, but also offline interviews to evaluate their realistic psychological conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jing told Southern Weekend reporters that some e-sports events are exactly the same as traditional sports. For example, in FPS (first-person shooter) games, he noticed that players need to complete a certain amount of traditional physical exercise to train muscle reaction speed, and the concept of &quot;warm-up&quot; is also introduced. Some high-intensity games are played from morning to night. Without this foundation, it is easy to suffer from physical exhaustion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ying Shunjie is the deputy director of the Shanghai E-sports Education and Training Working Committee and has been engaged in e-sports education for many years. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the e-sports industry has always paid attention to the traditional sports industry, including the training system and management, and is learning from traditional sports. &quot;It pays attention to players&#39; mental health, injury management, daily work and rest, physical functions, etc., these are traditional Something that esports doesn’t have.” He mentioned that the past &quot;Internet cafe-style&quot; model was obviously unhealthy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pan Jie said that the great development of e-sports competitions is due to learning from the game rules, transfer rules, salary caps, etc. of mature sports leagues such as the NBA. However, in the process of learning, traditional sports rules are always &quot;acclimated&quot;, especially how to adapt the rules that serve offline to online. &quot;At the beginning, all the rules were purely competitive, and later they included some commercial terms.&quot; It has also gradually been incorporated into the club system.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do we have so many people organizing, media operation center, athlete village, media village, venue competition team, and referee team? Because we are doing a serious thing.&quot; Sun Jing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;High-intensity physical exercise, the future of e-sports? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Committee E-sports Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We believe that virtual sports can help promote the core values ​​of the Olympic Movement such as excellence, friendship and respect,” said IOC President Bach. “They can inspire young people around the world to participate in sports activities and have active health. lifestyle.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that Bach divided e-sports into three categories: The first category is virtual reality sports, in which there are physical movements and the participants&#39; bodies are faced with (high-intensity) Sports and challenges; the second category involves esports competitions conducted under the rules of international sports federations; and the third category is broader esports.国际奥委会优先考虑的是第一类入奥。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广州体育学院是中国最早开办电竞专业的公办本科高校。王晓东认为，电子竞技分为有身体运动的竞技和非身体运动的竞技，虚拟体育指的是前者。他以模拟赛车举例，使用赛车模拟器的运动强度跟实际赛车并无太大区别。他们曾经举办关于模拟赛车的比赛，参加比赛的孩子个个“精气十足”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王晓东提倡巴赫所说的虚拟体育，他向南方周末记者介绍，学校的电竞课程首先要学体育，并且生源也是传统的体育生。他同时提到这些项目的困难度，目前来看，虚拟体育的市场竞争接受度不算太高，青少年基础相对较弱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相对于虚拟体育，《FIFA Online4》《王者荣耀》《英雄联盟》等非身体运动的电子竞技赛事，显然在市场上有更高的接受度。杭州亚运会的电竞项目，实际上容纳了两个方向，其中既有前者这样的虚拟体育项目，也有后者这样的热门电竞项目。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者了解到，目前国内俱乐部的投入仍然在后者，而非传统的虚拟体育项目。潘婕分析，一个俱乐部的投入项目需要考虑用户基数、市场情况、联赛体系、赛事的观赏性等，目前来看，虚拟体育的发展相对受限。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王国基2023年6月参加了在新加坡举办的奥林匹克电竞周，他有一个很深的感受。在新加坡举办的比赛里，其中9项是虚拟体育项目，例如需要肢体参与的射击、跆拳道、舞蹈游戏等。 “电子设备不断进步以后，人类在现有环境下，电子竞技，特别是虚拟体育成为一种新的运动形式，这个是非常积极健康的，也是未来有很广阔的发展前景的。”王国基认为，人类进入数字时代，会有一些新的运动形式诞生，而且可能远远超过传统的体育运动形式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期以来，人们认为非身体运动的竞技存在一些问题，比如缺乏锻炼的久坐不符合健康精神，同时带来的沉迷隐患也加剧了外界的担忧。不同于传统体育项目，电竞项目很可能受到游戏版权商的影响，这也增加了人们对公平性的怀疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亓昕告诉南方周末记者，如果电竞未来只是在原来游戏的基础上去做一个休闲娱乐活动的话，走向会很受限制：“如果未来我们的电竞还只是一种智力的挑战，我觉得可能会越走越窄。电竞未来选择的方向，是向体育方面发展，而不仅仅基于游戏。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;产业的尽头是文化&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在十八年的相关从业经历中，潘婕认为，电竞行业的发展始终是一个“循序渐进”的过程。其繁荣离不开庞大的用户基础，尤其是年轻人的热情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与过去的“正名”不同，电竞职业化后，“劝退”反而成了重要的事情。 “很多孩子是拿电竞当打游戏的借口，实际上他们既缺乏天赋，又不够努力”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，电子竞技入选雅加达亚运会表演赛，中国代表队取得了两金一银的成绩。 2019年4月1日，人力资源和社会保障部、市场监管总局、统计局正式向社会发布了13个新职业信息，其中与电竞行业相关的新职业有电子竞技运营师、电子竞技员两项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那时候，应舜洁能感受到2018年雅加达亚运会和一系列国际赛事对电竞行业带来的改变。 2018年上半年招聘从业人员，“大多数过来的人都不知道电竞是干什么的，水平也参差不齐”。应舜洁询问他们关于电竞的认识，得到的答案往往就是与游戏挂钩。下半年开始，应舜洁收到了更多的简历，包括一些传统体育从业者也开始加入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应舜洁说，电竞人才缺口巨大，“要求从业者既了解电竞的行业规则，又具备良好的职业技能素养，这在2018年之前是很困难的一件事”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雅加达亚运会四年后，《2022年中国电子竞技产业报告》显示，2022年中国电竞产业收入1445.03亿元，电竞人口规模约4.88亿，全年举办电竞赛事108项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杭州亚组委执行秘书长、杭州市副市长陈卫强在接受媒体专访时坦言，电竞“入亚”更加长远的考量在于产业——通过电竞“入亚”，带动杭州及整个中国电竞产业的发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从游戏的策划、开发到运动员的训练、赛事的组织，还有直转播解说评论，以及大数据的统计，整个电竞产业链非常长，内容非常多。”王国基对南方周末记者说，除了标准化、职业化、国际化，产业化也是非常重要的。受国家人社部委托，电竞委员会制定了电子竞技员国家职业技能标准，编写的相关教材也即将出版。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;潘婕所在的俱乐部曾与法甲足球俱乐部巴黎圣日尔曼合作，她对南方周末记者说，当她来到圣日尔曼主场，发现人们不一定去看足球赛事，但是一定会去俱乐部周边参观，这几乎成为一种城市文化，这给了她很大触动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中央电视台体育频道2004年的一档电视栏目《电子竞技世界》中，有一期，栏目组编了一个情景剧。剧中，主持人前往葡萄牙报道欧洲杯，临行前做了一个奇怪的梦：一些FIFA足球和实况足球的游戏玩家，竟然成了欧洲杯16个国家队的主教练……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个来自二十年前的“预言”。 2023年杭州亚运会，包括《FIFA Online 4》在内的八个电竞项目已经是亚运会正式竞赛项目，9月24日至10月2日,杭州亚运会电竞比赛共将产生7枚金牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（亦枫、陆知安、孙竞为化名。）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;会上，国家广播电视总局副局长杨国瑞介绍，电视“套娃”收费问题治理工作，中央高度关心，人民群众高度关注，广电总局深入贯彻以人民为中心的治理理念，下定决心，举全行业之力，将其作为政治工程、民心工程和系统工程予以解决。目前通过有线电视网络传送的有线电视、通过电信运营商专网传送的IPTV、通过互联网传送的互联网电视OTT形成了三大体系，一方面满足了群众多元化需求，另一方面由于多种市场主体不同程度参与电视的播送和收费，造成了“套娃”收费等问题，给人民群众带来困扰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前段时间专门成立工作组，针对群众反映强烈的收费包数量多、收费主体多元、收费不透明等问题，调研摸排了全部7家互联网电视集成平台、22家电视机厂商、31个省区市的所有IPTV和有线电视，开展了近万用户的问卷调研，与中央网信办、工信部、市场监管总局、中国消费者协会等部门进行沟通，并听取了产业链参与各方的意见和建议。在摸清底数的基础上，按照总体谋划、分步实施、先易后难、试点先行的思路，分三个阶段全力推进治理工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一阶段，今年内逐步实现收费包压减40%，提升消费透明度。第二阶段，明年上半年规范电视运营和收费。第三阶段，明年年底健全有线电视、IPTV、OTT三大业务体系长效管理机制，确保电视“套娃”收费问题“治得住、不反弹”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近已经开始了第一阶段的治理工作，确定了覆盖三大体系的北京歌华有线、山东省网、上海移动、广东电信、吉林联通以及小米电视和海信电视共7家试点单位。指导推动相关企业制定压减、合并收费包，增加订购管理页面，优化免费专区具体实施方案，其中歌华有线已经将14个收费包压减到5个，广东电信IPTV已经将原有10个影视类收费包压减为1个，新出厂的小米电视、海信电视不再预装APK。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;预计到今年10月底，试点单位收费包将压减40%以上，11—12月份在全国范围内开展集中整治，整体压减收费包40%，电视“套娃”收费现象得到显著改观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凤凰传奇粉丝逆龄化？00后为何迷上父母辈偶像]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257629]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
