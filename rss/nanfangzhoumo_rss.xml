The information reported online is true. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After the incident, the Tangfang Town Party Committee and Government promptly organized the beaten child to go to the hospital for examination. After examination, there were no obvious injuries on the body. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The County Education and Sports Bureau has ordered the private kindergarten to fire Zhang Moumou, the teacher who beat the child, and to punish another teacher who was at the scene but failed to dissuade Zhang Moumou from his behavior.

Musk actually proposed to immigrate to Mars?&quot; Xiao Ai was reading an article introducing Musk The article on the Mars Immigration Plan said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes, Musk is indeed an entrepreneur with great imagination and creativity. It is hard to say whether Musk&#39;s plan will succeed, but it is really possible for humans to immigrate to Mars.&quot; Dad continued Over topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Impossible? Do I know that Mars is dry, cold, and airless? It is a desert where living things cannot survive. Crops cannot be grown on Mars. What will the people on Earth eat when they immigrate there? Is it like the movie &quot; Does the protagonist Mark in &quot;The Martian&quot; grow potatoes like that?&quot; Xiao Ai usually reads popular science books and movies about Mars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Growing potatoes on Mars is still a bit far away, but it is not difficult to build a &#39;happy farm&#39; in space. It is also very possible to build a space farm on the moon or Mars in the future.&quot; Dad replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Really? I suddenly became interested in how to build this space farm. Dad, tell me about it!&quot; Xiao Ai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Okay.&quot; Dad Ai said with a little thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Happy Farm&quot; has many benefits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Imagine if you are lucky enough to become an astronaut and have to live alone on the International Space Station for a year Half a year. At first, you look down at the blue earth for a while, and look up at the dazzling starry sky for a while. It feels very beautiful. But as time goes by, will you feel even more lonely in the small space station? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can grow vegetables and flowers in the space station, and watch the seeds slowly grow green buds every day, grow up little by little, blossom and bear fruit, during this period, you can also give Fertilize, water, prune, and pollinate these plants. Record their growth process every day. At the same time, do some experimental records, occasionally take some beautiful photos or videos, and then share them with colleagues, family, and the public on earth. Will it add a lot of fun to your space life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the nutritionists at the space center do their best to prepare delicious and nutritious food for you, the spacecraft&#39;s load is limited after all, so they have to compress and re-compress the food as much as possible to make packaged food. When you eat these packaged foods every day, you will definitely feel monotonous and boring, and the nutrients of these packaged foods, especially vitamin C, vitamin K, etc., will gradually be lost. If from time to time you could eat salads made from fresh vegetables and fruits grown by yourself, wouldn’t that be considered a delicacy in the world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine further that at some time in the future, more and more humans will work, travel or even settle on the moon, Mars and other planets. Will they need a lot of food, which must be transported entirely from the earth? Food costs are going to be very high. If some reusable space farms can be built on the moon, Mars or other planets to grow fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers and even food, providing enough fresh food for human space travelers, it may be an important basis for future interstellar immigration. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cMRt6xzzXGZRNcrSLdt1yiGqvwhtRvha8BQNsRuR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1066&quot; height= &quot;1066&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cMRt6xzzXGZRNcrSLdt1yiGqvwhtRvha8BQNsRuR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252163&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zinnias planted by astronauts on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Growing vegetables in space has become commonplace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Human beings The unknown world is full of curiosity, and human exploration of the vast universe has never stopped. Since taking the first step into outer space, humans have begun to explore the impact of the space environment on various animals, plants and even microorganisms. Whether plants can grow in the space environment and whether they can provide fresh food for space travelers. Especially after the completion of the space station, astronauts have enough space and time to help scientists on earth answer these questions, and also add some fun and nutrition to the astronauts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1982, astronauts on the Soviet Salyut 7 space station used a miniature greenhouse device to conduct the first &quot;from seed to seed&quot; full life cycle cultivation experiment of Arabidopsis thaliana, proving that plants on earth can be Growth and seeding outside the earth have opened up human attempts to grow vegetables, flowers, and grains in space. In the following ten years, Soviet astronauts completed space cultivation experiments of various plants. However, these plants grown in space were not for human consumption, but were limited to scientific research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is American astronauts who actually grow vegetables to eat in space. In order to allow astronauts to eat fresh vegetables, fruits or other fresh foods, NASA has developed some plant cultivation devices, such as the vegetable production system Veggie and the advanced plant habitat APH. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The vegetable production system is a small plant growth device suitable for space stations that can automatically provide light, water, air and nutrients for vegetable growth. It is only the size of a suitcase and can generally grow 6 types of vegetables. . Since 2014, American astronauts have used vegetable production systems on the International Space Station to cultivate lettuce, Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard, zinnias and other plants. Some of them are for scientific research, and some are used by astronauts. Eat it as a salad, I heard it tastes great. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The advanced plant habitat is a more complex, more automated, fully enclosed plant growth device equipped with cameras and more than 180 sensors that can monitor light, temperature, humidity, atmospheric content, etc. Sensing and controlling, and staying connected to the ground laboratory so that observations and research can be carried out simultaneously on the ground and the space station. Advanced plant habitat installations enable more complex, diverse, and long-term plant growth studies. So far, American astronauts have used this device to conduct full life cycle cultivation experiments of Arabidopsis thaliana, dwarf wheat, radish, pepper and other plants. The pepper planting test is the longest and most &quot;stimulating&quot; test among them. After more than three months of growth, the pepper seeds have gone through the entire process of germination, flowering, fruiting, and maturity. In November 2021, after the peppers matured, the astronauts stored part of them and left them for ground laboratories to conduct follow-up analysis and research, while the other parts were made into delicacies by them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1032&quot; height= &quot;688&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/ZOmrdJMaHYfre5mMIu8NlOZMBXsOfVQDFKQj0KOM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Astronauts pose with the peppers they grow on the International Space Station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rice bears seeds on the Chinese space station&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Shenzhou The first manned flight on the 5th, Yutu&#39;s visit to the moon, Zhurong&#39;s inspection of Mars, the &quot;reunion in space&quot; of the Chinese space station... The booming Chinese aerospace industry has also injected new vitality into the exploration of space farms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2019, a mysterious scientific device was transported to the far side of the moon by the Chinese lunar probe Chang&#39;e-4, where it was performing an important mission. This scientific device was developed by scientists from Chongqing University and contains four kinds of seeds, including cotton, rape, potato, and Arabidopsis, as well as two animal eggs, yeast and fruit fly. After landing on the far side of the moon, the seeds that were originally dormant began to wake up and enter growth and development mode. Within nine days, the seeds began to germinate, and the cotton seeds also sprouted buds. Although the germination of cotton seeds on the moon is just a flash in the pan, this is the first green leaf to grow on the moon. Perhaps in the near future, more plants will sprout, bloom and bear fruit on the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the newly built Chinese space station, Chinese astronauts started longer-term plant growth experiments. This time the test subjects were Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. As we all know, rice originated in China and is one of China&#39;s main food crops. No one has ever conducted a full life cycle cultivation experiment of rice in space before. During the four-month test, both Arabidopsis and rice successfully completed the entire life cycle of seed germination, seedling growth, flowering and seeding, proving that rice can grow on the space station. However, scientists have observed that many indicators of rice grown on the space station are significantly different from rice grown on the ground, such as earlier flowering period, longer grain filling time, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rice generally has the ability to regenerate. The rice stalks left behind after normal harvest can also grow rice ears, thus increasing rice yield. This experiment also observed the regeneration ability of rice on the space station. As a result, more than 20 days after the rice was harvested, a rice plant on the space station also regenerated and grew two rice ears, indicating that regenerating rice is feasible in a small closed environment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our country has achieved world-leading scientific and technological achievements in the field of aerospace breeding. It is believed that with the in-depth development of aerospace projects such as the China Space Station, the Moon Landing Project and the Planetary Exploration Project, our country’s astronauts will be in a wider field. Grow vegetables, flowers, and crops in space to bring fresh, nutritious and delicious food to future space travelers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;806&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Km6QSDoE6uvnXPxyRos0LJ1iz8pZkqoCacoyIswX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252164&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rice seeds growing in the Chinese space station. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How far is it from the real space farm&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, so far So far, these plant cultivation experiments conducted in the space station have been extremely small-scale. It is a huge challenge to actually build a space farm, and there are still many problems that need to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the moon or Mars, the harsh environment is not suitable for plant growth at all. Therefore, the first step in building a space farm is to build a large-scale intelligently controlled greenhouse facility, similar to the intelligent greenhouses built on the earth, so that Plants have &quot;houses&quot; to live in. First of all, this greenhouse facility is completely airtight, can maintain stable temperature, and can protect plants and humans from cosmic rays. Secondly, this greenhouse facility is suitable for remote control, which requires full monitoring of the growth process of plants and timely control of temperature and light. , atmosphere, moisture and nutrients are precisely controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to allow the plants to &quot;eat and drink&quot; to maintain the operation of plant life and the operation of the entire greenhouse facility. The main power for greenhouse operation comes from solar power generation. This technology is not difficult, but it is a big problem to provide the necessary soil, nutrients, water, atmosphere, etc. for plant growth. Soil mainly provides support and nutrients for the growth of plant roots. Studies have shown that plants can grow in lunar soil or volcanic ash, but they will grow more slowly than in earth soil. In addition to soil, hydroponics can also be used. This smart greenhouse is relatively common on the earth. Of course, hydroponics requires a lot of water. The moon and Mars are both dry planets with little water and require artificial synthesis. This means that water must be accurately distributed to plants according to their needs. Plants also need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are needed for plant growth. These need to be synthesized or extracted by making full use of raw materials on the planet where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;housing&quot; and &quot;food and drink&quot; problems are solved, the protagonist can be invited out. At this time, it is very important to choose what kind of plants to plant. Not all plants are suitable for space farms. First, these candidate plants must be able to adapt to the unfavorable conditions of space, such as microgravity, high radiation, large temperature differences, lack of water and fertilizer; secondly, candidate plants should be rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients to provide space for astronauts, space tourists or settlers. Supplement additional nutrients; in addition, candidate plants should have the characteristics of short growth cycle, small space occupation, and easy management. In addition to selecting existing plant varieties, in the future, scientists may tailor special plant varieties for space farms, such as potatoes that are more suitable for growing in Martian ash, tomatoes that grow better under microgravity conditions, etc. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, each plant to be grown on the space farm needs to be carefully selected and passed simulation tests in ground laboratories to accurately calculate the nutrients, moisture, atmosphere, light, etc. required for its growth. , in order to minimize the waste of resources in space. It is worth mentioning that NASA assigned this part of the work to middle school students. NASA has launched a &quot;Growing Beyond Earth&quot; public welfare program, inviting middle school students across the United States to participate in space plant growth research and select plants suitable for planting on the International Space Station. As of December 2022, more than 40,000 middle school students and their instructors have participated in this activity, and screening tests of more than 180 types of plants have been carried out, and pak choi grown on the vegetable production system is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China’s manned moon landing plan is being steadily implemented, and the U.S. government also plans to return to the moon. Musk even proposed to build a self-sufficient city on Mars around 2050, and it is possible for humans to settle outside the earth. The day seems to be getting closer, when the construction of space farms is an indispensable link, which requires future scientists around the world to continue to improve space farms, maybe you can also participate in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[书籍背后，隐形的人：宁成春的六十年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257645]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/25/xIbJ7A8GZuLEmVxoLbqkz1CUXdwzffSWAxpGpWcn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1067&quot; height=&quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/xIbJ7A8GZuLEmVxoLbqkz1CU XdwzffSWAxpGpWcn. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ning Chengchun, a book designer who is over eighty years old, has spent nearly a decade in his design career , more than 1,500 books were born from his hands, which is almost equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81-year-old book binding designer Ning Chengchun is still living the life of an office worker . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he has work, Ning Chengchun takes the bus to and from his studio in Chaoyang, working from nine to five. In 2002, he retired from Sanlian Bookstore and established his own studio. Retirement just means changing places and continuing to design books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When drawing design drawings, Ning Chengchun&#39;s sitting posture was the same as when he was young: his back was straight, his shoulder blades were arched, and his head was slightly bent. He is still used to wearing shirts. The biggest change in his appearance is that he has grown a silvery white beard and trimmed it neatly after getting older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various books, a computer, and a pot of tea on his work table. Through the window on the left, sunlight pours in. The computer was for the assistant. Ning Chengchun used pens, rulers, and grid paper. The covers and layouts that were drawn by hand were handed to the assistant and turned into computer files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two book walls in the studio, and one of the bookshelves contains books he designed himself. In August 2023, he published the collection &quot;A Person&#39;s History of Book Design&quot;. In his nearly one year of design career, he has produced more than 1,500 books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These sixty years are equivalent to a history of contemporary Chinese publishing. In 1986, after Sanlian Bookstore resumed its independent establishment, Ning Chengchun became the first director of the art department. His works outline the historical changes of Sanlian Bookstore. The &quot;Reading and Writing Series&quot; closely related to the publisher Fan Yong established the ideological banner of the 1980s; &quot;Huai Ju Shi Cun&quot; and &quot;Bathing&quot; designed for Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang set a precedent for writing books for a large number of scholars. ; &quot;Collection of Jin Yong&#39;s Works&quot; has made countless fans of Jin Yong bow and remain unforgettable to this day; &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; inspired the &quot;Chen Yinke craze&quot; in the 1990s; the &quot;Local China&quot; series has led the creation of &quot;picture books&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of the editor of Sanlian Bookstore, Ning Chengchun is not old at all. When he has an important manuscript, he still asks him to contribute as he has done for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the balcony, a Monstera deliciosa grows as tall as a person. It was given to Ning Chengchun by his colleagues when he was hospitalized in 2008. Assistant Hu Changyue met Ning Chengchun in 2006. At that time, Ning Chengchun was working hard. At most, he hired 6 assistants to cooperate with the design. During his hospitalization, Ning Chengchun was still drawing layouts even in the hospital bed. The nurse reminded him to stop drawing and take a good rest. Within a week of his heart bypass surgery, he was back in the studio. &quot;If you can&#39;t do it in a day, you can do it for half a day.&quot; Hu Changyue recalled to a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second year after the operation, Ning Chengchun decided to close his studio, but many people continued to approach him for design, but the number of orders was reduced, and the work did not really stop. In 2019, Ning Chengchun underwent another heart stent surgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the collection of works has been published and is selling well, he wants to &quot;retire&quot; as soon as possible, writing, painting, and reading books that he had no time to read before. But when someone asked him to design some books, he still couldn&#39;t bear to refuse. The National Library wanted to publish &quot;The Complete Collection of Dunhuang Documents&quot;, and he agreed, &quot;This is a very important book. You can&#39;t just watch it fail.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Changyue said that Ning Chengchun received the invitation, I was actually very happy in my heart, but my body really couldn’t bear it. The job of declining various design invitations was left to Hu Changyue. When faced with requests from others, Ning Chengchun would most likely nod, &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun likes natural, folk and humanistic things. The books in his studio are dotted with various traditional artifacts he collected: blue and white porcelain, Pixiu stone carvings, and paper-cuts. His collection is all based on hobbies and nothing expensive or rare. While out hunting, I saw the cute porcelain bowls in farmers’ homes, so I bought a few from the local second-hand market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He took out a set of picture albums that he bought from the Panjiayuan Secondhand Bookstore. They were all full of line-drawn bronzes. He had bought a 32-karat version before and the pictures were very small. This set has a large format and the decorations are clear at a glance. &quot;Actually, there were many good things in ancient times.&quot; Ning Chengchun murmured. In the past twenty years, he has experimented with various traditional patterns, either using them on the spine of books or using a continuous square pattern as the background of the cover. His designs have become increasingly quaint and solemn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ning Chengchun’s eyes, utensils are used by ordinary people in their daily lives. They are made by unknown craftsmen and may look humble, but they have the beauty of everyday life. Books are utensils that serve people, and they should also have &quot;the beauty of utensils.&quot; Literary theorist Chao Wen once said, &quot;The art of binding is the soul of book aesthetics.&quot; Ning Chengchun deeply agrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1156&quot; height= &quot;1600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/w6CnLaxNeAhI3NTtNyendEzVb4nrAsxVucvuSfKU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252130&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1985, Ning Chengchun was at Kodansha Japan. In the 1980s, he went to Japan twice for further study, allowing Ning Chengchun to truly and systematically study design, and his design concepts were in line with the world. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;This is what this book should look like&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;A variety of teas are placed on the dining table in the studio. Ning Chengchun always makes a cup of tea when guests visit. The book designer&#39;s studio is also a living room. Editors, printing staff, and suppliers often come to the door. Ning Chengchun has long been accustomed to switching between putting down and picking up design drafts at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At home, the time after getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night is the quietest time. Ning Chengchun likes to conceive designs at these moments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After visiting his studio, Zhang Lixian, the founder of Duku, said: &quot;The designers I have come into contact with are all very good-tempered. I think it is because they communicate too much with editors and are polished. I have a good temper.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of Ning Chengchun&#39;s early masterpieces, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, designed 12 drafts, three or four plans each time, and submitted it for review several times before it was approved. The highest record is a book on international trade, with 20 drafts designed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the plan was called back, what Ning Chengchun thought was, &quot;Maybe because I didn&#39;t understand the book or didn&#39;t meet his ideas, I will continue to do it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mindset Only if you are better can you persist for sixty years.&quot; Ning Chengchun attributed this to his family influence. His brother was labeled as a rightist, and the family lost income. His mother taught him from an early age to work seriously, argue for words, and talk less. No matter at school or at work, Ning Chengchun was used to working hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun entered the industry in his early days, all he could think about was design. When he woke up every morning, his mind was already spinning even before he was fully awake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many political movements at that time. When a book was published by a publishing house, all the art editors would design it, and then choose from many designs. In other words, it may be in vain. Ning Chengchun didn&#39;t care about this and just kept busy. He is the youngest but has been selected the most times. For many years, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1992, when he designed the book &quot;Yixing Zisha Appreciation&quot;, Ning Chengchun had no knowledge of Zisha teapots and tea. He and his photographer traveled to 24 places across the country to take photos of classic Zisha teapots. Due to the limitations of technology at that time, many of the negatives produced were color cast, but Ning Chengchun had seen and touched all the teapots, and listened to the explanations of Gu Jingzhou, an expert on purple clay teapots, so he repeatedly adjusted the color tone of the layout with the plate maker based on his feeling and memory. When printing at the printing factory, Ning Chengchun woke up once every hour and 15 minutes to supervise the color effects, and stared at it for four days and nights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Post-80s designers Xu Yijun and Ning Chengchun went to the printing factory together. During the book printing process, color shades or technical details may not be completely accurate, and some differences are difficult to discern with the naked eye. Designers need to be on-site to help solve the problem. Printing was done all night long, and Ning Chengchun sometimes had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the workshop to look at the samples. Now that he was old, Xu Yijun and other young designers persuaded him to take a rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Changyue&#39;s eyes, Ning Chengchun&#39;s rigor in publications was beyond imagination. Once when a picture book was being produced, the quality of a picture was not good enough. The editor said that there was only this picture and there was no way to replace it. Ning Chengchun said sternly that if a higher quality picture could not be found, this picture must be used for publication. , he stopped doing it. Finally, he and the editor rummaged through the box and found the negative of the picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiaming, former deputy editor-in-chief of Sanlian, compared book design to building a house, “After a book editor has worked hard to compile a good book, he will always consciously or unconsciously imagine what the designer will design it to look like. ”, and the designer arranges the graphics and text content appropriately to create a reading space that looks attractive from the outside, allowing readers to walk in without any obstacles and is pleasing to the eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A manuscript is just a stack of paper. To form a book, it must be designed. The quality of the design has a great influence on the book.&quot; Ning Chengchun said that after the book is finished, others will read it and feel that it is a good book. It should look like this, and he would be happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height= &quot;1302&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c0sy4P7398JfwDUR9toiBjcD4ECRxLJT3qVHMq4X.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;When he entered the industry in his early days, Ning Chengchun designed sixty or seventy books a year. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Design is not just a cover&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Ning Chengchun loved books. When he was in middle school, Yang Shuo&#39;s generation of writers came into public view. He read many Chinese literary works. At that time, Tianjin People&#39;s Publishing House and Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House were publishing with high quality, which he still remembers today. Many small books published by Baihua Literature and Art are &quot;very lively and have illustrations. The illustrations of Zhang Deyu and Wang Guofeng are very famous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun’s eldest brother taught art in school. Under his influence, Ning Chengchun liked painting since he was a child. Mass cultural and artistic activities are also active in Tianjin. Ning Chengchun took the painting class of the district cultural center and went to the old house with several floors to paint in his spare time every week. When he was in junior high school, he published some sketches in newspapers and periodicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His first choice in the college entrance examination was the printmaking department. Printmaking played a propaganda role in various movements during the Anti-Japanese War and the early days of the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It was &quot;down-to-earth and not too lofty.&quot; At that time, many book illustrations were created by printmakers, and he also hoped to work in a publishing house. In the end, he was admitted to his second choice and entered the Decoration Department of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. Three years later, he was transferred to the book art major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, there was no systematic modern design teaching in China, and most of what Ning Chengchun came into contact with was painting education. For those who study painting, they prefer design literature books, political economic philosophy books, and can only do abstract designs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He clearly remembers the first academic book he designed, &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;. The philosophy book was difficult to understand, and I couldn’t use too concrete paintings to express it. I designed many drafts, but they didn’t pass. Ning Chengchun went to the publishing house&#39;s library to look through the collection of paintings, searching for modern paintings from Wittgenstein&#39;s period, trying to figure out the relationship between Mondrian and others&#39; paintings and philosophy, and finally applied large color blocks to the cover design. Later, when designing a series of triplex academic books, Ning Chengchun would start with abstract patterns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun asked Ning Chengchun why his contemporaries who studied design changed careers one after another, but he persisted. Ning Chengchun thought for a moment and replied, maybe because he went to Japan to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun truly and systematically studied design when he went to Japan for further study twice in 1984 and 1986. In Japan, Ning Chengchun personally studied design masters Sugiura Shohei and Manabe Kazuo, and took up basic design courses to integrate with the world in design concepts. At that time, all domestic design relied on painting, and no one knew how to use grids. Ning Chengchun returned from his studies and helped Sanlian usher in the era of picture books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Ning Chengchun’s graduation to 1995, nearly thirty years of the printing era, all design was done by hand. With the advent of computers, printing was gradually eliminated, and he was still used to designing on paper first. Ning Chengchun did not know how to operate a computer. At that time, the computer company next to the publishing house had five computers. He sat in the middle, drew the layout, and directed five assistants to use the computers to complete the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Designers of Lu Mingjing’s generation basically complete the entire design process on the computer, while Ning Chengchun still maintains the habit of manual grid design. It was pictures and books that prompted Lu Mingjing to learn from Ning Chengchun. The first task she received was to design Jiang Xun&#39;s &quot;History of Chinese Art for Everyone&quot;. The pictures were many and the text was fragmented, and the layout was difficult to form a block, which was very unsightly. Facing such a book, Lu Mingjing, who had just entered the industry, was confused. Wang Jiaming suggested that she go to Ning Chengchun&#39;s studio to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun took out several pieces of octavo paper, a ruler, and a pen, and showed Lu Mingjing how to use a grid to draw a layout, and accurately calculate the number of words on each page and the size of the pictures. &quot;The pictures and text information are all controlled on the manuscript paper, instead of pushing it page by page, and falling into the dilemma of having to redo the entire book if a few pictures are changed.&quot; Lu Mingjing realized that the seemingly backward grid design , actually has its own advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While studying at Sugiura Kohei&#39;s studio, Ning Chengchun understood the meaning of what he said: &quot;A book is a universe.&quot; Later, Ning Chengchun introduced Sugiura Kohei&#39;s theory for the first time in China. Sugiura Kohei emphasized the overall design and the core position of the book binding designer in the book design process, &quot;from the layout of the text, text, font, font size, title, table of contents, title page, cover, letter sleeve, belt to the copyright page, and the design of All paper and material selections, and printing and binding process settings are within the scope of the book designer&#39;s responsibilities. Modern book design concepts were promoted in China, and everyone began to understand that design is not just about making a cover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Yijun observed that in the early days of Ning Chengchun’s design career, design was often regarded as a vassal and branch of painting and lacked independence. As one of the first batch of book designers to study in Japan, Ning Chengchun mastered the professionalism of design. Coupled with his &quot;persistent pursuit of the design profession, including personal talents and opportunities&quot;, multiple factors superimposed to support his departure. Come down. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“I did what I should do for this book”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Ning Chengchun came back from Japan, he was over forty and his hair began to turn gray. When he made &quot;Chen Yinke&#39;s Last 20 Years&quot; in 1995, his hair turned gray overnight. The 200,000-word manuscript that fascinated him was once stolen along with his backpack. Ning Chengchun couldn&#39;t describe the pain. In just a few days, regret and guilt turned his hair white. Fortunately, two weeks later, the thief who took away the wages left the manuscript at the door of the neighborhood committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun chose a black cover for this book because both the content itself and the author&#39;s writing made him feel the intensity of emotion and the depression of the atmosphere. He compressed the catalog together, arranged it into an upside-down, fragmented, and disorderly combination, and placed it on the top of the cover to express the condensation of the last 20 years of the author&#39;s life. The photo of Chen Yinke on the lower right was one that Ning Chengchun spotted at a glance from many photos - his eyes were blind, but still bright, and he was holding the crutch tightly with both hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It particularly represents Mr. Chen&#39;s spiritual atmosphere in his later years, lonely and determined, as if staring at us descendants in the heavy shadow of history.&quot; He believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Hua, the person in charge of Shenzhen Shangshu Bar, has collected more books designed by Ning Chengchun than Ning Chengchun himself. He began to pay attention to book binding design in the 1990s and found that each book presented a different state. Sanlian&#39;s books were quite different from other publishing houses, being more elegant and heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Hua’s view, Ning Chengchun’s designs reveal a unique Chinese spirit. &quot;His creative language has absorbed the essence of traditional binding very well. He has taken deep roots. He also caught up with the reform and opening up. He went to Japan to study twice and learned modern techniques. He is not conservative at all, which is even more rare.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Ning Chengchun often thinks about how to distinguish each book when designing. Every book is unique. To design well, a designer must first understand the author&#39;s thoughts and feelings, and then convey this understanding to readers through book binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you encounter a book that attracts you, the design is often more inspiring. Ning Chengchun was very moved after reading &quot;Fu Shan&#39;s World&quot;. The author Bai Qianshen is an art history scholar. He originally studied international politics, but turned to calligraphy after studying in the United States. He tells the story of Fu Shan&#39;s ideological changes by examining the society in the late Ming Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When designing, Ning Chengchun used Fu Shan’s calligraphy works as the background. In a chaotic night sky, those characters slightly emitted seven-color light, as if flying from the depths of history, ancient and modern. The book has a wide influence and is constantly reprinted. Bai Qianshen highly approves of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I did what I should do for this book.” When Ning Chengchun talks about these books that he has never forgotten, his words can go very far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The understanding between designers and authors sometimes extends from books to reality. After retiring from Sanlian in 2002, Ning Chengchun received direct invitations from many authors. Wang Yuanhua and Zhong Shuhe both wrote letters asking him to design. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relic expert Wang Shixiang asked a publishing house to design &quot;Jin Hui Hei&quot;. When printing, he found that the design format was wrong and could not be printed. He found Ning Chengchun for help. &quot;At that time, he had just lost the sight in his left eye, and he was so anxious that he was really trusting him with his life.&quot; The two became friends from then on. Wang Shixiang sometimes went to the Sanlian Art Studio to look at design drafts and invited Ning Chengchun to have dinner downstairs. Ning Chengchun once witnessed Wang Shixiang instructing the chef to improve the taste of eel paste. The next time he went back, the store made it according to his method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这已不仅是看书稿，书稿的要害、作者的趣味都到了门儿清的地步。”汪家明感慨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;香港三联版王世襄《明式家具研究》图文分卷，宁成春嫌其翻阅不便，设计此书时，他将文字叙述、图片解说、图版重新整合。王世襄的夫人袁荃猷为这本书做了大量工作，可惜没等书设计完，她就离世了。宁成春知道王、袁一生相伴，恩重情深，临时增改了设计。封面他选了黑色衬底，中间用白色烫金印袁荃猷绘制的线描床样。函套封面上设计了两把明式椅子，一把是实物照片，一把是袁荃猷线描图稿，仿佛二人天上人间，隔世晤对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;章华被宁成春设计的王世襄一系列著作打动：“年轻一代对王世襄的追求、事功不是很了解。能够把它很完美地呈现出来，内容与形式完全统一，那是非常难的，是充分理解之后才能设计出来的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有些书籍没能按照他的想法实行，也会成为宁成春念叨的遗憾。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;设计《鲁迅手稿全集》时，他希望将鲁迅纪念馆前的雕像——更自然、生活化的模样——用3D成像技术放到封面上。做出来的效果很不错，但出版社最终还是选择了更稳妥的方案，用了课本里鲁迅的黑白照。宁成春觉得，设计本可以更新颖，现在已不是“横眉冷对”的年代了，“鲁迅的人生很难，有脆弱的一面”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这也没办法，你是乙方嘛，人家是甲方。”宁成春笑笑，话锋又一转，“不过这个形式以后遇到合适的人还会用，一定要合适，一般的人也不合适。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;克服孤独就很难&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;宁成春给鲁明静展示过一个速写本，是他大学去参加四清运动时随身带着的，画下了沿途乡下的风景。从北京城里徒步穿越郊区，直到河北乡下，得走两三百里地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春告诉她，现在也能走。鲁明静问，怎么走啊？宁成春说，安排一辆车，咱们就走，行李都放车上。你跟我走吗？鲁明静满口答应，心里想，嚯，还要重走一遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“凡是这种超出常人做的事儿，他都会鼓励你。”鲁明静发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，他俩一同见过一位斫琴师。工坊在偏远的小山上，一个小茅草屋。他与弟子做的古琴价格不菲，足以让他们遗世独立，不为生计奔波。宁成春鼓励鲁明静：“你要成为这样的人！”鲁明静那时刚刚工作，有些迷茫，她理解他话中的意思——身怀绝技了，便不需再迷茫出世还是入世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多宁成春的同代设计师都已成了画家、艺术家，徐弈君问过同样擅画的宁成春，他想不想成为艺术家，宁成春回答得很坚定：没有，就是一直要做设计师。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐弈君学设计时，同学们普遍认为设计不会是终身职业，“都用脚投票，都走了嘛”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;设计长期以来被视为实用美术，在重道轻器的传统思想中不受重视，艺术家与设计师在社会身份上有霄壤之别。徐弈君提起中国设计行业的断层，像宁成春这一代还在做书的40后，屈指可数。 “老辈的设计师虽然很少，但是还有，这个太宝贵了，要不然就很孤独。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纸质书已然夕阳行业，学平面设计，可以转做互联网产品设计，收入更高。徐弈君说，纸质书利润不大，许多设计公司都是批量生产，“如果花那么多时间去做，可能难以生存”。宁成春这代设计师，在每一本书上花费大量心血，实属难得。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鲁明静曾把书籍设计师分为哲学家、工程师、艺术家等不同类型和风格，宁成春选择的是与张扬自我的艺术家相背的路。他身上有激越的一面，但他甘于把自我缩小，将自己的名字隐没在一本本书的背后。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春在书里、采访中都强调了一件事。第八届全国书籍设计艺术展览上，一位日本设计理论家看了展品，说一个作者花许多时间写了书，如果设计者在这本书里夹杂个人的东西，是对文本作者极大的不尊重。 “这种现象在八展的展品上很普遍，就是脱离文本，或者强加文本出一些东西，为了吸引眼球，为了个人的炫技，不是为书，不是为文本，这种纯艺术的倾向，他说这是对书、作者的不尊重，但是没有人重视。”宁成春对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不符合自己理念的事情，宁成春总是不留情面地直陈。在一次赛事中，宁成春做评审，觉得其中程序很不合理，指出后也无改变，最后愤然退场走人。 “年轻人评奖……太讲名利了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于浮躁功利的风气，宁成春很警觉。 “功利放在最前面，所有东西都是为了功利，这就不行了。”在日本，他见过很多大学生出来做木工，也很好。社会不该如此单一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者到访时，宁成春手边在做雷殿生的书。对这位穿越罗布泊第一人，十年走遍中国的徒步者，宁成春很钦佩。他徒步的1990年代末，正值经济腾飞，各行各业都在赚钱。雷殿生却准备了十年，所有细节都提前预想，有计划、有能力，“他完全靠一个人，克服很多困难。首先克服孤独就很难的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春总让徐弈君想起鲁迅的话：巨大的建筑，总是由一木一石叠起来的，我们何妨做做这一木一石呢？我时常做些零碎的事，就是为此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“大家都想做惊天动地的事情，有英雄主义的想法，做这些平凡的事情是没有什么意义的。但是现在也不这么认为了。”徐弈君说，许多伟大的古代建筑，比如故宫，正是无名工匠设计的，“做普通的书也很重要，踏踏实实做事情。”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徐弈君去年和宁成春一起工作了很长时间，他发现，不管去到哪个城市，宁成春身边总带着要设计的书，“一直看，一直看，吃了饭躺在床上，再把稿子拿出来读一下。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宁成春总说，一生只做一件事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，徐弈君、章华为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[傅首尔与老刘闹离婚说明了什么？“全职丈夫”难以得到尊重]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257545]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The divorce between Fu Seoul and Lao Liu on the show made the variety show earn enough traffic, but it still It is a soap opera in life. Although it cannot be said to be a bad drama, it is also a plot that many people like me don&#39;t like to watch at all. Even so, we can still learn enough &quot;lessons&quot; from this incident. One of them is that men should be &quot;full-time husbands/full-time dads&quot; because society&#39;s acceptance of this is too low and it is difficult to be respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Seoul and Lao Liu have experienced &quot;poor and lowly couples suffer all kinds of sorrows&quot; and can be regarded as a couple in need. After Fu Seoul rose to prominence through &quot;Qi Pa Shuo&quot;, Lao Liu began his career as a complete &quot;full-time husband&quot; and the source of Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. In terms of the height an individual can achieve, Fu Seoul is definitely a strong woman and a successful person who uses knowledge and eloquence to embark on a unique track. There is no doubt about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Lao Liu returned to the family and became a full-time husband, the good stories about their marriage have existed on the Internet for a long time. Every time he participates in the show, Fu Seoul will almost always talk about how good Lao Liu is to him. Fu Seoul and Lao Liu had divorced once before. Later, they remarried. The reason was that Fu Seoul, who was on the rise in his career, had a mess in his work and life after the divorce. Fu Seoul also publicly described this marriage as &quot;the best marriage I could ever encounter.&quot; If this is the case, then why should we go to that step again at this time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because, the status and relationship between the two people are no longer what they used to be. The ancient saying that &quot;time and status change people&quot; must also exist in marriage relationships. The &quot;economic ability determines family status&quot; that today&#39;s people lament is actually the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Lao Liu has advanced in the life of a stay-at-home husband to the point where Fu Seoul kicks him and &quot;knows it&#39;s time to pour out the water&quot;, and Fu Seoul asks Lao Liu to throw away the garbage even though there is a trash can next to him. , they will never &quot;go back&quot;. Regarding the happiness of marriage, there are only feelings left. &quot;I can guarantee that my husband is very happy to be a stay-at-home dad, and I can make money to support the family.&quot; When Fu Seoul said this, Lao Liu was experiencing the most difficult time. This shows that Fu Seoer no longer understands his husband. And Lao Liu also lost himself in being misunderstood and became a symbol. Although he said that he didn&#39;t mind being used as a joke and ridiculed by Fu Seoul on the show, the subtext I realized was: The premise is that you have to respect me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, what did Fu Seoul say? She said: Do you know why a person keeps making salted fish? Because he is suitable to be a salty fish. Once the belief of not seeking improvement is formed, he will even breathe slower than others. You should not push him, because there is no harm if there are no expectations. Of course, there is an element of &quot;program need&quot; in such a statement, but too many details have already revealed that Fu Seoul is increasingly intolerant of Liu&#39;s &quot;not seeking to improve&quot;. She may not even realize that she has regarded Liu as a Stephen Chow It&#39;s a waste of words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger wrote: Lao Liu was forced to struggle by Fu Seoul. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu became the material for Fu Seoul&#39;s jokes. Which full-time housewife has experienced this? Lao Liu needs to report accounts to Fu Seoul. How many full-time housewives have experienced this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is indeed not necessarily true. For example, some jokesters will also &quot;operate&quot; on their wives, but overall, Lao Liu&#39;s experience is indeed the real experience of &quot;full-time husbands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, an old acquaintance quit his job and became a full-time &quot;housewife&quot; because he had to take care of his children. Although he talked about the pleasure of having a lot of free time when he was drinking with us, in his heart, he became increasingly intolerable to a life where he had to look at his wife&#39;s face even for pocket money and clothes. This is the same thing as the case where Lao Liu wanted to buy clothes he liked but because Fu Seoul didn&#39;t like them, his expectations were wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All the shocking details do not appear out of thin air and have no direction. To put it bluntly, whether it is Lao Liu or some &quot;house men&quot;, they have lost the respect of their wives and been rejected, which has become a normal feature of life. It’s hard to imagine how long this kind of lack of understanding and respect can last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people didn’t understand Lao Liu’s complaints, thinking it was pretentious and something he did in his spare time. But if the identity were to be changed - if the husband had all kinds of dislikes and restrictions on the stay-at-home wife, wouldn&#39;t many people be upset? In addition, if a stay-at-home housewife complains that she is under great pressure, she is often sympathized with, but you see, after Lao Liu’s difficulties were revealed, many people accused him of not knowing how to be blessed despite being blessed, and of not being considerate of Fu who worked hard outside. Seoul. What a double standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference between a full-time wife and a full-time husband exists objectively. Simply put, stay-at-home wives are more tolerated, while stay-at-home husbands are not. This nature has transcended the scope of a family. The pressure faced by that old acquaintance was not limited to his wife, but also came from the strange looks from the people around him. Some netizens also mentioned various bitternesses when commenting on Fu Seoul and Lao Liu&#39;s divorce. For example, no matter how you explain the &quot;force majeure&quot; of being a stay-at-home husband, you may still be regarded as a &quot;soft ricer.&quot; I would like to ask, have women been looked down upon as &quot;soft rice eaters&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When traditional social concepts have shaped men into &quot;family breadwinners and family responsibility bearers&quot;, in the eyes of some people, it is unforgivable for men to return to the family. This proves that men actually lack the public opinion environment to become full-time husbands. If you do it accidentally, you have to change it. A male compatriot I know started working odd jobs after being unemployed for many days and relying on his wife to support the family. He didn&#39;t make much money and was still looked down upon by his wife, but at least he could &quot;straighten his back a little&quot; in front of his neighbors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that marriage is based on love. Isn’t marriage based on respect? First, if a man really needs to be a full-time husband, the prerequisite must be that he can be respected by his family and society. Since being a full-time wife is a job for a woman, it is also a job for a man to be a full-time husband. He should not be labeled as &quot;eating soft food&quot; or &quot;receiving charity&quot;. Secondly, since the concept that men cannot eat soft rice is still solidified, then a man must think clearly whether his choice is appropriate, whether he can withstand the pressure caused by it in the future, and whether there is a better choice than being a full-time husband. Options? The reality is cruel. When the subtlety and even contradictions in the relationship between husband and wife gradually become apparent due to one&#39;s &quot;full-time&quot; choice, can one calmly bear the consequences of being unhappy or even being confused? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[去珠峰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257428]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gZ8MqmWkWhwE91TzmJdUkCKkearqzv7ohY6Hk2KN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2434&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gZ8MqmWkWhwE91TzmJdUkCKkearq zv7ohY6Hk2KN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251363&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Dingri County, Shigatse, Tibet, overlooking Mount Everest from Rongbuk Temple&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going to Mount Everest requires a border defense permit.

This place is vast and magnificent, with nature’s generous gifts in inaccessible places, uncanny craftsmanship, and orderly order. But apart from these kind words, I was first shocked by the harsh natural environment in southwestern Tibet. It is vast but also desolate, strange mountains are also obstacles, and it is difficult to maintain its original style and economic development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I suddenly understood why I would enjoy honors and awards after returning from aiding Tibet, and why the Tibetan director Kashenga told the story of Tibetans and modernization.

There are only fluctuations of heat waves.&quot; Director Wanma wrote in the novel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before arriving in Tibet, I had interviewed many members of the Everest scientific expedition team. One night, I was sitting and chatting with a geographer on the playground of Lanzhou University. He told a thrilling story about the scientific expedition on Mount Everest: a strong man with severe altitude sickness was lifted off a relay from an altitude of 6,300 meters. He got lost in the dark, snow fell on Mount Everest, and dangers arose one after another. He talked about the accident on the plateau, and I added: Wanma Tseden also died on the plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geographers were surprised that director Wanma passed away in May. At that time, they were conducting scientific research on Mount Everest and there was no signal. He had seen Wanma&#39;s movies and said that director Wanma was a good person and he filmed ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wanma and the new wave of Tibet he led are the window for many people to understand Tibetan life and culture.

The road is mostly smooth, with occasional bumps. This 5,476-kilometer-long ordinary road has a large altitude difference. Sometimes it spirals between hard mountains, and sometimes it rises in &quot;trough-shaped geologically broken sections&quot;. National Highway 318 was originally the Sichuan-Tibet Highway built from 1950 to 1954. Thirty thousand People&#39;s Liberation Army troops entered Tibet to build the road and more than 3,000 people died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the entrance of Mount Everest National Park, tourists lined up to take photos with the large-scale &quot;318 National Highway must be driven in this life&quot; ground painting. I was in a daze, and after searching on my mobile phone, I confirmed that the end point of National Highway 318 is indeed not at Mount Everest, but at the China-Nepal Friendship Bridge in Nyalam County, Shigatse. That night, at the tourist base camp at 5,200 meters in the Everest National Park, people sang loudly, sometimes &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; and sometimes &quot;Broad Sea and Sky&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/W8spSjGms58H9uY0nGIVUg5Og01ZHiIg3bNMO8iV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1795&quot; height= &quot;686&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/W8spSjGms58H9uY0nGIVUg5Og01ZHiIg3bNMO8iV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251354&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A dead donkey on the side of National Highway 349&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the national park, you will see the famous &quot;Everest 108 Turns&quot;. The asphalt road winds and climbs 800 meters, overlooking four snow-capped peaks above 8,000 meters. Due to the wide span and large drop of Turn 108, aerial photography has been mostly done here in recent years. But Dashi is an old-school photographer and has little interest in drone aerial photography. He likes his Fujifilm camera, which has a wide-angle fixed focus and can shoot 108-degree continuous undulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We settled at the Everest Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The webmaster wanted to take us to a good place, saying it was the best angle to photograph Mount Everest: from the high point of Rongbuk Monastery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rongbuk Monastery is the highest temple in the world. Its full name is &quot;Latucha Rongbuk Dong Aquling Monastery&quot;. It was founded in 1899 by the Red Sect Lama Ngawang Tenzin Norbu.

At its peak, the Rongbuk Temple had more than a dozen affiliated temples, some of which were still in Nepal, but were later destroyed due to historical reasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rongbuk Temple is named after Rongbukou. Under the north slope of Mount Everest, there is a north-south Rongbuk ditch, which was washed by the Rongbuk River. The Rongbuk River is formed by partial meltwater from the East Rongbuk Glacier, the Middle Rongbuk Glacier, and the West Rongbuk Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ysgmjcberZRv1P54zGkbT6jEbttPiggpyvG3n1Le.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2542&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ysgmjcberZRv1P54zGkbT6jEbttPiggpyvG3n1Le.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251356&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Greening project along the national highway&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter&#39;s meal/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Whether it is scientific research or mountaineering, you need to walk through the East Rongbuk Glacier to enter Mount Everest. In 1921, when the legendary mountaineer Mallory tried to scout out a climbing route to Mount Everest, he missed the intersection of the East Rongbuk Glacier. But one of their team members discovered the East Rongbuk route. Since then, all climbing teams climbing Mount Everest from the north slope have taken this route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/LuDSe8HweSQog5rP9TkaRw4lfOmc8e1SKPgzAzdm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2519&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/LuDSe8HweSQog5rP9TkaRw4lfOmc8e1SKPgzAzdm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;108 Turns&quot; leading to Mount Everest&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In the mouths of Western mountaineers, the road along the East Rongbuk Glacier to the advance camp is called the &quot;miracle highway.&quot; The scientific expedition team members of the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were quite surprised by this name. They had walked it several times and always called it the &quot;Yak Trail.&quot; This road is easy for yaks and people to walk on. It only takes 5 hours at a fast pace and 10 hours at a slower pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Mallory missed the East Rongbuk Glacier, he took a precious photo of the Middle Rongbuk Glacier. During the 2023 Mount Everest scientific expedition, the Northwest Research Institute found Mallory&#39;s photo spot after three efforts. By comparing two photos spanning a century, they estimated that the Zhongrongbuk Glacier has retreated 4 kilometers from the past, or an average of 40 meters per year. The continued warming of the global climate will inevitably intensify the retreat of glaciers. In the event of an avalanche, excess melted snow will form a torrent and rush towards the mountain villa at the foot of Mount Everest. In the past 20 years, flash floods caused by avalanches on Mount Everest have washed away many Nepali villages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ppbwun05bkWz2O9tFNqnLd1Ov4tJoq8if0MEI2FY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2599&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Ppbwun05bkWz2O9tFNqnLd1Ov4tJoq8if0MEI2FY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251358&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The lady raised her fluttering silk scarf into the wind&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Dashi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;This is the starting point of this trip, an observation of global climate change centered on the scientific expedition to Mount Everest.

Between the mountains, the Nu River, Lancang River and Jinsha River flow side by side in three canyons with a horizontal distance of only more than 60 kilometers. Under the sunlight, they look like yellow veins. When the plane landed slowly, I saw Shangri-La in the green valley like a spilled palette, flowing beside the Napa Sea wetland. The flowing cloud shadows are reflected on the water surface of the wetland, which is like a dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Lwz0dAOvw8iuPEN7OTb46QFWpvHn8s5f7SkFxZ2r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252052&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Napahai Wetland&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center of Shangri-La City is An ancient city named &quot;Dukezong&quot; was originally built by the Tubo people and means &quot;Moonlight City&quot; in Tibetan. Since its construction, it has been abandoned and rebuilt several times, and its organizational structure, zoning and name have been changed several times, but its status as the political, economic and cultural center of Diqing, Yunnan has remained unchanged. For thousands of years, this place has witnessed not only the smoke of wars, but also the bustle of tea and horse trade. It has also been the link between Yunnan, Sichuan, and Tibet&#39;s &quot;Grand Triangle&quot; and a channel for frequent exchanges among various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2014, an unexpected fire partially burned down the ancient city of Dukezong. Today, the ancient city has slowly recovered. Strolling along the stone road in the ancient city, you will see wooden houses on both sides, operating inns, restaurants, bars or handicraft shops. It reminds people of the &quot;quaint little town&quot; described by the British botanist Kingdon Ward. In 1913, in order to investigate the rivers and plants in the Hengduan Mountains, Kingdon Ward passed by this place and stayed in a house. He found that &quot;the house was extremely clean, and the copper cooking pots and tea utensils were polished to a discernible shine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kindon Ward was not the only one to leave written records for Shangri-La. Liu Manqing, the first &quot;female imperial envoy&quot; to Tibet in modern times and known as the &quot;Fantastic Woman of the East&quot;, wrote about the ancient city of Dukezong in a delicate way in &quot;The Campaign of Kangzang&quot; published in 1933:&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When the sky dawns or the sun sets, the streets are full of people carrying water. The ladles for collecting water are made of folded bark. They are light in weight and large in capacity. , beside the spring, water seekers swarm like ants.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, at the foot of Dagui Mountain, the spring mentioned by Liu Manqing is still gurgling. Someone placed a water ladle next to the spring for passers-by to get water and taste it. The sun passes through the transparent water, and the waves dance under the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since ancient times, Shangri-La has been a legend on the Tea Horse Road. At that time, there were more than 190 businesses traveling between Shangri-La and Lhasa alone, and more than 20,000 caravan horses passed through each year. In the alley of Dukezong Ancient City, I met the handsome Kham man Zhabagdan. Zhabagdan&#39;s father is from Shangri-La and was a member of a caravan when he was young. In 1970, Zhabagdan was born in a small mountain village in India. He worked as a monk for seven years. When he was seventeen, he returned to his hometown with his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhabagdan’s life legend begins in Shangri-La. After returning to China, he started studying in the first grade of primary school and later studied in Austria and the United States. He speaks Tibetan, English and Hindi, as well as a curry-flavored version of Mandarin. He has worked part-time as a civil servant, a tour guide, and opened a travel agency and restaurant. In 2012, Zhabagdan created the first &quot;Arokangba&quot; B&amp;B in the ancient city of Dukezong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Aruo Kamba&quot; is a sentence used by our fathers to greet each other while walking on the Ancient Tea Horse Road, which means &quot;Come on, friend&quot;. Creating &quot;Aro Kamba&quot; was not only Zhabagdan&#39;s father&#39;s dream during his lifetime, but also his own dream. Back then, the caravans walked on the Tea-Horse Ancient Road. Whenever they were exhausted, they would get a chance to rest in &quot;Naicang&quot; deep in the mountains. Every time my father mentioned the story of the caravan to Zhabagdan, he would always talk about the &quot;Naicang&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fire in 2014 severely damaged the ancient city. Although Arokamba Manor survived, the memory left by the fire in Zhabagdan has never faded. He still clearly remembered the shops and houses shrouded in fire, falling tragically like defenseless giants. The sound of explosions of liquefied gas tanks came one after another, and clouds of fireworks rolled up. The flying fragments hit the broken walls and made various sharp sounds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This was like a one-sided war. We were caught off guard in the face of the rapid fire.&quot; Zhabagdan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes Zhabagdan happy is that over the years, through the reconstruction of &quot;building the new as the old, replacing the old with the old, and imitating the old with the new&quot;, the ancient city of Dukezong has gradually restored its original appearance. What was once a devastated place has been replaced by a brand new look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stone streets, unique Tibetan inns, handicraft shops with ethnic colors, cafes and bars full of literary and artistic atmosphere, indicate that the ancient Dukezong city is back.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;For Shangri-La, Zhabagdan has always had love and confidence. He still often thinks of the time when he and his father climbed over a pass and saw Shangri-La for the first time: &quot;That was a scroll painting that appeared countless times in my dreams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/sbYkZP7IVmGI7grn25WnatoRXqkht9E7KSjwkhxB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;Songzanlin Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Shangri-La is the imagination of the whole world&quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After leaving Shangri-La, we headed towards Deqin along the Yunnan-Tibet Line and stayed overnight in Benzilan Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benzilan is located on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Jinsha River. It means &quot;little sand dam&quot; in Tibetan. It is a valley area between the surging Jinsha River and steep mountains. However, as the altitude decreases, the scenery of the valley becomes desolate: gravel and barren soil on both sides, and exposed rocks. Just now, you could still see tall broad-leaved forests, a lush scene, but gradually they turned into low shrubs and cacti. The wind blew on my face, it was hot and dry, making me feel like I was in the desert of Mexico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;hot and dry valley&quot; scene is a typical geological landscape in the &quot;Three Parallel Rivers&quot; area, and it can be called a wonderful stroke of nature: the warm and moist airflow becomes cold as it climbs over the mountains on both sides of the canyon in the wind. It triggers precipitation, so rainfall is frequent on the top of the mountain and vegetation is lush. The airflow descends through the leeward slope and becomes hot, and when it reaches the valley bottom, it becomes a dry and hot &quot;Foehn wind&quot;. The &quot;Foehn wind&quot; intensifies the degree of dry heat, causing the vegetation to become sparser, forming a &quot;hot dry valley&quot; landform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;Hot Dry Valley&quot; is by no means completely desolate. Through the car window, you can see ocher-colored mountains studded with agate-like terraces. By transforming these terraces, local people have created local environments suitable for farming. Walnuts, citrus, grapes, watermelons and olives are planted on the platform, complementing the tawny Jinsha River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After passing Benzilan Town, we left the road, followed the stream, passed through the valley, and arrived at the peaceful Bairen Village. Cacti grow among the exposed rocks, and pepper and plum trees grow along the roadside. The person I want to visit is Estelle Achard, a French female architect. Nine years ago, this French woman from the foot of the Alps sold her hut in northern France, came to this Tibetan village deep in the river valley alone, and opened an inn called &quot;Tulu Lodge&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dirt Road&quot; was renovated from an old Tibetan-style house in the village, and the original appearance has been maintained as much as possible: plum trees and pomegranate trees are planted in the small yard surrounded by earth and stone walls. , rosemary and mint grow in stone flower beds. Estelle went out to greet us, followed by two dogs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​of them is a blind dog&lt;/span>;), spinning around our feet excitedly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle has ash-brown hair, glasses, and a Tibetan necklace hanging around her neck. Thirty years ago, when she was an architect, she came to Yunnan on a business trip for the first time and couldn&#39;t help but fall in love with the mountains and rivers here. Fifteen years later, she moved to Kunming. After working in hotel design for a few years, she moved to Shangri-La and finally settled in Benzilan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Estelle takes us through the rooms she designed and decorated one by one. Although each room has a different style, they all organically combine national characteristics with modern concepts, as if time has quietly settled here. When renovating the house, Estelle values ​​​​the most ecological and environmental protection concepts. She kept the wood as bare as possible and did not use chemical-based varnishes. She also deliberately preserved the &quot;dry toilet&quot; in rural areas: a hole was made in the ground of the toilet, a chair was placed above the hole, the seat was hollowed out, and there was a pile of sawdust under the hole, and the excrement fell directly into the sawdust and became Fertilizer for the vegetable patch outside the yard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having lived in Benzilan for nearly ten years, Estelle can communicate with the villagers in Chinese, and the villagers call her &quot;French Ajia&quot;. She likes local ghee, yak meat, and fresh vegetables and fruits, and she grows various herbs needed for French cuisine in the garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, we sat under the plum tree in the garden and shared a country dinner made by Estelle with a French family traveling to Diqing: tomato and watermelon cold soup, spice roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, served with Shangri-La products red wine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The corn leaves outside the courtyard swayed in the evening breeze, and the sound of the stream became louder. We talked about our respective experiences. Estelle said that she also thought about opening a B&amp;B in Provence, but Provence was already too saturated. She was very happy to settle down in Benzilan and open a small B&amp;B. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provence is the imagination of the whole world, and it is the same here.&quot; Estelle said, &quot;Whenever I tell my French friends that I have settled in Shangri-La, they will exclaim!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/Q1PcGm7rADXzIUj537SZW8Xgt8f84vX66AiWDkEi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252056&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinsha River Big Bend&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Zichao/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Xueshan Market Dunshiyang&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, we left Benzilan, left the dry and hot valley, and walked along the Jinsha River. The elevation of the road rises again, and the vegetation on the mountains becomes lush again. At the big bend of the Jinsha River, I saw the yellow river water turning around, like a man&#39;s bent arms, full of power - the mountains sandwiching the river water were like the guardian angel of the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is 86 kilometers from Benzilan to Deqin County. Although the mountain road is winding, it is in good condition. Before liberation, there were no roads in Deqin County, and it was not until 1959 that the Yunnan-Tibet Highway was built. At that time, it was necessary to climb the Baima Snow Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. From October to May of the following year, traffic was often blocked due to heavy snowfall. Now that the tunnel has been opened, it is no longer necessary to cross the pass of Baima Snow Mountain. Our car seemed to be gliding on the road, surrounded by dense forests on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The town of Deqin County used to be called Adunzi. It is said that during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the eminent Tibetan Buddhist monk Karmapa discovered during meditation that Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, was the holy land of Chakrasamvara predicted by Padmasambhava. This started the pilgrimage of Tibetan Buddhists to Kawagebo. the first of its kind. Adunzi is not only the starting point and the end point of worshiping the sacred mountain, but also an important material distribution center and cultural exchange center on the Tea Horse Road. Therefore, it has the reputation of &quot;Snow Mountain Market&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a broader perspective, Adunzi is located in the contact zone between the Han and Tibetan peoples. As scholars say, just as Zhangjiakou&#39;s commercial development is due to its location in the contact zone between the Han and Mongolian peoples, Adunzi&#39;s commercial development is also due to the same reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Anti-Japanese War, traditional international trade routes were blocked, and merchants gathered in Adunzi, which became a bridge to maintain Sino-Indian trade and transport war preparation materials. Due to the large number of major business houses, in order to facilitate transactions, merchants used a &quot;Dunshiyang&quot; currency as a medium of circulation. This kind of currency can only be used in Adunzi market, which shows the prosperity of Adunzi in those days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Deqin has restored the appearance of a small mountain town, with buildings winding down the valley, with a drop of nearly 600 meters. Walking on the street, I can&#39;t see the prosperous scene of the Tea Horse Station back then. It looks more like an ordinary mountain city. Only the skin color of passers-by, their accents, and the attire of some residents made me realize that I was in a minority area inhabited by Tibetans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to its location in a narrow ravine, the biggest risk faced by Deqin County in recent years is mudslides. In 2003, the Diqing Prefecture government considered moving the county seat elsewhere. In 2010, a mudslide occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, which has similar terrain, which aroused people&#39;s concerns about Deqin. But local people told me that the mountains near Deqin are undulating, and it is very difficult to find a piece of flat land that is open enough. Therefore, the government’s latest consideration is to relocate the entire county seat to the adjacent Weixi County. If this is the case, the ancient city of Adunzi will also will become a piece of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/DkyjOuuGVwfs4clUEE2QKRrwezqYeWvqNdy8pplL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252053&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Kawagbo, the main peak of Meili Snow Mountain, and the Mingyong Glacier flows below the snow peak. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Mingyong Glacier is protected by Mingyong Village&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;In the early morning, we went to Feilai Temple to watch the sacred scene of &quot;Rizhao Jinshan&quot; - the golden sunshine hitting the Kawagebo Mountain Peak. Then we returned to Deqin County and met the poet Tashi Nyima in a Tibetan restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tashi Nyima was born in Mingyong Village under the jurisdiction of Deqin County. This village is located under the Kawagebo Snow Peak, which means &quot;mirror&quot; in Tibetan. It is named after the huge glacier pouring down from the snow-capped mountains behind the village. In addition to Mingyong Glacier, Mingyong Village is also the place where the late poet Ma Hua taught.在那里，马骅写下了诗集《雪山短歌》，被评论界誉为当代汉语诗歌中最明净、最澄澈的部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;午饭过后，我请扎西尼玛带我去明永村看看。我们坐上汽车，上了214国道，很快就看到了奔腾的澜沧江。这里同样是干热河谷地貌，但我发现，只要有台坎坡地的地方，就有田园民居，就能看到麦浪翻滚、瓜果飘香的景象。行驶在这条路上，一块块绿洲，一座座民居，镶嵌在雪山、峡谷与大江共同绘制的风景中，令人心旷神怡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一路上，在河谷两岸的隘口和田间地头，不时可以看到耸立的土碉楼，大都倾圮破败，充满了历史的沧桑感。我问扎西尼玛，这些碉楼建于何时？所为何用？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎西尼玛告诉我，由于年代久远，就连当地人也已经失去了对碉楼的记忆。它们究竟是出于战争的目的，亦或只是财富和身份的象征，历史学者和考古学者们各执一词。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/p9243QxUuIDpc0hJ7oun65LznBcxdNO3VKSmFwf8.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;那时，明永村人的生活十分困苦。多数人家全家人共睡一个铺，家里甚至没有多余的碗。扎西尼玛记得，上初中时，有一次放假回家，他邀请同学到家里吃午饭。由于家里没有客碗，只好用家人的碗，还是只变形的碗——他父亲有一次上山砍木头，摔了一跤，把木碗压变形了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;初中毕业后，扎西尼玛去师范学校读书，随后辗转在德钦县管辖的村镇。 1997年，他调入德钦县旅游局，参与编制了梅里雪山生态旅游区开发规划。正是那份规划把明永冰川作为优先开发的景区，而明永村的巨变也是从那时开始的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着政府大力度的推介，卡瓦格博峰和明永冰川开始吸引越来越多的游客。德钦县抓住时机，投资了七千多万元，为明永村修建基础设施，明永冰川成为迪庆州第一个国家4A级景区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在冰川旅游开发中，明永村村民主要参与的是为游客提供牵马服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“骡马成了明永村的钱袋子。”扎西尼玛说，“1999年，牵马收入是平均每户八千七百元；到了2006年，平均每户突破了五万元。”村民在旅游业中致了富，家家户户都置办了卫星电视、电冰箱、洗衣机、高档音响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，县里又提出实施冰川索道项目。因为饲养骡马成本不小，修建索道则可能带来更多的游客。村民们认为，跟索道公司订合同，谈好分成办法，这样既可以舒舒服服地挣钱，又不用为喂养骡马和安全问题大伤脑筋。冰川索道投入运营以来，村民每户每年至少可以分到五万五千元的红利。明永村从过去的贫困村，变为德钦县乃至迪庆州的富裕村。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/28wqjxJHLY65YACM1aD5eZvh0cGqRmvFrKmzkn7e.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;扎西尼玛告诉我，据明永村的老人们说，以前推开窗户就可以看到冰川，感受到冰川的凉气。那时候的冰川很“强壮”，把山谷堆得满满的，整天听得到冰川开裂发出的巨响。 1913年，英国植物学家金墩·沃德也曾造访过明永冰川，看到“一根巨大的冰柱醉汉般摇晃，瞬间后便咆哮着滚落山谷，将树上一群绿色的鹦鹉惊起”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;扎西尼玛说，在他小时候，冰川的出水口会被掉落的冰块堵住，河水一下子断流了，村妇们就到冰川边上，亮着嗓门唱起“嘛呢调”。唱着唱着，冰块被冲开，河水哗哗地汹涌而出。然而，这些年冰川逐渐消融，这让扎西尼玛感到心情沉重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每次回村，都会感觉冰川变小了一些。”扎西尼玛说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为此，他还拍摄了一部名为《冰川》的纪录片，从朝圣者、旅游者、村民三种视角，表达了藏族人对雪山的信仰，对外来文化影响的不同理解，以及他们在旅游开发浪潮中面临的种种困惑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/S3QpLt5MKOUgTjgGiunNeUQ3OTyxymWfgcs0sdcy.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;扎西尼玛和马骅是同龄人，又都是诗人，当年很快成为朋友。他回明永村看马骅时，两人经常一起聊书聊音乐。马骅会拿起吉他，唱起民谣，长长的头发像一团黑色的瀑布。他们去附近的山上野餐，躺在一棵不知有多少年月的老桃树下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;微风时时拂过，花瓣沿着暖洋洋的阳光纷纷飘落下来。背后是在云雾里时隐时现的卡瓦格博雪山和雪山上伸展下来的巨大冰川，冰川在阳光的照射下发着蓝幽幽的光，偶尔会传来冰崩的轰响，山谷的两岸覆盖着茂密的森林，头顶上是蓝得醉人的天空和天空中变幻不定的云彩。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;该声明表示：“第三方平台在旅客朋友购票过程中会保留用户信息，不仅有附加费、加速包、捆绑销售服务等陷阱，还可能存在个人信息泄露风险。请旅客朋友一定要通过铁路官方渠道购票，认准铁路12306网站（含客户端），注意保护合法权益和个人信息安全”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何理解这个声明的真实含意？会令“抢票神器”之类失去市场吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先要理解为什么多年来，每逢长假诸多线路的高铁一票难求。不过先说一句，从今年开始，一些线路车票紧俏的状况可能会有所改观。且往下翻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不同线路的高铁乘客使用强度是不一样的，有些线路比较热门，通勤、商务出行、旅游等需求常年不衰，每天班次很多，如珠三角或长三角区域内城市之间的线路，主要城市群之间的线路，以及去热门景点的线路；有些线路则不那么热门，班次就相对较少。到了长假，为了应对井喷式的出行需求增加，高铁会增开一些班次，但显然前者增加的绝对需求与相对需求都会多很多，但增开的潜力有限；后者增开的潜力大，但增加的需求有限。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，长期以来，绝大多数高铁线路都是平时与长假期间一个价，往往导致这样的后果：平时需求较少时，票价高于市场均衡价格；长假期间需求剧增时，票价显著低于市场均衡价格，从而导致票一放出就秒光。对于这种情况，国铁是心知肚明的，所以也在改进，让票价更加市场化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年12月，京沪高铁就开始实行浮动票价，全程二等座最高票价598元，涨幅8%；最低票价498元，降幅10%，即上限调高、下限调低，是京沪高铁开通9年来，首次推行浮动票价机制。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从2023年5月30日开始，铁路部门对沪宁城际、宁杭高铁、南广高铁、胶济客专、柳南客专等多条高铁线路“票价进行优化调整”，上限为公布票价，下限为公布票价的六六折，进一步上限调高、下限调低，且浮动幅度进一步放宽。以沪宁城际为例，南京站到上海站二等座公布票价为166元，即调整后的最高票价，较调整前的139.5元票价上涨19%；最低票价是110元，较调整前的139.5元票价下降21%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了对某些热门线路票价上限调高并实行浮动之外，铁路部门也推出了优惠票。中国铁路广州局集团宣布，“为方便城际旅客商务差旅和通勤往返出行”，自2023年6月20日起，长株潭城际铁路将正式推出定期票和计次票，旅客可在指定发到站乘坐线路上开行的S字头列车。以成都东到重庆西的售价5852元的60次/30天定期票为例，折合97.5元/次，接近普通票的最低执行票价，折扣最高达五八折。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总的趋势是，高铁定价策略正在向飞机看齐。除非有紧急事态，只要你提前一段时间买票，基本上都能买到机票，甚至价格还很优惠，这是因为飞机票会定一个高高的“原价”，远高于多数时候的市场均衡价格，没有上浮，只有下浮，打三折、四折，让乘客很有“获得感”，这是一种纯粹以市场为导向并且精准把握乘客心理的定价策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高铁动卧定价策略完全拷贝飞机票。从9月15日起，中秋国庆假期高铁开售，不少人在购票时发现，相比于平时，国庆期间部分高铁和动卧大幅上涨。有乘客在社交媒体发文称，北京到深圳的动卧，平日只需要1150元，但是在9月28日上铺涨到1860元，下铺涨到到2090元。同一天，北京直飞深圳最低票价为1100元（不含税）。官网上，北京至深圳动卧的公布票价为2264元，1860元与2090元折扣约为八二折、九二折。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，现在还不是在所有线路上实行浮动票价，你要是本次中秋十一长假抢不到票，只能说明票价相对于需求仍是偏低的，该线路或是仍在实行固定票价，或是实行浮动票价没有到位，从经济学的解释就是如此。而这意味着“抢票神器”还有生存空间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“抢票神器”的本质就是数字黄牛，当一种商品的官方价格显著低于市场均衡价格之时，这差价就是“无主收入”，许多人就有动机争夺这收入，黄牛就是其中一种，勤快的早早排队赚辛苦钱，有门路的搞到内部票，所得与内部人分成。数字黄牛也是黄牛，不过如果第三方平台宣称有“优先购票权”，那是骗人的，你购买加速包，人家也是帮你去12306买票。在这个意义上，铁路部门的澄清是很有必要的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，用算法抢、用App抢肯定比手速快，这就是“抢票神器”的市场生态位。铁路部门的澄清也劝返不了归心似箭、求票心切的乘客。当然，12306可以封禁某些频频刷票的IP甚至App本身，但也很难把机刷买票完全排除，只留下手刷买票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓“道高一尺，魔高一丈”，只要有利益空间在，技术会不断进化的。所以治本之策，仍是票价进一步市场化，让乘客的出价尽可能反映自己的需求强度。这样一天都等不得特别想去某个地方的人总能去，觉得缓一两天无所谓的也能省一笔钱，各得其宜；高铁也能赚更多的钱，以支付高铁运行成本、造价乃至银行本息，数字黄牛自然没有了生存空间。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“家门口的亚运会，让国旗升起，国歌奏响，说到做到。相比于金牌，我更开心的是能够打破自己保持的亚洲纪录！29岁的年龄，只是个数字，说我不行的人，你们看这个成绩还行吗！”赛后汪顺通过微博发表感言。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;参加本次亚运会，汪顺是憋着一股劲儿的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/emEbmlTytFrG20Di9EvJIEIsqged7cFynD4e9Rz3.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;说汪顺“不行”的声音，直到亚运会比赛前还存在。两个月前的游泳世锦赛，汪顺在报名的三项比赛中，均未能进入决赛，距离曾经的巅峰状态差距不小。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月24日，亚运会当天的预赛中，汪顺游出1分58秒84的成绩，这与世锦赛获得第11名的成绩(1分57秒97)仍有差距，而队友覃海洋以领先汪顺0.12秒的成绩位列第一晋级当晚的决赛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后的决赛，汪顺一路领先获得金牌，同时打破由他保持的亚洲纪录(1分55秒00)，此前这一纪录是他在东京奥运会创造的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“就好像我（本来）就会游泳一样，”汪顺和这片蓝色泳池的故事，从5岁那年的夏天开始。他跟着父亲第一次去游泳馆戏水，看见父亲跃入泳池，他紧跟着往下跳。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;身体下沉，手忙脚乱，想抓住点什么，汪顺很快呛了水，但他不觉得害怕，“我没有觉得被水呛到了，就要远离它，反而很想去征服它。也许，我对水有一种天生的亲密感。在水里面，我感受到了前所未有的快乐、放松，如鱼得水。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺的过往战绩中的确有如鱼得水的标记：1994年出生于浙江宁波，2007年被朱志根教练选中，进入浙江省一队；2009年，跟随教练朱志根进入中国游泳队二队；2010年广州亚运会，成为男子200米个人混合泳亚军；2016年，国际泳联短池游泳世锦赛男子200米个人混合泳夺冠，获得男子混合泳中国首个世界冠军；2021年7月30日，获得东京奥运会男子200米混合泳冠军。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在水里，并不可能总是顺流而下。东京奥运会夺冠后，汪顺一度失去了目标，觉得无法再从游泳中获得快乐。在奥运会的赛场上升国旗奏国歌，是汪顺过去二十多年运动生涯里的终极目标。他很早就说过，“做运动员一定要有清晰的目标”，从全国冠军游到世界冠军，再游到奥运冠军，他逐级提升自己的竞技成绩，“我一直给自己打气，好成绩得来不易，都是一步一个脚印。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/94Qa5dmkdhAtqoULhnGmN0ILcfn9fI6ezA4wBl7K.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;2023年7月，日本福冈游泳世锦赛。汪顺感觉找回了动力，希望忘掉奥运冠军的光环，继续超越自我，填补自己金牌大满贯（奥运会、亚运会、短池世锦赛和长池世锦赛）的最后一个缺口——长池世锦赛冠军。然而，汪顺在这次比赛的男子200米混合泳预赛中排名第16，差点被淘汰；半决赛排名第11，无缘决赛。在400米混合泳中，他因为犯规被取消成绩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺还行吗？这样的疑问来自外界，也来自他的内心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从福冈世锦赛到杭州亚运会，间隔时间只有不到两个月，汪顺一直在调整状态。他今年29岁了，这已经是他第四次参加亚运会。2010年广州亚运会时，汪顺还是新人，那是他第一次站在亚运会的舞台上，与亚洲对手们在同一个泳池竞技，今天回想起来“依然热血澎湃”。但汪顺不再是只有热血的新手，他有过巅峰，也经历了漫长时间里的起起伏伏，最终选择再次跃入泳池。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/YyS7jrnSTVUFm4UEWNKEYfmq7BgIQNYuhlpP1dXn.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月24日，在浙江杭州奥体中心游泳馆进行的杭州亚运会游泳比赛男子200米个人混合泳决赛中，中国选手汪顺以1分54秒62的成绩获得冠军&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;他要仔仔细细地看着它&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;第一次面对关于泳池的选择时，汪顺还是个小孩子。那时他正在学习画画，表现不错，同时收到了游泳队的橄榄枝。要不要选择成为职业游泳运动员，家里没有过这样的先例，是本能也是冒险，他选了泳池。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“游泳一直给我一种前进的感觉。”成年后，汪顺这样解释自己的选择。当时间足够漫长，他经历并感受了越来越多游泳运动的另一面：枯燥、重复、与自我对抗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在长50米、宽25米、有着8条泳道的泳池里游泳，不厌其烦地一次次往返于起点和终点之间。他说：“游泳是一项比较枯燥的运动，在竞技过程中，在日常训练中，很少能够跟别人交流。唯一能够听到的是水流滑向你，流过耳朵的声音是我最亲密的伙伴。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺曾在一次采访中无意间说起，2022年有7个月的时间，他都在基地训练，就像搭积木一样，每天从基础训练开始，一堂训练课游13000-16000米，有时连续练上两三堂训练课，到边、转身、翻滚、折返，一整套的水中动作循环重复着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的手看上去瘦削，指节分明，掌心却结下了粗糙老茧。头两年刚训练的时候，他手上的皮肤会因在水中泡得太久而起皱。时间一长，身体逐渐适应，“表象的反应基本上没有了”。长期的、固定的训练也改变了他的日常。“我休假的时候，一天还好，如果第二天没有去游泳池下水，会浑身不舒服。只要到了泳池，我就会很舒服，现在对水会有这样的情感。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了身体的训练之外，面对自己的内心，同样是这条赛道的必修课。2019年世锦赛，汪顺非常渴望收获一枚金牌，但他甚至没有发挥出自己的正常水平。3个月后的世界军人运动会，汪顺渴望不减，“一定要证明自己。”他拼命增加训练难度，结果却因为训练过量导致肺部破裂，出现了气胸。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时医生给他的治疗方案是每天吸氧一小时，而他却希望尽快恢复，为国争光，于是开始每天吸氧两小时。即便如此，医生还是建议他放弃那次比赛再休息一周.他不肯，在床上躺了五天之后，重新站回训练场，并在隔天的比赛中拼尽全力，拿到冠军。如今回忆起当时的情况他还是心有戚戚：“很多事情大家可能看不到，对我来说是玩命一样吧。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;774&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/AsLCsDTbaqPmWKVQyOVCdRSQGVkZkCEk6QA32Xzx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月23日，杭州亚运会开幕式，火炬手汪顺与数字火炬手共同点燃主火炬&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后的巅峰时刻，当数东京奥运会。夺冠当日，汪顺在微博上写道：“虽然我叫顺，但其实并不顺。今天我想对我的教练说，我做到了我们的约定！夺冠并非终点，走下领奖台，一切从零开始，我们巴黎见……”从里约铜牌到东京金牌，汪顺描述那种感觉“妙不可言”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我要仔仔细细地看着它，”汪顺说，那块（金牌）很重，这是对自己这么多年来的认可，“我要仔仔细细地看看它，我是为了什么——就是为了它我才一直拼搏。我觉得它比我想象的重量要重得多。大家虽然只是看到了一块金牌，但是我的人生都包含在这里面了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巅峰之后，经历低谷，杭州亚运会，汪顺再次证明了自己，以更加饱满的心态。赛后接受采访时，被问到有没有超预期，汪顺表示，“超预期了，原来预计56秒以内，没想到今天打破了亚洲纪录”，有记者调侃“是不是昨天点火给了你力量”，汪顺回答：是家乡父老给了我力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在夺冠前一晚，9月23日，杭州亚运会开幕式上，汪顺与“数字人火炬手”共同点燃亚运会主火炬，作为最后一名火炬手，他成为亚运史经典一幕的现场见证者。而赛场也见证了汪顺游泳生涯的起起伏伏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回望这漫漫长途，作为运动员得到的最大满足感是什么?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺曾在采访中这样回答，“在你竭尽全力后，提升了0.1(秒)或者0.01秒所带给你的快乐感，这是我能制造的最大的满足感。这种满足感不是连贯的，没有人能一直涨成绩，感觉是断断续续的，有好有坏的，就像心电图一样，有起有伏。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他喜欢赛场上的一些微小时刻，“当你回头看向大屏幕上的成绩，发觉你的最佳成绩提升了那么0.1(秒)、0.2(秒)或者0.01(秒)、0.02秒的时候，那一瞬间，会感觉到这段时间的训练没有白白付出。0.1秒，可能挑战了自己的极限，也挑战了人类的极限。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在杭州亚运的赛前采访中，记者问：游泳对你来说意味着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汪顺回答：“对游泳，小时候是热爱，现在更多的是责任。奥运冠军只是个新起点，自己还要为中国游泳付出更多的努力，期待我能在家门口举办的杭州亚运会上取得好成绩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次的成绩过后，如汪顺所想，他还会在自己更加漫长的时间里，一直游下去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;参考资料：《Glass Magazine》、《时尚先生》、《都市快报》&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;震荡后的几天里，余波仍然影响着一些凉山主播的直播间。人们质疑，哪些是本地人？哪些是本地货？哪些是真实故事？哪些是剧本编排？短视频平台兴起以来，用户们好奇地将视角投向乡村，不必再在头脑中想象异地生活。在当地人的镜头里，人们看到了景色和人文，也吃到了从当地寄出的瓜果蔬菜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次，凉山州有关部门开展的“清朗·从严整治&#39;自媒体&#39;乱象”专项行动情况，披露了“摆拍卖惨”“虚假助农”“伪慈善”等违法违规行为；抓获犯罪嫌疑人54名，其中涉案网红主播11人，捣毁MCN机构5个，查封涉案公司14家等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，最为引人关注的是包括“小虞””“赵灵儿”“凉山曲布”“凉山孟阳”等粉丝量两百万以上账号被永久封停。这些主播拥有巨大的粉丝基础，一度收割了大量同情、眼泪和钱包。至今，在相关新闻的评论区，一些粉丝仍然相信他们是无辜的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家网信办等七部门于2021年4月16日颁布了《网络直播营销管理办法（试行）》，国家市场监督管理总局于2023年2月25日颁布了《互联网广告管理办法》。律师冯胜钒对南方周末记者解读：“这说明国家已经意识到直播带货行业的乱象及其带来的危害，相信在不久的将来会出台更高位阶的法律及相关政策。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;凉山大舞台，有“才”你就来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;昭觉县公安局立案查明，2022年7月，成都小虞助农传媒有限公司（MCN机构）负责人张某来到凉山，物色到个体工商户赵某（女，汉族，27岁）、阿日某某（男，彝族，23岁）等“网红苗子”，开始精心孵化。不到一年的时间，“赵灵儿”“凉山曲布”两个账号粉丝量已破两百万，并带货变现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些粉丝眼里，曲布是被蒙骗了。一位名叫“王二帅”的三农视频博主，熟悉这批大凉山网红，他在9月22日晚的直播中解释，“只是说被钱给收买了”“他们所有做的这些都是商量好的”。他举例，卖了一千万，公司到手三百万，大头被老板拿走，曲布拿五六十万，赵灵儿比曲布高一点，“你是一个素人，你什么都不是，以前是工厂拧螺丝的，给你这么个平台你干不干？拧一辈子螺丝也挣不了这么多钱”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从业多年的三农视频博主农哥告诉南方周末记者，他身边的一些三农博主会在当地雇用演员表演。这是圈内半公开的秘密，“花个几百块钱，请个演员，有些演员还挺贵的，几百块钱都请不到。（因为）随便叫一个农户或者老百姓，在镜头面前是看得出来的，很多有镜头恐惧症。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;农哥介绍，一些专业演员拍一两个段子的费用约一两千元，但是“临时雇用”的比较多，这些段子大同小异：偶遇当地农民并善良地对话，表现出帮助别人的样子，配上悲惨风格的音乐。“音乐一响，大家觉得这主播真棒，真好。”用着同样的套路，博主们开始全国巡演，去海南岛卖菠萝、去福建卖柚子等，这样的直播间数据好、销量高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，大凉山的网红们不满足于此，在上述常规套路的基础上实现了“迭代升级”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年8月，赵灵儿第一次以返乡助农创业青年的人设出现，“偶遇”淳朴的凉山彝族青年曲布，从此开始了大凉山的故事。赵灵儿强调和曲布是“偶然相遇”，“没有团队，更没有大家说的资本和大公司的包装”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就在三个月前，自称在大凉山拍摄的“公益博主”小虞，同样也是“误入藕花深处”，见到了淳朴勤劳的“凉山四妹”。对比几个网红的镜头、拍摄和剧本，相似之处颇多。两者都是偶遇单身少数民族青年，去陌生人家吃饭，都要杀鸡款待，拿出腊肉，吃饭过程中谈起贫穷的家庭状况，两者建立起深厚的友谊，打造了帮扶的关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无独有偶，“小钟行中国”在2022年10月也发了一条视频，遇到了大凉山的彝族姑娘“十一”。据悉，与赵灵儿、曲布一样，十一同样签约于这家成都的MCN机构。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年10月，小虞曾在自媒体“真实人物采访”中发布了口述故事。他自称河南商丘人，2018年开始从事电子商务，一年便赚了100万元。他最初受到大凉山“悬崖村”故事的感染，去到当地后，发现藤条梯已变成了钢筋梯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，在他后来策划的一系列视频里，昭觉县特布洛乡谷莫村那些当地无人居住的生产用房和破壁残垣反而成了他们的拍摄和直播地。当地村民海来哈曲在接受采访时说，“有一天上面没得住人的老房子突然灯亮起来，后面才晓得他们是在那里拍视频、开直播”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小虞在大凉山送物资的时候，有当地拍摄者请求拍摄。“让我感到吃惊的是，最后一批物资我只花了七八千块钱，但是网友们打赏或者送礼物总额大约一两万。”小虞自此尝到甜头，一头扎入大凉山。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年7月22日，成都小虞助农传媒有限公司成立。一个月后，赵灵儿账号发布了偶遇曲布的视频。曲布与2020年爆火的丁真有相似之处，他们都来自偏僻的乡村，有着黝黑的皮肤、帅气的面庞和纯真的笑容，他被认为具有网红的潜力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王二帅记得，刚来大凉山时，小虞还告诉他，想要真正了解山里的人，就要在这里吃住，“最好是农户家，睡在家、吃在家，给他们一点钱跟他们交上朋友”。据媒体报道，小虞的团队在大凉山和当地村民交流并不多，但是需要村民出镜时，会给他们一些钱。他们租了当地几间屋子，租下土地种植玉米，还会在山上烧火做饭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者在直播间询问王二帅如何分辨网红真假，王二帅回复说：“看多了就分得清楚了……你们去自己分析，现在爆出来的我可以给你们讲一讲，没爆出来那些我也不会去说，毕竟人家现在还要靠这个东西吃饭，要靠这个东西赚钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/QgOxEPgrynEebvrA1wH3Ncg4n5GaWwYF4MRzSaUQ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在短视频平台对助农内容的扶持下，大凉山成了流量热点。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;被流量选中的赛道&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;小虞并不是最早的大凉山网红。凉山公安机关发现，2020年以来，成都澳维文化传媒有限公司（MCN机构）负责人唐某以剧本、摆拍等方式，在短视频平台孵化了有着三百多万粉丝的“凉山孟阳”（阿西某某，女，彝族，21岁），以及“凉山阿泽”（阿的某某，男，彝族，21岁）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《中国新闻周刊》此前报道，2019年有粉丝出于同情前往“凉山孟阳”所在的昭觉县比尔镇吉曲村，才发现孟阳经常拍视频的地方，实际上是当地农户养牛养羊的地方，且孟阳的家境不差，在村里算是富裕。孟阳早早辍学，曾在广东打工，村民认为孟阳的发家，离不开“遇到好老板”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凉山州警方表示，上述违法犯罪行为，组织严密、迷惑性强、涉案地广，形成了前端打造人设、孵化网红，中端剧本拍摄、电商运营，末端农产品供应、流量变现的制假售假灰色产业链。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年，为什么这些MCN机构如此热衷“掘金”大凉山？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;农产品电商的资深从业者王惠林分析，大凉山是天然的产品和流量的蓄水池。首先，大凉山的产品有不少网红“爆品”；其次，大凉山的话题迎合了流量，“大凉山有少数民族，风景也比较漂亮，又有文化的底蕴。人们稀罕这种少数的东西，这就解决了最大的流量问题。”王惠林告诉南方周末记者，“大凉山的经济发展比沿海地区相对缓慢，又有这种助农的属性，这个事情就更顺理成章地发展。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不只是大凉山，包括新疆、内蒙古在内，“有产品、有风景、有人情、有文化”的地方都受到追捧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;农哥认为：“去那边拍摄有更高的可信度，肯定是有选择的，怎么没有人选择去浙江助农？”据他多年在乡村的带货经验，像孟阳这样的短视频博主，不少有过度渲染农村悲惨之嫌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位来自北方某山区的三农从业者告诉南方周末记者，人们总是对山区有想当然的偏见，实际上包括营商环境在内，当地的一些东西可能比发达城市要好，但这些没有关注和流量，“xx山区没有通电”，这个主题便有了流量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;助农扶持已经成为短视频平台的重点。9月12日，首届“快手追光大会”宣布，启动快手村播“繁星计划”，将在未来三年投入100亿流量、5000万现金，培养100万村播、1000名乡村创业者，为160个国家重点帮扶县输送人才。9月21日，抖音电商发布《2023丰收节抖音电商助农数据报告》，抖音电商里挂车售卖农产品的短视频数量为2186万条，直播间里农特产商品讲解总时长达3778万小时，福建、河南、云南、安徽和四川成为平台中农货商家来源前五省份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凉山州警方公布了MCN机构的三农视频脚本，其中包括“收山货”。例如，十一和表姐带着秤、袋子、背篓等去当地村民家里收山货。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三农的剧本变相迎合了短视频平台的流量算法。山东某电商集团的董事长聂文昌在临沂做了最早一批直播基地，他对南方周末记者分析，“做剧本之后人气是高的，根据平台的一些规则做人气，把人气顶起来。”他说，乡村生活的主题拥有广泛共鸣。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王惠林认为，这些视频之所以火爆，原因在于触发了平台的机制，“数据反馈，而非人为反馈”。数据指标判断这是一个“好”视频，更多的流量便会注入。大凉山网红的粉丝积累速度，从平台的逻辑来看，是正常的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王惠林告诉南方周末记者，这些剧本缺乏正常的生活逻辑，套路也不新鲜，但是刷短视频往往是感情驱动，不需要思考逻辑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于此次大凉山网红事件，南方周末记者拨打多个助农文化传媒公司电话，或无法接通，或缄默不言。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;看似助农，实为卖货&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;利用虚假人设吸引到粉丝后，上述公司会开设网店和直播带货，打着“助农”“优质原生态”等旗号，从外地食品公司低价购入蜂蜜、核桃等农副产品，假冒“大凉山特色农产品”商标，以次充好、以假充真在全国范围内销售。警方介绍，“凉山孟阳”所在的公司还雇用网络水军，在直播间制造爆款、抢单的假象，诱导消费者购买。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孟阳曾在直播间里兴奋地喊，“你们给我刷礼物的钱，你们买了核桃，相当于支持了我们这边很多的叔叔阿姨老百姓，知道吧？”事实上，上述公司带货的农产品只有极少数来自本地，大部分是从外地低价购得。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;农哥不赞同这种助农的方式，他卖了几年的农产品，一直自称“贩子”。“在镜头面前说我们多可怜，利用别人的善良去挣钱，大多数人很容易相信”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯胜钒分析，虚假人设、虚构产地等情形已构成虚假广告的范畴，而一旦涉及虚假广告，主播及其所在的MCN机构如存在明知的主观故意，则可能需要承担刑事、民事、行政三种不同的法律责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使带货产品确实来自产地，但是通过编造故事和立人设售卖的行为也可能违法。冯胜钒告诉南方周末记者，“虽然产品的产地是真实的，但是消费者是基于主播编造的故事及人设，产生助农的同情心才愿意下单的。所以主播编造故事、立人设同样构成虚假宣传中捏造、虚构、歪曲事实的误导性方式。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谷莫村的村书记俄的克布说，“我们谷莫村这么小的地方，没得那么多的蜂蜜，他是骗人的，没有帮助过，农户认都不认得他嘞！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直播电商企业辛选集团的有关人士告诉南方周末记者，一些地方出现农产品滞销问题，分销渠道也较少，公益助农项目旨在帮助当地打开销路，带动就业、助力振兴。农产品相比于其他品类，更容易出问题，利润率偏低，还需要投入大量的人力、资源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相对于头部企业，地方供应链质量参差不齐。王惠林介绍，业内常见的模式是，网红公司找到当地合适的供应链，谈好合作后，通过短视频平台建立链接。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者了解，网红直播带货抽成，农产品一般抽成大概在20%左右，高一点的产品能到30%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些大凉山网红带货的产品来自于成都蒲江县的供应链，王惠林提醒，这并不意味着这些供应链商的货品不是来自于大凉山，或许是为了节约物流成本，“新疆的哈密瓜有可能是从西安发货”。据凉山州警方披露，入狱的凉山网红选择的供应链并非真正从大凉山拿货。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外一种常见的模式，是由供应链商培育网红和发掘网红。《中国新闻周刊》披露，多位凉山大网红曾和供应链商任彦兵合作，售卖其产品。南方周末记者以合作者身份联系上了任彦兵，他称，“这生意不好做，准备改行了”。这位供应商并未受到此次凉山网红事件的波及。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;聂文昌说，比起其他品类，农产品有特殊性，农民手中的农产品质量参差不齐，即使消费者拿到异地农产品也难辨真假。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，部分网红的违法行为对大凉山特产已造成负面影响。面对质疑，一些销售者不得不做出特别解释。一家主打售卖大凉山农家纯燕麦粉的店铺，其营业资质却显示在云南省昆明市盘龙区。主播解释，店铺是粉丝给办的，但发货地址就是自己家。而另一家号称售卖四川大凉山丑苹果的店铺，经营地址在海南省海口市。商家在直播间解释说，这是之前在海南卖凤梨时注册的地址，并且掏出手机询问“Hi，Siri，现在的海拔高度是多少”？Siri给了一个2515米的回答。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年度国家医保基金飞行检查已于8月下旬正式开始，聚焦医学影像检查、临床检验、康复3个群众反映问题比较集中的领域。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;医保基金是市民看病的“救命钱”，如何做好监管备受各界关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2023年上半年，全国医保部门共检查定点医药机构39万家，处理违法违规机构16万家，追回医保相关资金63.4亿元。2018年以来累计追回835亿元。”2023年9月22日，国家医保局基金监管司副司长顾荣在2023年下半年例行新闻发布会上表示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据悉，2023年度国家医保基金飞行检查已于8月下旬正式开始。 2023年国家飞检将覆盖全国31个省份和新疆生产建设兵团，聚焦医学影像检查、临床检验、康复3个群众反映问题比较集中的领域。同时，首次将定点零售药店纳入检查对象。截至目前，已先后赴贵州、陕西、四川、新疆、上海等15个省份开展飞检工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顾荣透露，不少省份也参照国家模式开展了省级飞行检查，今年上半年省级飞检已覆盖84个地市的488家定点医疗机构、30家医保经办机构，处理违法违规机构298家，追回医保相关资金2.1亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;监控&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;用上&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;大数据、人工智能&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;国家医保局已连续5年联合公安、卫健部门开展打击欺诈骗保专项整治，2023年检察机关和财政部门也加入进来，联动惩戒优势更加突显。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;顾荣介绍，2023年的专项整治聚焦“骨科、血透、心内、检查、检验、康复理疗”等重点领域，聚焦医保结算费用排名靠前的重点药品耗材，聚焦虚假就医、医保药品倒卖等重点行为，力争做到查处一批重点案件、打击一批违法行为、规范若干专项领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;医保数据庞大、繁杂，大数据和社会监督的作用不可忽视。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年，国家医保局在全国选取11个省份和53个统筹区，开展医保反欺诈大数据应用监管试点，鼓励各级医保部门运用大数据、人工智能等新技术，力争尽快实现智能监管子系统在所有统筹地区全覆盖，形成全国智能监控“一张网”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年上半年，全国智能审核和监控拒付、追回医保资金9.8亿元，通过办理群众举报，追回医保基金4233万元，并处行政处罚765万元。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“2023年3至8月，346个协议期内谈判药品累计报销1.23亿人次，医保基金支出491.7亿元，平均实际报销比例为69.7%。叠加降价和医保报销双重因素，3至8月的半年时间，346种谈判药品已为患者减负1097亿元。”国家医保局医药管理司司长黄心宇介绍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至2023年8月底，全国已有23.4万家定点医药机构配备了协议期内的谈判药品，其中定点医疗机构6.5万家、定点零售药店16.9万家，91个2022年新增的谈判药已在5.5万家定点医药机构配备。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年版国家医保目录调整工作也在进行之中。 7月1日申报启动，9月初通过形式审查的申报药品名单公布，包括224个目录外药品、164个目录内药品在内，共计388个药品通过了形式审查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们将按计划开展评审、测算和谈判等工作，预计于12月初公布今年目录调整结果，从明年1月1日起执行新版目录。”黄心宇说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
