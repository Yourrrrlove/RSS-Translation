It has demonstrated its determination to burn its boats to the outside world, and any attempt by the outside world to interfere with Israel&#39;s will will be rejected. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What does the dissolution of the Ministry of Public Affairs mean? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The term &quot;public diplomacy&quot; was first proposed by Professor Edmund Glean of Tufts University in the United States in 1965. He believed that public diplomacy is to ensure that one&#39;s own country maintains effective relations with foreign countries. Thought connection”. More generally speaking, public diplomacy is a strategic plan to carry out national marketing and create a positive and good international image. It is a &quot;popular project&quot; to win the hearts and minds of the international people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, Israel directly announced the immediate dissolution of the Ministry of Public Affairs. It is obvious that it has deeply felt the changes in international public opinion. Israel’s external propaganda department cannot escape the blame for this, although Israel is doing a positive job The battlefield has an overwhelming advantage, but the corresponding situation is not shown on the battlefield of public opinion. The reasons behind this are worthy of scrutiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, global public opinion has embarrassed Israel, which not only seriously interferes with Israel&#39;s upcoming retaliatory actions, but also has the potential to further weaken Israel&#39;s internal unity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this atmosphere, Minister of Public Foreign Affairs Atbaryan&#39;s voluntary resignation not only gave herself a step down, but also showed her support for the Netanyahu government. She said, &quot;Put aside Self-deprecation aside, running a ministry in such a horrific time of war is an expensive problem and the Israeli people need every shekel.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 12, the latest opinion poll conducted by the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; showed that nearly four-fifths of the people believe that the Netanyahu government needs to deal with this large-scale Hamas infiltration and Responsible for the massacre of Jews, the Israeli government must not only unite internally and externally at this moment, but also consider a potential post-war political reckoning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Israel’s internal struggles remain complex and changeable, which has profoundly affected Israel’s security environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israeli media pointed out that the Ministry of Public Affairs not only failed to fulfill its obligations, but even interfered in Israel&#39;s internal affairs for a long period of time. This minister from the Likud Party has used his power to vigorously promote the government&#39;s judicial reform and made a series of inflammatory remarks. For example, in April 2023, Atbaryan directly pointed out that the military, police and media composed of The deep state network is working hard to overthrow the government, which is reminiscent of how the Turkish government described the Gulen movement before the attempted coup in 2016, highlighting that the Israeli state and society are gradually being torn apart. In addition, she has launched scar-revealing attacks on her political critics, underscoring her right-wing conservative ultra-hardline political stance, which runs counter to Israel&#39;s desire to be diplomatic in its international propaganda matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, on October 12, before the department was disintegrated, she issued a resignation statement, saying that the power of her department had been weakened, and there was an overlap of powers between the Ministry of Expatriate Affairs and the Ministry of Public Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only received its budget six months after the new government was formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first cabinet member to resign after a new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel broke out. This is just a microcosm of Israel’s domestic struggle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Palestinian-Israeli conflict, analyzed only from a technical level and from an absolutely neutral political stance, has greatly shocked Israel. It is comparable in form to the Fourth Middle East War and in terms of psychological trauma. Compared with the &quot;9·11&quot; incident in the United States. This is not unrelated to the division of domestic public opinion caused by Israel&#39;s promotion of judicial reform in the past year. The root cause is the long-standing dispute between left and right, religious and secular disputes in Israel&#39;s internal affairs, as well as the frequent changes of governments in recent years. hidden fundamental crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the saying goes, fortresses are breached from within. Israel’s recent political chaos has seriously affected its military and intelligence systems, giving Hamas room to take advantage of the situation. In addition, the peace process between Israel and Saudi Arabia About to enter its final chapter, Hamas urgently needs to give the international community a heavy blow and prove to the world that Middle East reconciliation that bypasses the Palestinian-Israeli issue is putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the dissolution of the Ministry of Public Affairs heralds the imminence of a larger-scale bloody operation. Israel is consolidating all resources and preparing for war. Israel&#39;s domestic thinking in fighting Palestine urgently needs to form a united front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel’s move is also preparing for the worst for the safety of the hostages, that is, it ignores the hostage weight in the hands of Hamas, ignores domestic and foreign voices in favor of reconciliation negotiations, and treats Hamas the possibility of a complete liquidation. But this is undoubtedly a difficult decision. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the Israeli border are hesitant. During Biden&#39;s visit, he issued &quot;Advice to Israel&quot; and so on. These all prove that the large-scale ground war against Gaza will not only affect Israel&#39;s The international image is more likely to cause further division within Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The situation on the battlefield of public opinion is tense&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a medium for public diplomacy and a window for understanding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the importance of public opinion is self-evident. With the many conflicts that have broken out in recent years Similarly, the public opinion field is the second battlefield opened by all parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, various advanced technological means, such as 5G, streaming media, artificial intelligence and mobile-based social media networks, have made the battlefield of public opinion mixed, making it difficult to distinguish between true and false, and the situation is changing rapidly, which has brought about The &quot;information tide&quot; has a strong ability to induce and differentiate positions and values ​​and create opposing emotions for the public who lack certain professional knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the public opinion war in this Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it has the following three major characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the mature development of streaming media and online live broadcast technology has given global audiences a stronger audio-visual impact on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The timeliness and impact of information dissemination have greatly increased, and it has also provided opportunities for the proliferation of false information. It has provided a breeding ground for various conspiracy theories, historical-realistic information confusion and propaganda, and fake accounts and robot trolls have emerged one after another on social media. While expanding attention, it has also set off a confrontation between the two factions around the world. These include positional opposition (supporting Israel or supporting Pakistan), religious opposition (Judaism and Islam), ethnic opposition (Arabs and Jews), and intra-sect opposition (moderate factions exist within both Arabs and Jews). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Hamas launched its attack, it used heavy bulldozers to break through the Gaza separation wall and carry out bloody killings inside the Israeli border posts. The video was broadcast live on the Internet. This video set off a new wave of sectarianism in the Arab world. , nationalistic sentiments, but also directly angered groups sympathetic to Jews. It is precisely because of the popularity of the Internet and mobile devices that war has achieved a certain form of visibility and transparency, and has become a hotbed and soil for breeding public opinion wars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, when the Western media reported on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the wording was the Israel-Hamas War, not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This highlights the asymmetric nature of the conflict and is a precautionary endorsement of a potential high-intensity Israeli military strike. Hidden behind this is the challenge to the loopholes in international law and the laws of war. Because the laws of war are applicable to sovereign states, the Israeli Defense Forces&#39; attack on Hamas is most likely to be a &quot;police-like war.&quot; Such a narrative will also separate the public from the perspective of ethnic and religious conflicts. The legitimacy of the war on terrorism is obviously greater than the battle for territory. It can be seen that the inclusion of stance in narrative strategies is an eternal pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the public opinion war in this conflict has typical sinking and spillover effects. This conflict has transcended the conflicts between Palestine and Israel and Kazakhstan and Israel, and has shown a trend of spillover and camp formation. Currently, both sides are working hard to seek legitimacy for the war, and have moved from the level of international authoritative media to the level of mass entertainment media. The two sides are competing for the right to speak across the air in other countries. This is not common in previous war conflicts, but it is inevitable for the vigorous development of modern information technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, after Israel announced the dissolution of its Public Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has in a sense reaped the consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, Hamas publicly released two old Israeli women. A video of them shaking hands with masked Hamas members and saying goodbye went viral on social platforms, and they later faced dozens of reporters. , the released elderly people said that Hamas treated them very friendly and responded to their requests. The accounts of those who have witnessed it are extremely impactful, which has compressed the public opinion space in Israel now and even for a long time in the future, and also caused doubts in the Israeli media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game between Palestine and Israel has never stopped when narrating the war. The mutual siege is not only a portrayal of the real battlefield, but also a manifestation of online public opinion. This is a microcosm of the structural contradiction between Palestine and Israel in the field of international political communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;(The author Yang Fuxin is an assistant researcher at the Institute of Environmental Studies at Zhejiang International Studies University; Ma Xiaolin is a professor at Zhejiang International Studies University and an environmental Director of the Mediterranean Institute)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[难以推开的石门，看完很扎心]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259513]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 22:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;In recent years, female-themed works have exploded, but most of them Focusing on the plight of urban women, there are still very few films with small town women as protagonists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stone Gate&quot;, which was recently released on streaming media, is a precious image of the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/24e847a87b538a5e8d415b57418b1a23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/24e847a87b538a5e8d415b57418b1a23.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255861&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;01&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;The directors of &quot;Stone Gate&quot; are rising independent film stars Huang Ji and Otsuka Ryuji, who are a husband-and-wife team.

The film style is very similar to the early works of domestic sixth-generation directors that we are familiar with. It uses non-professional actors, talks about marginalized groups, and prefers extreme Life-like scenes and an objective and calm perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/8fa8ab8a6e1614c11be8c2dab955b11d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/8fa8ab8a6e1614c11be8c2dab955b11d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255865&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on the kernel , with Huang Ji’s own characteristics and personal experience, his friend and work partner Otsuka Ryuji can also make some observations about the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;02&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The narrative of &quot;Stone Gate&quot; relies on the three identities of a 20-year-old girl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, she is Lin Sen, a beautiful female college student, studying as a flight attendant at a vocational school. She has a stable relationship with her boyfriend Liu Long, who even paid for her to enroll in an English training class. With the unexpected pregnancy, Lin Sen&#39;s life also changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/bbb1a402d88da00e34082b137825c904.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/bbb1a402d88da00e34082b137825c904.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255866&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Sen&#39;s My parents run a small clinic.

The difficulties unmarried young women face when they have an unexpected pregnancy, whether to have an abortion or not, are common themes in feminist films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Romanian film &quot;April, Three Weeks and Two Days&quot; and the French film &quot;As It Happens&quot; are both set in the last century when abortion was not accepted by most countries.

On the one hand, the unrestrained display of shots greatly affects the rhythm of the narrative, and too many idle strokes make the movie long and boring. On the other hand, it also leads to the heroine becoming a tool, making the entire story biased towards curiosity and lacking the power to move people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although film and television works showing women in small towns have been relatively scarce in recent years, they were not uncommon in previous years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excellent works can maintain an excellent balance in grasping female narratives and social and cultural landscapes. Let’s not mention the classic representative works of the fourth and fifth generation directors, such as &quot;Qiu Ju&#39;s Lawsuit&quot;, &quot;The Love of Humans and Ghosts&quot;, &quot;The Beginning of Spring&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here is an example of an unpopular masterpiece - &quot;The Crying Woman&quot;.

It is a story that grows out of the shooting environment and the actors&#39; performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actors who play Lin Sen’s parents are director Huang Ji’s biological parents.

But this was completely different from the state of actor Yao Honggui at the time, and it was also different from the current situation of many young college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director and his wife rewrote the character design, and the protagonist’s story is a mixed experience of female college students obtained from interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the unexpected pregnancy experience of a small town girl, the film reflects the structural dilemma of this group.

The owner surrenders the dog. In the videos and texts circulating on the Internet, the dog has become a &quot;retired police dog&quot; or even a &quot;retired military dog.&quot; The words &quot;18 special police officers in three vehicles broke down the door and caught a 16-year-old dying old dog&quot;. Hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, the Shanghai Wusong Subdistrict Office issued a notice on this matter. The report stated that a resident of Haibin San Village was raising large and aggressive dogs (wolfdogs with hybrid blood) without a license, and had repeatedly walked dogs without leashes and large dogs without muzzles and other illegal dog-raising behaviors. After receiving reports from surrounding residents, police officers from the police station, staff from the Dog Breeding Office, comprehensive law enforcement officials and the district&#39;s special police detachment jointly came to rectify the situation. The dog owner took the initiative to open the door and cooperated with the work, and took the initiative to hand over the dog to the relevant departments for containment and disposal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After careful review of this incident, there are many contradictions and inconsistencies between the information transmitted online and the official report. Even after the report was released, many people expressed &quot;disbelief&quot; and need to be analyzed one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;bloodline&quot; of the dog involved. Someone on Weibo said it was a retired police dog, but the &quot;uniform&quot; in the video posted online only had &quot;POLICE&quot; in English and no Chinese &quot;police dog&quot;. This is obviously inconsistent with the &quot;standard dress&quot; of domestic police dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the first batch of retired police dogs in Shanghai were opened for adoption on September 5, 2022. The eight police dogs announced at that time were all from the police dog training base of the Songjiang Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Bradford, Malinois, Rottweiler, Springer Spaniel, German Shepherd, Doberman, etc., but only one Springer Spaniel and two Labradors are open to the public for adoption, and the remaining five including the German Shepherd are retired Police dogs can only be adopted by units. At the same time, adoptive citizens also need to receive follow-up visits every three months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, there is indeed a German Shepherd among the retired police dogs open for adoption in Shanghai, but it was not given to citizens for adoption. Therefore, the rumors that the dogs involved were just &quot;retired police dogs&quot; and &quot;German shepherds&quot; are self-defeating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;retired military dog&quot; theory, there is a lack of any supporting information, and it directly conflicts with the &quot;POLICE uniform&quot; in the online video. China&#39;s &quot;Interim Regulations on the Work of Military Dogs&quot; defines military dogs as special combatants and an integral part of the military&#39;s combat effectiveness. After military dogs retire, they will generally enter military dog ​​breeding and training bases to &quot;live out their old age&quot;. Military dogs with meritorious service will also enjoy recuperation treatment. Even if adoption is open, adopters have very high requirements, including &quot;must love dogs&quot;, &quot;must have experience raising large dogs&quot;, and &quot;cannot be a living environment in an urban community&quot;. Some units will also require adopters to have Military personnel will vouch for them, and they must have a stable income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;Zhengzhou 10 million reward for finding retired military dogs&quot; incident on July 9, 2023, the &quot;retired military dog&quot; gimmick instantly proved that this is a &quot;starting picture, the rest are all It’s fake news, because the description in the “reward notice” is completely contrary to the regulations for the adoption of retired military dogs. In this incident, the terms &quot;retired police dog&quot; and &quot;retired military dog&quot; are inconsistent and can be proven to be pure rumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether the dog owner’s dog-raising behavior is legal and compliant, and the truth behind the door-to-door rectification actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 12, paragraph 3, of the &quot;Shanghai Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; passed in 2011 and revised in 2016, prohibits individuals from raising aggressive dogs. Violators of this provision will have the aggressive dogs taken into custody by the public security department. The &quot;Shanghai Catalog of Prohibited Individual Breeding of Violent Dogs&quot; stipulates 24 types of ferocious dogs, including German Shepherds, French Wolfdogs, and Kunming Wolfdogs. Therefore, whether the owner of the dog involved adopts a German shepherd or a hybrid wolfdog, it is undoubtedly a violent dog breed that is prohibited from personal breeding, and dog registration, annual inspection and dog management fees are out of the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the official report, the owner of the dog involved also engaged in illegal dog-raising behaviors such as walking the dog without a leash and without wearing a muzzle. This is also consistent with the &quot;20 reports from surrounding residents&quot; in the online information. The statement is consistent. Articles 21 and 30 of the &quot;Shanghai Dog Breeding Management Regulations&quot; also clearly stipulate that dog owners shall abide by public order and shall not interfere with the normal lives of others. Residents&#39; committees also have the right to formulate and supervise dog breeding conventions or regulations in their residential areas. Management, dog owners should comply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that the illegal dog-raising behavior of the dog owner involved has been confirmed, surrounding residents naturally have the right to report and request the public security department to take in the dog. This request is reasonable and reasonable, and the joint door-to-door rectification by various local departments is also in line with current laws and regulations. Judging from the live videos and pictures, &quot;18 special police officers&quot; is also false information, and relevant social media bloggers have deliberately exaggerated it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, this incident also shows that relevant public issues have lost focus, which may not be a blessing to the public interest. Faced with the public issue of &quot;how to regulate dog ownership,&quot; some people are willing to mobilize by creating fake news and create traffic and attention with &quot;tragic narratives.&quot; Similar behavior is no longer a public discussion, but an out-and-out &quot;information war&quot; and &quot;public opinion war&quot; method, trying to blur the focus and muddy the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, laws and regulations regulating dog breeding have been implemented in various places for many years, in order to better protect people&#39;s rights. Dogs are not civil subjects and are the private property of their owners. &quot;Conflict between humans and dogs&quot; is a false issue that does not exist. The real issue is how to regulate dog breeding: only when the premise of protecting human rights is established can we talk about protecting people&#39;s property rights to dogs. Protecting people from being hurt by dogs and preventing &quot;dog bites&quot; should still be a real issue that public opinion pays attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方通报深圳欢乐谷过山车碰撞事故救治情况：目前17人留院诊治]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259549]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 21:08:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/29/icPBcDeRPzTXeytRVvcAgxDLzedBlJx77ZIA0HT2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;821&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/icPBcDeRPzTXeytRVvcAgxDLzedBlJx77ZIA0HT2. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[社会总要“毒打”每一个准社会人丨 记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259535]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/29/o2oKFU2EiDUXRbLqoSU8L1WMxan6W8ITAbEXeCc5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;880&quot; height=&quot;658&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/o2oKFU2EiDUXRbLqoSU8L1WMxan6W8ITAbEX eCc5. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255940&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, 2023, Guangzhou, the theme of the South China University of Technology was &quot;Shenzhen It is a double-selection meeting of the &quot;State-owned Enterprises 2024 Campus Recruitment&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Ke Yule/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Details of relevant reports See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/258798?source=131&quot;>;&quot;Who is in the cold?&quot; Who&#39;s popular? The first job fair for the Class of 2024&quot;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a journalism student, when interviewing job fairs, I pay special attention to the situation of media units. However, after the four double-election meetings, I only saw one news website from Foshan, which was on September 28, 2023, at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The HR of this news website used the pseudonym Huang Li in the manuscript. After a brief introduction, I was allowed to sit aside and ask questions or observe on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a form on the table to record the basic information of job-seeking students. Nearly three hours have passed since the double selection meeting, and about twenty names have been filled in. The next column is &quot;Education,&quot; almost all of which are master&#39;s degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I heard that Guangzhou Foreign Studies University (graduated this year) has 150 master&#39;s degrees in new communication.&quot; When she said this, Huang Li had a subtle smile on her face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seven minutes ago, she just rejected a girl&#39;s resume on the grounds that &quot;the resume was not suitable.&quot; A girl wants to apply for the social media platform operation of a news network, but she only has user operation experience in an ordinary company. It’s hard to tell what the essential difference between the two “operations” is, but it doesn’t prevent Huang Li from thinking that they don’t match each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I speculate that what she meant was that there were many students applying for jobs and she could choose as much as she wanted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the number of graduates has been rising year after year - 9.09 million in 2021, 10.76 million in 2022, and 11.58 million in 2023 - making each year replace the previous year and become a new &quot; The most difficult employment season.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following interview with Xu Yang, the organizer of the double election conference, confirmed this point. He told me that in recent years, the supply and demand for jobs at the double election have become increasingly asymmetric. On the one hand, students&#39; enthusiasm for employment is actually increasing and the number of participants is increasing; on the other hand, the number of participating companies and the number of jobs released is decreasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiamin, a master’s degree student in materials science from Sun Yat-sen University who has been mentioned in many reports, was someone I met at South China University of Technology. At that time, she was sitting outside the venue and resting against the wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across the wall, countless red posters hang low, and there are one or two nervous-looking HRs in front of each booth. The aisles were narrow and cluttered, leaflets scattered everywhere, and it was dark and stuffy, like a trench. Li Jiamin smiled bitterly: &quot;Looking for a job requires physical and psychological torture.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employment is indeed like a battle, and everyone is prepared. But after each battle, it seems that everyone has lost their armor and lost their armor, with no victory or defeat in sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the bathroom of the same double election meeting, I also saw a young HR with a childish look on his face. She was still breastfeeding and asked me in a low voice to help close the outer door of the toilet. I was secretly surprised by how hard he worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the manuscript was released, Li Jiamin’s demands for salary were considered by some readers as “having not withstood the severe beatings of society”. Like a motto of the times, society always wants to “beat” every (quasi) social person. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn’t it normal for job seekers to want higher wages and better jobs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, companies also have their own grievances. When Huang Li commented on today&#39;s young job seekers, her dissatisfaction could not be concealed in her words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For those of us who were born in the 1980s and early 1990s, our family conditions were not that good when we were young, so we all consciously cherished our jobs. But today’s young people have good family conditions, have no worries about food and drink, and have many choices of work. A lot. For them, the boss doesn’t fight against the west, right? As long as there is something that doesn’t fit the idea, just leave.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to improve the so-called recruitment retention rate, the job seeker’s hometown It became a question she repeatedly asked. From whether she is from Foshan, to whether she has relatives and friends living in Foshan, to her identification with the city of Foshan, she did not let go of any clues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Feng, who was at the same double selection meeting as Huang Li, is the head of the Guangzhou branch of a public examination training institution. On this day, his booth was almost always surrounded by people. This is very unusual for a small and micro enterprise with less than 50 employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to tell whether the crowd who gathered around him was attracted by the several &quot;Guangdong Written Examination Questions for Selected Students&quot; on the table or by the institution itself. Wu Feng seemed not to think about this problem. Before the interview, he gave me a set of real questions with the same enthusiasm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 5 pm, the interview came to an end and I was ready to leave. But he stopped me and asked about the end time of my internship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There&#39;s still one month left.&quot; I said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Then after your internship is over, you can sign up for an internship with us.&quot; Wu Feng said that they are short of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[弃养致死，那些变相杀害孩子的父母]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259466]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/QxImREUiIkRx7hQBSB6y1vFdwO3z0acGg8wkGHnx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/QxImREUiIkRx7hQBSB6y1vFdwO 3z0acGg8wkGHnx. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 5, 2022, children watched carp streamers in Koshigaya City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan . Today is Children’s Day in Japan. On this day, people hang carp streamers to pray for their children &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do parents do this? Becoming the murderer who personally caused the death of a child? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 20 years, Japanese writer and journalist Haru Sugiyama has continued to investigate cases of parental abandonment in Japan. In many cases of abandonment that shocked society, young children eventually starved to death because they had no ability to take care of themselves. Or die of illness. These cases are driving the revision of Japan&#39;s Child Protection Act, but the situation of deaths due to abandonment remains serious. &quot;Most of the parents who have lost their children seem to be young people, prejudiced people or people with disabilities.&quot; In October 2023, 65-year-old Haru Sugiyama told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; in an email interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After children are born, does the world provide them with a safe and protected growth environment? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022 alone, 77 children died of abuse in Japan. Data from the Japan Children and Family Agency show that the number of child abuse consultations in Japan in 2022 has set a new record for 32 consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 23, 2023, a case involving the death of an abandoned baby was opened in Japan. 33-year-old Narumi Taniguchi, who works in a custom shop, gave birth to a baby girl alone on a street in Osaka City on January 30. She put the baby in a bag and abandoned it in a coin-operated locker. The baby eventually died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the South Korean police discovered the remains of two infants in a refrigerator in an apartment in Suwon City. This incident attracted great attention in South Korea. South Korea&#39;s Ministry of Health and Welfare stated that as of July 18, there were more than 2,123 unregistered &quot;ghost babies&quot; in South Korea, and 249 of them were confirmed dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What initially led Haru Sugiyama to investigate the phenomenon of &quot;child abandonment&quot; was a death case of a girl that shocked Japanese society. On December 10, 2000, a girl died in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. A pair of young parents put their 3-year-old daughter Mana Murata in a cardboard box at home for nearly 20 days. During this period, Mana barely ate, she eventually starved to death. At that time, Masami Murata, a mother, was pregnant and raising a 1-and-a-half-year-old son with her husband Tomonori Murata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugiyama Haru graduated from the First Faculty of Literature of Waseda University. He worked as a magazine editor and later became a freelancer. He writes reportage about parenting and parent-child issues, parents killing their own children, etc. His works include focusing on women. The poverty-stricken &quot;Documentary·Abuse - The Case of Two Children Abandoned to Death in Osaka&quot;, &quot;Thoughts from Child Abuse: How Society Pressures Families&quot; which explores the seriousness of family relationships in Japanese society, and &quot;Parenting Abandonment - Trapped Mothers&quot; The Chinese version of &quot;With the Neglected Daughter&quot; will be published in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SLJxrzToY7rJMxC11QGsHQ2fvLN081Dr1nnwGzrk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SLJxrzToY7rJMxC11QGsHQ2fvLN081Dr1nnwGzrk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255435&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugiyama Haru met the Muratas while they were serving their sentences and continued to correspond with them. Sugiyama Haru&#39;s child is one and a half years older than Mana. During the investigation, Sugiyama Haru &quot;the closer he came into contact with the case, the more unable he was to escape from his mother&#39;s perspective.&quot; After three and a half years of interviews and research on this case, Haru Sugiyama finally recorded this tragedy caused by the parenting environment in modern society in a way that is close to line drawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother who abandoned her daughter was also a daughter who was abandoned since she was a child. In Japanese society with structural gender inequality, women&#39;s own needs are always ignored. When her daughter Mana&#39;s health condition worsened, Masami turned to her husband Tomonori for help. After being treated indifferently, the frustrated Masami no longer cared about her daughter&#39;s condition, but turned to her own mother Hideko, and flattered her husband who had already remarried. The mother expressed her love passionately and tried hard to imitate a &quot;well-behaved daughter in her mother&#39;s eyes.&quot; The 24-year-old Yamei was afraid of her haggard child and did not dare to touch her daughter, waiting for her child to die in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a society where mothers assume the main childcare responsibilities by default, lack of social awareness of childcare, and economic inequality, the tragedy of young children dying due to abuse and abandonment is not an isolated case. The circumstances and details in the &quot;Mana&quot; case have appeared repeatedly in subsequent &quot;childcare abandonment&quot; cases. The parents of these children often suffered violence or abandonment when they were young. They grew up in isolation. As adults, they still face tremendous pressure to survive and lack the ability to live stably in society. Haru Sugiyama said: &quot;Twenty years of continuous interviews have given me the feeling that cases of death by abuse are also affected by the contraction of social functions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BBiMfnmVj1JPaa4U1MSOG6MhKdmSSDILBNSDxy9o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/10/25/BBiMfnmVj1JPaa4U1MSOG6MhKdmSSDILBNSDxy9o.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is an interview between &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; and Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unable to Why don’t parents raising children seek help? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From the 1990s to the present, Japan’s &quot;childcare abandonment&quot; &quot;How has the phenomenon changed?&quot; What kind of fluctuations have the incidence rate shown, and what are the social and temporal reasons behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Currently, about 70 cases of killing children occur in Japanese society every year. Of course, in the period of social chaos after the war, children suffered even more. In the second half of the 1970s, there were approximately 200 cases of child abuse-related death each year. In the first half of the 1970s, in Japan, which was experiencing rapid economic growth, cases of babies being thrown into lockers at train stations often occurred. That was an era when a large number of young people moved from rural areas to cities. Such cases occurred frequently, probably because the society at that time did not provide cultural and institutional support for families. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have been paying attention to &quot;nurturing&quot; since the 1990s Children” topic, especially the phenomenon of “parenting abandonment” or improper parenting in Japan. What is the general appearance of the families you met during your research, such as their economic status? Are they all from the bottom of society? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Haru Sugiyama:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I interviewed six families that were torn apart by child abuse. Some of the children in these families were abused to death, and some were on the verge of death. . Some of the interviews involved me meeting directly with family members, while others I simply attended court proceedings. Objectively speaking, the families I interviewed were all facing financial difficulties. Even if they do not fall into the low-income group defined by society, these families are still in considerable financial difficulty. In addition, parents who lose their children seem to be more likely to be young, prejudiced, or disabled. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Childcare requires an investment of resources. British urban anthropologist Sandra Wallman believes that there are six types of necessary resources for family life: structural resources; land (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Residential&lt;/span>;); labor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Services&lt;/span >;); Capital (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Money&lt;/span>;); Organizational resources (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Resources that put structural resources into actual use&lt;/span>;); time, information, self-identity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sense of belonging, self-esteem&lt;/span span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is necessary for people to realize that they are eligible and have access to these resources, otherwise it will be difficult to use rescue services. People who are living in difficulty should not kill their children, but should actively seek help and find ways to get out of their predicaments. It is important to prepare social resources, but I think it is more important to solve the problem of society clearly providing resources, but people are unable to take the initiative to ask for help. We must let everyone realize that if there are difficulties, we must use social resources and society to make adequate preparations for everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In these families, the mother is often the one who receives the most attention. What state are they usually in? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the cases I participated in, every mother suffered from mental trauma and serious psychological problems. Mothers who are physically and mentally healthy can use a variety of resources to get over the hump. The formation of psychological problems is related to the mother&#39;s lack of care in childhood and repeated violence during childhood and marriage. The experience of sexual violence can be particularly deeply traumatic. The mothers in many cases appeared to have experienced sexual violence in a situation where their self-esteem was not protected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in these cases, the aiding party failed to fully play its role. Clients often lack relevant knowledge and do not know that they can receive help. In 2010, a case occurred in Nishi-ku, Osaka City. The mother of the child is a full-time housewife. Although she received full social assistance when raising children, she did not even receive child support allowance after the divorce, and she never thought of seeking any social assistance. This really surprised me. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reporter&#39;s note: In 2010, a mother in Nishi-ku, Osaka, Japan abandoned her 1-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl for 50 consecutive days. Causing them to starve to death. The mother left home, leaving her two children at home, and never came back.&lt;/span>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the differences among mothers with different education levels and social classes regarding seeking help? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have not investigated how differences in education and class affect families. But even mothers with outstanding knowledge and high education may not be able to seek appropriate assistance if their self-esteem is taken away and they no longer believe in their own worth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also people who overcome difficulties with the help of wisdom. When difficulty intensifies, knowledge is even more needed to overcome it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A survey shows that about half of single mothers have difficulties in living. Even if women are eager to work, they often can only enter the workplace by doing part-time jobs and cannot become regular employees, which means that they cannot receive normal income. Sometimes, the mother&#39;s income alone is not enough to support her children. This is a problem that needs to be addressed as a society, not just mothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many specific cases, I found that men’s fear of leaving the social class in which they grew up seems to have gradually become the reason why they are violent towards family members and violent towards their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japanese society is currently experiencing an economic downturn and social functions are gradually shrinking, which adds to the worries of being a parent. Continuous interviews over the past 20 years have given me the impression that cases of child abuse deaths have also been affected by the retrenchment of social functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Z4NhPACsTexDnNlEpygQrFeZAvgbSuBzce4y7338.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Z4NhPACsTexDnNlEpygQrFeZAvgbSuBzce4y7338.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 23, 2023, in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, a 6-year-old boy was tortured to death and his body was dumped.

Has the proportion of husbands’ participation in family childcare changed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Haru Sugiyama:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At present, Japan’s economic development is in a period of stagnation. I think society’s requirements for women are no longer limited to protecting the family. Probably only those who marry men with very strong financial ability are allowed to &quot;maintain the household&quot; - there are also a few families where the husband does not allow the wife to work outside the home even though the family is very poor. However, patriarchal values ​​are still very strong, and everyone still believes that family values ​​are in the hands of men, and women only provide assistance. This view also binds many people unconsciously. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, the proportion of fathers participating in child care in Japanese society should have increased. Twenty or thirty years ago, very few fathers went to kindergarten to pick up and drop off their children, but the situation now has improved a lot compared to that time, and everyone has begun to think that it is normal for fathers to pick up and drop off their children. More companies allow employees to take parental leave, and men&#39;s participation in childcare is much more common than before. The maternity leave system for men in large companies has gradually improved, and the success rate of men applying for maternity leave has also become higher. This means that a reform of society&#39;s consciousness is underway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a &quot;separated generation parenting&quot; in Japan similar to China (by Grandparents raising children) phenomenon? Is there a problem of &quot;left-behind children&quot; in Japan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; &quot;Skip-generation parenting&quot; has also happened in the past, but in today&#39;s Japanese society, grandparents and maternal grandparents often lose their jobs due to insufficient pensions. If you can&#39;t make a living, you still have to work in society. The situation may be different in each region, but the number of families that the previous generation could comfortably help with childcare was probably limited. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About the issue of &quot;left-behind children&quot;. In today&#39;s Japanese society, the number of young people going to work in big cities from small areas has decreased compared with before. The phenomenon of migrant workers used to be very popular, but now things have changed. In addition, most young people with financial difficulties seem to choose not to get married or have children. The declining birthrate is a major problem that Japanese society needs to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Separate-generation parenting&quot; and &quot;left-behind children&quot; phenomena are also reflected It explains some Chinese people&#39;s understanding of childcare - childcare is a &quot;public matter&quot; for a family or even a family. This is different from the cultural understanding of childcare in Japan and South Korea. How do you understand this difference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It turns out that in China, childcare is a &quot;public matter&quot; of the family. This is very interesting. It turns out that parenting has a public nature, which moved me very much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, the nature of childcare is private. It gives me the impression that childcare is basically centered on the small family. In other words, the small family is not actually &quot;private&quot; but A minimalist “public” with responsibility. The restricted &quot;family&quot; is burdened with everything. The parent-child relationship is very close, and some children are controlled by their mothers. The problem of underage caregivers in Japan also needs to be solved urgently. In some families, parents lack basic abilities or have behavioral disorders or mental illnesses, and they have to be cared for by their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Whether it emphasizes the rescue of abused children or the treatment of abuse There is a lag in judicial punishment of behavior, and the damage has already been done. Is the socialization of childcare responsibilities important? What is Japan’s current progress in this regard? What support should be provided but is not? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sugiyama Haru: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You are right. The family system in modern society has become increasingly difficult to maintain with the development of economy and capitalist society. In the past, people relied on their family&#39;s industries to make a living, but in today&#39;s society, people have to spend money to buy labor, and the intergenerational nature of the family is no longer available. Although the era of having children for the family still has a certain influence on the present, the concept and form of family have changed. If society is not aware of this problem, people raising children may be in pain forever. In my opinion, Japan currently lacks awareness of socialized parenting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/1BOnhzrjk82P9hZmXn1pzMruYmoidjR9Xi1UPhsB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 956&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/1BOnhzrjk82P9hZmXn1pzMruYmoidjR9Xi1UPhsB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255444&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda.

Society should make changes so that women can take charge of their own lives. In addition, the power of society is also very important, and it has the responsibility to carefully care for and nurture every life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s contraceptive pills, especially emergency contraceptive pills, also require a doctor’s diagnosis before they can be prescribed. They are also expensive and not readily available to women. The current situation is that the pregnant woman herself cannot decide whether to give birth to the baby. Society lacks awareness of raising children together, and individual women cannot make the decision for themselves when it comes to having children. This interview made me realize that Japanese women have to bear the burden of childcare, but there is a lack of social assistance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;South Korea will become the country with the lowest fertility rate in the world in 2022.

This is achieved at the expense of lowering standards of care for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has also adjusted its education system so that children can receive free education. Children from poor families also receive free scholarships to further their studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the school&#39;s facilities are still imperfect. Or some old facilities could be easily updated before, but now they have not been able to do so.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Haiyang |&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For several days, Dahuang, Xiaohei and Xiaohuang did not show up, and the cat food placed in the corner remained untouched. This made the tea house in Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area untouched. The waiter Han Xue clenched her heart. She was worried that the three kittens would also die from poison given by &quot;bad guys&quot; as reported on the Internet. This guess was immediately corrected by the colleague next to him, &quot;None of us saw it with our own eyes, so we can&#39;t talk nonsense.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 20, 2023, Weibo netizens broke the news that a large number of stray cats died of poisoning in the Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area in Suzhou, and attached photos of the cat corpses. This information has been fermented on multiple platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, adding a new dimension to the controversy over stray animal management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 22, Liu Fang, a staff member of the Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area Management Office, confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that 14 cats were found dead in the park between October 10 and 16. However, after checking the surveillance, no evidence was found that the cat died of poisoning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 16, 2023, a Rottweiler dog bit a girl in Chongzhou, Sichuan. Some netizens linked the deaths of stray cats in Huqiu to dog bites of girls. However, Southern Weekend reporters found that most of the deaths of stray cats in Huqiu occurred before dogs bit girls, which means it is more likely to be an isolated incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the number of topics about killing stray animals on social networks has increased sharply recently. Qian Yefang, a professor at the School of Law at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, also noticed the &quot;dog-hating and cat-hating&quot; sentiment on social media. In her opinion, behind it is both the incitement of practitioners in the dog meat industry chain and a manifestation of the &quot;cat-kicking effect.&quot; : &quot;If you don&#39;t dare to express negative emotions to the strong, you vent them to the weak. They are passed down layer by layer, and finally passed to animals that cannot speak.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perennially calling for the introduction of the Companion Animal Protection and Management Act &quot;In addition, Qian Yefang conducted an experiment that lasted for more than three years in Haitian Community, Qiantang District, Hangzhou. Regarding the management of stray animals, the solution she gave is not novel, but there is still a long way to go: improving legislation, advocating civilized dog breeding, eliminating street culling, rational disposal, and more cooperation with private forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The scenic area has alerted the police&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area is located in the west of Suzhou. The main body is a hill with an altitude of 34.3 meters. There are two entrances and exits at the foot of the mountain in the north and south. Ji Jie, who works in the bonsai garden in the scenic area, told Southern Weekend reporters that the density of tourists at the north and south entrances and the bonsai garden is small and the terrain is flat, so they have become the main stronghold for stray cats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the feeding of Ji Jie and his colleagues, there are already more than a dozen cats living in the bonsai area. The scenic area management office also discovered the traffic potential of cats. In a short video released by the official Douyin account of Huqiu Mountain Scenic Area in April 2020, an orange cat named &quot;tiger&quot; appeared, whose name means the &quot;tiger&quot; of Huqiu. This video received 482 likes, which is more than ten times the number of likes for the flower and scenery video released in the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This sudden death made many employees feel sad. Ji Jie recalled that a colleague who had participated in the &quot;Small Animal Protection Association&quot; found that a cat that had been raised since childhood was convulsing and foaming, and he tried to rescue it by pouring water. But the kitten failed to save him in the end and bit him while struggling. In addition to the one that died in front of his colleagues, Ji Jie estimated that there were two or three cats missing from the bonsai area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Tiger Hill Scenic Area, most employees are on duty during the day, but cats often come out to be active in the evening when there are few tourists. Some cats die after nightfall, and their bodies are collected by cleaners in the early morning. Most people have not seen the corpses with their own eyes, but intuitively feel that the number of cats has decreased, and then they hear about &quot;poisoning&quot; on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aunt Mei who runs a stall near the south gate of the scenic spot also feels that the number of kittens has decreased. In the past, when I went to work every morning, the sound of Aunt Mei&#39;s trolley on the road would attract five or six cats begging for food. Shortly after the National Day holiday, the number of kittens in this batch was reduced to two or three. After that, she asked the cleaners every day if they had picked up the kitten corpses. After receiving consecutive affirmative answers, she was very sad and angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Fang said that the places where cats died were mainly concentrated in the South Gate, Xixi Huancui (West Garden), and Wanjing Villa (i.e. Bonsai Garden). From the map, these three areas are adjacent to each other and concentrated on the south side of the scenic spot. Ji Jie and other employees in the bonsai area mentioned that a few days before the cat&#39;s death, tourists complained about being scratched by cats in the bonsai area. Could there be a connection between the two? Apart from deliberate revenge, Ji Jie couldn&#39;t think of any reason to explain all this. Of course, he had no proof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Fang said that the scenic spot has called the police and the police station has intervened in the case. The park also called in surveillance cameras and checked the ground, but no poison was found. &quot;If another cat is found dead later, we will ask the public security department to conduct a physical inspection immediately to determine whether this is a man-made incident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, the scenic spot further strengthened the strength of on-site security inspection personnel, and promptly Clean up food residues scattered on the ground and discourage visitors from feeding small animals at will. On October 26, Liu Fang said that the scenic spot has organized a cat care volunteer service team to install smart cat boxes at points where cats come and go frequently, with dedicated management, remote monitoring, and fixed-point feeding to create a safe living environment for cats. At the same time, animal protection advocacy videos are played in scenic spots and cat care signs are produced. &quot;In the future, we will continue to pay attention to the living conditions of cats in the scenic area and provide them with necessary help and protection as much as possible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rumors verified, whether true or false&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the dog bite girl incident , public opinion about hurting dogs and cats continues to ferment. Southern Weekend reporters verified some of the revelations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Hangzhou blogger broke the news that on October 18, his Schnauzer and Shiba Inu were stolen and killed by the landlord’s father. Among them, the Shiba Inu was skinned and chopped into pieces. Dog meat”. Three days later, the person involved deleted the relevant notes about the incident originally published in Xiaohongshu and canceled his account. The person involved declined the Southern Weekend reporter&#39;s interview invitation, saying that the matter was over and he did not want to be disturbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person close to the blogger revealed that the two parties in the incident have been mediated by the Public Security Bureau, and the other party has publicly apologized and compensated for the losses. The parties involved will donate the compensation to charity projects for stray cats and dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The authenticity of another revelation is controversial. On October 20, a Weibo user broke the news that the property management of Phoenix Garden Community in Wuhan beat to death &quot;three 4-month-old puppies and a pregnant cat mother&quot; on the evening of October 19, with the caption &quot;The murderer&quot; &quot;Photos of security guards and several dead cats and dogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 25, a staff member of the Phoenix Garden Community Property told a Southern reporter that the dog beating incident was a rumor. The real situation is that many community owners complained that stray cats and dogs were barking and disturbing the residents, so the property management organized security to drive away the stray animals instead of culling them. The property management company called 110 on the morning of October 20 to report the incident to the police at the Canglong Island Police Station in Jiangxia District and reiterated that no stray animals were killed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being &quot;exposed&quot;, the community property management received a large number of calls in a short period of time. Some of them &quot;cursed and said we are not human beings&quot;, which affected the normal development of property management work. Southern Weekend reporters called some of these numbers, and most of them said they saw the breaking information on Xiaohongshu and WeChat groups rather than on Weibo. At present, Xiaohongshu cannot find relevant information, and the post may have been deleted by the person who broke the news. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some Weibo bloggers used image recognition software to identify the news that many reports of stray dogs being hunted and killed online were in fact “old news” or were copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some news of harm to stray animals has been confirmed. On October 21, Sichuan Science and Technology Vocational College reported the killing of stray dogs in the student dormitory: two students were given detention for probation, and the police were transferred to the public security organs for processing; Sohu Clairvoyance reported that a resident in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province discovered that the lawn was being eaten while walking his dog in the community. A large amount of &quot;poison ham&quot; suspected to be stuffed with pills was released, and stray cats in the community died after accidentally eating it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Beware of the &quot;kicking cat effect&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Qian Yefang believes that in the complicated news about the death of stray animals, in addition to distinguishing the authenticity from the false, it is also necessary to define the nature of the behavior: Government The capture, containment and subsequent harmless disposal organized by the competent authorities are incomparable with the &quot;lynching&quot; and execution of stray animals by individuals or even the cruel killing of stray animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Yefang began to pay attention to the problem of stray animals in 2018. In her observation, whenever there is a dog biting incident, there will be a wave of support for culling stray animals on the Internet. In addition to the differences in the opinions of various parties, Qian Yefang believes that there are still some practitioners in the cat and dog meat or animal cruelty industry chain in the public opinion field who are muddying the waters and setting the pace, allowing voices that encourage extremes to gain the upper hand from time to time. This is actually the strong bullying the weak - the manifestation of the &quot;kicking the cat effect&quot; in social emotions. For example, if a person is criticized by his boss at work, he vents his depressed emotions on his wife when he gets home, and the wife vents on his children. The child had nowhere to vent his anger. When he saw a cat when he went out, he went up and kicked it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/9c19b8a38a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/29/9c19b8a38a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255950&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 18, 2022, in Zhengzhou, Henan, the 32nd &quot;Zhengzhou Adoption Day&quot; offline charity event was held. Volunteers found new homes for stray cats and dogs. Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike food animals, cats and dogs, as companion animals, have received special legal protection from slaughter in some countries and regions. The two seemingly incompatible groups on the issue of stray animals also have a consensus. For example, Qian Yefang has been calling for the introduction of the &quot;Companion Animal Protection and Management Law&quot;, in which the focus of management is civilized dog breeding, which can not only reduce conflicts between humans and dogs, but also reduce the occurrence of stray animals from the source, which is beneficial to animal welfare. If you compare stray dogs with stray cats, the specific disposal procedures are different. Compared with stray dogs, the risk of stray cats injuring people is relatively low. &quot;So the act of killing stray cats has no legal system support, nor moral or traditional support. It is a naked atrocity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, stray cats have strong reproductive capabilities and may pose a threat to small wild animals such as birds. The Trap Neuter Release (TNR) model is currently being promoted. In Qian Yefang’s TNR practice, she also found a low-cost way to sterilize stray cats: working with nearby pet hospitals Cooperate to promote the hospital among pet parents in the community. In return, the hospital can perform two sterilization surgeries for free every month. For more than two sterilization surgeries, the hospital charges 100 yuan for female cats and 50 yuan for male cats, which is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai;&quot;>;(Except for Qian Yefang, all others in the article are pseudonyms.

News about the release of hostages came one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 23, 2023, local time, at the Rafah Port, two elderly Israeli hostages detained by Hamas were handed over to the Israel Defense Forces. They had been held in Gaza for 17 days before being released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is the second batch of hostages released by Hamas. On October 20, also on the Gaza border, Hamas released a mother and daughter from the United States, Judith Lanan and Natalie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The hostage issue puts Netanyahu in a dilemma. Israel wants to completely eliminate Hamas and establish a new order in Gaza, while Hamas The hostages were used as bargaining chips in an attempt to interfere with Israel&#39;s ground offensive plan.&quot; According to Zou Zhiqiang, a researcher at the Middle East Studies Center of Fudan University, the two sides are still in an ongoing game and compromise is extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth mentioning that Qatar mediated the release of two consecutive batches of hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden publicly expressed his gratitude to Qatar after two American hostages were rescued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 25, Qatar Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed once again responded to the progress of hostage negotiations. He said that negotiations are still actively underway and both sides have made some progress and breakthroughs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the ever-changing Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the small Gulf country of Qatar is walking in the flames of war and mediating on the hostage issue. People can&#39;t help but wonder: Why is it a &quot;small country&quot; like Qatar? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The released hostages are targeted&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the deep night, accompanied by Hamas soldiers, two female hostages were Handed over to staff wearing ICRC uniforms. Two Hamas soldiers covered their faces with black veils and held steel guns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before leaving, one of the hostages turned around and shook hands with the Hamas gunman in farewell, saying &quot;Shalom.&quot; In Hebrew, &quot;Shalom&quot; means &quot;peace.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of October 23, 2023, Hamas shared a video of the release of hostages. The two hostages released in the video are 79-year-old Nurit Cooper and 85-year-old Yochiri Lifshitz. They live in Kibbutz Nir Oz, Israel, close to the Gaza border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 7, Hamas launched the &quot;Aqsa Flood&quot; operation. 1,200 Hamas armed gunmen crossed the border and launched attacks in southern Israel. And took away a large number of hostages. Cooper and Lifshitz were also among the hostages kidnapped, along with their husbands, who are still being held in Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Israeli military said that there are 222 hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, &quot;most of whom are still alive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In fact, through the raid on Israel, Hamas&#39;s main military goal has been achieved. The kidnapping of hostages is mainly to make Israel have concerns and facilitate future bargaining. &quot;Zou Zhiqiang analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Lifshitz&#39;s account, after being kidnapped, she was taken into a vast network of tunnels under Gaza that &quot;looked like a spider web.&quot; They ate the same food as the Hamas guards - pita bread, cheese and cucumbers. To ensure the hostages are healthy, a doctor will check on them every two or three days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When asked why she shook hands with the gunman, Lifshitz said the hijackers were nice to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Hamas, the hostages were released for &quot;humanitarian reasons.&quot; However, in the opinion of the interviewed experts, Hamas&#39;s release of the hostages has the dual purpose of exerting pressure and showing a compromise posture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Under the dual pressure of Israel&#39;s continued air strikes and the pressure of its soldiers, Hamas is looking for opportunities to threaten the release of hostages in exchange for Israeli military concessions. &quot;Zou Zhiqiang pointed out, &quot;So far, the hostages released are all non-combatants and women.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the first hostage released by Hamas The hostages are dual American-Israeli citizens and are from Chicago. The two were visiting relatives in Israel when they were captured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The hostages Hamas chose to release are targeted.&quot; Yu Guoqing, a researcher at the Institute of West Asian and African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Hamas sent We hope that the United States will put as much pressure on Israel as possible to allow it to retain a certain amount of leeway in ground military operations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 18, Biden visited Israel. Brigade, in addition to expressing his staunch support for Israel, Biden also discussed the hostage issue with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden emphasized that ensuring the safe return of American hostages is his top priority. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But to this day, dozens of foreigners, including 11 Americans, are still detained in Gaza. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Currently, hostages are the most valuable bargaining chip in the confrontation between Hamas and Israel. In the case of asymmetry in strength between the two sides, Hamas will make full use of it. This card opens up the situation.&quot; Yu Guoqing analyzed, &quot;When to release the hostages and how many to release at one time, Hamas will not obey Qatar&#39;s orders.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt; strong>;Suitable&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Mediator&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gaza since Hamas raid on Israel Encountered ruthless rocket bombardment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the evening of October 25 to the early morning of October 26, the Israel Defense Forces launched a large-scale ground attack on the Gaza Strip and conducted approximately 250 air strikes within 24 hours. Netanyahu said in a televised speech, &quot;We are pouring the fire of hell on Hamas... and this is just the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;And Qatar, thousands of miles away from Gaza, has become lively after the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with dignitaries from various countries arriving in droves. Among those hurriedly visiting Qatar were US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French President Macron’s special envoy for Lebanon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dignitaries from various countries gathered in Qatar, and the hostage issue became an unavoidable topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gaza is the stronghold of Hamas, which hides hostages in batches in huge underground tunnels. &quot;We don&#39;t have specific data on every house and street in Gaza.&quot; Michael Milstein, who has worked in the Israeli military intelligence system for 20 years, warned, &quot;This is the most difficult hostage situation that Israel has ever encountered in its history.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Rescuing hostages is extremely difficult, and mediation has become an important way for hostages to gain freedom. In this context, Qatar’s unique role as an international mediator has become increasingly prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hasni Abidi, director of the Geneva-based Center for the Study of the Arab and Mediterranean World, pointed out that &quot;there are not many mediators, and Qatar is the most suitable mediator. This small country has no regional agenda of its own and does not care about the political uses of mediation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Qatar has deep pockets, extensive contacts, and a good rapport with the United States. It maintains close contacts with Hamas, which provides it with a unique advantage in mediating the hostage crisis,&quot; Yu Guoqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar is one of the 18 &quot;important non-NATO allies&quot; of the United States. Al Udeid Air Base, located 35 kilometers southwest of Doha, the capital of Qatar, is one of the largest U.S. military bases overseas and the forward command center of the U.S. Central Command, with approximately 10,000 U.S. troops and 100 military aircraft deployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, the United States hastily withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, and Al Udeid Air Base will assume the role of a &quot;transit hub.&quot; According to statistics, the United States has withdrawn 123,000 people from Afghanistan, of which about 57,000 were transited through Qatar. In fact, the withdrawal agreement between the United States and the Taliban was originally reached in Doha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In addition to relying on the United States, Qatar also has close contacts with Hamas, Hezbollah and other &#39;radical organizations&#39; in the eyes of Western countries.&quot; Yu Guoqing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar is an important economic supporter of Hamas and has provided a large amount of aid, investment, humanitarian and infrastructure construction to Gaza. Didier Billion, deputy director of the French Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies, pointed out that Qatar provides $30 million in monthly financial support to Hamas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar not only maintains close economic ties with Hamas, but also provides political asylum. In 2012, Qatar’s Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani visited Gaza. This is the first head of state to visit Gaza since Hamas seized control of the region in 2007. Also starting in 2012, Hamas leaders began to reside in Doha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Struggling between the United States and its hostile forces, Qatar&#39;s role seems contradictory, but in fact it is inseparable from the &quot;tolerance&quot; of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The United States&#39; Middle East strategy has inherent flaws. On the one hand, the United States hopes to rely on its alliance system to achieve its Middle East intentions, but on the other hand, it pulls one faction to fight against the other. It has created all kinds of enemies, especially various sub-international organizations and non-state armed groups.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang analyzed, &quot;When the United States cannot use force to suppress it to achieve diplomatic goals, it must find a middleman to mediate, and Qatar plays the role of Such a key role.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Qatar&#39;s ambitions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar is surrounded by sea on three sides, with its southern land bordering Saudi Arabia, like a small boat docked On the west coast of the Persian Gulf. Similar to the shape of its land, Qatar is like a &quot;fast and flexible boat&quot; in international diplomacy, balancing among different forces and playing the role of messenger and mediator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Actively mediating the Palestinian-Israeli hostage crisis is just a microcosm of Qatar&#39;s role as an &quot;enthusiastic&quot; international mediator. In just over a month, Qatar has made three consecutive attempts to act as an intermediary for hostage rescues, prisoner exchanges and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, the Qatari government announced that after months of mediation, Russia agreed to release four Ukrainian children. Embassy in Moscow, taking a different route back to Ukraine. Qatari officials said in a statement that the repatriation of the four children was &quot;only the first step.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, the United States and Iran officially exchanged five prisoners detained in the United States and Iran, and the prisoner exchange took place in Doha. In fact, the success of this negotiation is inseparable from Qatar&#39;s mediation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to public reports, negotiations between the United States and Iran were held in Doha. During the negotiations, representatives from both sides did not meet each other and stayed in different hotels, while Qatar, the middleman, ran on both sides and acted as a sounding board. After at least eight rounds of airborne talks, the United States and Iran finally reached a prisoner exchange agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qatar has a land area of ​​only about 11,500 square kilometers and a total population of 3 million. How can such a small country be frequently active on the international stage and play a role far beyond its own capabilities in major conflicts? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the 1990s, Qatar wrote the &#39;diplomacy&#39; strategy into its constitution. Since then, it has been adopting a multi-faceted strategy to deal with various forces. Balance. At the same time, Qatar is extremely rich in oil and natural gas resources, and its strong financial resources provide strong support for Qatar’s diplomatic strategy.&quot; Yu Guoqing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that Qatar&#39;s &quot;small country, big diplomacy&quot; strategy is not only based on the needs of its own survival, but also conceals huge diplomatic ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Middle East is intertwined with contradictions and conflicts are frequent. &quot;Caught between regional powers, Qatar is unwilling to be passively controlled by others and choose sides among different forces. For security reasons, Qatar hopes to use high-profile diplomatic mediation in exchange for protection from relevant countries to ensure its own national security. and political security.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang said, &quot;In fact, the reason why Qatar is not afraid of getting burned is largely because it has the big tree of the United States on its back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;More importantly, using a &#39;grand diplomacy&#39; attitude to mediate in geopolitical crises can further highlight Qatar&#39;s regional importance and international influence.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang further said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Qatar is not entirely following the lead of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the United States has supported Israel, but Qatar has not completely followed the footsteps of the United States. On the contrary, Qatar&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned that Israel bears full responsibility for the continued escalation of the situation and that the international community urgently needs to stop Israel&#39;s violations of international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Qatar has its own considerations and will not completely follow the interests of the United States.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang pointed out, &quot;adopting a multi-sided bet strategy to balance between different forces , rather than one-sidedly surrendering to major powers or following allies, is an important basis for Qatar to play the role of a middleman. Only by being good at dancing can Qatar have greater room for mediation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But such balanced diplomacy is not without risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2017, several Middle East and North African countries, led by Saudi Arabia, accused the Qatari government of &quot;supporting extremist forces, intervening in other countries&#39; internal affairs, and creating regional instability.&quot; It suddenly announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed embargo and blockade measures on Qatar, including closing borders and airspace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The crisis of severing diplomatic relations lasted for nearly four years before it ended. It was not until January 2021 that Saudi Arabia and other countries announced that they had reached reconciliation with Qatar and officially restored comprehensive diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 17:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[应该关掉各种班级群，给家长“减负”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259533]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a seventh-grade teacher from Zhuge Liang Middle School in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province commented to his students &quot;the best in the class&quot; while correcting homework. Oops, are you an orphan?&quot; He then took a photo and posted it in the &quot;Grade 7 Class 9&quot; WeChat group. Subsequently, the local education bureau issued a notice of criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course it seems that the teacher has no teacher ethics when he said this. The real problem in this matter is that the teacher really thinks that it is the parents&#39; business to correct students&#39; homework and teach students cultural classes. She was really angry at the parents: &quot;Why don&#39;t you teach your children or grade their homework?&quot; The reason why she scolded her was not to scold the students, but to scold the parents and put pressure on them. In fact, in today&#39;s education, she is by no means the only teacher who thinks so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the inevitable factor behind this accident, and this is the real problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still remember that when I was a child, the teacher would assign homework. It was always after class. The teacher would write on the blackboard, and I would circle it with my book or memorize it in my notebook. This is something every student can accomplish. Do your homework as soon as you get home. If you don&#39;t know how to do it, you may be asked, or you may leave it alone. Your parents may sign it, but they will definitely not check whether the homework is done correctly one by one. Submit your homework the next day and the teacher will correct it. If you are wrong, ask for correction and hand it in with the next day&#39;s homework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now everything has changed. Tutoring and correcting homework have become the responsibility of parents. The teacher assigns homework in the group every day, and parents see it and help their children complete it as required. Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly warned not to assign homework to parents, the effect is not great. Teachers still give assignments, and parents still need to help with homework, correct homework, and attend class. Among these, Internet-based home-school contact plays a big role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are of course many benefits to using the Internet and smartphones to communicate between home and school. Teachers and parents can communicate at any time without being restricted by time and location, which is convenient and fast. Teachers can assign homework in the group to prevent students from forgetting, and can also publish students&#39; learning status, homework completion status, test scores, etc. Parents can also keep abreast of their children&#39;s learning status and provide timely feedback to the teacher. In short, through WeChat groups, QQ groups, DingTalk groups and other platforms, parents and teachers can interact better and participate in their children&#39;s education process together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the advantages and disadvantages of anything actually lie in the purpose. If the purpose is changed, the advantage may become a disadvantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In various home-school groups, privacy issues such as sending wrong messages are not a big deal. The key issue is that these Internet channels are a channel that effectively distributes pressure and work from teachers to parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that love in the past was beautiful. You had to wait repeatedly to send a love letter. Although it was backward, it was romantic. Nowadays, WeChat contact is constant, making many people feel that they have no space of their own. It is said in the movie &quot;Mobile Phone&quot;: Mobile phones are originally for convenience. Without them, people are quite free. With them, people become kites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Channels will affect content, and tools will affect behavior. Efficient electronic channels have forced parents to have nowhere to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, parents could say: The child didn’t tell me when he got home, so I don’t know. Now that parents no longer have this space, teachers will shift all the pressure onto parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teacher is the group leader, to some extent the leader of a small organization. When teachers communicate with parents one-on-one, they are relatively equal, but when communicating in a group, teachers will have many supporters. . Whoever the teacher praises or criticizes in the group will create pressure in the class, and then this pressure will be transmitted to parents and children. In this incident, the teacher also took photos and posted them in the group to unscrupulously put pressure on parents. This will force parents to tutor their children, increase the pressure on their children&#39;s studies, and ultimately form a heavier academic burden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, when there are too many WeChat groups and QQ groups, it will also put a lot of pressure on teachers, add some extra work to them, and increase their workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reducing the frequency and convenience of home-school contact can reduce the tasks and pressure teachers pass on to parents. Obviously, if there were no electronic channels and groups, it would be impossible for teachers to call parents one by one to assign homework. These tasks and pressures return to the teachers, and the teachers cannot complete them. In the end, the students&#39; academic burden is reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people may worry that without efficient communication and interaction channels, what should we do if our children&#39;s learning declines? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, from a large policy level, this choice has been completed. Some people believe that in the process of implementing the &quot;double reduction&quot; reform, on the one hand, it is necessary to &quot;reduce the excessive academic burden&quot;, have more outdoor activities, and have less homework; on the other hand, it is necessary to &quot;study well&quot; and let children learn in their interests. You can learn more, faster, and better in a state of exuberance. &quot;Load reduction&quot; cannot be simplified to &quot;reducing academic work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of strategy of having both fish and bear&#39;s paw is very safe in terms of attitude. Neither side is offended, both sides want it, and they do not bear any responsibility for the consequences. Children&#39;s burdens are still heavy because they have to &quot;study well&quot;; children do not learn well because they have to &quot;lighten their burdens.&quot; There are changes because we need to &quot;reduce the burden&quot;; there are no changes because we need to &quot;learn well&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to have your cake and eat it too. For most people, learning requires high-intensity brain operation. The more you learn, the less time you have for this high-intensity operation. The only way to reduce the burden on primary school and junior high school students is to lower their academic standards. In fact, the high school entrance examination in many places has lowered the distinction, and everyone&#39;s scores are about the same. This is lowering academic standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that this will drive parents to let their children continue to answer questions and improve their proficiency, but this may not be the actual situation. Some people&#39;s strategy for reducing returns is to invest less. For example, in the past, people who ate from a big pot and worked hard could be promoted and become model workers. However, most people would choose to lie flat in the face of such disproportionate input and output. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having a group to establish close ties can indeed enhance academic performance, but at the same time, it will cause the problem of overburdening parents. Since the main goal of the policy is to &quot;reduce the burden&quot;, it should not &quot;increase the burden&quot; on the children by &quot;adding burdens&quot; to parents. At this time, the advantage of establishing close ties between home and school through groups becomes a disadvantage. Then, it is a logical choice to reduce the frequency of home-school contact, close various class groups, or even prohibit Internet-based home-school contact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[通向世界的小作坊]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259455]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/d1QYAQWbkA9N7KOCeuSnuYX6WDwwSJcgAEI1NnpD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/d1QYAQWbkA9N7KOCeuSnuYX6WDwwS JcgAEI1NnpD. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255428&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Young people working in small workshops in the suburbs of Yiwu&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Shijie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beilun, Ningbo, the hometown of photographer Wang Shijie, has a port area of ​​Ningbo Port just offshore to the north.

It&#39;s just that &quot;The Bionic World&quot; only focused on forcing tears, forgetting to solidify the foundation of the science fiction setting, and also went out of its way to foreshadow suspense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a science fiction drama, in addition to the future background explained in the beginning, the persuasive style of the main film is close to that of modern urban crime dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting place inside the &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; organization is like a simply decorated office; the crime scene outside the city looks like a shanty town waiting to be demolished. It may seem excessive to use the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; style of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; to ask for it, but using slightly softer science fiction dramas such as &quot;Relative Universe&quot; and &quot;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot; as comparison objects can fully highlight this The show&#39;s perfunctory attitude in setting up scenes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7a42a0253179c920aab4f67ca67eafab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/7a42a0253179c920aab4f67ca67eafab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255891&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you zoom in to As for the details of the science fiction setting, &quot;The Bionic World&quot; also has many flaws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; with a similar setting, we glimpsed the tragic experience of robots through Spielberg&#39;s lens. Discarded after use, they are slandered as murderers, treated as garbage, and put on the execution ground for humans to vent their hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Bionic World&quot; explains the smuggling activities in a few words, and in less than ten minutes of transition, it hints that ordinary people consume the flesh and blood of bionic people.

It uses elements that are extremely rare in domestic dramas to try to explore the human nature motif that has been repeated many times. This also explains that this drama is not only inconsistent in terms of science fiction, but also extremely difficult to grip people&#39;s hearts in the suspense section. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine An Qiu, played by Cheng Nuo and Wen Qi, investigates the serial murderer of androids. During this process, Cheng Nuo gradually discovered An Qiu&#39;s true identity, and the latter was gradually lost under the brainwashing of similar androids. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/9fa39f3949d4688ae37ac9e055c55bbb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/9fa39f3949d4688ae37ac9e055c55bbb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255893&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Nuocong An investigator who was prejudiced and jealous of androids finally revealed his true colors and turned into a gray figure who had accidentally killed androids. We can hardly see the changes in his personality and the contrast between before and after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Song Weilong&#39;s slightly immature acting skills prevent him from grasping the details delicately; on the other hand, there are problems with the plot setting. The arrangement and revelation of suspense rely too much on the villain Yin Tianhong played by Li Hongqi in the climax. Part of it is talking to myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for An Qiu&#39;s transformation from a seemingly ordinary psychologist to the most critical role in the whole drama, it was also revealed too early and too hastily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/afd4d7660d48d6afe60bd8f86db16bc4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/afd4d7660d48d6afe60bd8f86db16bc4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255894&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sixth At the end of the episode, which is also the middle part of the whole drama, we learned the answer to the mystery from the rivalry between An Qiu and Yin Tianhong. Even in many scenes before this, An Qiu&#39;s true identity was clumsily revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You must know that the two biggest mysteries in &quot;The Bionic World&quot; are that Cheng Nuo accidentally killed someone and An Qiunai is a bionic human. These two mysteries involve the emotional tearing of the male and female protagonists, and also reflect the subtle complexity of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/1ed929dc9f100b6aa2d32f0b58009de0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;448&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/1ed929dc9f100b6aa2d32f0b58009de0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the final Judging from the presentation effect, the reconciliation between Cheng Nuo and An Qiu is more like a &quot;love trick&quot; without the profound speculation brought by science fiction settings such as bionic man and initial obsession. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The science fiction works of domestic film and television dramas have begun to show their talents. Whether it is the movie &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot; series or the live-action series &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, they are all outstanding works recognized by the audience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quality of &quot;The Bionic World&quot; is indeed poor, but I prefer to regard it as a trial and error for domestic science fiction dramas to mature. After all, without enough &quot;The Bionic World&quot;, how could there be more mature &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot; and &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
