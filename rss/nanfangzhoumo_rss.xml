An old man had entered the last moments of his life, and a relative with whom he had a very good relationship was out of town. The old man’s children considered letting them see each other for the last time, so they prepared to use the ultimate method to Medical means extend the life of the old man and let him &quot;wait&quot; for his arrival. He considered and refused again and again, on the grounds that it would add unnecessary pain to the old man before he died. Even if it &quot;makes sense&quot; to him, it&#39;s not humane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone is afraid of the word &quot;old&quot;. Many people are desperately looking for beauty treatments, no matter how much money they spend, they are not afraid of getting old. There are also many people who are obviously old, but they are taboo about being called &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;. But physical aging is an objective law that no one can resist. &quot;Are you young? It doesn&#39;t matter, you will be old in two years.&quot; Zhang Ailing&#39;s famous saying fully expresses the impact of the law of aging on the illusion of &quot;eternal youth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Old&quot; can be divided into two situations. One is that the body ages and the body functions become weaker. The original straight back has collapsed, the original beautiful features have turned into a &quot;mess&quot;, the original speedy steps have turned into slowly moving steps with a cane... The second is psychological or spiritual aging. Some people have a good mentality and appear young, even if they are seventy or eighty years old, they are not old. Some people age faster than their peers under heavy pressure. The so-called &quot;a 30-year-old has a 60-year-old heart&quot; and &quot;premature aging&quot; all have this meaning. The latter type of people is actually more common. Their hallmark is that they want to work hard on the &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; every day, and they also frown and sigh all day long, accompanied by white hair and wrinkled faces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who are not involved in childbirth and are pampered, it is relatively easy to achieve the goal of aging slower. Even at different stages of a person, there are big differences. For example, the &quot;Sha Wujing&quot; who was leisurely swimming in the Liusha River back then must be more beautiful than the Sha Wujing who was walking on the road to seek Buddhist scriptures, eating and sleeping in the open and carrying everyone&#39;s luggage on his shoulders. Appear youthful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most people cannot have freedom of wealth, nor can they rely on others to support themselves without working. This will inevitably lead to people plotting for rice and trying their best to get tomorrow’s steamed buns. Because in reality, it is not easy to make a living, and there are all kinds of internal and external frictions all the time, so there are nine out of ten people who are exhausted both mentally and physically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What to do? As ordinary people, since we cannot change our situation, the only thing we can do is to take it lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once had a neighbor who was in his nineties and could ride a bicycle very fast. Why? In fact, he was not strong when he was young. Instead, he had problems here and there, but he just had a good mentality. Whether you encounter a small trouble or encounter a hurdle that others may think is almost insurmountable, you should be able to deal with it calmly, think less, and worry less. Such people should live longer. &quot;Be heartless and live a long life&quot; may not sound good, but the words are rough and rational, and the mentality of &quot;if you can afford it, let it go&quot; is worth learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person should work hard when working, and should also &quot;try hard&quot; to rest when resting. That is, he should neither be distracted when he should be working, always thinking about lying down, nor should he be lying down when he should be working. I always think about work when I am resting, and as a result, my work is not good and my rest is not good either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can enter the world and you can emerge from it. This is the highest state of life. It seems difficult to achieve, but it is not. How to work and how to rest is a science. As an individual, you must learn to adjust, relax the tight strings at the right time, balance work with rest, and laugh at gains and losses. This is a skill that can be mastered. If you can&#39;t do it the first time, do it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are afraid of old age and even talk about death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Speaking of &quot;die faster&quot;, this does not conform to the philosophy of many Chinese people. In contrast, it is greed for life and fear of death. Even if you die a moment later, it seems to be good. This is instinctive and understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to die slowly, many people (mainly family members of the deceased) do whatever they can to survive. As long as they can breathe one more breath in the human world, they are willing to suffer all kinds of hardships. This mentality has far-reaching influence. Most of the savings of many people&#39;s lives are not spent while enjoying life and raising children, but are thrown into the water in a &quot;surprise attack&quot; one or two months before death. Death is already an irreversible outcome. No matter how much money is spent, it is in vain. At most, it can delay the death a little. In the end, one person will lose both his life and property, and even his children and grandchildren will be burdened with heavy debts. It is really not worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of disease, some people are even &quot;scared to death&quot;. As soon as they heard that they had an incurable disease, they would fall into a state of panic and disorder, causing physical and mental harm and exacerbating physical diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most difficult thing in life is to remain transparent on the subject of death. If a slower death equals long-term torture—including torture for children—then the meaning of life will also change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father told me that there was an old lady in the family who lived alone and lived to a ripe old age. She had done &quot;white things&quot; during her lifetime, and she became a favorite story in the village. If a person has seen through life and death, and the true meaning of &quot;disappearance&quot;, what is there to be afraid of, and why must he do it even though he knows it cannot be done? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To let go of life calmly is a kind of great love. It’s not about going against the trend and forcibly delaying death, it’s about cherishing life. Knowing the deadline, waving your hands and going away, isn’t it a kind of optimism towards life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there is no need to doubt the significance of saving lives and healing the wounded. Reducing illness and pain in life is a legitimate pursuit. But what we need to take warning from is gambling-like “fighting” in order to die slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are reports that after someone learned that he had terminal cancer, he specifically told his closest relatives not to needless treatment, let alone to &quot;intubate&quot; himself when he was dying, so as not to spend more money. . Having such an open heart is a rational choice after insight. Of course, financial hardship is also one of the reasons, but in general, it is still based on optimism about life and great love for family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To grow old slowly and die quickly is my creed and pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[有冇蛋散？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257980]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/LSoqRSrnSyZBlr1s57t36ByNrvH2VbqJ0Lb9A70o.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/LSoqRSrnSyZBlr1s57t36ByNrvH2Vb qJ0Lb9A70o. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Song Dong&#39;s work &quot;You Are There&quot;.

This is where different eras, regions and myself meet &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Liu Lang/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Look, everyone, this is the &#39;Big Egg Powder&#39; that has become very popular recently -&quot; A teacher-looking person pointed to the exhibit behind him with one hand and held up a microphone with the other, speaking to the person in front of him. said a dozen young people. They were wearing uniform white short T-shirts. It was probably a summer vacation activity organized by a nearby school. On August 29, 2023, the second GDMoA Annual Artist Academic Nomination Exhibition was launched at the Guangdong Museum of Art and will last until October 8. The works of the 21 nominated artists are displayed in several exhibition halls on two floors. They are rich in types and styles, attracting a steady stream of visitors. For several consecutive weekends, the admission quota for 1,000 people every half day has been reserved early, and there is a long queue at the entrance of the Guangdong Museum of Art. When the crowds are the strongest, it takes an hour to queue to enter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most photographed exhibit on social media in this exhibition is the &quot;big egg powder&quot; in front of these students. It was made by artist Feng Yu using bamboo curtains and wooden frames, and is called &quot;Wei&quot;. The work is introduced as &quot;an exploration of ancient space emotions, and also an extreme mechanical challenge to traditional Chinese soft materials.&quot; The bamboo curtains and wooden frames are curled and twisted to form several looping and twisting pipes, occupying nearly half of the venue, standing tall and full to the left and right. The promotion speech written by Zhang Zikang, director of the Central Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum, described it this way, &quot;The artist uses the relaxing combination of the movement rhythm of Chinese calligraphy to form a unique spatial scale experience and emotional experience. Every viewer will have a different feeling when entering it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/IspoXu1Bh7c0Oomwnsl8AwykobOsjT79lvEohzGi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252438&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Feng Yu’s work &quot;Wei&quot; is called &quot;Dan San&quot; on social media and is widely circulated&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Lang/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the feedback, in the audience’s feelings, it has derived an image that is more suitable for the Internet context - Dansan. Egg powder is a traditional snack in Guangdong. It is made of flour, gluten flour, eggs and lard, fried in a wok until light yellow, scooped up and dipped in maltose before eating. In Cantonese, Dan San also refers to a timid or unpromising little person, taking his characteristic of being &quot;not strong enough&quot;. The color of the bamboo curtain and wooden frame is very similar to the light yellow color of the eggs when they come out of the pot, and the irregular bends are like the appearance of the eggs on the plate. Compared with the words in the recommendation, &quot;This spatial art installation will no longer be retained as the exhibition closes. Just like fireworks and life, no matter how gorgeous and bright they are, they will eventually pass away with the wind...&quot;, it is obvious that &quot;the eggs are scattered&quot; Closer to young people’s daily experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A work that is also highly visible on the Internet is the artist Song Dong&#39;s &quot;You&quot;, which is very Cantonese from its name - &quot;无&quot; comes from Cantonese, pronounced mǎo, meaning nothing, This word was first seen in &quot;Guangdong Tongzhi&quot; revised by Huang Zuo during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty. From the perspective of word creation, the word &quot;无&quot; is the provincial meaning of the word &quot;有&quot;. Song Dong, who was born and raised in Beijing, has a close connection with Guangdong. His works were included in the first Guangzhou Art Biennale as early as 1992. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Guangzhou Fei Art Museum invited Song Dong to hold a solo exhibition. He walked around the vegetable market next to the art museum for a long time and thought that the smoky-looking vegetable market should not be separated from the tall Class A office buildings and private art museums next door. Can you make an unbounded wall? So, he built a 106-meter wall made of old windows. It was made of glass and walls. Various exhibitions could be held inside. The name of the work was &quot;Wall without Borders&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The art museum invites residents from surrounding communities to put in small items that they are reluctant to throw away at home, including Teresa Teng’s audio tapes, thermos bottles with double happiness printed on them, and even BB cameras. During the launch, the museum held a long street banquet. Everyone gathered around the 106-meter wall and chatted while eating Poon Choi: &quot;Where is the boundary between life and art?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Have You&quot;, Song Dong continued his previous style. A rectangular fishing net is pulled out on the second floor of the art museum, and it is covered with about 200 old mirrors. They have different shapes, but they have a unified sense of age. On the back of the mirror are yellowed figure paintings, calendar scenery, and various block letters. words, or clean and old brown wooden boards. When you stand under the work and look up, you will see yourself in the mirror, caught in a fishing net, with age symbols on the left and right. This is where different eras, regions and yourself come together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Dong wrote: &quot;The title of &quot;You&quot; uses the local characters of Guangdong, expressing the juxtaposition of the words &#39;have&#39; and &#39;no&#39; to form the title. I have always believed that nothing is the ultimate The big being is the great nothing. The mirror is not only an indispensable object in life, but also a philosophical object for thinking and understanding. I have been asking &#39;what is a mirror&#39; for a long time, and I think &#39;everything is Mirror&#39;, the mirror divides the world into real and virtual, existence and non-existence. It also integrates real and virtual, existence and non-existence into one place. It is the critical interface between &#39;being&#39; and &#39;empty&#39;. I use a big net to catch The collected mirrors form a &#39;diaphragm&#39;, dividing the space into virtual and real worlds. These mirrors have seen different people and objects, and they are constantly refreshed and vacated. As the saying goes: everything is a mirror body and place. , catching all emptiness and nothingness in one sweep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This thinking text received another interpretation from the students. After they stared at the &quot;Egg Powder&quot; for a few minutes, the teacher asked: &quot;Do you want to go in and have a look? The original intention of this artwork is to hope that the audience can walk among it, interact with the work, feel the changes in the space, and have different emotional experiences.&quot; . Do you think so?&quot; After receiving a unanimous nod, she said with a smile: &quot;But now it&#39;s blocked and you can&#39;t get in. Let&#39;s just close our eyes, imagine, and pretend we&#39;re walking through it. Come on, let&#39;s start. ——&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They really closed their eyes and entered a kind of existence and non-being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 13:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最后的“老猎”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258331]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 12:10:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[放下猎枪20年：使鹿鄂温克人的现代化之路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258325]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021856083094&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;China&#39;s last hunting tribe, raising reindeer in the Daxingan Mountains.mov&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/10/axGGjfymsBkbfbnrKyhAdFttnt16PyWWEfk3fGGH.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/d97a528f5576678021856083094/ lX55HJ107gwA.mov&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot; 360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/d97a528f5576678021856083094/lX55HJ107gwA.mov&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A kind of turbulence The infectious disease is spreading among the reindeer in Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of July 18, 2023, veterinarian Lao Ge received a notice from the village that four reindeer had died in a row at a tourist spot, and he had to go check what was going on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aoxiang, the full name is Aoluguya Ewenki National Township. Driving 250 kilometers northeast from Hailar, the central city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, is Genhe, the county-level city where Aoxiang is located. It borders Mohe, the northernmost part of China, and is the &quot;China Cold Pole&quot; certified by &lt;span>;National Climate Center&lt;/span>; ”——The annual average temperature is minus 5.3 degrees Celsius, and the heating period is 9 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Genhe, the name that is more famous than &quot;China&#39;s Cold Pole&quot; is undoubtedly &quot;Ewenki&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki are one of the ethnic groups with a small population in China. According to statistics from the seventh census, there are 34,617 people in this ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, there were three tribes of the Ewenki people. Among them, the safari Yakuts are called the &quot;deer tribe&quot; because they raise reindeer. The Ewenki people in Aoxiang are descendants of the Shilu tribe, also known as the Shilu Ewenki people. Their population has always hovered between one and two hundred people. They are the smallest micro-group within the tribe and the only ethnic group that raises reindeer in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rudolph the Red-Nosed, who pulls Santa’s sleigh, is the star among the reindeer. This is an animal that lives in the tundra around the Arctic Circle. Its two towering antlers are more than one meter long and have many branches like tree branches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reindeer in Aoxiang are facing a survival crisis. Lao Ge judged that the reindeer that died this time had a high probability of suffering from a blood parasitic disease with a very high fatality rate. He was &quot;not surprised&quot; by this situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In 2003, Genhe implemented the &quot;ecological immigration&quot; policy. The Evenki people who originally lived in the deep forests put down their shotguns and went down the mountains to settle. Lao Ge suspected that the reindeer&#39;s illness may be related to the small animals that come with tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In media reports, the Ewenki people are called &quot;China&#39;s last hunting nation.&quot; Today&#39;s Ewenki people are ending hunting and embracing a modern lifestyle. They also face the process of adaptation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for this micro-ethnic group, which has been maintained at a scale of a hundred people for a long time, it is also a choice that must be made in order to survive and develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/qRn508Oi3WcF8vf82ReSkwFmTsVqMaPgORodRf9U.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253537&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 18, 2023, tourists fed reindeer in the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I miss you very much in Aoluguya&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;Ewenki originally means &quot;people who live in the mountains and forests.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, both humans and deer lived in the deep forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, and reindeer had never been heard of contracting infectious diseases. &quot;It&#39;s hard for reindeer to work in the mountains.&quot; Lao Ge sighed, &quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do to make money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being a veterinarian, Lao Ge also has another identity - the operator of the largest reindeer park in Aoxiang. By. On the way to see a doctor, his cell phone rang almost every ten minutes. Most of the calls were made by acquaintances who wanted to waive the 70 yuan ticket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors who visit the reindeer park for the first time are often surprised: the reindeer roam freely in the scenic area without fences, and people can freely have close contact with them. If you spend 20 yuan to buy a basket of fresh moss, you will soon be stared at by the reindeer&#39;s big round eyes, its round and soft nose will come over, and it will dig straight into the basket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff teaches tourists how to take very dynamic photos: lift a bamboo basket filled with moss above your head and run, and the herd of reindeer will follow obediently. However, most tourists were so frightened that they dropped their bamboo baskets on the ground when they heard the hoofbeats of the reindeer behind them. At this time, you can always hear the staff shouting from behind, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, don&#39;t be afraid, the reindeer will not hurt people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Besides the reindeer, Lao Ge himself is considered the second &quot;star&quot; in the reindeer park. &quot;. He is 51 years old, a mixed race of Ewenki and Russian, with curly silver hair, a high nose bridge, deep eye sockets, and bronze skin. It is said that he looked like the French movie star Alain Delon when he was young. Tourists who have done some planning in advance often take photos with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If reporters visit, the local propaganda department will most likely bring them to Lao Ge. He has a strong desire for expression and a vivid Northeastern dialect, which always makes reporters come home with a full load. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the time, tourists can find him in the most luxurious hotel in the park. Choluozi is the traditional residence of the Ewenki people in the mountains and forests. More than ten pine trees are intertwined to form a cone shape, and a layer of birch bark is spread outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why the tuoluozi is said to be &quot;luxurious&quot; is because the birch bark is densely surrounded by a layer of roe deer skin. There are dozens of them. According to Lao Ge, the cost is &quot;worth seventy-eight dollars at least.&quot; Ten thousand&quot;. In the past, that was a treatment enjoyed only by &quot;old hunters&quot; (the term given to experienced hunters). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going west from Luyuan, less than 10 minutes’ drive by sightseeing bus, you will find the settlement of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2003, the Evenki hunters had just moved to this settlement. There were 62 bungalows with red roofs and white walls in the settlement. In 2008, in order to develop tourism, the Aoxiang government renovated the house and specially invited a Finnish construction company to design it. The exterior facade was covered with dark brown wooden boards and the sloping eaves were wider, aiming to create a &quot;Nordic style&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, except for a dozen families who still live here, most families have moved into residential communities in Genhe City. Their houses in Aoxiang have been converted into B&amp;Bs and specialty shops. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I miss you in Aoluguya&quot; - the now pervasive Internet celebrity street signs have also invaded Aoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the street sign is the most conspicuous house with a huge reindeer mural painted on the exterior wall. It is a B&amp;B run by Yang Lan, the granddaughter of Maria Suo, &quot;the last female chief in China&quot; . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maria Suo is the prototype of the protagonist in Chi Zijian&#39;s novel &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. She died on August 20, 2022, at the age of 101. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many tourists are attracted by the old man’s legendary experience and follow his footsteps. On a sightseeing bus, the tour guide told the tourists the story of Maria Soo adopting a dozen orphans. &quot;How come I didn&#39;t see any of them?&quot; the sightseeing bus driver muttered after hearing this fictional story. The title of &quot;the last female chief&quot; is somewhat of a packaging color. There is no chief among the Ewenki people, but Maria Suo is indeed the most respected elder among the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Can&#39;t you tell some true stories?&quot; However, for this driver, there is nothing to complain about. Driving a sightseeing bus in scenic spots gives him an extra 3,000 yuan in monthly income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to climate restrictions, Aoxiang’s tourist season is short. In previous years, Aoxiang’s attractions were only open from June 1st to October 8th. In 2023, due to the influence of the Zibo Barbecue Fever, the working season of the reindeer was advanced one month. At the end of April, before the snow had completely melted, the scenic spot opened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1099&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/PxXZX0PVOrtCubThYs07UZs3yAmsHN6hBa6hkX9b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Migration route map of the Ewenki people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The third settlement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the tourist season, Whenever he gets the chance, Lao Ge still likes to jump to the deer spot on the mountain. There was no cell phone signal there, and no one could find him. It was quiet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the 32 reindeer that come down the mountain to &quot;work&quot;, most of Laoge&#39;s reindeer are still herding deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After some hunters came down to settle down in the mountains, they still maintained &quot;deer spots&quot; where reindeer were grazed on the mountains. Officially, Deer Point is also called Hunters Point to distinguish it from the settlements at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 26, 2023, Lao Ge set off from Aoxiang, traveled more than 200 kilometers north to Alongshan Town, and then drove into the forest fire road from the only main street in the town. On the road, birch trees and larches are scattered at random, rose-red willows grow wildly on the roadside, and sables pass quickly in front of the car from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Walking another 60 kilometers along the fire road, you can reach his deer spot, a place that cannot be pinpointed on the map. Lao Ge hired four relatives to take turns guarding the more than 180 reindeer on the mountain. As soon as we got off the car, the air was filled with a strong scent of pine. Four or five hounds approached Lao Ge with their tails wagging, and the sound of deer bells could be heard in the nearby woods. This is the environment the Evenki people are most familiar with. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, the Ewenki were divided into three tribes: Solon, Tungus and Yakut, each engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting. In 1957, after ethnic identification, these three tribes were collectively called the Ewenki. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv Guangtian, an ethnology scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has verified that as early as 2000 BC, the ancestors of the Evenki people lived on the shores of Transbaikal and Lake Baikal. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Shilu Ewenki people (hereinafter the Ewenki people are specifically referred to as the &quot;Shilu tribe&quot;) came to the Greater Khingan Mountains on the right bank of the Ergun River, the border river between China and Russia, and never left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People living in the mountains and forests&quot; began to descend from the mountains after the founding of New China. At that time, the Ewenki people were hunting on the right bank of the Ergun River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region approved the establishment of Qigan Ewenki National Township. Since then, allowing the Evenki people to settle has become a goal that the party committee and government hope to achieve. After the government built the wooden house (a typical Russian dwelling made of wood and mud), the Ewenki people had a place to settle for the first time. However, although they have a home at the foot of the mountain, except for the township head and the director of the supply and marketing cooperative who live there all year round, the rest of them live in a state of settlement and hunting. They hunt in the mountains for a long time and occasionally live at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, the Ewenki settlement moved eastward from Qigan to a place 17 kilometers north of Mangui Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi, who once served as deputy director of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Genhe City, is a researcher of Ewenki culture. He said that the location of the relocation was very particular: in order to resolve the conflict between hunting and settlement, the settlement was chosen to be close to the hunting grounds and suitable for reindeer living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is the original and real Aoxiang, so named because it is surrounded by the Aoluguya River. In the Ewenki language, &quot;Aoluguya&quot; means a place with lush poplar trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to distinguish it from Aoxiang after the relocation in 2003, the settlement chosen at that time was habitually called &quot;Old Aoxiang&quot;. For the Ewenki people, the period after the relocation was their &quot;golden years.&quot; Schools, grain depots, post offices, hospitals, cultural stations and banks were built where 126 Evenki people originally lived. In order to develop the economy, the township has also set up wood processing plants, hunting production teams and ethnic trading companies. Foreigners also came. At its peak, there were more than 500 people living in Lao Ao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi recalled that in Lao Ao Township, the Ewenki people were considered &quot;nobles&quot;. Maria Suo&#39;s family became the first 10,000-yuan household in the township in the 1980s. Many Ewenki families have bought cameras, bicycles, and &quot;several watches.&quot; It does not cost money to go to school and see a doctor, and students can also receive living allowances. &quot;All outsiders are willing to marry Ewenki people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, young Ewenki people had settled at the foot of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Kong Fanzhi, by the 1980s, 40 of the 71 Ewenki adults in Aoxiang had jobs, becoming the first generation of teachers, doctors, drivers, and waiters among the tribe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;However, nearly 40 years after moving to Lao Ao Township, the public facilities have begun to age, the government buildings have cracked, and the power grid and dams need to be repaired. The repair cost is estimated to be more than 10 million yuan, which is greatly exceeded. Root River&#39;s financial ability to pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, the State Council launched the Western Development Plan, with funds earmarked for ecological migration. Therefore, the leaders of Genhe City decided that instead of repairing in situ, it would be better to apply for &quot;ecological immigration&quot;, and the funds would also come from a source. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leader’s idea led to the third settlement in the history of the Evenki people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;At 8 a.m. on August 10, 2003, the first batch of relocated 11 households with 37 people and 260 reindeer took 12 Dongfeng extended vehicles and headed for the new rural address more than 200 kilometers away. ——Departs from a place only 4 kilometers away from Genhe city. Teams organized by towns along the way lined the road to see off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Genhe City Chronicle records that at 4 p.m., the convoy arrived at the new Aoxiang in the drizzle. &quot;The new township site had colorful flags flying, gongs and drums roaring, and two elderly yangko teams singing and dancing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than ten days before the move, Kong Fanzhi started busy receiving reporters. They recorded the last class of the school in Lao Ao Township, the &quot;minimum post office&quot; with only one employee, and the last bonfire before departure. Party. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Return to hometown after one day down the mountain&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This relocation attracted Xie Yuanyuan, a Ph.D. in sociology from Peking University. On September 18, 2003, she arrived in Aoxiang and began a one-year field investigation. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What aroused her interest was the reversal of the hunters&#39; emotions. Before setting off, she noticed the report in &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;, the title was &quot;&lt;/span>;China&#39;s last hunting nation&lt;span>;The Ewenki people returned home after just one day of going down the mountain. Township&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beijing Youth Daily&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Reporters at&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Hunter&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;relocation times&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Visiting Aoxiang on the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; day, I found that the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;yard was surprisingly quiet&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, and &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;some houses were empty&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. Some hunters made a rough calculation: the annual income of a reindeer is about &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;200 Yuan &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; no &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; investment when raising stock in the mountains. After going down the mountain, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;we have to &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reindeer &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; in captivity &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; just the feed money, every day A reindeer costs thousands of dollars every year. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Originally, what the government promised was that the hunters would move, the reindeer would be kept in captivity, and someone would feed them. “The hunters would just hold the wine bottle and watch the reindeer smile.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reality is that there is no feed at all in the rows of deer pens blocked by brick-red barbed wire in the settlement. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;During the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, some reindeer were lost, injured, and some were not used to eating bean cakes and choked to death. A total of more than 90 reindeer were lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Li Mengchu, chairman of the Aoxiang People’s Congress, was the Minister of Armed Forces of Aoxiang at the time. He recalled that at that time, the township government mobilized cadres to go up the mountain to collect moss, mushrooms and willow twigs. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A reindeer can eat a sack of moss in a day&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, which is equivalent to what one person can harvest in a day. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;A few days later, the hunters &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; took the deer out of the deer pen and led &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; back to the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;first &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; reared them around Aoxiang, but &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;the moss in the mountains and forests around the city did not grow well&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Go north again&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and continue deep into the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Mountains&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, there are 14 deer spots scattered in the mountains and forests of Xinlao Ao Township. &lt;p>; span>;20 years later, when talking about this matter, a former deputy mayor of Aoxiang said bluntly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Writer Chi Zijian visited Aoxiang in 2004 and found that there was not a single reindeer in the deer pen, only a group of lazy goats wandering along the overgrown path. Go shopping. The butterfly effect caused by this situation was that the Ewenki people descended from the mountain and became the origin of the writing of &quot;The Right Bank of the Ergun River&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;While reindeer breeding was realized&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; also put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, as early as 1988, with the promulgation of the Wildlife Protection Law, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; it was clear that &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; hunting was prohibited , killing national key protected wild animals&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;common prey of the Ewenki people, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;moose&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, black bear, roe deer, gray rat &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;They are all on the list&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. In 1996, the Gun Management Law was promulgated, which imposed stricter regulations on civilian use of guns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xie Yuanyuan obtained a document clarifying the meaning of &quot;ecological migration&quot; of the Ewenki people from the then director of the Ethnic Affairs Bureau of Genhe City. She was attracted by the strong &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;span>;&lt;span>; short sentences: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1. The mode of production does not change, and settling down has become a sentence Empty words. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2. Without changing the mode of production, it will be difficult for various economies to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The material clearly expresses the point of view: to change the production method, reindeer must be kept in captivity so that hunters can put down their shotguns. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This also makes the third settlement essentially different from the first two: in the past two settlements, the government did not restrict the Evenki people’s choices, but instead increased their travel options. An alternative to hunting. But this time, the goal of letting the Evenki people go down the mountain to settle down is more clear. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;We must change the &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;safari &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; such &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &quot;production&quot; Way&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ecological immigration has accelerated the process of closing guns. Li Mengchu remembered that the Public Security Bureau confiscated the guns of the Ewenki hunters right after they moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gu Taozeng, a documentary director who filmed the &quot;Ewenki Trilogy&quot;, recorded&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;this process&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. Li Mengchu&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;is concerned about&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;that the Evenki people&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;have hunted for generations to survive&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and their guns are gone. , which means a change in the tradition of hunting people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Changes inevitably bring confusion. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Two months after the relocation&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;More than a month later, the then Aoxiang Party Committee Secretary&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Liu Panchang&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s nose bone was hunted by Ewenki The people interrupted, and the township head Gu Xianglian, who was also an Ewenki, was sued by his own aunt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Xianglian’s aunt wrote to the then Secretary of the Hulunbuir Municipal Party Committee: “In the past, without subsidies or assistance, the hunters lived quite well. But now, in Genhe &quot;To subsidize life is just like begging for food.&quot; &quot;This is not trying to achieve a well-off life, it&#39;s just trying to make us eat chaff!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as it&#39;s time to go to work, a circle of people rush into Gu Xianglian&#39;s office. The long sofas on both sides of the room were filled with villagers, and the radiator by the window was also crowded with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancient fragrant lotus has nothing to do with it. She complained to Xie Yuanyuan: &quot;I have no selfish intentions at all. I don&#39;t have a house of my own, so I live in a hunter&#39;s business. It&#39;s worse than a hunter&#39;s house! If you were to be the mayor of the township, what would you do?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are problems everywhere. In November, the temperature in Aoxiang reached subzero, the new house began to get damp, and black hair grew on the walls of the house. The floor made of wooden boards in Lao Aoxiang was replaced by milky white ceramic tiles. &lt;span>;The designer obviously doesn’t have much experience in rural life. As soon as you enter the house in winter, the snow stuck to the soles of your shoes melts quickly, and you may slip&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; accidentally. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Making a living has become difficult&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the Ewenki people used to be respected in Lao Ao Township&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;It seems&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is gone too. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Their appearance is easily identifiable: high cheekbones and deep-set eye sockets. When Xie Yuanyuan and Ewenki women went shopping in a store in Genhe City, they would always see the clerk pointing out, &quot;Look, that&#39;s from Aoxiang.&quot; The restaurant owner also laughed at Xie Yuanyuan for their old-fashioned ways: they only served free side dishes and drank almost all the wine. Before the main dishes were served, I paid and left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan recorded the scene she saw in the winter of 2003: except for the hunters raising reindeer, there was almost nothing for others to do. The only way for pure hunters to amuse themselves is to drink, drinking low-quality liquor that costs 1.5 yuan per pound and is filled with mineral water bottles. &quot;There are three or five people, very quiet, not talking or laughing, just leaning on the sofa or leaning on the bed.&quot; Drinking like that. It feels like they want to get into a state of &#39;drunkness&#39;, the sooner the better.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Twenty years have passed, and Gu Xianglian, who was the township head at the time of the relocation, is now the deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Genhe Municipal People’s Congress. &quot;There is no need to talk about the past.&quot; On July 28, 2023, in her office, she quickly interrupted the reporter&#39;s question, &quot;Go to Aoxiang and see for yourself. I don&#39;t know how much everyone&#39;s living standards have improved. . That&#39;s a huge change.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1014&quot; height=&quot;758&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/mtXgU30A1jUSpsFVSkB0wppXC6tGAq5bHLcoNYyr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253539&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Ewenki hunter settlement in Aoxiang is full of Nordic style. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“Almost forgotten everything”&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The latest improvement in living standards &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; celebrates &quot;ecological migration&quot; &quot;20th anniversary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On September 12, 2023, at the celebration ceremony, 15 dark green high-power tractors were lined up, which were allocated to the mountain&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Deer point. A month ago, the township &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;had &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;replaced &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; each deer spot with 5,000-watt solar energy storage panels. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;When fully charged &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , the solar panel &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; can provide &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;8 kWh of electricity. This means that you can use a refrigerator, TV, rice cooker, and even hot pot at the same time on the mountain. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summer travel season has also met expectations, ushering in a major outbreak three years after the epidemic. The price of accommodation in the two hotels in the scenic area is about 1,000 yuan per night. The price of a B&amp;B with simple facilities not far from the scenic spot starts at 500 yuan per night, and it must be booked at least a week in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Genhe, a resource-based city built for forestry, has now positioned the cultural and tourism industry as a &quot;city-building industry&quot; in the government work report, and &quot;Aolugu Ya&quot; has become a key focus The “brand” created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The living standards of hunters have improved a lot in recent years, and the original oppositional emotions have almost been forgotten.” Kong Fanzhi said when talking about the development of Aoxiang in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Change cannot occur without reindeer. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, three years after the relocation, Li Mengchu was appointed deputy mayor of Aoxiang. How to allow the Ewenki hunters to make a living under the mountains became a difficult problem that he had to face as soon as he took office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long after taking office, he organized the first Reindeer King Competition, hoping to build the reputation of the reindeer. According to the plan, the antlers of the top three deer kings will be auctioned on site. Worried that no one would bid, Li Mengchu specially arranged a few &quot;trustees&quot; in the auditorium. Unexpectedly, the person in charge of a company auctioned off all the top three antlers, and the most expensive pair was auctioned for 7,000 yuan. At that time, an adult reindeer was worth only 5,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government also took over the entire township’s deer antler business. Deer antlers are deer antlers that have not yet been boned. In traditional Chinese medicine, they are considered to have nourishing properties. Starting in 2005, Li Mengchu led the township cadres to various deer spots to cut the antlers, which would be processed by the township, packaged and sold. &quot;After the sales are completed, the hunters will be given money, and they will be happy with every penny they receive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a few years of unified sales, hunters no longer need government support. After the rise of tourism in Aoxiang, deer antlers are sold by the same gram as ginseng, with prices ranging from 8 to 20 yuan per gram depending on the quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reindeer is the spirit of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the treasure of the Ewenki people.&quot; Lao Ge often repeated this sentence when interviewed by the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one can say how the tourism industry in Qing Ao Township became so popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the Ewenki people came down from the mountain, the Aoxiang government made plans for tourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xie Yuanyuan was investigating in Aoxiang, the government had built a &quot;folk custom village&quot;. At first, there were only two buildings: a tent and a tuoluozi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The township government arranged for Asuo, a young male hunter, to live in a tent and raise 6 reindeer nearby. As long as he stays there, Asuo can receive a monthly salary of 100 yuan. However, Asuo&#39;s situation seemed awkward: he stayed there alone, drinking, dazed, and being sucked by mosquitoes. Later, the township leaders said that the &quot;Folk Custom Village&quot; was located in a remote location and lacked &quot;life&quot;, so Asuo&#39;s &quot;work&quot; was stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, hunters gradually took over the business of the folk village, but they were all in a slump. In 2007, with the support of the township government, Lao Ge invested more than 100,000 yuan, and the township government signed a ten-year contract to take over the business of the reindeer park. &quot;I never dreamed of it, but it started slowly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Mengchu’s impression, around 2008, Hulunbuir’s tourism business suddenly became popular. At that time, tourists drove around Genhe and couldn&#39;t find a place to stay. &quot;They were all confused at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge’s specific feelings about Aoxiang’s tourism industry “taking off” come from the increasing number of reporters visiting. Several groups of reporters from different CCTV channels came. The camera crew of Japan&#39;s NHK&#39;s &quot;China Railway Journey&quot; also came, as well as teams from Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea. Reporters from various countries came to see it all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also took reindeer to Changsha to record the variety show &quot;Happy Camp&quot;. Lao Ge clearly remembers the broadcast time of the March 5, 2011 issue. He chartered a truck, hired two drivers, and took the reindeer with him, and it took him 85 hours to reach Changsha. Finally, the Ewenki clip appeared on the show for 5 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge was originally worried that the reindeer would be frightened after coming on stage and run wild all over the place. The result was good, the deer was calm and even peed on the stage. On the contrary, he himself was very nervous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This deer was later named &quot;Little Hunan&quot; by Lao Ge. The day after returning to Aoxiang, &quot;Little Hunan&quot; disappeared. Half a month later, a forestry worker 40 kilometers away discovered it. Its mouth and body were covered with hunter&#39;s nooses. &quot;Little Hunan&quot; did not survive that autumn and passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, a Hunan tourist made a special trip to the reindeer park and bought the antlers of &quot;Little Hunan&quot; for 2,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;692&quot; height= &quot;514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/LshBZyp56uNBLZi123aXA1287nCOlpYo2v8q7kmf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 28, 2023, tourists watched birch bark boats at the Aoxiang Museum in Genhe City, Inner Mongolia.

Now, he is 56 years old, his hair is gray, his face is covered with wrinkles, his eyes are squeezed to only a slit, and almost all his teeth are missing. Aging has completely overcome him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distance from the bedroom to the bench is less than ten meters, which is the distance Zhuoye moves every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty-six years ago, He Xie was cleaning a gun at home, and the gun went off. The bullet penetrated the thin wall panel and entered Zhuoye&#39;s head. It has not been removed yet. The accident left her with no mobility in her right leg. After that, she stopped going out and became increasingly fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a curious tourist passes by the door and asks the couple about their Ewenki story, He Xie always walks slowly into the house and takes down two large photo albums from the top of the refrigerator - there is no smartphone yet. In the popular era, visiting reporters and photographers would always mail them to him after developing their photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the photo, they are skiing, singing, and drying dried meat in the forest. If you want to eat meat, pick up your gun and go out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to hunting, the energetic young hunter will briefly return - He Xie is the &quot;old hunter&quot; among the tribe who never misses. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Things in my memories are long enough. Most of the Evenki hunters in the photo have passed away, and the cause of death is somewhat related to alcohol. Of Maria So&#39;s seven children, only He Xie and his sister Dekesa remain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If I hadn&#39;t looked at him, he would have been gone.&quot; Zhuoye said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you don&#39;t drink, what else can you do?&quot; He Xie pushed back. His memories seemed to linger forever in the mountains and forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Lan, a researcher at the Institute of Ethnology of the Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences, has been following the Ewenki people for more than 30 years, and has become old friends with He Xie&#39;s family. Sometimes, Bai Lan would receive a voice message from Zhuo Ye, lamenting that there used to be people in front of her house, but now, they are the only ones left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are all busy now, so how can we have time to drink with him.&quot; In Bai Lan&#39;s view, He Gong&#39;s arrogance as &quot;Boss He&quot; disappeared. He Xie loves to make money, and as soon as he has some money, he calls friends and invites people to drink. But today&#39;s Aoxiang no longer follows the order of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/kdRbls3Jq6AprFfu5f2yAbPlRrJThsUqHp55Ojoe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 23, 2023, He Xie was in front of the graves of his mother Maria So and his father Rajmi He. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young Evenki people have their own way of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;36-year-old Gu Musen has 300,000 fans on the short video platform. In 2022, he founded his own media company, signed up young people in the countryside to be &quot;artists&quot;, and attracted tourists by relying on the fans he accumulated on the Internet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people who went to big cities to make a living have also returned. After graduating from college, Jue Le originally worked as an administrator in a hospital in Beijing, bought a house, got married, and had children in Beijing. But he felt that the work in the hospital was boring, and staying in the cubicle &quot;was like turning on the mechanical mode.&quot; In 2016, Juele returned to Genhe and ran a tourist spot not far from Aoxiang. &quot;It was very open, just like playing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Doing tourism business in Aoxiang can indeed bring considerable income. Juele estimates that he will earn more than 100,000 yuan from tourism in the summer of 2023, which will be enough to support his family throughout the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Lan gave He Xie some advice. The couple was humorous in their dealings with others, and He Xie played the harmonica well. If they could clean up their house and start a small business in the tourism industry, they could make money. He Xie was not willing to do it and thought it was &quot;boring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Xie still maintains a rough drinking method: drink vigorously for a few days to get stronger, then sleep for a few days and nights, wake up, then get up and continue drinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Lie, who was once envied by others, has become a person who is left behind and &quot;has not made progress&quot; in the eyes of his relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of July 2023, He Xie returned to Lao Ao Township. Not long after the Ewenki people moved out, the land was acquired by a real estate businessman in Daqing with plans to develop an international hunting ground. As a result, the plan was aborted, the hunting ground was not built, and all the old wooden carving houses were demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old Aoxiang became a deserted land, and the weeds on the roadside grew as tall as half a person. He Xie walked around Lao Aoxiang with his hands behind his back, but he didn&#39;t recognize where his house was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A fellow traveler asked him if he would be willing to come back to raise deer again. He thought about it seriously. This place had been uninhabited for a long time, and there were more wolves and lynxes nearby. &quot;It might not be appropriate to come back again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Romanticism&quot; and &quot;Realism&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As National Day approaches, a brown bear has become the big news in Aoxiang . At around 5 o&#39;clock in the morning on September 26, 2023, Lao Ge received a call that a bear had entered the reindeer park - he entered through the ticket gate, and he was familiar with the road. This is the third time it has visited the deer park in half a month. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Ge joked, &quot;If it comes again, then we will have to deal with it.&quot; When it comes to the beasts that appear more and more frequently, the deer herder on the mountain doesn&#39;t sound so relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a brown bear visited Yang Lan’s deer spot and killed 7 reindeer in one night. In another household, after the arrival of the wolves, only 8 of the more than 30 reindeer were left. In the year when the beasts were most serious, the entire Aoxiang lost more than 200 reindeer, and the total number of reindeer was more than 1,300. In other words, one out of every six reindeer died due to beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Really annoyed, Yang Lan&#39;s father complained to her that if the guns could be returned to the hunters for a week, the problem of animal harm could be solved. Otherwise, in a few years, deer farmers will face personal danger even if they survive in the mountains. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the speaker and the listener know that this is just angry talk. They are all nationally protected animals, who would dare to fight them? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki people are also gradually losing their ability to survive in the mountains and forests, which makes Bai Lan feel a little anxious. How to choose between modernity and tradition? &quot;Everything has given Ewenki an external intervention, so this culture will inevitably have its flaws.&quot; Bai Lan put forward this point of view in an interview with the media at the beginning of the ecological migration in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She felt that if hunters could decide their own development model, obtain certain resource management and use rights in ethnic areas, and be able to engage in moderate logging and hunting, the situation might be different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“That’s the view of literati.” In 2003, Kong Fanzhi had a remote debate with Bai Lan. When he mentioned it again now, he still couldn&#39;t agree with Bai Lan&#39;s point of view. &quot;We can&#39;t just let the Ewenki people live in Zuoluozi in order to protect traditional culture, right? Who doesn&#39;t want to live a modern life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xie Yuanyuan&#39;s view, these two attitudes come from completely different things. value judgement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the research, she and Maria Saw lived in Deer Point for more than half a month. Get up at around five o&#39;clock in the morning and work, such as beating legba, milking deer, picking wild fruits, cooking leather, and sewing leather goods... The days are simple and repetitive, and no one thinks that life needs any changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Ewenki people of different ages have different pursuits. When younger hunters see the broader world, they will naturally feel that their nation&#39;s customs are backward and want to make changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yuanyuan also wrote at the end of her doctoral thesis that traditional hunters who are attached to forest life do not have the right to speak and cannot easily sacrifice things that are more valuable and meaningful to the long-term development of mankind.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, doctoral student Xie Yuanyuan became a researcher at the National Institute of Strategic Studies at Tsinghua University. Today, in her opinion, Bai Lan’s views are “romantic”, while Kong Fanzhi represents the “realist”.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It is inevitable for social development for micro groups to enter modernization. Now Xie Yuanyuan feels that from the perspective of national governance, this is a sacrifice that must be made for the development of the nation. Faced with reality, rational The attitude is to remember those people and give them and their descendants a certain amount of compensation. &quot;This is reality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, since the Ewenki people first settled and came into contact with the outside world, Some traditions are slowly changing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ewenki language has no written characters and can only be passed down orally from generation to generation. Even people as old as He Xie and Lao Ge cannot speak the Evenki language as well as Half of them are old people. The birch bark boat, the most commonly used means of transportation by the Ewenki people half a century ago, has long since drifted into the museum from the rivers of the Greater Khingan Mountains. When Lao Ge was young, he began to tie several rubber tires together to use as a boat. , much simpler than making a birch bark boat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Ewenki hunters first settled in 1957, the young people who are now returning home to raise deer and run the tourism industry are already the third generation since the settlement. .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What about the next generation? &quot;&amp;nbsp;Bai Lan feels that the third generation who grew up in the mountains and forests have some affection for reindeer. The fourth generation of children who are not yet adults have lived on the cement floor since they were young. &quot;What will reindeer be in the future? Maybe I don’t care anymore.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Fanzhi believes that the reindeer will not disappear in Aoxiang. It is now the most important symbol of the Ewenki people and the reason why tourists rush to Aoxiang. “Others Nothing more to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Reference books:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Kong Fanzhi &quot;The Ancient Ewenki of Aolulu&quot; 》&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Xie Yuanyuan &quot;Ecological Migration Policy and Local Government Practice: Taking Aoluguya Ewenki Ecological Migration as an Example&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999 ;&quot;>;Gu Tao&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Aoluguya·Aoluguya&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:25:13 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方通报“北极鲶鱼”事件：深圳市原交通局货运管理分局局长钟庚赐被开除党籍]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258327]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 11:18:38&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, the Shenzhen Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision investigated Zhong Gengci, the former director of the Freight Management Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Transportation Bureau, for serious violations of discipline and law.

The month after Cai E’s death, he drafted the rules of the association and sought the consent of relevant personnel. Shi Taojun submitted the case to the nearby Hunan Provincial Government. Liang Qichao drafted a speech that was full of reasoning and reasoning: &quot;Therefore, the general served as an official in Yunnan and Guangxi, and served in Kyoto for more than ten years. At times, he was worried about state affairs, and did not care about family finances. In the breeze, his sleeves were full of energy, and he engraved this The white hair is in the hall, the yellow mouth is in the arms, and all the aftermath matters are waiting to be dealt with. Maybe they have been in trouble all the time, or they may have been close friends. They are saddened by the death of the hero, and the orphans are helpless. They gather their colleagues and organize the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. . Regarding matters related to the upbringing of orphans, our Association should carefully plan and cooperate with us at all times to provide support for the future. We should ensure that we are able to serve the country well in the future, have no worries at home, and comfort the souls of heroes underground.&quot; The Hunan Provincial Government has already participated in the matter. Chief Tan Yankai immediately gave instructions for filing, and ordered Xiangjiang Daoyin and the governors of Changsha and Baoqing counties to check and take the records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/KhSZoB5bYYKmJgoXQpy6K3S6p68uWuMO6VwV12Zj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height= &quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/KhSZoB5bYYKmJgoXQpy6K3S6p68uWuMO6VwV12Zj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Records about the Cai E Orphans Education Association in &quot;Tan Yankai&#39;s Diary&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao put a lot of thought into the design of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. Its goals and tasks, division of responsibilities and operation methods are all clear and feasible. As early as early December 1916, Xiong Xiling proposed: &quot;The current situation is unpredictable. To raise money for Song Gong&#39;s bereaved family, it seems appropriate to quickly send calls to the central government and all provinces for help.&quot; He also asked Liang Qichao to lead the call. Through contact with Cai E&#39;s family in Shanghai, Liang Qichao discovered that &quot;their family affairs were extremely controversial,&quot; so he decided to initiate the establishment of the Cai E&#39;s Orphans Education Association to reduce the impact of family conflicts on the education of orphans. Instead of using electricity to raise donations, so as not to violate Cai E&#39;s &quot;honest intentions during his lifetime,&quot; he instead mobilized relatives and friends to donate money, and planned to subsidize it with royalties. The people invited were selected by Liang Qichao, and were either Cai E&#39;s mentors or colleagues from the same hometown. Xiong Xiling, Tan Yankai, Fan Yuanlian, Zhao Hengti, and Jiang Fangzhen were also important figures who influenced Hunan Province and even the country. There are separate accounting directors in Hunan and Shanghai. One is to facilitate current education, and the other is to facilitate future study abroad, taking long-term and comprehensive considerations into account. In addition, two sources of fundraising are planned: one is national pension, and the other is sponsorship by comrades and martyrs at home and abroad; three methods of maintaining and increasing the value of donations: one is to purchase real estate, the other is to invest in valuable public stocks, and the third is to save in banks . Liang Qichao&#39;s design was unanimously approved by Tan Yankai, Xiong Xiling and others, who believed that it was &quot;allowed to be called Xiexie&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 17, 1917, Tan Yankai came to the Cai Gongying Funeral Office located in the Changsha Army Surveying and Mapping Bureau to attend a meeting of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. This is the first actual operation of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. Zhang Xiaozhun, Shi Taojun, Zeng Jiwu, Fan Zhihuan, Xiao Kun, Yuan Jiapu, Zhao Hengti, Liu Gengxian, Chen Fuchu, He Pengxiang, Tang Xi, Yue Sen, etc. in Hunan have a high probability of joining the Cai E family. Attended a meeting together. After the meeting, Tan Yankai telegraphed the agreed opinions of the meeting to Xiong Xiling and solicited his opinions:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xiao Ri (Editor&#39;s note: on the 17th) The Cai Gong Orphans Educational Association held a meeting and decided on the following matters: 1. The property in Shanmen shall be retained by the Dowager. 2. The newly purchased houses and land in the provincial capital and Baoqing City are owned by brothers Duansheng (i.e. Cai Duan, author&#39;s note). 3. The new and old movable properties, except for the 10,000 yuan provided for the meal expenses of the dowager, the rest of the stocks and cash will belong to the Duansheng brothers. 4. According to Cai Gong’s order during his lifetime, Duansheng will be raised by his wife, and Yongning will be raised by his wife. All movable and immovable properties will be equally divided and cannot be sold. 5. Investigate old accounts and clear them separately. 6. Madam, if your wife is currently living together and separated, should you do that?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distribution plan is centered on brothers Cai Duan and Cai Yongning, which has the color of the era where men are superior to women. Shanmen&#39;s local property is located in Shanmen Town, Wugang County (now part of Dongkou County) where the Cai family lived. It consists of a field with an annual rent of ten stones and an old house. Two new real estate properties were purchased in the provincial capital and Baoqing City. One is the residence at No. 1 Zhangshu Garden, Swan Pond, outside the south gate of Changsha City, which is relatively small in scale; the other is the abandoned site of the old association in Baoqing City, which was built by Cai E after his death. Tang Qian came forward to purchase it and originally planned to build a nursing home for Cai&#39;s mother, but the construction had not yet started due to lack of funds. The bulk of the property was the shares of Hunan Huachang Mining Company, which were very popular at the time, totaling 34,000 yuan, of which 5,000 yuan was purchased by Liang Huankui three years ago as a gift in gratitude to Cai E for his hard work and lack of production. At that time, the monthly salary of the brigade commander was as high as 2,000 silver dollars, and the total property of the Cai family did not exceed 40,000 yuan. Compared with local officials of the same era, they were really shabby. The sixth article, &quot;Mrs. Ru, Mrs. Ru is currently living together and separated&quot; confirms that &quot;their family affairs are extremely controversial&quot;, which obviously puts Tan Yankai in a bit of trouble. This telegram is found in &quot;Mr. Xiong Xiling&#39;s Posthumous Manuscript&quot; and should have been sent to Liang Qichao and others at the same time, but others have not preserved it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pay attention to descendants to repay the old friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the victory of the National Defense Movement, wars still continued, social unrest and people&#39;s livelihood were difficult, and the Cai family was also greatly affected. Affected by the international situation and other factors, the price of pure antimony dropped sharply. After a short period of prosperity, Hunan Huachang Mining Company fell into trouble in 1918 and later went bankrupt. Company managers such as Yang Du and Xiong Xiling have also been subject to continued lawsuits and extortion by Americans, and have even been detained. The Cai family&#39;s important asset, 34,000 yuan worth of shares in Hunan Huachang Mining Company, was lost in less than two years after collecting interest. Affected by war and disasters, the Cai family almost lost revenue from land and house rent. The world is difficult, and colleagues in the association have suffered greatly, but they still take the responsibility of caring for and supporting Cai E&#39;s orphan at heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 19, 1921, Tan Yankai, who was in the Guangdong military government, wrote to Shi Taojun: &quot;We must not ignore Mr. Cai&#39;s orphan. There are too few people here, and I am afraid that the inquiry is not as good as ours. My brother calls me my generation. It would be good to work out a solution, and everyone will agree. I hope you will tell me what you think.&quot; This was Tan Yankai&#39;s reply to Shi Taojun. Facing the plight of the Cai family&#39;s financial resources drying up, Shi Taojun asked Tan Yankai to find a way to rescue him, hoping to find a way to rescue him in Guangdong. Although Tan Yankai could not think of a permanent solution to the new approach, his sense of responsibility and concern were palpable. Four years later, Shi Taojun&#39;s son Shi Chaobai and Cai Zhulian got married in Shanghai, and then studied in Japan together, which was also an apology to their hometown friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/jaiAoaID918ardyBcujrPDHc5gbSfoHa1PqKJQzR.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;772&quot; height= &quot;441&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/jaiAoaID918ardyBcujrPDHc5gbSfoHa1PqKJQzR.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253484&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;News&quot; report on Cai E&#39;s Orphans Correctional Association on February 17, 1917. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of May 1922, Liang Qichao called Zhao Hengti, the governor of the Hunan Provincial Government, asking him to care for Cai E&#39;s orphan and protect the Cai family&#39;s property. The text is as follows: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Dear Sir, Qi Chao met with Bingsan and Jingsheng a few days ago, and occasionally asked about Cai’s posthumous affairs and education. The problem is that we should pay special attention to the incident. As for the property purchased by the bereaved family, since it is the capital of Cai Gong, we have to think of some preventive methods. The savings of the Cai Gong Orphans Correctional Association are very small, so they can only set aside funds for education, and it is extremely difficult to use them for other purposes. The living problems of the surviving family members cannot but focus on the property that has been established. Unless there is an official effort to consolidate the preservation of this property, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be eroded or abused by local ruffians. Members of the association should fulfill their own responsibility for maintaining and supervising the association, so those who respect the descendants of meritorious deeds are repaying their deceased friends. I hereby write to the deacon to promptly issue a notice and order it to be handed over to the local government office where Cai Gong’s property is located, prohibiting the sale and mortgage of the property, so as to protect the property and its long-term prosperity. The words of public friendship are dedicated to this, and I praise Xun&#39;an. Liang Qichao also started. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Hengti was once convicted of rebelling against Yuan, but was rescued by Cai E. He was very grateful. He was also a member of the Cai Gong Orphans Correctional Association, and immediately ordered the governor of Baoqing, where the Cai family was from, to comply. Zhang Xiaoyu, let everyone know. It can also be seen that Liang Qichao, Xiong Xiling, Fan Yuanlian and others have never forgotten Cai E and the orphans of the Cai family, and often tried hard to protect them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 1927, with the development of the Northern Expedition and popular movements, Hunan Province&#39;s movement to recover concessions, regain consular jurisdiction, anti-warlords, and punish old bureaucrats and gentry gained unprecedented momentum. The provincial government successively promulgated the &quot;Hunan Province Provisional Provisions on Punishing Local Bullies and Evil Gentlemen&quot; Regulations&quot; and the &quot;Interim Regulations of Hunan Province on Punishing Corrupt Officials&quot;, a special court and a committee to investigate and investigate counterfeit goods were established, and the campaign of sealing and confiscating counterfeit goods spread throughout the province. The Provincial Inspection and Inspection Office will reward those who report illegal property. The reward for reporting movable property will be 20% of the confiscated amount, and the reward for reporting immovable property will be 5% of the confiscated amount. Groups such as the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions have actively promoted it, using members&#39; meetings and other means to distribute questionnaires on adverse labor on a large scale, and strongly encourage reporting of adverse labor. There is a sizable property under Tang Guo&#39;s name, located at No. 31, Dadongmao Lane, Changsha City. It has been declared a reverse production and is about to be confiscated as the office building of the Provincial Mining Union. Three days later, the Cai Duan brothers contacted all walks of life to the effect that although the property was built by the Tang family, all rights had been transferred to the Cai family and should be returned. Immediately, under the intervention of military dignitary Tang Shengzhi and others, the property was removed from the list of adverse births. Tang Qian (1875-1929), courtesy name, was born in Baoqing. He joined the Tongmenghui while studying in Japan. After returning to China in 1905, he successively served as the director of the Guangxi Army Academy and the Yunnan Lecture Hall. Later, he participated in the Revolution of 1911 and the National Defense Movement. He has always been with Cai E and regarded him as a brother. He was one of the attachés who escorted Cai E to Japan for medical treatment. After that, Tang Xi served as the Financial Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Government, the President of the Provincial State Council, and the Director of the Provincial Finance Bureau. He was an important member of the provincial governor Zhao Hengti, and also served as the Director of the Ministry of Finance of the Beiyang Government. The warlord Zhao Hengti and the Beiyang government were both wanted to overthrow the Hunan Province at that time. Because of this relationship, the industries under Tang Guan&#39;s name were included in the anti-production list. Two years later, Tang Guan died in Shanghai, and his family donated the property to the Renshu Hospital next door in accordance with his last wish. It can be seen that the Cai Duan brothers provided friendly assistance to the Tang family by providing electricity, and it was society&#39;s respect for Cai E&#39;s orphan that preserved the Tang family&#39;s property. Before and after this, Cai E&#39;s second brother, Song Yuan, privately used his property as a mortgage to borrow money and deliberately went into bad debts. Cai E&#39;s wife, Liu Xiazhen, came forward to report that he had been defrauded and reported the case to the police station. It was immediately exposed by the other party and a public statement was made in the newspaper. However, it was only published for three days and then stopped. There was also the intervention of important people behind the scenes to protect Cai E&#39;s family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Liang Qichao has expanded his influence by advocating state funerals, regular commemorations, organizing Songpa Library, and writing birthday poems for Cai E&#39;s mother to take care of Cai E&#39;s orphan, who was still at home one or two years before his death. The book mentions: &quot;Cai Songpo&#39;s family is hungry and now they are homeless in Shanghai.&quot; Naturally, they can&#39;t help but try to save them. When Jiang Fangzhen was in Changsha, he lived in Cai E&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Zhang Xiaozhun, Fan Yuanlian, Liang Qichao, Tang Xiang, and Tan Yankai have passed away one after another, but colleagues in the Cai Gong Orphans Correctional Association and even outsiders have never given up helping Cai E&#39;s orphans. The friendship is touching. In June 1931, upon the petition of Zhang Renjie and others, the National Government allocated an annual pension of 800 yuan to Cai E&#39;s survivors, a monthly education fee of 400 yuan for their children, and a subsidy of 5,000 yuan for building a temple. Cai E&#39;s daughter was mentally depressed and was recuperating in Mogan Mountain, so Jiu Buqu heard the news and donated money to help reduce the pressure on medical expenses. On May 2, 1935, Mrs. Cai&#39;s mother Wang passed away in Changsha. Dignitaries from all walks of life sent letters of condolences and presented expensive gifts. The Hunan provincial government organized a grand funeral. The reputation of the Cai family reached its highest level after Cai E&#39;s state funeral. point. Around 1950, under the arrangement of Zhu De, Cai Duan and Cai Yongning entered the North China People&#39;s Revolutionary University to study, and were subsequently assigned jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A little regret and accident&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are very few public historical materials about Cai E&#39;s orphan&#39;s growth and development. According to general reports, except for Cai Fulian, who died young, both men and two women were college graduates. Cai Duan studied in the History Department of Fu Jen Catholic University in Peking, Cai Yongning studied in the History Department of Southwest Associated University, Cai Shulian studied in the Department of Pests and Diseases of Zhejiang University, and Cai Zhulian also studied abroad Japan. According to the &quot;History of Peking Fu Jen Catholic University&quot;, Cai Duan entered the History Department of Peking Fu Jen Catholic University in 1934. In 1935, he participated in the December 9 and December 16 anti-Japanese demonstrations and was injured, which shows that he was quite heroic as a young man. Peking Fu Jen Catholic University is a church-run university with excellent teachers and equipment. However, the tuition is expensive, about 400 yuan per academic year, and ordinary families cannot afford it. The care and concern of the Cai E Orphans Correctional Association and the righteous people have ensured that the living and educational standards of the four people are higher than ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduation, Cai Duan worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government. After the founding of New China, he worked in the Cultural and Historical Materials Research Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference and Guangming Daily. Cai Yongning worked in Yunnan Fudian Bank and Beijing Institute of Physical Education. Cai Shulian teaches at Songpo Middle School in Kunming, Yunnan. All four of them received good higher education and obtained decent jobs after entering the society. It can be said that they have basically become adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 1946, General Lei Biao, a fellow countryman of Cai E&#39;s hometown, published a long article &quot;A Brief Story of Mr. Cai Songpo&quot; in the &quot;National Defense Monthly&quot;, recalling Cai E&#39;s achievements and character in detail with deep affection, and even sighed at the end of the article. Angry:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;However, the family situation after his death is also deeply sighing. As a general, The family has no place to stand, the old mother is in the house, the two younger brothers have not completed their studies, the widow has a young son, and the upbringing is helpless. Although Liang was appointed as a public teacher, he collected 10,000 to 20,000 gold from various parties&#39; tributes, just for the temporary needs of the family, and as a citizen. In the 90s and 10s, the war between the north and the south resumed, and Baoqing, where he was originally from, was particularly affected. His mother, wife, concubines, and children had no peace at home all year round, and they had no choice but to live in Yunnan, Beijing, etc., and all their savings were exhausted. , it is also very surprising that the most shameful ones are the ones who have benefited the most, and those who have taken charge of the donations collected by all parties to support orphans, no less than tens of thousands of yuan, have been swallowed up together. Unexpectedly, in the army protecting the country, there are actually like this Such a person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 1905, Cai E served as the assistant director of the Hunan Coaching Office and a teacher at the Hunan Military Preparation School and the Bingmu School. Lei Biao was a student at the Bingmu School and followed Cai E after graduating in June of that year. E went to Guangxi, then to Yunnan and Sichuan, participated in the Revolution of 1911 and the National Defense Movement, and has been holding important military positions. When Cai E left Sichuan, he told Lei Biao to control an army and support the provincial governor Dai Kan. Because he was far away in Sichuan and probably not familiar with Liang Qichao, he did not participate in the Cai E Orphans Education Association. As a fellow villager, student, and subordinate of Cai E, what Lei Biao said should be basically credible based on his identity and experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many colleagues from Cai E’s Orphans Correctional Association have joined the National Defense Army. Among them, Shi Taojun, Zeng Jiwu, Xiao Kun, Liu Gengxian, He Pengxiang, Tang Guan, and Yue Sen are Baoqing compatriots who have more contacts with Cai E. He Pengxiang and Tang Gu were Cai E&#39;s deputy chief and secretary respectively. Theoretically, these people could be the person Lei Biao mentioned. As for people outside the association, it&#39;s hard to guess. However, people at the time generally believed that Shi Taojun and Cai E had a long and frequent relationship, and later became in-laws of their children, with the two families having the closest relationship. Li Xiaodan&#39;s &quot;Farewell Biography of Cai E&quot; pointed out: &quot;His classmate Shi Taojun was the broker of his family affairs.&quot; Therefore, it is very possible that Lei Biao alluded to Shi Taojun. Of course, all this is just speculation, and the truth needs to be proven by new historical data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is a great pity that such a collective act of charity is mixed with the selfish misdeeds of individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 10:25:13 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[最高人民检察院依法对杜兆才决定逮捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258323]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 10:10:11&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The case of Du Zhaocai, a former member of the Party Leadership Group and Deputy Director of the State Sports General Administration, is suspected of accepting bribes and will be investigated by the National Supervisory Commission The case is concluded and transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution.

When I signed up, I saw that it was full of people; when I went to the classroom, I saw that it was full of people. It&#39;s crowded. There were originally 40 people per class, but now it&#39;s almost 60. But what troubled my wife and me at first was whether the child should write with his left hand or with his right hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son is left-handed, which is a minority. According to statistics, one in ten people is left-handed. There are many left-handers in our family. My mother, wife, and eldest daughter are all left-handed. According to this statistics, the majority of them reaches 60%. When my son followed me to write calligraphy and draw pictures, many people around me were surprised and said: &quot;Left hand!&quot; My wife and I are relatively consistent on this point and have never let him forcefully use his right hand. Therefore, when others are surprised, I will say to my son: Son, you can write in whichever hand you want. Dad will not force you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son is very casual when he learns to write from me. But when I entered first grade, the problem of writing first surfaced again, as if it was back to when my eldest daughter was more than ten years ago. Because my daughter’s left hand writing was forcibly changed by her elementary school teacher, but she was not used to it at first, and then she changed to writing with her right hand. The left hand still took priority in doing other things, but the left hand could no longer write. Looking back on my daughter&#39;s experience of changing her right hand to write, the only difference is that when writing numbers and letters, there is a mirror image. Sometimes it is easy to make mistakes like b and d, but she gradually got used to it. For my son, I talked with the kindergarten teacher when he first started drawing with colored pens, and he has always used his left hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the problem of left and right hands, I have checked a lot of information, but there are almost no accurate and scientifically verified answers. Is this a question to be studied or a pseudo-question that is not a question? It is worth thinking about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After searching on the Internet, many celebrities including Einstein and Bill Gates are left-handed. They are far away from us. The most famous one I know is Gao Fenghan, a Qing Dynasty painter and one of the Eight Eccentrics of Jiangnan. He has hundreds of square meters of exhibition area dedicated to his works in the Qingdao Museum. He is a famous writer who writes with his left hand, but I don&#39;t know if he is left-handed because he only used his left hand after his right hand became ill. The other is the local Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan. I often see him writing with his left hand, but I don’t know if he is left-handed, let alone whether his most famous works were inspired by his left hand or his right hand. Assuming that both of them are right-handed, there will be no problem writing with the right hand, and the left-handed person will naturally use the left hand. Of course, there will be no problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We live in a world where the right hand is used to writing, eating and doing things. Because the number of people is small, people are a little curious about people who do things with the left hand. From this perspective, the question of writing with the left hand or with the right hand is a social phenomenon, an indicator of social tolerance. When you are a minority, the only problem may be that you have to grow up in a different light, which is not easy. Although it is not easy, I still tend to let it take its course when it comes to my son&#39;s left hand writing. With a symmetrical human body structure, it is impossible to say which side has the advantage. Therefore, it is especially important to treat left-handers as normally and naturally as right-handers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to think that this issue would attract many parents to discuss it enthusiastically, but when I posted it in the class group, I got no response. After the first parent-teacher meeting in elementary school, I communicated with my child’s class teacher, and the answer I got surprised me: In my son’s class, among the 55 children, there was only one left-handed person who wrote. Of course, he was not the only one who was left-handed. I asked friends of all ages who are familiar with me, and the information I got was: a fourth-grade primary school student said that there was only one student in his class who wrote with his left hand; a second-grade primary school student said that there was no one in his class who wrote with his left hand; a third-grade primary school student said The head teacher told me that in her impression, among the many classes she taught, there was only one child who wrote with his left hand. It seems that the question of whether we use our left hand or our right hand has been entangled for a long time. For most people, it is not a problem at all, and of course there is no need to discuss it. Perhaps, parents had made a choice about this issue when they first started holding pens in kindergarten, or they may have struggled with it at that time, but most people chose the mainstream, that is, using their right hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children who are born left-handed are destined to be a minority among the crowd, and it seems that children who choose to write with their left hand can only be a minority among the minority in our small place. If you look at it from another angle, writing naturally with the hand that is most convenient for you is not a problem if you are left-handed and right-handed. But from the perspective of only looking at the left and right, especially the perspective that more people only look at the right hand, becoming a minority is indeed a challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a son chooses to write with his right hand, it will be a challenge. It will challenge his physical limits. This is an individual issue; but choosing the left hand and choosing the minority is a psychological and social challenge. Children, although you are in the minority, hold on! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a citizen of Gaomi, Shandong)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

One day, I received a call from the village cadre saying that several trees next to his own grain drying field outside the village needed to be cut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are some poplar trees that my father planted next to the grain drying farm more than ten years ago. Although they were planted at the same time, several trees grew unevenly. The largest one was more than 30 centimeters in diameter at breast height and I couldn&#39;t wrap my arms around it, while the smallest one was no more than the width of a bowl. My mother said that maybe they were planted too densely, and the weaker ones couldn&#39;t compete with the stronger ones, so they grew slower and slower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After chatting with the village cadres for a while, I learned that cutting down trees was required by the superiors. This time, in addition to a few trees in my house, all the trees planted by villagers in nearby fields will be cut down: &quot;This time, all these trees in the fields south of the road must be cut down, and there is no bargaining.&quot; It is said that the County Land and Resources Bureau received satellite photos (&quot;satellite photos&quot;) sent by superiors, which circled many places in our county and said that these are cultivated lands, and those with trees must be cut down, and those with greenhouses must be demolished. All the land was restored to cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinarily, our trees grow beside the grain drying field and are not planted in the ground. Strictly speaking, the grain drying farm is agricultural facility land, not farmland. How did this small grain drying field with only a few dozen square meters turn into cultivated land? Maybe it’s because my parents have been in poor health in recent years and have farmed a lot less land. This drying field has basically not been used. It is covered with grass in summer, so it is regarded as cultivated land in the satellite film? Or maybe those who watched the satellite films didn&#39;t make a careful distinction at all, but just drew a random picture and concluded that all the land south of a certain road was cultivated land, and if it was changed to other uses, it would be restored? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, such problems are not uncommon in the process of &quot;satellite film law enforcement&quot;. More than half a month ago, a doctoral student from the School of Social Sciences of Wuhan University also mentioned a similar issue in an article. The superior land and resources department determines land use based on the changes in the &quot;patterns&quot; of satellite photos over the past few years. If it is found that the original cultivated land has turned into forests or houses have been built, it will issue a notice asking the local government to &quot;enforce the law&quot; and return the land to farming. But the problem is that the use of some land is more complicated and has changed many times in history. Just looking at satellite images without carefully studying the nature of the land and its changes can easily lead to problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And due to the insufficient resolution of the satellite images used in land surveys in previous years, some relatively small roads and other construction lands were not identified and were all classified as cultivated land. Nowadays, with technology upgrades, satellite photos The resolution has been greatly improved, and the road in the middle of the farmland could be distinguished. However, it turned out that it was considered illegal to occupy land for road construction and needed to be rectified. Just like my family&#39;s grain-drying field, it was also zoned as cultivated land, and the trees planted next to it had to be cut down. These mechanical &quot;law enforcement&quot; that do not study the actual situation and only look at pictures on satellite films, the pressure is directly transmitted to the grassroots, and conflicts between cadres and farmers are commonplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our county, due to the reduction of rural population and lack of labor force, a lot of land cannot be cultivated. Moreover, most of the land in our village is hilly and sloping, and it is difficult to divert water for irrigation. We basically rely on the sky for food, and the harvest from farming is not high. For farmers, switching to planting trees may not bring much income from selling trees, but at least they don’t have to work hard every year. A few years ago, the government also encouraged afforestation and even provided subsidies for planting trees, so some villages also planted trees on their farmland. Nowadays, it is necessary to &quot;return forests to farmland&quot; and cut down all the trees that are just about to become useful. This will naturally harm the interests of farmers and cause many people to not understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are indeed some good lands, and it is a pity to plant trees. For example, the neighboring village has thousands of acres of flat land beside a small river. There is water in the river. It was the &quot;irrigated land&quot; that everyone envied back then, and it was very suitable for growing wheat and corn. Later, these lands were also planted with trees. When I passed by my hometown a few years ago, I felt quite emotional. These patches of cultivated land have good soil quality and water for irrigating, and large agricultural machinery can be used to reduce manpower. Perhaps after the cultivated land is restored, it can be collectively contracted to large households for growing food through circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the barren mountainous land in our village, even if it is converted back to cultivated land, there will be no one in the village who can cultivate it. After all, the more than 200 people who still stay in the village all year round are mostly six-year-olds. For a seventy-year-old man, these fragmented lands are difficult to carry out large-scale mechanized farming. Even if all the trees are cut down, the final result is likely to be abandoned. So what’s the point of cutting down trees and “still plowing”? Will we spend money to hire people to grow food in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although there are doubts, the old people in the village are relatively honest, and most of them will not delve into it. If it says it needs to be cut, then just do it. After all, cutting down trees is now the task of the village cadres, and many of the villagers are related to the village cadres, or at least they are neighbors who never see each other without looking up. The villagers do not want to make it too difficult for them. It&#39;s not worth breaking up for a few trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the village cadres, there were also two businessmen from nearby villages who specialized in cutting down and buying trees. They negotiated the price on the spot, and they would come to cut down the trees and take them away the next day. There was no need to sell the trees in the whole process. People worry. However, since trees are being cut down everywhere now, the price is naturally much cheaper. A few years ago, someone offered 200 yuan to buy the largest tree, but my mother thought the price was too low and refused to sell it. Now, the five trees can only be sold for 200 yuan in total. This was because the person who bought the tree was an acquaintance from my mother’s natal village and was given a preferential price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
