Modern architecture, located in the ancient village of Huangpu, Guangzhou. Visitors walking through the granite strips will enter the landscape space under the hard top of the mountain and the low straight ridge. An artist is painting on a long table, and on the wall is a large completed landscape. This is 68-year-old Luo Yiping, who has used this ancient ancestral hall as a studio for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/1b19dc0539.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/1b19dc0539.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259849&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Luo Yiping&#39;s work &quot;Region·Non-Region (1)&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping has multiple identities. He is a painter, professor, critic and curator. He has taught at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Sun Yat-sen University. Later he served as the director of Guangdong Museum of Art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping is considered a rare &quot;scholar-type painter&quot; in the art world. In an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend in 2007, Luo Yiping, who teaches at Sun Yat-sen University, published a series of books called &quot;Images in Art History.&quot; &quot;Rather than reading their pictures, it is better to say that I am reading my own desires and will.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After many years, Luo Yiping remembers this discussion. It was his most important academic achievement at Sun Yat-sen University, and he interpreted thousands of Western paintings from his own perspective. Images in the history of contemporary art, as well as images of landscapes, figures, flowers and birds in the history of Chinese art. He said at the time: &quot;I don&#39;t think the essence of art is divided into East and West, but the expression tools of art are definitely different. This is not determined by personal subjective thoughts, but by differences in ethical habits and cognitive habits.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, Luo Yiping presided over the &quot;Art Creation Laws, Talent Growth Laws and Thousand Talents Research Plan&quot;, which was applied by the China Artists Association. To this end, he drafted a questionnaire to be distributed to members of the National Artists Association. As a result, he discovered something that worried him: the boundaries of artists now seem to be more &quot;firm&quot; than in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;They will frame it with a symbol or image. This unintentionally creates a clear boundary between traditional ink and contemporary ink, each playing its own role.&quot; Luo Yiping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fan Di&#39;an, chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, said: &quot;At present, the biggest issue in the development of Chinese painting is how to look at the relationship between tradition and contemporary times.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping did not answer this question directly. He painted many new works. In November, Luo Yiping completed his most important solo exhibition in 2023, &quot;One Yuan Returns to the Beginning - Luo Yiping&#39;s Ink Works Exhibition&quot; hosted by the Guangdong Museum of Art and the Guangdong Artists Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6aa87222e5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;784&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/6aa87222e5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259850&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Luo Yiping&#39;s work &quot;Jing·Not Jing (1)&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The exhibition consists of four parts: &quot;Mountain · Non-Mountain&quot;, &quot;Region · Non-Region&quot;, &quot;Jing · Non-Situation&quot; and &quot;Word · Non-Word&quot; The exhibition hall is composed of exhibition halls that display Luo Yiping&#39;s landscape works and boundary concepts in recent years. In Luo Yiping&#39;s works, Fan Di&#39;an said that he saw that boundaries are not constraints, but also provide the possibility of breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The homogeneity of ink painting is too serious”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May 2023, Luo Yiping created while listening to Tchaikovsky A large painting of 18 meters was made. It has been his habit for many years to pair classical music with large paintings. Music guides the painter&#39;s emotions, while large-scale landscapes test the painter&#39;s creative &quot;momentum&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What exactly is a landscape painting that is different from others? Over the past few decades, these works, ranging from large landscape paintings to landscape sketches, have not lacked appeal and literary interest, but they are still considered by critics to have the shadow of famous artists such as Huang Binhong, Pan Tianshou, and Lu Yanshao. Luo Yiping doesn&#39;t care about these external comments, but hopes to &quot;push open a door.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The paintings I have seen and the books I have read over the years flow into the eight-foot rice paper through the end of the pen. In the dense pen and ink, the traditional landscape &quot;disappears&quot; on Luo Yiping&#39;s scroll. &quot;Yes. This 18-meter-long scroll now hangs in the &quot;Mountain·Feishan&quot; exhibition hall. The image of the mountain appears faintly, but it is no longer so &quot;mountain-like&quot;. Luo Yiping uses an uncertain long and short lines and thick and light ink color blocks to show the atmosphere of the mountains, trying to draw the viewer into the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The painting theory of the Tang and Song Dynasties required that Chinese paintings should be &quot;visible, feasible, travelable, and habitable.&quot; Luo Yiping pointed to the broken lines in his landscape, &quot;Is this mountain beautiful? I can&#39;t tell.&quot; &quot;Does this mountain have space for us to enter? No.&quot; &quot;Does this mountain have the cultural atmosphere of a gathering of literati in pavilions and pavilions? No. &quot;This mountain has only bare lines. Do you want to live here forever? It will definitely not attract interest.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Traditional ink painting has strict regulations. &quot;What opinion do I want to express in a Chinese painting? Is there a mountain in front or behind it? Should there be a pavilion on the mountain?&quot; These are settings.&quot; Likewise, this regulation affects the people who view the paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This time, the spatial image that is most valued in traditional landscapes has been &quot;lost&quot; by Luo Yiping. Viewers of the painting are never able to enter the mountains, and can no longer find familiar directions and specific spaces. In the end, they can only &quot;see with non-mountain eyes.&quot; This is exactly the effect Luo Yiping expected. People who look at paintings can see their own desires and wills, just like they did in the past. Among the horizontal and vertical thick and thin lines and thick and light ink dots, follow along and let your emotions blend into the mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/23b202d7ae.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;831&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/23b202d7ae.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259851&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Luo Yiping&#39;s work &quot;Mountain·Not Mountain (V)&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yin Shuangxi, deputy editor-in-chief of &quot;Art Research&quot; of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, once said: &quot;He is a scholar, and the paintings are not just about his theory. It also reflects his memory of landscape painting images. A painter’s possession of the feeling of pen and ink is always the most important.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping was born in Jiangxi. He started painting in elementary school, then went north to study and received a doctorate degree from the Art History Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Later he taught in Guangzhou for many years. For many years, he has always insisted on &quot;having nothing in mind&quot;, which means that there should be no settings and regulations in mind, and he should break away from fixed ideas and methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After this painting, many problems seemed to be solved at once. Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters that in the past, there was a clear boundary between contemporary art and mainstream art: &quot;The boundary has a very strong restriction on the development of Chinese painting. Once it passes a little bit, it is not classified as Chinese painting because it crosses the boundary. This is Artificially setting up barriers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What Luo Yiping is worried about is that &quot;the homogenization of ink painting is too serious. If you learn from Huang Binhong, you will be Huang Binhong, and if you learn from Lu Yanshao, you will be Lu Yan Shao emphasizes foundation rather than development... Every ancient person actually has his own present. When every ancient person moves forward, the biggest issue he considers is the present.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping showed the questionnaire to Southern Weekend reporters. In the questionnaire, he asked more than 9,000 Chinese artists more than 600 questions, ranging from national ideology to the current development status of Chinese art to the artists&#39; personal family lives. Regarding the laws of art, the anxiety of faults, and the establishment of an evaluation system... On August 6, 2021, Luo Yiping decided to put everything aside for a short time and no longer consider these issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, he felt that there was nothing else in his mind, only the &quot;emotion&quot; that existed faintly. He wanted to pour out this emotion into his unforgettable works. This was how it was born. Luo Yiping found &quot;unprecedented passion&quot;: &quot;When you break through this boundary, you can gain greater freedom.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;There is an either-or barrier between traditional art and contemporary art. ”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In February 2010, Luo Yiping served as the director of the Guangdong Museum of Art. Two years later, at the Sixth Asian Art Museum Directors Forum, Luo Yiping once again felt some kind of discourse “pressure”. At the roundtable meeting, some art museum directors from East and South Asia suddenly &quot;attacked&quot; and hoped to cancel the forum later because &quot;the force that promotes the development of Asian art is not art museums, but curators.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As one of the participants at the time, Luo Yiping replied that he partially agreed with the curator’s opinion and decided to hold the first Asian Curated Exhibition in September 2013 The forum even proposed four sections of content. &quot;This is a temporary decision, including the time and topics of the forum,&quot; Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters. &quot;I remember the scene was quiet.&quot; Luo Yiping then added that the forum would also invite directors and curators from the world&#39;s top museums People discussed &quot;Asian consciousness and Asian experience&quot; together, and the vote was passed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soon, curators from important art museums including the Tate Modern in the UK, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the US, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, I received an invitation letter from China. This invitation lists the guests who will participate in the forum, although some people have not yet been invited. As a result, all the replies Luo Yiping received were &quot;participate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This was already ten years ago. Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters that various opportunities have contributed to this largest curator forum in the world so far. Luo Yiping said that this is the first and currently only forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping believes that the crisis faced by Chinese artists in the 21st century began in the late 20th century. Chinese artists suffered two impacts. One was the coercion of Western culture; Another is the change in the communication environment. &quot;For the outside world, mainly Asian contemporary art faces the European and American-centered art structure. Do we need to get rid of the Western system model and establish a new Asian artistic image? If so, how to achieve it?&quot; said the above-mentioned curator. At the forum, Luo Yiping said in a speech on the topic of &quot;Asian Consciousness and Asian Experience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Luo Yiping, who has retired, also prepared for the China Centenary Comics Exhibition held at the National Cartoon Museum of Belgium. At first, they encountered the familiar &quot;prejudice&quot; in Belgium, where the other party &quot;popularized&quot; comics, explained art and other basic content, but was unwilling to disclose the curatorial plan. In the subsequent long-term and powerful communication, the original &quot;assist in organizing the exhibition&quot; became &quot;leading in organizing the exhibition&quot;, and the plan to only show the &quot;revolutionary&quot; side of Chinese comics was replaced by a more comprehensive plan proposed by Luo Yiping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For many years, Luo Yiping has served as a visiting professor at the Repin Academy of Fine Arts in Russia, and has also been the chairman of the China Committee of the Asian Artists Alliance for 17 years. He told Southern Weekend reporters To put it bluntly: &quot;Chinese traditional landscape paintings have not received much attention in the world. The Japanese converted Chinese ink paintings into Japanese paintings during the Meiji Restoration era. When Europeans and Americans see Chinese paintings, they do not think they are Chinese paintings, but think they are Japanese paintings.&quot; Painting. Our traditional art has really little international influence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There is an either-or barrier between traditional art and contemporary art.&quot; After completing the 1.7 million-word project report, Luo Yiping realized that one of the core issues in Chinese painting is &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;cultural definition&quot;, which &quot;restricts the possibility of Chinese artists looking at art from a more comprehensive perspective.&quot; Sexuality has caused Chinese artists to be unable to deny themselves like Picasso and Matisse, Western artists in the 20th century, and lack a more tolerant and forward-looking vision.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Luo Yiping told Southern Weekend reporters that Chinese painters can of course &quot;put traditional language into a contemporary context to speak.&quot; In the work &quot;Region · Non-Region&quot; in Hall 2, Luo Yiping breaks the traditional ink landscape pattern and uses traditional brush and ink to organize the space, frame, and structure common in contemporary art works. In order to get closer to contemporary patterns, he added &quot;color&quot; to black and white ink to express the postmodern sense of &quot;absurd dislocation&quot;. In some works, Luo Yiping added elements of Western artists&#39; works to the ink that was originally a traditional landscape, realizing the &quot;juxtaposition&quot; of traditional ink and contemporary art, and also used contemporary painting materials to integrate them into the ink. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Hall 3, &quot;Jing·Feijing&quot;, Luo Yiping also brought installation art, with huge paintings reflected in the pillar mirrors. In Hall 4, &quot;Words and Non-Words&quot;, Luo Yiping uses 38 circular landscape paintings, tracing the ancient - imitating the ancient - literati taste - sketching - semi-abstract - abstract, recreating the path of ink painting from tradition to contemporary, without confrontation and Not a compromise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/44292696a2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/44292696a2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259852&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Some works from Luo Yiping&#39;s &quot;Yan Feiyan&quot;. Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These works may appear to be Chinese paintings at first glance, but they are full of contemporary atmosphere and feeling. During the curatorial period, after seeing the exhibition, German-Chinese artist Ren Rong believed that Luo Yiping&#39;s works were &quot;the purest contemporary art, and it is non-Western, breaking the traditional landscape space.&quot; None of the more harsh critics deny that Luo Yiping&#39;s works are ink paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past, Luo Yiping mentioned in an interview with Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;What does the author want to do? Isn&#39;t it to ingrain the system of signifiers and signifiers that is deeply ingrained in the readers&#39; minds?&quot; Tear them apart one by one?&quot; Sixteen years later, his works once again &quot;seduce&quot; and &quot;tear apart&quot; the self-imposed barriers of Chinese painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[曹保平：我并不迷恋愤怒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261458]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小区电梯放露骨广告背后：业主自治权难落实丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261479]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the &quot;Xiaoxiang Morning News&quot; report, a citizen in Changsha reported that the elevator in their residential complex was covered with stickers on three sides. The &quot;home massage&quot; advertisement, the advertising images and slogans are very &quot;explicit&quot; and uncomfortable. It also arouses the curiosity of children and worries the owners. After the owners complained, the property management company removed two advertisements. The remaining advertisement looked relatively normal, but after scanning the QR code on the advertisement, there were still pages featuring a large number of sexy &quot;physical therapists.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding these marginal advertisements, staff from the property management company said that if the owner feels there is something wrong with the advertisement, he needs to provide evidence that it is an illegal advertisement. Whether it is illegal or not is up to the government. This incident quickly aroused heated discussion, which made people think: Is it true that any advertisement can be placed as long as it does not violate regulations? Do the owners have a say in what advertisements are placed in the community? Furthermore, who does community advertising revenue belong to? How should it be allocated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These issues are actually very clear in law. Article 271 of the Civil Code stipulates that owners “enjoy the right to co-own and jointly manage the common parts other than the exclusive parts” of the building. The &quot;Property Management Regulations&quot; also stipulate that owners have the right to know and supervise the use of shared parts of the property, shared facilities and equipment, and related sites. Elevators, public activity venues, etc. are all shared by the owners of the community. In some communities, parking lots are built using roads, sites, etc. shared by the owners, and are also owned by the owners. Since these common parts are shared by the owners, the owners should naturally have the right to decide how to use them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to legal provisions, whether public locations such as elevators in a community can be used for advertising is a matter decided jointly by the owners and requires a vote by the owners. If the owners vote to place advertisements, they can also authorize the property management company to carry out specific operations. After all, it is unlikely that the owners will vote on whether every advertisement can be placed. However, even if the property management company is authorized to operate advertising spaces, it cannot do whatever it wants. When deciding what advertisements are acceptable, the views and feelings of the owners should be taken into consideration. Advertisements that the majority of owners think are inappropriate should be removed as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After solving the problem of whether it can operate, the next step is who owns the operating income and how to distribute and use it. In some communities, the owners&#39; shared portions are used for operations, and the income gained is considerable. &quot;Qianjiang Evening News&quot; once reported that a community with 15 residential buildings in Hangzhou has an annual operating income of about 1 million yuan, and some communities have an annual income of more than 4 million yuan. Advertisements in elevators, entrances, garages, etc. are an important source of income for the community. In addition, there are parking fees, business rent, venue rent, etc. Express lockers, self-service vending machines, etc. in the community need to pay rent. Some communities even charge entrance fees for telecom operators to set up base stations in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These operating income should naturally belong to the owners. According to the provisions of the property management regulations, these operating income should be mainly used to supplement special maintenance funds, and can also be used according to the decision of the owners&#39; meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, many property companies often forget that they are only entrusted by the owners to provide property services, and instead regard themselves as the managers of the community. Many property companies arbitrarily add business projects in public places of communities or increase charging standards without consulting the owners. Some time ago, property companies in many residential areas in Nanjing installed electronic billboards in elevators without the consent of the owners. Previously, some residential properties added express delivery cabinets, takeout cabinets, etc. without the consent of the owners. Disputes caused by property management companies arbitrarily increasing parking fees in residential areas occur from time to time in various places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to not respecting the rights of owners on whether and how to operate the jointly owned parts, the actual operating income of many communities is also unclear. Some property companies announce operating income every year, but they only announce a total amount, which is divided into several major items such as parking fees and advertising space rentals. As for the details of each income, they are rarely announced, and of course few owners study it in detail. This leaves a lot of room for the property management company to operate. Some property companies rent out business buildings shared by owners in the community to their affiliated companies at low prices. The affiliated companies do not even charge for advertising in the community, but for unrelated companies, the charges are even higher than the market price. More importantly, some of the income may go directly into the pockets of the property management company, rather than being used as public operating income for the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root cause of the constant disputes over community property management is that the property management company oversteps its authority and regards itself as the owner of the community and the manager of the owners. The fundamental solution to the problem lies in implementing the autonomy of community owners and allowing them to truly have the right to choose property management companies. Only then can property management companies truly change their roles and become service providers to all property owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财富管理榜：29家最活跃金融机构，谁更用心看护您的财富？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261448]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-28 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wealth management is one of the core businesses of the global financial industry. It is one of the blue ocean markets where financial institutions are increasing competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Calculated in terms of personal financial assets, China has become the world&#39;s second largest wealth management market. As of the end of 2022, my country&#39;s wealth management market has reached 118.49 trillion yuan, a year-on-year growth of 8.7%. Among them, the total scale of bank financial management and insurance asset management accounts for nearly 62%. At the same time, the huge potential of the wealth management market has attracted financial institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the wealth management market heats up and competition intensifies, regulatory agencies have issued new regulations one after another. In particular, the central bank, together with relevant departments, issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Regulating the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;commonly known as the &quot;New Asset Management Regulations&quot;&lt;/ span>;) is continuing to reshape the asset management market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The wealth management business in 2023 will not be easy. The lack of high-quality assets, the turmoil in the financial target market, and residents&#39; financial management deposits and regular deposits are all testing banks and insurance companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to select evaluation objects? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the huge market temptation, increasingly strict supervision and unfavorable market environment, the competition between my country&#39;s commercial banks and insurance institutions in wealth management in 2023 How is the strength? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the People&#39;s Bank of China announced the list of domestic systemically important banks. The People&#39;s Bank of China mainly evaluates and identifies systemically important banks from four dimensions: size, relevance, substitutability and complexity. Rated commercial banks are divided into different groups based on their scores. In addition to meeting minimum capital requirements, reserve capital and countercyclical capital requirements, banks in each group should also meet different additional capital requirements.

One voice thinks that Li Bai disdains to participate, while the other is that Li Bai cannot participate. &lt;p>; qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Contemporary scholars such as Professor Lang Baoru of Inner Mongolia University interpret that even if it is not a &quot;family of industry and commerce&quot;, Li Bai&#39;s family &quot;hidden back to Guanghan in the early days of Shenlong&quot; and was not in the Ministry of Household Affairs Registration, no genealogy. Xiang Gong needs to provide documents that can prove his family background and identity, such as household registration and genealogy, for review by the Ministry of Household Affairs. People with &quot;unknown origins&quot; like Li Bai were naturally not eligible to be selected as tribute candidates by prefectures and counties and take part in the imperial examinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai can only realize his ambition through other ways. &quot;Roaming in the mountains and rivers, living in seclusion to study Taoism, making friends with Taoist priests, paying homage to local governors and ministers of the government and the public, all with the purpose of raising one&#39;s worth and creating a sensational effect in becoming famous in the capital and the emperor, and only then was Tianbao summoned to the capital.&quot; Chongqing Xiong Du, a professor at Technology and Business University, said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taoism was respected in the Tang Dynasty, and the royal family regarded Laozi and Li Er as their ancestors. During the Xuanzong period, respect for Laozi and Taoism reached its peak. From the emperor to his relatives, nobles and bureaucrats, everyone believed in Taoism. Xuanzong&#39;s two younger sisters, Princess Jinxian and Princess Yuzhen, simply became female Taoists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From the age of 5, Li Bai lived in Changlong County, Mianzhou, central Sichuan (now Jiangyou City, Sichuan Province) for 19 years. As the birthplace of the Five Pecks of Rice Taoism, Shu Taoism is very popular and there are caves and heavens all over it. According to legend, Zhang Daoling, the founder of the sect, once lived in seclusion in Heming Mountain and preached in Qingcheng Mountain. There is still a Jinguang Cave in Qianyuan Mountain in Jiangyou, which is said to be the place where Nezha became a disciple and practiced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai was immersed in the atmosphere of Taoism. He visited famous Taoist mountains such as Mount Emei, Daitian Mountain, and Ziyun Mountain, and made many unique friends. He once lived in seclusion in the south of Minshan Mountain with Dong Yanzi, raised many birds, and learned the art of calling birds to his palm. Yuan Danqiu later became his best Taoist friend throughout his life, and invited him to visit Taoism in Songshan Mountain several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Fifteen tour fairy, fairy tour has never been rest ... ...

She analyzed to the Southern Weekend reporter that Li Bai and Su Shi were both from Sichuan, and their poems were full of elegant and romantic atmosphere. &quot;We are in a basin, and it is difficult to get out. The only exit is the sky. Sichuan people have developed the habit of using their own brains to make up for the reality, so they all have magnificent imaginations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Modern people are no longer sure of the specific locations of the fairy mountains in Li Bai&#39;s works, but they may as well pay tribute and commemorate his enthusiasm.

He mentioned to Southern Weekend reporters that in the past, when worship was allowed, before the Mid-Autumn Festival every year, Guangdong businessmen would often come to the ancestral hall with their families and ask Taoist priests to perform rituals for three days. &quot;Li Bai likes the moon.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai never left Taoism throughout his life. However, there were many motivations for learning Taoism. Taoism&#39;s pursuit of freedom and eternity in individual life is exactly in line with Li Bai&#39;s pursuit of a spiritual state of indulgence and freedom. When he was politically frustrated, Li Bai often turned to mountains and rivers and wandering immortals. Taoism undoubtedly gave him spiritual comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The subtle relationship between studying Taoism and seeking official positions is much more secret. While the Tang Dynasty implemented the imperial examination system, it also recruited secluded wise men from time to time, asking them about political affairs, or asking them to come out to assist the king. Many of these people were Taoists. Xiong Du discovered that, compared with the strict scrutiny of family background in the imperial examination, talents specially ordered by the emperor could escape this rule. For example, Taoist celebrities such as Zhang Guo and Ye Fashan, who were rumored to have the secret of immortality, were recruited by the emperor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also speculated that the reason why Li Bai was good at immortal Taoism may be related to this, &quot;It is to create for Xuanzong that he not only has the talent of Wang Zuo who knows the world, but also is You really have the impression of being an &#39;immortal&#39; with an &#39;immortal spirit&#39;, so that you can avoid the trouble of tracing your family background and place of origin when you join the officialdom.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The spirit of taking off your boots is still in your sleeves&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Night shrouds Xi&#39;an, and the lights of the &quot;Datang Everlasting City&quot; commercial street at the foot of the Big Wild Goose Pagoda come on. &quot;Prosperity of the Tang Dynasty&quot; performances are being performed all over the street.

Every night, this NPC (non-player character) will come here to exchange poems with tourists, &quot;Everyone, come and listen to this one again, the most difficult one among Taibai poems.&quot; What he throws out is &quot;Thoughts on a Quiet Night.&quot; There is also a &quot;Li Bai&quot; in Xi&#39;an. In the theme of the &quot;Twelve hours of Chang&#39;an&quot;, a certain wine industry has created Taibai wine restaurants. 》. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the Datang West Market Museum, a middle-aged lady who came with a group from Anhui told a Southern Weekend reporter that she observed that people traveling to Xi&#39;an pay attention to The most popular ones are the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, and the current recommendation is Li Yang’s Love.” Her tour guide, Xiao Liu, a native of Xi&#39;an, talked about Li Bai twice in the museum, &quot;casually&quot;. He admitted that he didn&#39;t know Li Bai at all before working, and he had relatively little contact with him after working. Except for a few tourists who like history, most of them People are similar to themselves, &quot;After watching &quot;Thirty Thousand Miles from Chang&#39;an&quot;, I understand a little bit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Li Bai actually did not have a fixed residence in the Tang Dynasty. He neither bought a house, nor was it found in relevant documents that he rented it. So like Bai Juyi, as his official position rose, his residence was from the south of the city to the imperial city, so the status level determines the level of wealth.&quot; Mao Jingru, education specialist of Xi&#39;an Museum, told Southern Weekend reporters that in history, &quot;Chang&#39;an It is not a place where he (Li Bai) has lived for a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 742, Li Bai received Xuanzong&#39;s order to enter Chang&#39;an. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, some northern Hu people&#39;s clothing became popular in society, including the &quot;black leather Liuhe boots&quot; worn by the Hu people. Later, the official officially designated it as the standard wear for officials, which is quite similar to the black leather shoes commonly worn in modern formal occasions. When he first arrived in Chang&#39;an, Li Bai was still wearing the white linen clothes that symbolized the common people. This time, he changed into a round-neck robe and black leather boots and entered the capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai wrote &quot;Nanling Farewell Children Entering Beijing&quot; before leaving, &quot;It&#39;s not early to persuade the children to endure the hardships, and ride the whip on the horse for the long journey. ...Looking up to the sky and laughing out loud &quot;How can I be a Penghao person?&quot; Years of depression were relieved, and the ideal of displaying talents and strategies was given the opportunity to be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, he had the ambition of &quot;lobbying thousands of people&quot;, and the position he was awarded was Hanlin enshrinement, or Hanlin waiting for the imperial edict. Unlike Hanlin scholars who are in charge of edicts and participate in political affairs, Hanlin ministers are a group of professionals in various fields who stay by the emperor&#39;s side to serve him. They had the opportunity to have real positions after being favored by the emperor. For example, Wang Shuwen, who was good at playing chess, and Wang Qian, who was proficient in calligraphy, waited for the imperial edict, were appreciated by Dezong, and served as attendant readers and calligraphers, and were promoted step by step. However, Li Bai entered the Imperial Academy with poetry and prose as his skills, and he always stayed in the position of a literary attendant and never entered the formal bureaucratic ranks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As time passed, Li Bai, who was living in the Hanlin Academy, found that his political ideals were becoming disillusioned. &quot;It&#39;s easy for blue flies to get together, but it&#39;s hard for white snow to harmonize with each other. It&#39;s meant to be dispersed,&quot; he said. People have repeatedly criticized others and promoted criticism.&quot; Not only could they not be reused, they were also slandered and ostracized by others. Opportunities that once seemed close at hand are actually out of reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/895515d194.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/895515d194.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259847&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Bai once lamented in a poem that &quot;the road is difficult and divergent&quot;, but then he wrote, &quot;There will be long winds and waves, and the clouds and sails will rise across the sea.&quot; &quot;.

Wei Hao&#39;s &quot;Preface to the Collection of Li Hanlin&quot; names the slanderers: Xuanzong once intended to appoint Li Bai as Zhongshu Sheren, but he was slandered by his consort, Zhang Shuo&#39;s son Zhang Bian, and it was not realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nowadays, Li Bai&#39;s own political limitations are gradually being valued and emphasized. Zeng Yueyu and Zhou Shi described Li Bai&#39;s incompetent official performance in the novel &quot;Li Bai Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Li Bai has drafted several official edicts, which are related to the recent personnel changes in the DPRK. Logically, before the official announcement, the content must be strict Keep it secret. Li Bai, who was drunk, didn&#39;t care about that at all. He took advantage of the drunkenness to use the internal information as oral news, spreading it around regardless of occasion or location.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text -align: left;&quot;>;There is no way to verify whether Li Bai ever drafted official documents, and the degree of leakage may not be as exaggerated as described, but there is evidence for such writing. Fan Chuanzheng, who wrote the inscription for Li Bai, said that he &quot;went in and out of the province while drunk, and had to talk about the greenhouse trees.&quot; Wang Qi of the Qing Dynasty also suspected that he &quot;had leaked the secrets of the ban while drunk, and the Ming Emperor ignored it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Fangmin, a professor at Northwest University, researched based on Li Zhao&#39;s &quot;Hanlin Chronicles&quot; that the Hanlin Academy in the Tang Dynasty had particularly strict requirements on work style. Any carelessness in words or deeds would be punished. It may ruin the political future. He concluded that those who served in the Hanlin Academy would be more cautious than bureaucrats in other institutions. He also discovered that Xuanzong himself had personal experience of the harm of drunkenness and had abstained from alcohol for the rest of his life. Therefore, Li Bai&#39;s addiction to drinking could not help but make Xuanzong worry about appointing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For Li Bai, returning from the political center frustrated, being slandered and alienated can be said to be his true feelings at that time. However, due to his personality and officialdom Political alienation and conflicts led to another reason for his political failure, which was also obscured to some extent. In the final analysis, Li Bai&#39;s frustration in waiting for imperial edicts was the political failure of a talented poet.&quot; Li Fangmin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xuanzong, who once &quot;gave food on a bed of seven treasures and a spoon in his hand&quot;, gave the poet a grand courtesy, but whether he would let Li Bai participate in politics must be marked by a question mark. In Duan Chengshi&#39;s &quot;Youyang Zazu&quot;, Xuanzong said to Gao Lishi, &quot;This man is really poor.&quot; Meng Qi&#39;s &quot;Benshi Shi&quot; records that Xuanzong &quot;used it as a non-corridor temple vessel, so he dismissed it with an imperial edict.&quot; Everyone is saying that Li Bai left an impression on Xuanzong, and that this person was not worthy of elegance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The discord between Li Bai&#39;s celebrity temperament and officialdom is concentrated in the matter of &quot;taking off his boots&quot;. Academic circles have different opinions on whether Li Bai ever asked Gao Lishi to take off his boots. Some scholars regard it as a novelist&#39;s statement and cannot be trusted. Zhou Xunchu, a professor at Nanjing University, believes that although Gao Lishi was the most favored eunuch by Xuanzong, under normal circumstances, Li Bai would not have ordered him to take off his boots. However, &quot;Li Bai was wild in nature and was drunk, so there was no clear reason to exclude this matter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The movie &quot;The Legend of the Demon Cat&quot; combines the two anecdotes of Lishi taking off his boots and writing &quot;Qing Ping Tiao&quot;. Gao Lishi asked Li Bai to compose a poem for Yang Yuhuan, and Li Bai took off his boots. After two rounds of fighting, Gao Lishi reluctantly took off a black leather boot for Li Bai. Li Bai was half drunk and half awake while writing &quot;Qing Ping Diao&quot;, which was praised by Yang Yuhuan, but Li Bai bluntly said that he did not write it specifically for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The Tang Dynasty is really amazing if you have you.&quot; In the movie, Yang Yuhuan appreciates this sincerity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The moon shines on Qinchuan on Mount Emei&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 744, on a spring night in Chang&#39;an City where flowers were blooming, Li Bai drank wine alone. There was no one around, but he was determined not to drink the contents of the cup quietly, so he sang and danced wildly, inviting the bright moon in the sky and the lonely shadow on the ground to drink together. He wants to get drunk, and then heaven, earth, and himself will cease to exist, and everything that is not going as he wants will be annihilated. At this time, it was less than two years since Li Bai was waiting for imperial edict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On an autumn night half a year ago&lt;/span>;, he was slandered and shunned in the officialdom, and his ambitions were difficult to realize. The frustrated Li Bai thought of the moon in his hometown: &quot; The dim clouds are falling, and the love of the past is dim. The green rose moon on the autumn mountain, who will see it tonight?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Finally, he left Chang&#39;an, leaving only Read such masterpieces as &quot;Drinking Alone Under the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wine to Ask the Moon&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At this time, Li Bai had gone through two-thirds of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;On the Nine Heavens of Chang&#39;an Palace, this place was once a close minister.&quot; Everything suddenly disappeared and became a memory. Li Bai&#39;s hope of seeking a way out of the court was shattered, and he urgently needed to find spiritual sustenance. His deceased wife left behind a pair of children, but the time he spent with the children was far less than the amount of time he spent practicing Taoism in seclusion with the Taoist priests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the Ziji Palace of the Taoist Temple in Jinan, Li Bai asked the Taoist priest Gao Rugui to teach him the Taoism and became a Taoist priest. From the time when Tianbao left Chang&#39;an in the late spring of the third year of Tianbao&#39;s reign, to when he traveled south to Wuyue in the fifth year of Tianbao&#39;s reign, this was the period when he was most worldly-minded. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Fu and Li Bai also met at this time. Du Fu experienced the blow of failing the imperial examination, and with a common depressing mood, he saw the depth and persistence behind Li Bai&#39;s wild and unrestrained attitude. &quot;We spend our days drinking and singing wildly, who is the hero of flying and domineering.&quot; This sympathy for each other continued in the lives of the two poets, even if they never met again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While wandering in the south, Li Bai kept witnessing the disappearance of old friends, and his mentality changed. When he arrived in Siming (now Shaoxing, Zhejiang), he paid homage to He Zhizhang, who died of illness here, and missed the years when they met in Chang&#39;an to exchange wine with each other. While in Jinling, another series of bad news came: his friend Cui Chengfu was demoted, Li Shizhi was forced to commit suicide, and Li Yong and Pei Dunfu were killed with a stick. Li Linfu, who was in power, was imprisoned many times, unjust cases appeared one after another, and the government and the public were filled with an atmosphere of terror. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai could no longer feel safe in seclusion. He often worried about the fate of the country, and his passion for serving the world deep in his heart burned again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;He often expresses the longing for retreating to deserted mountains, but he always wants to return to the court immediately when he has the opportunity. The ideal and desire to achieve great things,&quot; Ha Jin wrote in &quot;The Road to Heaven: The Biography of Li Bai.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After getting married for the second time in Liang Yuan, he went north to the land of Youyan, hoping to seek development by joining the army. In the poem presented to the judge He Changhao, Li Bai&#39;s intention is obvious. He is ashamed to be a scholar of Zhangju, and he is unwilling to be like Geng Yin. He actually wants to rise up with a sword and collect extraordinary achievements in the desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On this trip north, Li Bai arrived at the jurisdiction of Anlu Mountain, and perhaps saw clearly the truth that the latter was preparing to rebel. Li Bai returned frustrated. He felt helpless against the internal and external troubles of the Li Tang Dynasty, so he could only seek seclusion in the south again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Besides studying Taoism, Li Bai, who has stars on his temples, is increasingly aware of the importance of one thing. &quot;Knowing what is wrong at fifty is what the ancients have done. If you make up for your mistakes with words, you will live forever.&quot; &quot;I am determined to delete the story and reflect it for thousands of years.&quot; He made it clear that there is no hope of meritorious service, and perhaps his destiny is to make words. It can also be said that Li Bai truly became aware of his identity as a poet when he was around fifty years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai&#39;s first wandering ended with the scene of entering Chang&#39;an; the last wandering also had an event that brought it to an end, that is, joining the team of Yongwang Li Lin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, the Anshi Rebellion broke out, and people fled the war and were displaced. Wang Changling returned to his hometown, and when passing through Jianghuai, he was killed by the governor who hated him. Du Fu moved his family to Yanzhou for refuge. He heard that after Suzong ascended the throne in Lingwu, he went north to Lingwu and was captured by the rebels on the way and taken to Chang&#39;an. The poet Wang Wei was taken prisoner to Luoyang by the rebels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai and his wife Zong fled south to seek refuge and lived in seclusion in Lushan Mountain. He once planned to lobby the Li Tang clan in Jiangnan to raise troops to serve the king, and had dealings with both Xu Wang Yannian and Wu Wang Zhi. It happened that Yong Wang Li Lin raised his army and patrolled eastward to Xunyang. He repeatedly invited him to be an aide, and Li Bai finally agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is 56 years old and this is probably his last chance. This person with a complex of the Eastern Jin Dynasty feels that the old dream of the previous dynasty is right in front of him. At the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Five Husties disrupted China, and the Eastern Jin Dynasty established the country in Jinling, inheriting the lineage of the Central Plains. Will the Anshi Rebellion achieve Li Bai just like the Battle of Feishui in the previous dynasty achieved Xie An? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Li Fangmin understands that Li Bai is inevitable, this move integrates an objective situation and subjective desire. He speculated that when Li Lin&#39;s lobbyist Wei Zichun was lobbying Li Bai, he hinted that Li Lin&#39;s actions in Jiangling and even on the eastward tour were in accordance with Xuanyuan&#39;s purpose and had the strategic purpose of managing Jiangnan. With these, he was able to impress Li Bai, who had an old love for Xuanzong as a monarch and a minister, and once again inspired his desire to help the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Lin was defeated, Li Bai was downgraded from a capital crime to a first-class crime, and was sentenced to Changliu Yelang. He set out from Xunyang, traveled to Dongting, and went up to the Three Gorges. When he first arrived in Wushan, he encountered a nationwide amnesty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At this time, the counter-insurgency war was still going on. Not only was a large area of ​​land north of the Yellow River in Shi Siming&#39;s hands, but the rebels continued to invade the south. The situation was very serious. After wandering for thousands of miles, Li Bai once again had the idea of ​​​​serving the world. In Jiangxia, the political center of the south, while waiting for news about his friend Wei Liangzai in the capital, he went to visit some officials and waited for several months. , the imperial court showed no sign of conscription. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With no hope of meritorious service, Li Bai then thought of writing poems and speeches. &quot;Qu Ping&#39;s poems and poems hang over the sun and moon, and the Chu king&#39;s terrace is empty on the hills.&quot; He compared the two lives of Qu Yuan and the King of Chu: Qu Yuan was loyal and patriotic, but was exiled, but his poems and poems can compete with the sun and moon and are immortal through the ages; while the King of Chu The palaces, towers and pavilions built with extravagance and lust have long since disappeared, leaving nothing but desolate hills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bai asked people to compile collections three times during his lifetime. Once he invited Duke Dongqian of the Han Dynasty, once he invited Wei Hao, and once he invited his clan uncle Li Yangbing. The end of Qian Gong&#39;s manuscript is unknown. Wei Hao followed Li Bai thousands of miles away, and the two became friends with each other. Li Bai gave him all the manuscripts at that time. Wei Hao was the editor chosen by Li Bai when he was in good health and thoughtful. However, the &quot;Collection of Li Hanlin&quot; he compiled for Li Bai were mostly fragments recovered from the Anshi Rebellion when &quot;all the chapters and sentences were exhausted&quot;. Li Bai was seriously ill in his later years and had no time to sort out the drafts. There was only one Li Yangbing around. Entrusting the poem manuscript to the pillow, there is no choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Li Bai was 60 years old, he returned to Xunyang and climbed Mount Lu again, determined to spend the rest of his years traveling as an immortal and learning Taoism. However, he could not forget about the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he heard that Shi Chaoyi&#39;s power was back on the rise and Li Guangbi sent troops to suppress it, he resolutely asked Ying to participate, but he returned halfway due to illness. Li Bai is old. But the passion that had been ignited in him since his youth had never been extinguished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;His understanding of things, his political ideals and thinking have been like this for a lifetime. People like us would never know ourselves ten years ago, but from his youth to his old age, he maintained an innocent young heart.&quot; Ding Ying lamented to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 762, Emperor Daizong came to the throne, searched widely for talents, and granted Li Bai the official position of Zuo Shiyi. However, &quot;he was not born with a salary, but he was promoted to an official after he died.&quot; When the edict came, Li Bai had already passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are different opinions on the cause of Li Bai&#39;s death. &quot;Jumping into the river to catch the moon&quot; or &quot;riding a whale to catch the moon&quot; have always been talked about. Japanese sinologist Tomohisa Matsuura believes that these legends are sensitive to Li Bai&#39;s hobby. Li Bai unconditionally affirmed the existence of the moon and pursued the pursuit of becoming one with the bright moon. &lt;p>; There are earth-shattering articles.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A thousand years later, Gong Zizhen said in &quot;The Most Recorded Collection of Li Bai&quot;: &quot;Zhuang (Zhou) and Qu (Yuan) Shi cannot be combined.

However, this comprehensive functional paralysis lasted for nearly 12 hours, which is also the longest failure of Didi Chuxing in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Didi Chuxing’s previously announced financial report for the third quarter of 2023, the total transaction volume of China’s travel business in a single quarter was 72.5 billion yuan, and the average daily order volume reached 31.3 million. With this “collapse” Calculating the duration of the failure, it is estimated that Didi will lose over 10 million orders and over 400 million transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As for the reason why Didi Chuxing App crashed for a long time, Didi Chuxing has not responded as of press time. However, judging from the system failure, some relevant people in the industry pointed out that the cause of the failure is likely to come from Didi’s own computer room network problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data shows that as a network service that requires extremely high response speed to data volume, the frequency of Didi Chuxing failures is not low. On September 22, 2022, users reported that Didi Chuxing could not be used normally. At that time, Didi Chuxing responded that &quot;due to a computer room network failure, some Didi services were affected.&quot; At that time, the failure had been repaired within half a year. On February 25, 2021, &quot;Didi crashed&quot; also appeared on the hot search. Didi Chuxing responded at the time that it was due to a &quot;system abnormality&quot; and the fault was quickly resolved. Earlier in October 2019, July 2016 and October 2015, Didi also experienced system failures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Didi Chuxing’s cloud services are mainly supported by Didi Cloud. According to Didi Cloud&#39;s official website, Didi Chuxing&#39;s cloud computing services are based on Didi Chuxing&#39;s business technology and experience accumulation. It adopts leading cloud computing architecture, high-specification server cluster construction, high-performance resource allocation mechanism, and refined operation model, and is committed to It provides developers with IT infrastructure cloud services that are simple, fast, efficient, stable, cost-effective, safe and reliable.

A total of ten people came. It turned out that three classmates who worked in different financial institutions were wearing almost identical work clothes. Nowadays, different units have different requirements for dress code. Some require employees to wear work clothes while others do not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This seems to be a small problem, but it is not. For example, in September, the U.S. Senate was in an uproar over whether members should wear formal attire when entering the Capitol. In the end, the U.S. Senate revised the dress code: allowing senators to wear casual attire such as hoodies and shorts. This move attracted criticism from mainstream media such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Institutions, companies, and organizations around the world are faced with a multiple-choice question when it comes to employee attire: Should they uniformly dress? What are the considerations of whether to do it or not? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/tqrexqi6pppqr6nfmev6iqb9pvta67a.jpeg&quot; widt = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/TQRExQi6pPp7lbrXzwLPQr6NFmeV6iqB9PvTA67a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259823&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Realistic Considerations of Uniform Dressing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The so-called &quot;work clothes&quot; are actually people from the same institution or organization wearing uniform styles of clothing to identify them. Identity, showing their occupations, showing their duties. Generally speaking, work uniforms are uniform, rigorous, and depersonalized, and are distinguished from employees&#39; personal attire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a company&#39;s perspective, employees often have practical considerations when wearing uniforms. First of all, this is a need to shape the corporate image. Employees are uniformly dressed and neatly organized, which will leave an initial impression that the company is rigorous, serious, and positive; uniform work uniforms generally have the company&#39;s logo on them, which can play a role in promoting the company&#39;s image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Secondly, for those positions that face customers directly and have more communication with customers, such as the financial industry and the lawyer industry, uniform attire of employees can bring customers A professional look and feel helps to dispel customers&#39; doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; For the job, when wearing a unified professional worker, it can play a psychological suggestion, help yourself enter the state of work, improve your work, and improve your work. execution ability. At the same time, wearing work clothes can also restrict the personal behavior of the staff, reminding him not only the personal image, but also the image of the unit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There are also some special occupations, uniformly pretending to reflect the authority and seriousness of the occupation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;比如我国对一些公权力机构提出了统一着装的要求，其中就包括公安部门、国家安全部门、司法部门、法院系统、检察院系统、 Customs systems, tax systems, national quality inspection departments, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In contrast, the reason why the US Senate relaxed the requirements for clothing was caused because public opinion was worried that this would harm the seriousness of Congress. The New York Times wrote like this: In the current division of the United States, one of the last harmonious signs of the Senate is the decoration specification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Although it cannot eliminate the profound differences under the surface, it does remind each senator that their goal is still the consensus of most people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; There are also some occupations unified dress, which is determined by the characteristics of the occupation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; For example, the doctor&#39;s white coat is the earliest to promote the disinfection habits in surgery. The white coat also helps doctors to prevent static electricity during treatment. Many medical devices are very precise instruments. The effects of static electricity on equipment may mislead the results of diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; When a doctor enters the operating room, he wore a blue or green surgical jacket, which has something to do with &quot;visual retention&quot;. During the surgery, when the doctor saw the patient&#39;s red blood, when he moved his eyes to the doctor&#39;s white robe, the phenomenon of &quot;color replenishment&quot; appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As long as the doctor looks at the red complementary color of the red-such as blue or green, it can immediately alleviate the role of &quot;color replenishment&quot; and slow visual fatigue, so surgery Most of the service will use blue -green. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/28kkdyi9mv0KEF1GEF1GEF1Gen4exeibztev2.jpeg&quot; Border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/28kkdyi9mv0KEF1GEF1GEF1GEF1Gen4exeibzxTev2.jpeg&quot; Data-Key = &quot;259824&quot;>; &lt;/&lt;/>; p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >; Relaxation requirements are not necessarily bad. &lt;/H4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Some units and institutions require unified dress, with reasonable reasons, but this does not mean that uniform dressing is suitable for all all to all of all Units do not mean that uniform costumes are favorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Some people who have experienced the 1970s and 1980s may be impressed by the &quot;unified dress&quot; of that era. At that time, there was a name called &quot;law enforcement&quot;, and all a public unit would be uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On the one hand, it reflects the sense of honor, &quot;there is a head&quot;; on the other hand, the work uniform is the &quot;invisible benefits&quot; of the unit, and some units take the staff The clothing all year round was packed, but the finances were paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So that some industries and personnel who did not have the functions of administrative management were also uniformly dressed, and they moved closer to the dressing of the law enforcement department. It has damaged the seriousness of the law enforcement department, wasted the finances, and also had a bad impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; So, starting from 1986, the State Council rectified the unified dress. In 1988, 1991, 1992, 2003, the State Council issued a unified dress issue. Related notices, criticizing those departments that uniformly uniform dressing, &quot;not only affect the seriousness of uniform dressing, but also lead to increasing fiscal expenditure.&quot; Later, the State Council also made clear stipulation on the unified dressing department and personnel. It can be seen that it is not uniform or good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Unified dressing will bring constraints, stereotypes, and uncomfortable feelings to some professionals. Therefore, many employees opposed the unified dress. A British survey showed that 61%of the people looking for new jobs in 2017 said they would have a negative view of any company that executed the decoration specifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In order to fight monotonous uniform clothes, the Western workplace was born in the Western workplace. On the day, at least on this day, you can grasp the autonomy of dressing and be free to be yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Another study shows that if the dressing requirements are easier, most British labor will feel higher efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Those big companies that pay attention to creative ideas often do not require employees&#39; dressing, such as Microsoft and Facebook. Although the employees may be different, such as the programmer loves a plaid shirt, Zuckerberg wore the same casual clothes every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; These technology companies not only do not require employees, they will also improve the work environment. Stimulate employees&#39; imagination and creativity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In short, it is difficult to generalize whether employees need to be unified. Some occupations emphasize seriousness, and some occupations value the perception that they bring to customers. Some occupations have special occupational attributes, and some occupations are more concerned about how to maximize the creativity ... Different demands are facing pretending to pretend to pretend to be pretending to be. There are different requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; For the staff, the unified dressing problem is not so big, if the unit is free to send the work service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
