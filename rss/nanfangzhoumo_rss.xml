The 39-year-old CEO has always kept a low profile and rarely appears in the spotlight. The last time he appeared in the public eye was Douyu&#39;s 2023 second quarter results conference call held on August 14. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu (DOYU.&amp;nbsp;Nasdaq), which was born in 2014, has survived the brutal fighting in the early days of China’s game live broadcast industry. It once ranked among the top two players in the industry with its ferocious playing style and Huya, which entered the game earlier than it. male. In 2019, Douyu ushered in a bright moment, following Huya to become a listed company on the US stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past two years, large comprehensive short and medium video platforms such as Bilibili, Kuaishou, and Douyin have accelerated their attacks, and the game live broadcast track has become increasingly popular. Douyu has also experienced the loss of anchors, weak performance, frequent scandals, etc., and its prospects are not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 25, 2023, Douyu received a compliance warning from the Nasdaq Listing Qualification Department, stating that its closing price had been lower than US$1/share for 30 consecutive trading days and did not meet the compliance requirements. Nasdaq&#39;s minimum share price requirements. Douyu must maintain the closing price of its stock at no less than $1 per share for at least ten consecutive trading days within 180 days, or before April 22, 2024, in order to return to compliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Echoing Douyu’s unpredictable prospects, there is also the whereabouts of CEO Chen Shaojie. Douyu told Southern Weekend reporters that Douyu has no official response to this news and the company is currently operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, Douyu closed at US$0.82 per share, a decrease of 1.19%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;A person who likes adventure and licks blood&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1984, Chen Shaojie was born in Jinan, Shandong. Looking at his life experience: addicted to games, majoring in computer science, dropping out of college, and starting a business continuously, Chen Shaojie has gathered many characteristics of the trendsetters in the Internet era and successfully turned his hobby into a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Shaojie himself once said bluntly in a Douyu live broadcast that he had a high school degree and dropped out of college after one year. He believes that spending four years studying does not necessarily mean a deep understanding of the Internet. Comparing the Three Kingdoms, he said that one&#39;s origin is not the most important. &quot;Liu Bei originally sold straw mats, Guan Yu sold dates, and Zhang Fei slaughtered pigs. As their respective With their growth, they have become the most awesome generals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2009, Chen Shaojie and his partner Zhang Wenming sold their first entrepreneurial project, the &quot;Master&quot; battle game platform, to Shanda Games, and Chen became the general manager of Shanda Winger Wuhan Company. The function of the leader is to realize online battles in stand-alone games. Geek Park once reported that Leader is a successful product. One year after it was launched, it has registered a total of 450,000 people and has more than 200,000 daily active users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, Chen Shaojie, who made his first pot of gold, acquired the two-dimensional video website AcFun (referred to as Station A) for about 4 million yuan, and launched the &quot;Shengfang Broadcasting&quot; live broadcast channel. In January 2014, Chen Shaojie independent &quot;Shengbangshu&quot; into a game live broadcast platform with barrage function - &quot;Douyu TV&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following years, China’s game live broadcast industry entered an explosive period. In May 2014, Zhanqi Live, backed by the state-owned enterprise Zheshu Culture (600633.SH), was launched. In November of that year, YY spun off its game live streaming business and established Huya Live. In 2015, Longzhu Live and Wang Sicong’s Panda TV were established. In 2016, NetEase and Tencent successively launched CC Live and Penguin Esports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu has been the darling of capital since its appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qichacha shows that Aofei Entertainment (002292.SZ) made an angel round investment of RMB 20 million in Douyu just after its establishment in 2014. In the same year, Sequoia Capital invested another US$20 million in Series A financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2016, Douyu’s Series B financing was led by Tencent, which invested RMB 400 million, followed by Nanshan Capital and Tianyu Digital (002354.SZ), with the total investment scale reaching US$100 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Series C financing five months later, Phoenix Capital and Tencent led the investment, with participation from many institutions. Douyu finally raised 1.5 billion yuan. Before going public in 2019, Douyu received financing every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu, who is backed by financing, plays fiercely, which is also related to Chen Shaojie’s personal character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been media reports that Douyu insiders evaluated Chen Shaojie as &quot;a person who likes taking risks and licks blood at the edge of a knife.&quot; Douyu once poached six anchors from the industry within a month, with a total fee of more than 60 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Feng, founder of YY Game Live, once wrote an article analyzing why Douyu was able to overtake Huya in its early stages. “A big reason for the rise of Douyu is that we spent huge sums of money to sign the top anchors in YY and the industry from the beginning.” Before Douyu, YY game live broadcasts could be relatively controlled by controlling traffic and income distribution. Live anchor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, game anchors are different from entertainment anchors. The former has external effects, does not rely on live broadcast platforms, and has other opportunities to become Internet celebrities (such as e-sports events, Youku game channels, Weibo etc.), has the ability to bring its own fans, and can also bring fans to migrate, so YY Game Live has not signed a contract with the head anchor. This gave Douyu an opportunity to directly use the signing fee instead of the share to obtain top anchors, which became the core reason why Douyu could overtake Huya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the game live streaming industry went through a period of consolidation after a big wave, forming a &quot;fish-tooth confrontation&quot; pattern in the first echelon, with Douyu and Huya taking most of the game live streaming market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The problem of profitability is difficult to solve&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On July 17, 2019, Douyu was listed on Nasdaq at an issue price of US$11.5 per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But its stock price only experienced a short period of sustained growth during the epidemic. On February 16, 2021, Douyu once reached an intraday high of US$20.54 per share, and then plummeted to less than US$1 per share now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering 2021, Douyu’s quarterly revenue, except for the fourth quarter of that year, has been negative growth. According to its 2022 financial report, Douyu’s revenue growth relies heavily on paying users and revenue per paying user. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Douyu is losing users. Wind data shows that in the second quarter of 2023, the number of quarterly paying users of Douyu was 4 million, a year-on-year decrease of 39.39%. The number of monthly active users was 50.3 million, a year-on-year decrease of 9.69%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu’s current revenue still mainly comes from live broadcasts and advertising, and its attractiveness to advertisers continues to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2020 to 2022, Douyu’s live broadcast revenue was 8.8522 billion yuan, 8.5966 billion yuan and 6.7973 billion yuan, accounting for 92.2%, 93.8% and 95.6% of the total revenue in the same period respectively. Douyu&#39;s advertising sales revenue was 645.2 million yuan, 464.9 million yuan and 190.3 million yuan, accounting for 6.7%, 5.1% and 2.7% of the total revenue in the same period respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although revenue continues to decline, it will be profitable for two consecutive quarters in 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, Douyu’s net profit was 6.8 million yuan, and the net loss in the same period of 2022 was 38.8 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Douyu’s turnaround from losses to profits is the result of cost reduction and efficiency increase.” Ding Daoshi, a senior Internet observer, told Southern Weekend reporters that he does not think this is a healthy way to make money, but Expressing understanding, &quot;This is also a helpless strategy in extraordinary times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second quarter of 2023, Douyu’s expenses were 196 million yuan, a decrease of 42% from 340 million yuan in the same period last year. Among them, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 48% compared with the same period last year, research and development expenses decreased by 30.2%, and general and administrative expenses decreased by 48.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sluggish performance of Douyu is due to the impact of short video platforms on traditional live broadcast platforms on the one hand, and the impact of leading video platforms such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Kuaishou on the gaming field on the other hand. Strong preemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, Station B spent 800 million yuan to defeat domestic live broadcast platforms such as Kuaishou, Douyu, and Huya, and won the exclusive live broadcast of the League of Legends (LOL) Global Finals (S Competition) in China for three years. copyright. In July of the same year, Kuaishou launched the “Million Game Creator Support Plan” and frequently held various competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the unfavorable situation, in July 2020, Tencent tried to lead the merger of Douyu and Huya, but was later stopped by the regulatory agency on antitrust grounds in accordance with the law. As of March 31, 2023, Tencent held 46.7% of Huya’s shares and 37.7% of Douyu’s shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Game industry analyst Zhang Shule told Southern Weekend reporters that although Douyu and Huya are survivors of the game live broadcast melee, the failure of the merger means that both have lost an opportunity to integrate resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Douyu and Huya continue to experience brain drain. In August 2023, Xuxu Baobao, the head anchor who had been live broadcasting on Douyu for 5 years, announced that he would switch to Douyin. In March before this, Huya outdoor anchor Mu Yingying also joined Douyin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Anchors are like migratory birds, they go wherever it’s warm.” Zhang Shule said that anchors have no loyalty to the platform and are now jealous of selling products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ding Daoshi’s view, Douyu and Huya have few moats. In their early years, they relied on the Tencent system and related popular e-sports live broadcasts to rise. In recent years, Bilibili, Douyin, Kuaishou, and even video accounts can also conduct game live broadcasts. “There are so many people sharing the cake, but the growth rate of the cake is obviously not synchronized.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that in this context, traditional e-sports live broadcast platforms represented by Douyu and Huya are in these A year-on-year decline is inevitable and the downward trend will continue. They are all looking for new growth paths outside of games, such as sports live broadcasts, but the results will take time to be verified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shule said bluntly that the overall revenue scenario of Douyu game live broadcasts and short videos is single. Facing the attack of other pan-entertainment platforms, Douyu lacks more effective checks and balances besides relying on Tencent. &quot;The biggest pain point is Profitability is still a problem.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that Douyu’s only moat is Tencent, one of the three giant domestic game companies (the other two are NetEase and MiHoYo). Tencent has a huge control over the field of e-sports, and can use IP licensing and e-sports event licensing to reserve some private space for Douyu. However, opponents can still look for game and e-sports cooperation outside the Tencent system, so the moat is not wide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shule said that the plight of Douyu and Huya is almost the same, but now under the arrangement of Tencent, the two companies cannot merge and try and make mistakes at different times in order to find a way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his opinion, Douyu’s gaming attributes are too strong, and the user portraits in the outdoor, appearance, and two-dimensional areas highly overlap with the gaming area. The real possible direction for Douyu to get out of trouble may be to combine new profit models in e-sports events that are also difficult to make profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Ten Thousands of People Gather to Gamble”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a leading game live broadcast platform, Douyu has frequently received negative news about pornography, vulgarity, and alleged gambling in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2020, the official blog of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League published an article saying that the live broadcast room of Douyu anchor &quot;彡彡九屋&quot; (hereinafter referred to as 339) is suspected of hosting tens of thousands of people for gambling, and the daily turnover can reach several million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2021, the official blog of China Youth Network’s short video stated that the Douyu anchor “Changsha Village Death Squadron” is the “biggest casino in Douyu” and a lottery suspected of gathering gambling will be opened at 10 o’clock every night. , thus forming the public codename &quot;Ten Points Economic Lessons&quot;. In 2020, its turnover was as high as 177 million yuan, and its daily turnover was as high as 13 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, &quot;彡彡九Outdoor&quot; will be characterized as gambling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sichuan Legal News, 339 member Fu Moulong and three other people &quot;tried to turn their bicycles into motorcycles&quot; through &quot;one card application for 50,000 yuan to take home&quot; between March 2017 and September 2020. &quot;A large number of inflammatory words such as &quot;Encourage live broadcast room viewers to participate in the lottery, and push lottery time and amount information to other people who did not participate in the live broadcast through platforms, WeChat groups, etc., resulting in a large number of people entering the live broadcast room during the live lottery period and paying.&quot; Apply for a card&quot;, swipe virtual gifts, etc. to participate in the lottery. After the draw, winning cash will be distributed to the winners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to the time of their arrest, Fu Moulong and others had organized a total of 4,267 draws (times), with more than 4.42 million people participating, and gambling funds of nearly 120 million yuan. After trial, the Dujiangyan Court held that the actions of the three people constituted the crime of opening a casino, and they were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from six to three years, and were also fined. This case is also the first gambling case involving a live broadcast platform in the country supervised and handled by the Ministry of Public Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2021, Qian Xiaojia, the first brother of the former Douyu outdoor anchor, revealed in an interview that although gambling-related activities in 339 and other live broadcast rooms are not officially held by Douyu, the platform is not unaware of it. There will even be internal guidance. In the second half of 2019, Qian Xiaojia was banned by Douyu for violating regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China&#39;s WeChat public account &quot;CyberChina&quot; released the national cyberspace administrative law enforcement and supervision situation in the first quarter of 2023, stating that it will continue to promote the &quot;Qingming&quot; series of special actions , resolutely investigate and deal with all kinds of online illegal activities in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It mentioned that Internet platforms such as Baidu, Sina Weibo, Douyu, and Douban failed to fulfill their main responsibilities and failed to manage the information released by their users, resulting in obscenity, feudal superstition, and solicitation of prostitution. Regarding the spread of harmful information on the Internet such as prostitution, gambling, and loan sharking, the Cyberspace Administration of China instructs the local Cyberspace Administration to conduct interviews, order rectifications, and carry out punitive measures in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 8, &quot;CyberChina&quot; issued another article stating that in response to serious ecological problems such as pornography and vulgarity on the Douyu platform, the Cyberspace Administration of China directed the Cyberspace Administration of Hubei Province to send a working group to station Douyu platform launched a one-month centralized rectification supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Shule’s view, China’s live broadcast craze originated from game live broadcasts, but game live broadcasts failed to break the barriers of consumption scenarios and failed to become the leader in the trend. It was not until the emergence of live broadcasts to bring goods that A new situation has opened up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The current game live broadcast platform is also looking for its own &#39;live broadcast delivery&#39;, but through crazy trial and error, many problems have arisen.&quot; Zhang Shule said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[100万？300万？想不上班到底要存多少钱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260278]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen in Jiangxi shared his story. She and her husband spent 7 years saving 1 million yuan. After part of it was used to buy a house, the remaining 500,000 yuan was deposited in the bank. Now the monthly living costs can be covered by interest alone. She also shared a series of ways to save money, such as cooking at home for many years, not drinking coffee outside, only buying discounted clothes, taking her children to sunbathe instead of taking interest classes, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the authenticity of this experience has not been verified, in February this year, a Shanghai couple did decide to &quot;retire&quot; with a deposit of 3 million yuan. This news sparked widespread discussion at the time. Just recently, Professor Chen Bingzheng from the Department of Finance at the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University was interviewed by CCTV Finance. He mentioned that “a survey found that over 70% of those born after 90 start to think about pension issues.” He said that it is too late to start thinking about pension issues at the age of 35. From work After receiving your first month’s salary, you should start saving for retirement in a planned way. It can be seen that young people’s anxiety about saving money for retirement is not an idle complaint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much savings do you think you need to retire from the workplace with peace of mind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Come to the comment area to express your opinion, and we will send you a hot comment immediately! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 20:25:58 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[董明珠称孟羽童兼职接广告不合规：非工作时间能否干副业？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260289]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 20:20:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In May this year, Dong Mingzhu’s secretary Meng Yutong resigned, triggering various speculations and discussions. Recently, in an interview with Guangdong Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;Financial Eyes&quot;, Dong Mingzhu responded publicly to the matter for the first time: Internet celebrities do not judge people&#39;s quality, and it is illegal for people to advertise outside Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dong Mingzhu said Meng Yutong’s part-time job accepting advertisements was illegal” was once a hot search topic. According to a report by the Shanghai Securities News on May 16, the reason for Meng Yutong&#39;s resignation was that he &quot;often missed work to participate in business activities and take on private work&quot; during his time at the company. After the company talked to him, he still carried out related activities without improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, Meng Yutong did receive advertisements on social media platforms. In the short videos on his Xiaohongshu account, he appeared many times selling clothing, beauty products, electronic products and household goods. In the &quot;Good Things Pocket&quot; column, there are 65 notes included, none of which have anything to do with Gree Electric products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally thought that the rights and wrongs of this incident were very clear. However, many netizens believe that the contract Meng Yutong signed with Gree is a labor contract, not an endorsement contract. The time outside the eight hours is her own. Of course, she has the right to control how much she earns through endorsements and part-time advertising. Money is a reflection of her ability. This has also led to some discussions: Is it appropriate for the company to restrict employees from doing side jobs? If the income from your main job is not as good as your side job, will you leave your job? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this point of view and these discussions? First of all, it must be said unequivocally that it is not appropriate to use Meng Yutong&#39;s case to demonstrate the rationality of employees taking part-time jobs or doing side jobs outside of their own jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Yutong did graduate from a prestigious university, has a sweet appearance, and has good looks, but these qualities are not sufficient or necessary conditions to become an Internet celebrity. There are a lot of people with these qualities, but only a few lucky ones are successful. The track for Internet celebrities is very crowded and very winding. If someone says that Meng Yutong’s ability to become an Internet celebrity depends entirely or mainly on his personal abilities, that is undoubtedly not objective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that Meng Yutong became an Internet celebrity mainly due to Dong Mingzhu’s efforts on top of his buildable personal qualities. Dong Mingzhu made her his secretary, and announced that he would train her to be his successor and take her to various occasions. Through the event, many hot searches and topics were created, bringing her countless traffic. Dong Mingzhu is working hard to make her the first person to bring goods to Gree live broadcast. In this sense, Meng Yutong, who has become an Internet celebrity, is an asset of Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Dong Mingzhu and Gree are obviously old-school, hoping that gentlemen&#39;s agreement and personal consciousness will have sufficient behavioral constraints on Meng Yutong, rather than &quot;first Before the company invests resources in an individual, it ensures and locks in potential future earnings, and limits and eliminates the risk of breach of trust of a sparrow that turns into a phoenix and then soars into the sky and escapes control. That is, the contract stipulates the rights and obligations of both parties and improves the The cost of breach of trust should be taken into account before you can safely invest in betting and package marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when it was discovered that Meng Yutong was using the Internet celebrity identity created by the company to do private work, Dong Mingzhu and Gree did not immediately send a clear and strong signal saying &quot;this is not acceptable&quot;, but The reason is that there was no timely intervention or the intensity of the intervention was not enough. The mentality may be that the matter can be solved quietly internally, through reasoning and persuasion, so as to prevent the matter from turning into a negative incident or scandal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if Meng Yutong had been given a clear choice the first time he did private work, either to stop and hand over the proceeds from his private work, or to leave, the problem might have been solved long ago. When Meng Yutong took on more and more private jobs and his income outside of work became higher and higher, it became difficult for him to stop. At a certain stage, Dong Mingzhu could no longer tolerate it and had to resolve it through a final showdown, which brought us to the scene in May this year. Therefore, if there is something wrong with Dong Mingzhu and Gree, it is that they made the above two mistakes one after another. But this does not disprove that it is in line with professional ethics for Meng Yutong to use the Internet celebrity status created by the company to do private work and make big money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there is no simple answer to whether employees can work part-time or do side jobs outside of their regular jobs, and it needs to be analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it depends on whether there are express provisions on this in the labor contract or other types of contracts signed with the company or organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, units within the system generally have some clear restrictions on employees&#39; part-time work, and will regularly conduct inspections on employees in this regard, allowing employees to declare on their own. Of course you can lie or conceal the situation, but if your employer finds out, you will inevitably be punished or even lose your job. In addition, well-regulated companies generally prohibit employees from receiving remuneration from competitors, suppliers or customers. This not only potentially harms the company&#39;s interests, but may also lead to criminal investigation in serious cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it depends on the nature of your part-time job or side job, and whether there is any conflict of interest with your work in the unit and the business of the unit. You are a salesperson and have accumulated a lot of customer resources. At a certain stage, if you set up a business and go it alone, the company may not be able to do anything to you. However, if you secretly set up a business with a similar nature to the company while receiving a salary from the company, A company that imports customer resources into its own company is undoubtedly against professional ethics, and the company may not let it go if it finds out. Or if you are a technical R&amp;D person and sell the code you wrote in the company to a competing company or other companies, or take work from a competing company, this will also damage the company&#39;s rights and interests and seriously violate professional ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, &quot;Besides the eight-hour working time, it is all your own time, you can do whatever you want.&quot; This statement must be at least restricted by the above two rules. In the final analysis, it means respecting the contract and Observe professional ethics. As long as it does not violate the contract and company regulations, does not harm the company&#39;s rights and interests, has no conflict of interest with the company, and does not affect the main job, generally speaking, the company has no objection to individuals doing side jobs and part-time jobs to increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 20:25:58 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[桐子故事丨峡河西流去]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260210]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;701&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tongzi flowers bloom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Xiahe to Luanzhuang, we have to cross three ridges. It&#39;s not the three ridge heads, it&#39;s the third ridge head counting from Taoping. Taoping has now changed from a township to an administrative village. It is where the Santiao Ridge originates and the Yitiao Ridge begins. Going further south is the Funiu Mountains and then enters Nanyang. Why it is called Santiaoling instead of Sandaoling or something else is not clear. Indeed, the word &quot;Tiao&quot; is a bit strange, as if it is a ridge rather than a mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The side of Santiao Ridge near Luanzhuang is a ten-mile downhill slope. At the bottom of the slope is the Bada River. After crossing the river and going five miles eastward, you will reach Luanzhuang Town. Luanzhuang Town has been the capital of Luanzhuang since the Republic of China, the so-called economic, cultural, transportation and power center. The ancient town that was more than a hundred years old now has no trace of the past. Instead, there are concrete buildings rising from the ground on both sides of the Luanzhuang River, which is sometimes dirty and sometimes clear. Everything sold on the street is modern. For example, household appliances used for heating in winter are electric braziers instead of charcoal. Even the dogs running on the street have many fashionable hair styles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the side of the ten-mile downhill road, there are all tung trees. Of course, that was a scene more than thirty years ago. Nowadays, it is all pine trees and arrowgrass. The pine trees are overbearing and the arrowgrass is not a fuel-efficient lamp. With them, there is no one else. There are only a few tung trees here and there, and the old-fashioned people have nowhere to stand. In today&#39;s spring and summer, the mountains are green and interspersed with wild flowers of strange colors. Walking through this place gives people the excitement and satisfaction of returning home in rich clothes. In winter, half of the mountains are green and half are withered and yellow, like a failed oil painting. The economy of small places is not good. Traffic management personnel hide in those curves, use the terrain and vegetation to catch illegal motorcycles, and fine them to generate revenue. They catch them accurately. Unless there is an urgent matter, people rarely ride there. If you want to go there, you will choose morning or evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than thirty years ago, I was a junior high school student in Luanzhuang Town. At that time, most of my classmates didn&#39;t like studying very much, and it seemed that going to school was just to complete tasks to pass the time of their youth. In comparison, I love studying more, but compared with those brain-burning words and numbers, I still love things that have nothing to do with grades, such as tung seeds, from tung flower to tung seeds, I love them all. No matter what, it just feels good. I feel that they are mine and I am theirs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers bloom in March. At this time, many flowers have finished. The peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, pear blossoms and begonia flowers have all disappeared, but more summer flowers have not yet arrived. The day is already very warm. At this time, it suddenly gets cold, and there may even be snow. When the temperature becomes warm again, the tung flowers will bloom. The adults said that the tung flowers are still frozen by the cold wind. The tung flower is neither beautiful nor ugly, neither big nor small, but its aroma is different, it is a delicate fragrance, and the smell is very similar to its color and shape: white petals inlaid with light red ones. Each flower and branch is similar, like twin sisters. The tung flower blooms on one slope, so vast and dense that no one else can be seen. From a distance, the flowers on a slope look like chatty words that no one can talk about. Unlike other flowers, there are red, green and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many children at that time. If they all rushed to school together, there would be a long queue from front to back. The front is in the Tung Blossom Array, and the back is still on the other side of the ridge. The front is across the Bada River, and the back is still in the Flower Array. Everyone who goes to school carries a net bag, and the white buns, black buns and mixed-noodle buns in the pockets are clearly visible. Girls love vanity. They cover the buns with a layer of newspapers so that they can only see the prosperous scene of the motherland but not the buns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers have one use: treating burns. At the mouth of the Bascha River, there was an old Taoist priest who had returned to secular life. He was very old, bent over, and his beard and hair were all white. He often goes to the mountains to collect fallen tung flowers. The fallen tung flowers were spread all over the ground, as dense as tree heads. The strange thing was that there was no decrease in the trees, as if they were growing while falling. He carries a woven bag and collects a bag of fallen flowers. I don’t know what he did with it when he took it back. He mixed it with other ingredients, mixed it into a paste, put it in large and small bottles, and applied it on the injured person’s burns. I don’t know which year the old Taoist priest died, and the prescription for treating burns was taken away with him. He had no children, and no one passed him on. Besides, he couldn&#39;t make a living by treating burns. There weren&#39;t many burns all year round. He doesn&#39;t rely on this for a living either. If you get burnt, you have to go to the hospital and spend a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months after the tung flower bloomed, the tung seeds came out. They were all green and tender, but they were actually too hard to be broken open. The boys were throwing it at each other and hitting a bag on their heads. If you smash it open with a stone, you will find that the tung seeds are white and plump and crowded together. They are very fragrant when chewed in your mouth. They are more delicious than walnut kernels, but after a while, you will have a headache and nausea. The shell of the tung seeds removed and dried in the sun is a good material for making fires, which is perfect for burning the kang in winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school cafeteria only has one kind of rice, corn grits soup and porridge made from corn grits over high and slow fire. It only has breakfast and lunch. In the evening, you can only eat your own steamed buns or cook them until dawn. The food for dinner is very important. It must have oil and water, but most of them don’t have oil and water. It’s okay to have no oil and water. There are some varieties, but there are few varieties. It’s just a bucket of garlic juice mixed with sauerkraut, and the amount is limited, so it must be distributed reasonably. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a lacquer tree in front of Jinsuo&#39;s house. It is more than three feet tall and as thick as a hug. Such a large lacquer tree is rare. In summer, it blocks the sky and the sun, but in autumn, the lacquer seeds can be broken down to boil a large pot of lacquer seed oil. Lacquer seed oil is also a kind of edible oil, and can also be used to light lamps. On the way to send the deceased, a burning lantern can be lit. But the tree is too old, half prosperous and half withered, and half of the tree trunk is rotten. One summer, after a rain, a large mushroom grew on the dry side of the tree. It was red and yellow in color, like a flaming cloud falling from the western sky. The sumac mushroom is one of the finest tree mushrooms. It is tender and delicious and can be served on banquets. Jinsuo and I broke it off and filled a basin full of it, but he had no oil at home and couldn&#39;t find it after searching through the cabinets and corners. I said, if there is a way, go get the tung seeds to refine the oil. We went up to Santiao Ridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to refine oil from tung seeds. We picked a basket of tung fruits, smashed them open, dug out the tung seeds, crushed them with a garlic mortar, boiled them in a pot, removed the residue, and made a bowl of oil. I heard adults say that no matter what kind of oil it is, as long as it contains poison, it will be fine. When the tung seeds are boiled in a pot, the water vapor is boiled away and the smoke is released, which is considered to be poisonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We had vomiting and diarrhea all night. Jinsuo’s father gave us washing powder and water, and he stopped only the next day. Fortunately, I didn’t eat much that day and put in less oil. We didn&#39;t go to school for three days. We were both in the third grade of junior high school that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years later, Jinsuo went to college and I went to the mines, and our fates parted ways from then on. I don’t have his phone number, and he doesn’t have any contact channels with me. After his parents died, we knew nothing about each other. The only thing we vaguely knew was that he went to Europe after not working for a few years, married a wife, and settled down in a foreign country. Become your hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only remaining tung trees on Santiao Ridge will bloom a few branches in some years. The scattered tung flowers are hidden among the green bushes, which are more beautiful than the large stretches of tung flowers and do not look lonely at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;二&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tung fruit usually matures in mid-to-late October. The fruit changes from green to light red, and finally turns to dark brown, and it is ready for harvest. The pedicle of the tung fruit is very strong and closely connected to the branches. Unlike walnuts and chestnuts, which are easy to knock off, harvesting the tung fruits is a very slow and hard work. If the branches are not high, it is best for women and children to pick them by hand. Fast. The men climbed up the tree, beat it with bamboo poles, and beat the tree branches into hairless ghosts. There were always a few tung fruits that remained motionless, and in the end they had no choice but to leave them for the next year. Tongzi&#39;s body was heavy, and transportation was also a laborious task. A good laborer had to carry a basket, and he was hunched over and panting due to the exertion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of hammers is very wide. Almost any work related to breaking can be solved by pounding. The most effective way to produce tung rice is to thoroughly dry the tung fruits and pour them into a wormwood pit and pound them. This work is usually done by women and children. The cleaned rice is white and tender, like suet. We children were caught in the middle and busy, and when others were not prepared, we threw a pill in our mouths, and the adults picked it out, and vomited all over the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the oil squeezed from tung seeds. The process of pressing tung oil is similar to that of peanut oil. When I was a child, I had a good deed and a monkey spirit. I participated in the oil extraction work of adults many times. I don’t remember the tedious details. I only remember the transparency and purity of tung oil. There is no corresponding reference for the light yellow color, so I can’t describe it. , using one thing to describe and explain another thing, this ancient and omnipotent language method completely fails in the face of tung oil. The squeezed tung oil was put in pots and bowls, and outsiders came to buy it. Although they couldn&#39;t sell it for much, they made money from the oil, salt, sauce and vinegar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the best paint for furniture, and Master Lin is the best painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, a carpenter is also a painter, and a painter is also a carpenter. It is rare that a family hires a carpenter, and then hires a painter after finishing the furniture. A carpenter does not necessarily have to be talented, but he must be versatile. Otherwise, he would not be able to compete with hundreds of others. There is only Master Lin, who only knows how to paint. He knows nothing about the carpenter&#39;s work, but because his craftsmanship is so good, even if he has a unique skill, he still has no worries about making a living. eat. Because his craftsmanship is so good, his peers often lose their way out, making people both admire and hate them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin is not a local either. Some say he is from Henan, some say he is from Hubei, and some say he is from Sichuan. If he does not say it himself, others will just guess. People&#39;s basis is his accent, but for people who have been away for a long time, eating in all directions and enjoying the scenery in all directions, the local accent has long since disappeared, leaving behind a mixed accent. Master Lin was forty years old when he came to Xiahe. His craftsmanship was not learned in Xiahe, but brought from afar. He became a master as soon as he arrived. He himself said that it was a family tradition, and naturally everyone believed this statement. Most good craftsmanship comes from family traditions. Forty-year-old Master Lin arrived in Xiahe and married a woman at the age of forty-one, which naturally benefited from his good craftsmanship. The woman is seventeen or eighteen years younger than him, and she is still a girl. Her name is Liu Lanhua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua’s father is a mat craftsman and has been weaving reed mats all her life. When you go out to weave, you also weave at home. People who need it come to buy it or exchange it with it. Liu Xijiang&#39;s career as a mat craftsman consists of two methods, half of which is home-based work, and the other half of which is a family workshop. When Liu Xijiang got old, he didn&#39;t go out anymore. He kept a reed garden on the mountain behind his house. It was five or six acres, and it was enough for people with a radius of dozens of miles. Craftsman Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life and has saved some money. He is considered a wealthy family in the surrounding area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, people were too poor to afford coffins. When most people died, they were rolled into the earth with a reed mat. Naturally, the reed mat was made by craftsman Liu Xi. The craftsman Liu Xishan weaved from east to west mountains, weaving from day to night. Half of the mats weaved were used to dry food and half were used to roll people. Later, people&#39;s lives became more relaxed, and some people began to use coffin boards. Of course, reed mats were not absent from the burial. Later, everyone switched to coffin boards, and there was no such thing as reed mats. There are stars and moon, and at this time, someone begins to paint the coffin to make the deceased sleep more peacefully and longer underground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Carpenter Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life, and saw countless people being swept away by what he weaved with his own hands, but from the bottom of his heart, he did not approve of the way of sweeping people to their graves. He felt that it was really a waste of human life. . Similarly, he also hated the way people later painted coffins with chemical paint bought from the street. Not only was it not antiseptic, but how could the smell make people feel peaceful? In short, people are too busy in this life and have never had a good night&#39;s sleep. When they leave and enter another world, they must sleep more peacefully and more solidly. Liu Xijiang&#39;s greatest ideal is to have a tung oil coffin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin helped him realize this ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the whole village, young and old, witnessed the great and spectacular process of tung oil changing from raw oil to mature oil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin built a waist-high earthen stove in the yard of Liu Xijiang’s house. He set up a large iron pot on the stove and burned it with oak firewood.来的光净石子放在锅中炒，石子炒烫后，倒入生桐油，倒多少，肯定有讲究，林师傅只是倒，嘴里不说。接着锅里翻江倒海，随着温度越升越高，桐油里的水汽逐渐蒸发掉了。空气里有了香味，香味铺天盖地，像一个大毯子蒙住了整个院子，但那个香，是谁也没有闻过的香，浓烈放荡，说不出来是好是坏。此时，大家看到锅中的桐油泛起油花。林师傅快速加入了一铲粉状东西，一会儿，桐油面上泛起一层白色的泡沫，并冒出浓浓的黄烟。林师傅指挥一个青年用木棒奋力搅拌，泡沫迅速地与桐油密合，这时候烟色由黄转黑，浓烟直冲天上，渐渐消散。林师傅用木棍挑出一缕儿桐油，滴在石头上，用手指蘸着桐油往上拉长，拉出很长的细丝来。林师傅命人迅速浇灭锅下的火，大喊一声:成了！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;观看的人好奇又紧张，又不得要领，像做了一场梦。觉得林师傅真神，才知道原来桐油可以这么熬成好东西，以前总是把桐油生生卖掉，好可惜。若干年过去，当熬桐油不再是独门绝技，大家才知道，那粉状的东西是土子粉和樟丹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经熟桐油由外到里刷过三遍的柏木棺板，简直像一只多棱的镜子，映照出一群人怪异好奇的嘴脸，映照出天上的太阳和游荡的云彩。为证明桐油的功效，林师傅往棺里倒了一桶水，倒进去时满满一桶，舀出来一桶满满，不多不少。刘席匠说，这狗日的桐油，怕能护人身子一千年！ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;林师傅和刘兰花生了一个女儿，叫林萍儿。刘兰花一副好身段，两扇好屁股，像一团棉花，要多饱满有多饱满，生多少都不是问题，但不敢生，政策紧，根本承受不起罚款。林师傅走的那年，林萍儿十三岁，还在读初中。满打满算下来，刘兰花和林师傅做了十四年夫妻。对林师傅的走，刘兰花是真的舍不得。下葬的那天，天下着雨，刘兰花从头到脚都湿透了，有人说是雨浇的，有人说是泪浇的，其实两个都是。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;满打满算，林师傅在峡河生活了十四年，桐油匠职业生涯十四年，不算长，也不算短，但经他使用过的桐油，刷过的家具，不知道用什么才能计量清楚。他传下的手艺，他有意无意带动的行业，在他离开五年后也戛然而止，按新的经济发展要求，乡村产业转型，上面要求弃桐子改播松树。一种产业、一个行业随着世事的转腾而终于凋落、寂灭了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一年的有一天，林师傅送林萍儿上学去，学校在镇上，星期六接回来，星期天送到校。他骑一辆大杠，车头上挂着书包和干粮袋子，车后座上载着女儿。车下三条岭，桐子花正开，路里的花，路外的花，头连着尾，尾连着头，人车在花中穿行，头上的天，鼻孔里的花香，真叫人快乐啊。林师傅想，今年又是好收成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;车到二道盘，那里有一处泉眼，四季清水汩汨，又甘又甜。来往的人、雀鸟、小动物都在这里饮水、歇脚。因为潭在低处，人需要双腿跪下，伸长脖子才能饮到水。有一个传说，说泉眼里有一条鱼精，受人的跪拜时间久了，已经得道，有时晚上会出来清理水潭的脏物，让泉永远清清净净，但谁也没有见过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林师傅有些饿了，他把一只饼分两半，自己一半女儿一半，就着泉水吃起来。在吞第二口时，他感到饼在喉咙里卡住了，上不上，下不下。他掬起一捧水，灌下去，也不管用。他知道这是怎么回事，他想起母亲也是这样的情形，这样卡了几年，走了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林师傅请匠人给自己打的棺是一口泡桐木棺，泡桐木材质松软，不经腐，但好处是得来全不费工夫，一排大树就长在院子边，就地取材。刘兰花说，还早呢，让树再长几年。林师傅说，不早了，早晚都得准备。刘兰花说，也给我备一口。林师傅说，你的还早，让树再长几年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林师傅给自己熬桐油的壮观场面和十四年前在刘席匠院子第一次熬桐油的场面如出一辙，围观者众多，帮忙的也多。虽然这时候这门技术早已不是秘密。在最后退去锅底的柴火时，刘兰花有些慌张，把锅底打了个洞，熬成的桐油倾泻而下，虽然众人奋力抢救，熬成的晶亮的好东西只抢救出三分之一，漏掉的部分化作了一阵冲天大火。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林师傅的棺板刷到一半，没有桐油了，另一半，只好去街上买来一桶洋漆完成。林师傅叹口气，说，这都是命。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林师傅走了两年后，有一天，刘兰花收到一封信，寄件地址不详，寄件人不详。收信人姓名是林懿德，刘兰花不认得名字里的中间那个字，问女儿林萍儿，林萍儿这时已上了高中，没有不认识的字，说那个字读yì。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘兰花开始以为寄信人把地址和名字写错了，想退回去，丈夫的名字叫林建业，从来没有听说过这个怪怪的名字。乡邮寄员说，没有错，邮政编码都是对的，再说，谁知道往哪里退，退给谁？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘兰花就拆开信读了，说完，才知道寄信的人没有寄错地址和收信人。她读完了信，悄悄抹了一阵泪，就随手把信丟进锅洞里烧了，烧尽的信没有成灰，保持着纸的形状，从灶洞飘出来，飞出了院子，在空中飘飘荡荡。刘兰花心里说，你就落下来吧，我读过了，就是你读过了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林萍儿从房里拿着一件衣服出来，问写的啥？刘兰花说，没写啥，是有人把信寄错地方了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[东西方贵族是如何消亡的？从贵族到精英是身份政治的式微]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260200]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Lucy Challenger, a blogger who claims to be a &quot;British etiquette expert&quot;, posted a video on TikTok, Teach netizens how to eat rice with a knife and fork in formal occasions. She believes that in a Western environment, one should not eat rice with hands, spoons or chopsticks, but should push the rice to the top of the back of the fork with a table knife and then put it elegantly into the mouth, which can appear more educated and graceful. This &quot;aristocratic&quot; video triggered all kinds of ridicule and ridicule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese people also like to emphasize the concept of nobility, such as nobility in houses, cars, and clothing brands... Even a few days ago, I even saw the &quot;nobility&quot; in latex paint in building materials stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They say they are aristocrats, but in fact they are mostly consumption paranoia. The social group of aristocrats has died, or is close to death, in both Eastern and Western societies. It is also an interesting historical review journey to have a general understanding of the birth, development, decline, and demise of aristocrats in Eastern and Western societies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In ancient Eastern and Western societies, aristocrats were born almost at the same time in the early stages of civilization. The development can be roughly divided into three major historical stages: classical aristocracy, ancient aristocracy, and modern aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aristocracy began in the Western Zhou Dynasty and Spring and Autumn Period in the East, and emerged in the Republic of Ancient Rome in the West. Because they arose in the early days of agricultural society, the classical nobility in the East and West all originated from large landowners. In the Spring and Autumn Period in the East, princes were nobles, and the feudal system was an ancient system of large land ownership. Dining with bells and dishes, wine pools and meat forests are the lifestyles of nobles that distinguish them from common people. The titles of duke, marquis, uncle, son, and male divided the nobility hierarchy, including the &quot;scholar&quot; class attached to the nobility, and constituted the ruling order of ancient oriental agricultural society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, in ancient Greek society, which was slightly earlier than ancient Rome, the aristocracy was not very powerful. Due to the lack of large contiguous areas of land in the Balkans, ancient Greece developed an early democratic system that reflected the demands of the wealthy business class in the city-states for an equal distribution of power. Rome owned a large amount of land in its conquered areas, such as North Africa and Spain, so it produced a large number of landed aristocrats. They were a strong foundation supporting the Roman Empire and shared power in the Senate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of classicism, the aristocrats of the East and West not only monopolized a large amount of land and wealth, but also monopolized culture, knowledge, and art, producing and consuming amazing cultural and artistic achievements of that era: Ancient Greece and Roman sculpture and architectural art, as well as the elegance and praise in the Eastern &quot;Chu Ci&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 4th and 5th centuries AD were a watershed era in the changes of human civilization: the classical civilizations in the East and West (Eastern Han Dynasty and Western Rome) were defeated by the northern barbarians, and human civilization entered a period of darkness that lasted for hundreds of years. Era (or &quot;Middle Ages&quot;). The classical nobility died out in this era, and instead, the second round of &quot;ancient nobility&quot; (medieval nobility) emerged in both the East and the West. Moreover, in this era, both the East and the West produced military lord aristocrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, after the Germanic tribes conquered the Western Roman Empire, they divided territories and enfeoffed feudal lords, resulting in a large number of barbarian military nobles. These medieval nobles were rough, unpretentious, and simple... almost all of them They are illiterate. They only emphasize the spirit of martial arts. They compete with each other on whose arms are thicker, stronger, and have longer swords. If nothing happens, they compete on horseback. European military aristocrats regarded reading and writing as shameful and unmanly. The writing needs at the administrative level were almost entirely borne by priests and attendants. As a result, Christianity monopolized the ideology, culture and art of medieval Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East at the same time, the gentry (similar to aristocrats) in the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties were divided: the southern gentry, because of their &quot;dress and clothes&quot;, had higher cultural and artistic accomplishments, and were known as elegant and weak. The northern aristocracy has a considerable part of the Hu people&#39;s ancestry, and their cultural and artistic standards are low, but their military force value is high. This supported the &quot;Guanlong military aristocracy&quot; of the Sui and Tang dynasties. In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, the northern aristocratic army conquered the southern gentry, and China entered the second era of great unification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unification promoted economic and social development, and culture and art also flourished. Although the cultural level of the northern aristocrats was low, they were still improving. Their huge wealth was enough to support and consume great masters such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Wu Daozi, Yan Liben, and Li Guinian. The prosperity of the Tang Dynasty created the peak era of national culture and art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of culture and art seems to inevitably lead to weak, hedonistic, decadent and even decadent lifestyles, both in the East and the West. In the East, the &quot;Huang Chao Uprising&quot; at the end of the Tang Dynasty completely ended the aristocratic era in China. To put it simply, all the nobles were killed, and &quot;the bones of the public officials were trampled on in the streets.&quot; Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been no aristocrats in China. It has entered the era of common people and landlords. The emperor and his relatives are also representatives of the common people and landlords. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France is similar. From after the &quot;Hundred Years&#39; War&quot; to before the &quot;Great Revolution&quot;, the French aristocrats were prosperous, extravagant and luxurious. They lived a paradise-like life on earth for hundreds of years and created astonishing world-class culture and art. At the same time, it burned up the national wealth and led to the social and economic collapse of France. In the end, the entire modern French aristocratic group was almost ended on the guillotine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Germany and England are the Anglo-Saxon branches of the Germanic ethnic group, and their medieval martial ethics lasted relatively long. The tradition of military aristocracy of these two ethnic groups even lasted until the middle of the 20th century. Until the two world wars, machine guns, cannons, tanks, bombers... ended a large number of British and German military aristocrats on the battlefield, and the modern aristocracy in Europe finally declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Kingsman: The Secret Service&quot; vividly tells this historical process: As a large number of military nobles died on the battlefield, the vast aristocratic wealth became ownerless property, CEOs (not Boss) promoted the modern transformation of European society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, the rise of the elite class is no longer the aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobility is identity politics and hereditary. The elite emphasizes non-identity politics, ability first, self-strength, and survival of the fittest. According to our ancient saying, &quot;Excellence in learning leads to officialdom.&quot; However, it is not enough to study well. You must also be good at doing things, obey laws and regulations, and be socially responsible. The elites of modern society: Most of them come from the civilian class, such as Elon Musk. Before he became successful, he also paved the floor in his garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern elite politics does not monopolize power like aristocratic politics, but breaks class solidification and opens up channels for individual advancement and dimensionality reduction, which is of great significance for preventing social rigidity and corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Musk, the world’s richest man with hundreds of billions of dollars, has some unscrupulous sons. If we cannot effectively inherit, pioneer, and enterprising, we will fall back into mediocrity and will not be able to enjoy the hereditary privileges of the nobility. This is the modern elite system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that everyone can cheer up and make progress as much as possible, produce as many elites as possible to promote social progress, realize self-worth, and have fewer aristocratic dreams. That concept has been eliminated by history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南方周末6件作品获广东新闻奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260282]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 17:29:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 8, organized by the Guangdong Journalists Association, The selection results of the 2022 Guangdong News Award and the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>; Golden Bell Award sponsored by the Guangdong Press Society have been announced. 381 works won the 2022 Guangdong News Awards, including 49 first prizes, 122 second prizes, and 210 third prizes. 10 comrades won the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>;, and 1 comrade won the 15th Guangdong Province News Golden Bell Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Six works of Southern Weekend Newspaper won the Guangdong News Award.

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kintaro Candy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2023, the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; held its premiere in Beijing. The film is directed by Japanese director Yojiro Takita and stars Zhang Guoli and Han Geng. This is the first time that Yojiro Takita has directed a Chinese-language film, adapted from Xin You&#39;s novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;. In the story, the Liu family has been making ice crystal cakes for generations, and it was passed down to the eighth generation Liu Jiansan. His father Liu Tingshen was still unwilling to reveal the secret recipe, and the two gradually became estranged. It wasn&#39;t until his father passed away that the secret recipe and the secrets accompanying it finally surfaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was finalized as early as 2018. After several twists and turns, the finalized poster was finally released recently, and it was officially announced that it will be released nationwide on November 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first film by Yojiro Takita to encounter setbacks. The highlight of his career, &quot;The Embalmer,&quot; was released after a year&#39;s delay after filming was completed. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; is adapted from &quot;The Diary of a Coffin Bearer&quot; written by Shinmon Aoki. The author compiled his many years of experience into a book. In the world narrated by the coffin bearer, the deceased and the undertaker completed the passing of human life from generation to generation at a certain moment during the funeral ceremony. The movie starts from this and unfolds a sad and melancholy story around the protagonist who performs rituals for the deceased&#39;s body. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and swept the Japan Film Academy Awards - a total of 13 nominations and 8 wins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro recalled that the protagonist of the movie dealt with corpses every day, and the Japanese were not willing to accept it, let alone face death. The subject of the film thus became taboo. No company was willing to release it for fear of not selling well. In 2008, &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won awards at China&#39;s Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival and Canada&#39;s Montreal Film Festival. The news spread back to Japan, and the film was only released in theaters (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;September 13, 2008&lt;/span>;) became popular and topped the box office. During the Oscar awards season, although the box office had declined and dropped out of the rankings, it returned to the top of the box office once the news of the award was announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Takita Yojiro&#39;s most famous work was &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 2001, starring Nomura Mansai and Hideaki Ito; and &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 1986, starring Yuya Uchida, Yumi Aso, and Takeshi Kitano. No Funny Magazine. The former is adapted from the &quot;Onmyoji&quot; series of novels by Dream Pillow Tapir, which tells the story of Abe Seimei, an onmyoji with superb magic skills in Japan&#39;s Heian period, who used his wisdom to exorcise ghosts and gods and solve difficult problems. The latter vividly reproduced many real events that occurred in Japan in 1985, revealing the dark side of society and condemning the media for its failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the publication of the transformational work &quot;Don&#39;t Funny Magazine&quot;, Takita Yojiro was once known as a &quot;pink movie&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; refers to a large number of Famous for movies that feature nudity&lt;/span>;). On December 4, 1955, Yojiro Takita was born in Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. In 1973, after graduating from Takaoka Commercial High School, he went to Tokyo to pursue his dream. At the age of 20, he joined Lion Film Production Company as an assistant director. In 1981, he directed his debut film &quot;Crazy Female Teacher&quot;. In the next five years, he filmed 21 pink movies mainly in the &quot;Crazy Train&quot; series. Although this type of film uses female nudity and male-female sex as gimmicks, its themes are diverse, including serious dramas, light comedies, and even suspense dramas. The whimsy and fun of Takita&#39;s works earned him the nickname &quot;Pink Movie Genius&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At that time, the sun was setting in the Japanese film industry, and audiences rarely went to the movies. Some people watched pink movies, but the market demanded that filming be completed quickly at a very low cost. Many people wanted to make movies but had nowhere to go. Those who could go joined the ranks. There are too many people in the world who are determined to make movies, and I am one of them.&quot; Takita Yojiro recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he worked 15 hours a day and was bored with 35mm film all day long. When he was young, Takita Yojiro often went to the cinema with his family, and movies would be shown in the school gymnasium. He would often watch and think, &quot;Isn&#39;t this movie about me?&quot; But he didn&#39;t know what it would be like to actually make a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256532&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Embalmer&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Even such a person who is full of anxiety and uncertain future I am willing to invest alone in the world. I believe that only those who are exposed to this world and discover something about themselves after going through hardships can survive.&quot; Yojiro Takita said, &quot;There are no rules to follow in anything. At that time, living in this world , can’t see dreams, and feels that having dreams is a luxury. All he can do is work hard to complete the things in front of him.&quot; He remembered the words of a senior director he knew well - he hoped that he would be entangled in film and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Being surrounded by film, I deeply understand the meaning of film and movies. As well as editing, I understand the importance of frame by frame. In these senses, the era of pink movies is My origin. Although it was very painful at the time, there were many happy partners. We cried together, laughed together, and drank together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro once described his works as &quot;Kintaro candy&quot;. Kintaro candy is a candy that Japanese children use on the Seven-Five-Three Festival (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Similar to Children&#39;s Day, celebrating the growth of children aged 3, 5, and 7 years old&lt;/span>;) The edible candies come in a variety of patterns, and are &quot;long, sweet candies&quot; that need to be cut off bit by bit to eat. No matter where this candy is cut, the cross-section pattern is the same, only the outermost layer is different in color. He believes that although his works have various themes, when you really cut them apart, they are all the same movies. In his conversation with Takita Yojiro, the writer Zhian summarized this similar core as: about how ordinary people can prove themselves and realize their own value through an action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also during that conversation that Yojiro Takita looked back on his career and lamented that he had always carefully selected job offers and rejected many works. Now he is more concerned about &quot;Why are you looking for me? What is the reason for choosing me to be the director?&quot; If there are consistent answers to the two questions, he will happily accept it. The next piece &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot; is the result of this thinking. This is a Chinese movie, with all Chinese actors, and he wanted to do something fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As a director, I need to run around and be busy, but at the same time, I am also observing myself objectively. For example, sitting here for an interview, there is actually someone I am standing on high, looking down at. I am thinking about myself. In my head, on the one hand, there is this objective consciousness of always reflecting on myself, and on the other hand, I am rushing forward like a wild boar, running straight towards the goal.&quot; said Yojiro Takita. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for filming, his wife did not say to him, &quot;Come back after making a good movie.&quot; Instead, she told him: &quot;Don&#39;t get angry in front of everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Movie Good or bad, people don&#39;t care.&quot; Takita Yojiro said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2019, we had the opportunity to watch an early version of the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; and interviewed Yojiro Takita. In the interview, he talked about his motivation for making Chinese movies and his understanding of the film. Views on traditional disorder, the film’s response to changes in the times and people’s hearts, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256533&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Onmyoji&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is a dialogue with Yojiro Takita:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A story about reconciliation and rebirth&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Just listened to the staff After reading the novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;, you felt that the story was actually a bit Japanese. What parts of it touched you and made you decide to film it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The family structure of China and Japan is very similar. The father is the backbone of the entire family, so daily life, father-son relationship, Cultural inheritance will also have many similarities. The original setting is a story that happened in a small town in China. This story can be copied to the Japanese countryside. This made me feel very familiar, and it was one of the motivations for me to try to make this film. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal favorite is that the father has been keeping secrets and sticking to himself, and his intentions were only felt by his son after he passed away. This misunderstanding, sadness, and ultimate mutual recognition is what captures my heart the most. In other words, this is a story about reconciliation and rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Like the novel, you still use the son&#39;s perspective to construct the story Why did you choose this perspective on the relationship between father and son? And why make such a movie in modern times? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was still thinking about this issue until yesterday. In fact, as we grow older, people’s way of thinking will become more and more fixed. and limitations, the scope of action may become narrower and narrower. The world of young people is more interesting, they have many expectations for life, there are incompleteness and immaturity, and the collision of various elements will lead to the development of the story. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this also depends on the background of the times and career settings. Japan has many old shops that have been inherited from generation to generation, and there are also many stories about craftsmen. The world of traditional crafts is a world where seniors and juniors fight, because values ​​​​are different from the times, and it is inevitable for juniors to want to surpass their seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wonder if it is the same in China. Therefore, this story is set before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The economy is growing rapidly, people&#39;s economic activities are becoming more and more important to the world, and in order to successfully integrate into the modern world, the traditional world is gradually losing order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of these? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think this is not a good thing from the perspective of changes in values ​​and the changes that follow. Everything is digital now and you want fast results. People always think that when they do something, the result is there and they can get there quickly. But traditional craftsman-style things are just the opposite. Through accumulation, various techniques are passed on, and ways of thinking and feelings are refined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, this 6cm×6cm camera (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;points at the photojournalist’s medium format film camera&lt;/span >;), it has existed a long time ago, 40 years ago, it is very rare, and it is still in use. There must be something in it that you want to stick to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan held the Olympic Games in 1964, which was very similar to China. It developed rapidly after that. It’s just that the speed of development was “additive” at that time, but now it feels like “multiplicative”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You graduated from high school a few years after the Japan Olympics. There are reports that you were faced with two directions at that time, whether to find a job directly or continue studying. So did you feel confused in the accelerating social environment? What was your state at that time, and why did you go to Tokyo? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because I didn’t pass the college entrance examination, it doesn’t matter if I tell you. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;laugh&lt;/span>;) I was very confused, and for the first time I realized, what have I been doing for so many years? I&#39;m very lonely. Like Jian San (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Jian San, the male protagonist of &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;&lt;/span>;), I also grew up in a small place, so I just wanted to stop staying there and go to Tokyo. I thought I would find something in the city. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I went there, the level of prosperity and the number of people were completely different, and there were no parents nagging you behind your back. It felt like heaven. So when I first started working as a director, I shot all the cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as I got married and had children, the entire film industry environment changed, and the depth and breadth of my interactions changed, I began to realize that my hometown before I was 18 years old was something I couldn’t forget, including &quot;The Embalmer&quot; also has the feeling of returning to a small town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are those unforgettable things? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The terraced fields, the smell of the river, the light miso soup, udon noodles, the smell of my parents’ house, my mother’s smell.

It was only after I entered this industry that I found it interesting. Everyone has always believed that the world of entertainment and movies, including singing, is the domain of a few or special people. About half a year to a year later, I discovered that this was not the case. Whether it was lighting or photography, they were actually just people who were passionate about something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, can I also make this thing? I worked very hard and studied a lot about movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember what happened on the first day you entered the set? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I just looked at it blankly, didn’t understand anything, and kept getting scolded.

The fellow pointed forward with his hand. Yang Ping asked again: &quot;Are there any paintings on the walls in the temple?&quot; Yang Ping&#39;s Shanxi dialect is a bit different from that of his fellow villagers, but it does not hinder their communication.要跑遍山西的角角落落，没有这样的语言优势，杨平还真拍不到那些庙里的“画画”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提起山西壁画，人们总会想起岩山寺、永乐宫这样精美的宋元壁画，但很多人不知道，隐藏在山水之间的山西村落，保存着大量的村庙壁画。比起宋元壁画“享受”到的保护、研究和世人的赞叹，村庙里的壁画显得有些落寞。它们一般都是清代的遗存，“这些清代壁画，不用说&#39;国保&#39;了，连&#39;村保&#39;都不是。”杨平说。它们安静地扮演着村庄神祇塑像的背景，也是村民们生活里的一抹情趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;山西省朔州市朔城区南曹村某村庙东壁壁画局部。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨平已经拍了十多年山西壁画了。和很多爱好者入门拍壁画一样，杨平一开始也拍宋元壁画，拍得多了，她发现山西还有更多的壁画隐藏在人迹罕至的山野小庙里，“很多人拍到&#39;省保&#39;就为止了，但我不一样，我要到村里去转。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨平早年是旅行杂志的主编，杂志停刊后，她把精力完全放在山西的壁画和彩塑上。这些年来，她拍了山西四百多处壁画，其中明清的占了三百多处，“我知道但还没有拍的大约还有二三十处”。 《高堂粉墙烛下见——中国山西乡村古壁画探幽》是她2023年出版的新书，里面收录的21处精美的村庙壁画，大多是清代晚期的，其中很多都是她首次发现的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打开这本小书，一种与宋元壁画的高古、宏大完全不同的艺术气质扑面而来，秾丽的色彩、富有生活气息的神祇形象、小巧紧凑的构图，无不昭示着这是来自民间草根的审美情趣。杨平给这21处壁画写了21个小故事，大多是她与村民的聊天，家长里短，乡野旧闻，写来轻松有趣，但是在采访中，杨平说得更多的却是拍摄背后的甘苦，以及她对乡村壁画的种种忧思。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每个时代遗留下来的文化，都反映了那个时代。乡村壁画不仅仅是艺术的呈现，里面还有很多历史信息。这本书的言外之意，其实在壁画之外。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“带回来的片子，几乎全部作废”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;杨平的老家是山西晋城，晋城以古建筑闻名。 2003年，杨平自己掏出36万元，开始拍摄晋城的古建筑。建筑拍得多了，她渐渐地对建筑内部的壁画产生了兴趣。别看她现在成天往村子里跑，瞧着灰头土脸，但她说其实自己最爱打扮，以前做时尚旅行杂志，喜欢漂亮衣服，最初爱上壁画，也是因为壁画的美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2012年，杨平得到了一个机会，可以拍摄山西各地的壁画和彩塑。当时她只知道那些在文物名录上的壁画，至于山西到底有多少壁画，她并不清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一开始没有拍壁画的经验，杨平向山西撒了一张大网：山西十一个地级行政区，每个行政区派一支摄影队，每队至少三人，由一位知名摄影家领衔，加一个灯光、一个司机，打算对全山西的壁画、彩塑进行地毯式拍摄。这是一项庞大的工程，花费不菲，但效果却令人大失所望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“带回来的片子，几乎全部作废。”杨平想起当时自己的“莽撞”，不自觉露出苦笑。当年杨平请来的摄影师都是行业里的“大腕”，“他们对怎样拍得好看有自己的认知。你说拍成这样，他认为那样的才好看。而且很多他们觉得不好看的就不拍。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是忠实地记录与“拍得好看”是两回事。要忠实地记录一铺壁画的全貌和其中的每个细节，每张照片的像素就要足够大，这就需要对一铺壁画进行分区拍摄。然而印制到书本上的壁画至少需要有一幅是完整的，这就又要保证每部分拍回来的照片都是可拼合的，也就意味着拍摄同一铺壁画的不同部分，其拍摄角度、像素、光线、曝光度，都要做到尽量一致。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;诸龙寺大殿东壁壁画全图。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拍下的局部图如果要合成一张整图，上百张照片拼合，合成的时间就要半个月，整幅图的大小动辄几十个G。 “他们从来没有这么拍过。”杨平说。摄影师们各自为政，拍回来的照片风格各异，美则美矣，就是“合不了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有些三四米高的壁画，如果梯子不够高，摄影角度的变化就会造成画面的畸变，也是“合不了”。 “一看这个图片不行，回来培训，又去拍，还不行，就买很多书给大家看……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次不成功的地毯式拍摄让杨平赔了很多钱，十一支摄影队的仪器、差旅、人工，全打了水漂。到后来，她意识到，不是摄影队越多就效率越高，掌握拍摄的准则才是最关键的。她把摄影队缩小到了两支，其中一支就由她自己来拍。面对一铺壁画，要形成比较标准的拍摄流程：大小的梯子必须要有，对墙壁进行分区的红外线仪也要有，镜头是标准的蔡司50，还要有一个手持的小相机，“很多塑像离壁画很近，手要伸进去拍”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拍村里的壁画，除了这些一般的设备之外，铁锹和鸡毛掸子也是必备的，后者用来拂去壁画上的灰尘，前者则是修路的工具，“通往村里的是土路，用得上”。有一次到吕梁的一个村子，路况糟糕，摄影师用铁锹铲了一个多小时，才铲出一条“路”来。最后三百米，实在是没办法，只能大小器材都扛着走进村。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“三十年前题记还在”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;走进杨平的工作室，首先看见的就是一整排山西寺观壁画的图册。 《岩山寺》《开化寺》《公主寺》……这些在壁画史上赫赫有名的寺观，杨平都相应做了极为精细的图册。这些图册是她十几年来拍摄壁画的成果之一。在她之前，当然也有人拍过它们，也出过很多图册，但她想要做的是把每个细节都拍清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像这本《岩山寺》就拍了三年，2013、2014、2015年，陆陆续续拍，每次都要补拍，出版的时候发现某块不够清晰，就重新拍。”杨平说。岩山寺的金代壁画被誉为壁上的《清明上河图》，人物繁多，细节丰富，浓郁的生活气息就隐藏在画面细节之中。杨平的要求是画面上每个人物的身份、每个佛道故事的典故，乃至对首饰名物的辨认，不仅要有清晰的图像，还要附有学术文字的解释。所以她做的图册比前人要厚很多，八开本的一大本《岩山寺》厚达三百多页。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到2013年冬天，像岩山寺、开化寺这样的“国保”“省保”，差不多都被她拍完了，杨平开始系统地拍摄村庙里的壁画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一开始，对于村庙壁画，杨平只是路过的时候顺手拍，但拍得多了，她慢慢意识到，村里的明清壁画，比起宋元壁画，自有它的价值，完全值得再去搜罗一遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;山西古村落里，民间信仰的庙宇有着很多常见的神祇，关帝庙、娘娘庙（三霄娘娘）、龙王庙、马王庙、东岳庙，它们可能会单独出现，也可能会“组团”出现——即在一个庙中分布于不同的配殿里。龙王保佑风调雨顺、娘娘保佑生育平安、关帝则保佑教育子女忠孝节义。 “生娃、教育、农业，都是老百姓的真实需求。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;山西某村庙北壁龙王母右侧的女官、两位四值使者和风婆（从右至左）。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一次，一尊庙里的东岳神挡住了去路。那个庙的主殿两壁都是精美的彩塑，殿中央却立着一尊不知道年代的彩塑，藏身在一个小小的木阁里，据说是后世的村民们给加上去的。杨平要拍两旁的彩塑，镜头却总是被这尊东岳神彩塑给遮挡，摄影师们去拍了五次，拍回来总是不好看。无奈之下，第六次拍摄时她和村里人商量：“能不能先把这尊神请到殿外？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;旧时，这尊东岳神每年都要抬出来游街，近些年，这个仪式已经渐渐消逝，但村里老人还是担心，像这样不合常规地抬出来，会造成不祥。 “他们担心会引起暴雨。”杨平说。几十年没动过的木胎泥塑，移动稍有不慎，表面很可能就会碎裂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好不容易说服了村民，具体要怎么搬，杨平自己心里也没有底。几个人正围着神像急得团团转的时候，村里的一位老人站了出来，只见他拿着一根粗麻绳，用一种从来没见过的打结方式，快速将神像捆得四平八稳，四个人一抬，上下不会倾斜，左右也不会侧翻。 “要是没有这位老人的帮忙，我们真拍不到这样好看的照片。”杨平指着图册上的这页彩塑说。拍完后，东岳神被重新安放了回去，当然，村里也没有下起暴雨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时间在流逝，壁画和彩塑也随着时间在改变。很多壁画和杨平最初看到它们的时候已经完全不一样了。 “我知道的一堂宋代壁画，三十年前题记还在，现在某些题记已经模糊了。”而一些无人关注的清代壁画，已经再也看不到了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》里提到的罗圈堡村是其中幸运的一个。当时，当地文物局听从了杨平的建议，把村庙修缮一新，壁画也重新做了拼合。 2021年杨平回访的时候，罗圈堡的壁画都还完好。但是像罗圈堡这样的例子实在太少了。作为文物大省，山西要用到钱的文物非常多，村庙里的壁画，似乎还排不上号。 “山西文物部门经常开玩笑说，让他们开两家银行，可能也不够。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;到底要不要将村庙壁画出版，公之于众，杨平曾经犹豫过很久。 2016年，他们在太原附近的一个村子拍摄，摄影师被当地村民给撵走了。杨平非常理解老百姓的“警惕”：“文物贩子实在是太多了。”村庙里的壁画，一般连文保点都不是，官方的保护体系鞭长莫及，它们虽躲在深山，却躲不过文物贩子的“勤奋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某种意义上来说，杨平就是在和文物贩子赛跑，“你完全想象不到他们有多&#39;勤奋&#39;，十年前我去的山沟里，文物贩子都走过。”杨平的朋友圈本来是完全开放的，自己看到了什么、拍到了什么，都会发在朋友圈，但不会发具体地址。有一次，一位朋友从外省追了过来，和她打听，“杨老师，你朋友圈里的东西，能不能给我一个地址？”杨平随即警惕了起来，对那位朋友说：“我手里的东西，你一个石头也不能拿走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是在这本《高堂粉墙烛下见》里，很多村庙却写了详细的地址。杨平说，这也是她思考了很久之后的无奈之举。一方面，把它们隐藏得再好，可能也逃不过文物贩子的搜索，而且就算文物贩子没有找到，书中多数村庙都已经半坍塌了，这样隐藏下去，等待它们的命运也是逐渐湮灭。 “不如公开它们的状况，引起全社会的重视，唤起村民的保护意识。”杨平明确知道一个英国的银行家家里，收藏有一铺清代的壁画，“我们的研究者目前也大多关心更高古的宋元壁画，清代壁画无人关心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋晓丽是杨平这本书的读者，2023年9月，她沿着书中的路线，走访了书中的几个村庄。她发现，很多村民的保护意识，确实比杨平拍摄时提高了不少。比如在瓦窑头村的龙王庙，“村民们有了保护意识，他们用厚厚的塑料布遮挡着壁画，我们拍摄完毕后又原样子给挡上，这是令人欣慰的发现。”宋晓丽告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，也有不幸的例子。书中提到的北曹村壁画，有非常生动的“龙王行雨图”。 “北曹村的龙王庙修缮一新，庙前立了文保碑，但是龙王殿里东西壁的龙王行雨图丢失了，文保部门将两幅喷绘的展示图分别悬挂于东西两壁。”宋晓丽说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/22JV6GWSbSGTjjeMLrZqJnhVpgHOVHa8EFrUySFO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/22JV6GWSbSGTjjeMLrZqJnhVpgHOVHa8EFrUySFO.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》卖得很好，有一点出乎杨平的意料。相对于她的整个出版计划来说，这本小书只展现了她工作的小小侧面。 “你做了这么多事情，没有人知道你在干什么，它老不冒火花，不冒泡。突然在这本书上红了。”书里的彩图，对于那些已经湮灭的壁画来说，是珍贵的记录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨平最花心力的一套大书，是即将出版的《山西寺观艺术全集》，“全集”包括《山西寺观彩塑全集》（十卷）和《山西寺观壁画全集》（二十卷），共三十卷。她多年来拍摄的所有彩塑和壁画，都会收录进去，这是真正第一种尽可能完整地收录山西壁画彩塑艺术的出版物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《全集》的受众是专业的研究者，《高堂粉墙烛下见》的受众则是普通读者，杨平希望这本小书可以成为一个支点，撬动一点公众的认知。 “其实我有一个发心，文化不仅要吸引文化人，还要吸引更多的普通人，文化应该要滋养人的。我们现在的文化只滋养了一小批人，这是不够的。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

(hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suzhou Iron and Steel Group&quot;), Suzhou Environmental Science Institute, Suzhou Suzhou Environmental Technology Co., Ltd., Suzhou National The High-tech Industrial Development Zone Management Committee and the Suzhou Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau went to court and recently received a written case acceptance notice from the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The second is Lujiazui’s claim amount is as high as 10 billion yuan. According to industry estimates, the litigation costs of this lawsuit may be as high as 50 million yuan;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Third, 14 cases of seriously contaminated land have attracted market attention . The land purchased in Lujiazui was purchased in 2016, but the contaminated land was not discovered until 2022. By this time, a large number of businesses had been built. Did the pollutants affect the construction workers? Why has no problem of excessive pollution been found during construction site operations for 6 years? Have you tried other options before filing a lawsuit? Wait for questions to follow&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;On the afternoon of November 8, the Securities Affairs Department of Lujiazui Company responded to Nandu Bay Financial News: &quot;We have disclosed all matters related to soil pollution disputes in the announcement. , are not accepting interviews at the moment. Regarding the status of the projects such as the Reading School that have been delivered, from the perspective of disclosure, we do not need to disclose it. We will make an announcement if there is any progress in the follow-up matter.&quot; Nanduwan Financial Society also called the above five defendants, but As of press time, the call had not been connected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many industry insiders told reporters from Wancaishe that complex interests are involved behind the &quot;poisonous land&quot;, and the relevant departments of the Shanghai and Jiangsu governments should handle related issues rationally and prevent produce sequelae. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;After spending 8.5 billion in 222 rounds of bidding, &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Lujiazui bought 14 “poisonous sites”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The incident originated from Lujiazui’s strategic decision to “go global” 7 years ago. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2016, Lujiazui’s designated holding subsidiaries Jiawan Company and Jiaer Company (through a trust plan) formed a consortium and jointly bid for the listing of Suzhou Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd. on the Shanghai United Equity Exchange. 95% of the equity of Green&#39;an Company was transferred. The main assets under the name of Green&#39;an Company are 17 land use rights located north of Sutong Road and east of Sugang Road in Suzhou High-tech Zone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/6470f097007bb2896cb1498aab01a0d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;574&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/6470f097007bb2896cb1498aab01a0d2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257622 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The development history of Suzhou Iron and Steel Group.

After 222 rounds of bidding, it attracted Greenland, Poly , Shimao, Vanke, China Merchants and many other real estate companies participated in the bidding. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui finally won 95% of the equity of Suzhou Green Bank Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. for a total price of 8.525 billion yuan (transaction price of 6.84 billion yuan, debt of 1.685 billion yuan). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui, which has defeated many powerful real estate companies, is also quite confident about the success of this auction. At that time, the group publicly stated that the successful joint bid for 95% of the shares of Suzhou Green Bank would be conducive to further increasing the company&#39;s land reserves and expanding the company&#39;s development space. &quot;By actively implementing the &#39;going global&#39; strategy, we will further enhance the brand influence of Lujiazui commercial real estate and enhance The company&#39;s sustainable operating ability and profitability.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, Lujiazui&#39;s bold &quot;going out&quot; investment decision was not so smooth sailing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2021, news spread that Suzhou Green Bank accidentally discovered that some plots of the project had serious pollution risks, and a report was made to the local government departments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In April 2022, the &quot;Processing Status of the Sixth Batch of Letters and Calls Transferred to Our Province by the Second Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team&quot; announced on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial People&#39;s Government mentioned Recently, the test results of a third-party testing agency showed that benzopyrene and naphthalene in the soil of many plots of the Suzhou Green Bank project seriously exceeded the standards and did not meet the land use standards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It also mentioned that the Suzhou High-tech Zone Management Committee attached great importance to it, established a special work team, and quickly started work, requiring Suzhou Green Bank to effectively perform its main responsibilities. Before the end of June, a third-party agency will be entrusted to complete the formulation of a soil pollution investigation plan, and the organization and implementation will be organized and implemented. Related work will be carried out in accordance with the law based on the investigation results. During this period, the above-mentioned plots shall not carry out any activities unrelated to the prevention and control of soil pollution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same month, Lujiazui also issued an announcement stating that 8 of the 17 plots of land have been developed. It was unexpectedly discovered that plots 2 and 13 where educational facilities have been built and plots 3 and 4 that have not been developed yet have serious pollution risks. Many elements in the soil or groundwater greatly exceed the standards and do not meet the original requirements of these plots. According to the planned land use standards, the total area of ​​the four plots is approximately 118,000 square meters. As of the end of 2021, the cumulative project investment in the four plots is approximately 450 million yuan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Due to the exposure of land pollution problems, the Lujiazui project had to be stopped. &lt;span>;Public information shows that the above-mentioned land No. 2 and land No. 13, where the pollution was determined, are planned to build Suzhou Reading School and a kindergarten respectively. &lt;/span>;When they were named by the Central Second Ecological Environmental Protection Inspection Group in 2022, the two plots of land had been completed. According to media reports, due to pollution problems, Suzhou Reading School failed to welcome its first batch of new students in September 2021 as scheduled, and the students of the school are transitioning to Suzhou Science and Technology City Foreign Language School. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257627 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Aerial view of Suzhou Reading School.

The infringements together resulted in the plaintiff receiving the land involved in the case that was seriously polluted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui requested that the defendant be ordered to pay compensation of RMB 10.044 billion to the plaintiff (if it is subsequently discovered or clear that the actual amount is higher than this amount, the lawsuit will be increased or a separate lawsuit will be filed) Responsibility; request a ruling to order defendants 2, 3, 4 and 5 to bear joint and several liability for the claim in item 1; request a ruling to order that the litigation costs of this case shall be jointly borne by all defendants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This lawsuit with a claim amount of up to 10 billion yuan quickly aroused heated discussion in the market. According to estimates by industry insiders, based on a fee of 0.5%, the litigation costs in Lujiazui may exceed 50 million. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;677&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257630 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;As for the reason why Lujiazui sued for large compensation, Wang Yuchen, director of Beijing Jinliu Law Firm, told reporters that the main reason is that it may face pollution problems on the land where the construction project is located. Huge legal risks and legal liabilities, and the Suzhou Iron and Steel Group, appraisal institutions, etc. in this incident will also have corresponding legal risks and legal liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It further stated that as far as Lujiazui Group is concerned, according to the current information, it has a large scale of construction, many types of projects, and a huge amount of capital investment in the land involved in the case. , and related projects were found to have serious pollution in the land during construction, completion, sales and other aspects. Construction suspension, completion acceptance failure, sales suspension, rectification and repair, re-appraisal, etc. are all problems that Lujiazui Group is currently facing or will need to face in the future. Behind this, only in terms of civil liability, there is the risk of breach of contract in various contracts such as construction contracts signed with construction units and house purchase contracts signed with owners. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;A claim of 10 billion yuan, what is the probability of winning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wang Yuchen told reporters that if Suzhou Iron and Steel Group knew about the land contamination of the relevant land parcels at the time of the transfer and had the obligation to know but failed to perform it, it would Intentional concealment, etc. may not only affect the validity of the previous contract, but also face corresponding liability for breach of contract. For the losses that Lujiazui Group needs to bear, Lujiazui Group also has the right to recover from Suzhou Iron and Steel Group; in addition, if the appraisal agency investigates the case There are cases of fraudulent identification involving soil pollution, and they also face legal risks and liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, it will involve civil compensation risks, and may bear joint liability with Suzhou Steel and other entities; &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;Second, it will face administrative The risk of punishment is that you may face administrative penalties such as warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal income, and revocation of corresponding qualifications;&lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;Third, if the circumstances are serious, the relevant responsible personnel may also be guilty of providing false certification documents, etc. Criminal offenses, criminal liability. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Zhengfeng, a lawyer at Guangdong Huashang Law Firm, also told reporters that if the investigation proves that the soil pollution involved in the case was falsified, Lujiazui may win the case. But the case may eventually be mediated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, in addition to the current lawsuit, this case will also require corresponding solutions in the future. Issues such as how to deal with developed land are more worthy of attention. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui behind the “poisonous land” case:&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Revenue and net profit dropped&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition to paying attention to the case itself, the incident also caused netizens to worry about Lujiazui’s business conditions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of November 8, Lujiazui’s market value was 44.76 billion yuan. Perhaps due to the huge impact of the case, the company’s stock price fell 0.75% that day to 9.30 yuan per share. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“You can’t recover the cost even if you win the lawsuit” “The claim amount of 10 billion is equivalent to 22% of the market value” “Is there no money for development?” Some investors responded to the incident They have a negative attitude, believing that Lujiazui is also facing operating difficulties during the real estate downturn cycle; but some netizens also have a positive attitude, &quot;Lujiazui&#39;s attitude is not bad. Investors are more assured when such things happen, and proactive disclosure of information makes investors feel more at ease.&quot; &quot;Lujiazui still has a conscience. No more false reports were issued to defraud property owners into purchasing their homes.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Regarding whether the case will have an impact on the company’s operations, Lujiazui mentioned in an announcement on November 4 that the case is still in the filing and acceptance stage, and it is temporarily unable to judge whether it will affect the company’s operations. The impact on the company’s profits for the current period or subsequent periods. According to relevant media reports, Lujiazui Chairman Xu Erjin said at the performance briefing on November 6 that the company’s special working group is going all out to carry out disposal and rights protection work, and promote relevant responsible parties to assume subsequent disposal responsibilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xu Erjin also emphasized at the performance meeting that in the future, the company will pay close attention to the market situation in the Yangtze River Delta, choose opportunities to participate, continue to actively support the integrated development and construction of the Yangtze River Delta, and continue to strengthen Optimize the company&#39;s main business. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the company still has confidence in investment, it is undeniable that from the data point of view, Lujiazui has experienced a continuous double decline in operating income and net profit. According to the financial report, in 2022, Lujiazui achieved revenue of 11.762 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 15.21%; net profit was 1.085 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 74.84%; revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 was approximately 5.775 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 14.48%; attributable to listing The company&#39;s shareholders&#39; net profit was approximately 837 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 27.75%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The decline in Lujiazui’s performance is not unrelated to the fact that the current real estate market is still at a trough. In the first three quarters of this year, the national real estate development investment was 8,726.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 9.1%; the commercial housing sales area was 848.06 million square meters, a year-on-year decrease of 7.5%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Land pollution has devalued, the real estate market has declined, and forced development is unprofitable.” Some people in the industry believe that the main reason for this case to surface is due to multiple factors Impact. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The emergence of this case also triggered a new round of discussion on land development in the real estate industry. &quot;In the past 20 years of working in the industry, I have never seen a lawsuit like the tens of billions of land withdrawals due to soil pollution.&quot; Zhang Hongwei, founder of Jingjian Consulting, said that the lawsuit has involved the two governments, so it is not easy to handle. However, the &quot;poisonous land&quot; has been delayed for seven years. It is hoped that through the coordination of relevant departments in Shanghai and Jiangsu, this problem can be fundamentally solved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yan Yuejin, research director of Yiju Research Institute, speculated that the case may also involve fraud and corruption, which obviously requires strict investigation. &quot;This incident also shows that in some years of radical real estate development, some land transfers did not follow the regulations and were transferred illegally, which caused many problems and infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of the people.&quot; He further pointed out that the industry needs to monitor industrial land Pay more attention to safety issues, and companies should be cautious about some sites with a history of industrial land development to prevent sequelae. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 9, Lujiazui’s intraday price was 8.94 yuan per share, down 3.32%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作家做的事丨昼夜有时]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260204]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/OPZQPfGmKpkzdhhdwOeMj0xHzukNVQQo1yrwdngS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1303&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/OPZQPfGmKpkzdhhdwOeMj0xHzukNVQQ o1yrwdngS. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257539&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mother&#39;s magic shoes. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier, I was talking about that before she got sick, she wore the Leviathan sold by Azhen Pei magic shoes. In fact, she was already feeling uncomfortable at that time. She was lethargic, had diarrhea and had a fever. Maybe cancer cells were growing wildly in her body, but no one knew it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said they were a pair of magical shoes. A pair sells for MYR 2,200. Azhen allowed her to take the shoes home first and try them on for a while before paying. She was satisfied, and perhaps felt she had taken advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So she wore them out, to breakfast in town, to the store, and to her son&#39;s wedding in Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I almost fell!&quot; she once said to me. I don’t know whether it was because she was too weak at the time, or whether the shoes made her feet uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I never cared about those shoes. It was a place where people would believe in porcupine dates, talisman water and head-dropping magic. A pair of shoes is no big deal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But those are no ordinary shoes. Azhen said that they were energy health shoes with super magnets. The soles of the shoes contained carefully blended Chinese medicine, which could open the second heart of the human body and stimulate the body&#39;s self-healing energy ring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Health comes from wearing it&quot;, it says on the paper bag of the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time I saw those shoes, she was already a skinny, spiteful patient. She began to resent the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paradoxically, her friend Xiuli also suffers from cancer. But Xiuli didn&#39;t wear magic shoes. She ate the collagen powder sold by Azhen. They both eat it every day. That thing is quite troublesome, you have to eat it as soon as you get up, and the sooner you eat it, the better. Once, when we were traveling to Xi&#39;an, she got up before dawn to boil water and make collagen powder. After drinking it, she went back to bed to sleep. The buzzing sound from the hotel kettle made my second sister and I upset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She didn’t want to see the pair of shoes, so she asked my sister and I to go to Azhen’s barber shop to return the shoes. She went to get a haircut that day, but she didn&#39;t go to Azhen&#39;s barber shop, nor to Alian&#39;s barber shop downstairs. She held an umbrella alone and walked to the barber shop upstairs in the back shop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My sister and I bravely walked into Azhen’s barber shop. Azhen was perming a woman&#39;s hair while talking to us. She showed us her and her daughter&#39;s shoes. They all wore black leather shoes that were exactly the same as their mother’s pair of Allipex magic shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Look, my daughter and I wear them. I stand and work all day long, and my feet are not sore at all!&quot; Azhen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course the shoes cannot be returned. &quot;Who would buy it after they&#39;ve already been worn?&quot; Azhen rejected us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, Xia Mu came to Ula Port, and his mother showed him the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I tell you how these shoes are deceiving, you write it down and publish it in your newspaper.&quot; She said to Xia Mu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Natsuki and I looked at each other, then took a look at the dull, ugly shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is what she thinks writers and journalists should do. She can’t seem to tell the difference between a reporter and a writer. In her opinion, they are all scholars and writers, and they should use their pens to speak out for others and plead for the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I tell you, you write it down.&quot; That&#39;s what she said when she told me about her experience of nearly losing her life giving birth to her son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She herself is such a person, keen on upholding justice and speaking for others, which is completely opposite to her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a period of time, in addition to working in the tailor shop, she was also busy applying for relief funds for the poor people passing through Hong Kong. She took a stack of application forms from the city council and distributed them to those who were struggling. When she met people who didn&#39;t know Malay, she asked her Malay friends to help fill out the forms because she didn&#39;t know much Malay herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also called the newspaper office and applied for the newspaper office’s relief fund for her friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she told me this, I was amazed at her ability and passion. I remembered something she said a long time ago. She said a fortune teller had predicted that if she continued to go to school, she would become a big shot like Li Jinshi. Li Jinshi was our former Minister of Health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is very proud. She walked around Port Ula like a country squire, like a big shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon her glory disappeared. She resented the magic shoes, resented her sister, and resented the person who deceived her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The night before the first chemotherapy session, in a hotel near the hospital, in the early hours of the morning, after vomiting out all her dinner, she told me a story about a woman. The woman received relief funds through her help, but she discovered that she was not poor. She and her husband ran a seafood business in a town not far from the port of Ula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I still have their business cards.&quot; She said. She decided to call the newspaper to expose the woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a month, she herself became a person waiting for relief. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father said that she could apply for relief and that she should receive relief. So the city council came. The man was also my mother’s friend, and he had been handling the application forms submitted on my mother’s behalf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Azmin looked at his mother with deep understanding and compassion. He made an immediate decision and suggested that I take a photo of my mother. The mother had to lie in bed so that her illness could be fully revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did not take pictures of my mother. Xia Mu also did not write a report for her to expose the scam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was much later, five years after her death, that I thought I should search the Internet for introductions or news about magic shoes. I soon saw the report in Southern Metropolis Daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was a report in 2016. She wasn&#39;t sick yet. I was still teaching in school at that time. Two years later, I was no longer a teacher and she was a dying patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she showed us those shoes, why didn’t we think of searching online? Isn’t this the instinct and ability of us scholars? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe I don’t care how much she spent on a pair of shoes. Maybe I was already used to the fact that she was being fooled. It was a place where people believed in porcupine dates, talisman water and head-dropping magic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I respect other people’s beliefs and lives, I always say this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have left Ula Port for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We don&#39;t need relief.&quot; We kids all thought so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did not take pictures of my mother. Besides, my mother was unwilling to lie on the bed and let someone take a photo of her shame and despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After her death, one Sunday afternoon, the second sister returned the pair of magic shoes to Azhen. She used the silk money she received from the funeral to pay Ah Zhen 2,200 ringgit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After she died, I found a newspaper clipping in her drawer. That was the news about the &quot;Love in the World&quot; child sponsorship program in Sin Chew Daily on November 29, 2014. There are portraits of five sixth-grade students on the newspaper clipping. The title of the report is &quot;Repaying Sponsors with Good Results, Sin Chew Sponsored Students Achieve Excellent UPSR Results&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought they were all children passing through Hong Kong, children she had helped. no. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I know why she keeps that clipping. She loved stories like this, stories about struggle, hardship and reward, and gratitude. In the past, her children also received support from society with their excellent academic performance. She was proud of it, and she did not blush at all because of the deep aura of humility hidden in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That pair of magic shoes may be on a woman&#39;s feet right now. We no longer talk about those past events. But I never forgot them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, I didn’t do what a daughter could (should?) do, so now I do what a writer should do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财政部通报460亿隐性债务案例，点名西安成都等地国企垫资]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260144]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 6, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Typical Cases of Local Government Hidden Debt Accountability&quot;, It notified 8 typical cases of hidden debt accountability investigated and dealt with since 2022, involving nearly 46 billion yuan in new hidden debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;2254&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257304&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The targets of this notification involve some local governments, bank branches and state-owned enterprises, including: some areas in Hubei Province require provincial state-owned enterprises to advance capital for construction of new hidden debts, Liuzhou City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region requires state-owned enterprises Projects with advanced financing for construction should be arranged by the fiscal budget.
