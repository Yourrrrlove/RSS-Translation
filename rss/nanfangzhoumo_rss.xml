At present, the global per capita consumption of eggs is about 150 eggs per year, with more than 210 eggs in Europe and 300 eggs in China. In ancient times, eggs were not only food, but also a medicine for treating diseases. Since the 1960s, eggs have had a bad reputation for being unhealthy. For a time, many people were wondering whether they should eat eggs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A warning from a cardiologist&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Eggs’ “bad” reputation comes from cholesterol. As early as the early 20th century, scientists discovered through animal experiments that increasing the cholesterol in feed could increase the serum cholesterol levels of animals and promote the development of atherosclerosis in animals. Given that cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in the United States, on June 16, 1948, U.S. President Harry Truman signed the National Heart Act and allocated $500,000 to launch a 20-year study on the epidemiology of heart disease. study, the Framingham Heart Study. In 1957, the Framingham Heart Research Team published a blockbuster study that concluded that elevated serum cholesterol levels were closely related to the risk of cardiovascular disease. In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists successively observed a certain correlation between dietary cholesterol intake, serum cholesterol concentration, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, since one egg (about 50 grams) contains about 200 mg of cholesterol, and eggs had become a daily food in the United States at that time, eggs inevitably became one of the &quot;culprits&quot; in the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1968, the American Heart Association clearly stated for the first time that in order to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, it recommended limiting dietary cholesterol intake, and for the first time proposed limiting egg consumption to no more than three eggs per week. This may have been the source of subsequent recommendations from nutritional experts or doctors around the world to limit three eggs per week. This recommendation from a group of American cardiologists on limiting egg consumption seems logical and easy to operate. It has been recognized by many and has gradually become an important basis for the United States and other countries in the world to formulate national dietary nutrition guidelines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The media&#39;s fueling has deepened the public&#39;s misunderstanding of eggs. The most typical example is the two cover reports on cholesterol in the American &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 1984, Time magazine&#39;s front-page article was titled &quot;Cholesterol and Today&#39;s Bad News,&quot; and included a picture of a sad, round face on the cover of the magazine. The eyes were made of two fried eggs, and the sad mouth was Use a piece of bacon with both ends bent downward. Although Time magazine did not originate the bad reputation of eggs, its huge influence undoubtedly further deepened the public&#39;s association between eggs and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. Fifteen years later, Time magazine once again put an egg on the cover. The omelette still had the round eyes, but the mouth had been replaced by a melon with upturned sides, showing a cheerful smile. The corresponding front page The title of the article is &quot;Cholesterol, now the good news.&quot; Although this article marked a more scientific and comprehensive understanding of cholesterol by doctors and nutritionists, it did not quickly eliminate the misconceptions that had been instilled in the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the joint promotion of the medical community and the media, the bad reputation of eggs has lasted for more than 50 years. The biggest impact is undoubtedly the laying hen industry. From 1968 to the early 1990s, U.S. egg production basically stagnated, hovering around 4 million tons. During the same period, the U.S. population increased by more than 20%. Obviously, per capita egg consumption in the U.S. continued to decline during this period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3wGetBG43ptbpUG1Vj1VHnQbf0cdR4trlEeWXiIN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height= &quot;512&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/3wGetBG43ptbpUG1Vj1VHnQbf0cdR4trlEeWXiIN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258239&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1984, Time magazine published a report with the title &quot;Cholesterol and the Bad News Now&quot; and included a picture of a sad, round face on the cover. Fifteen years later, the egg appeared on the cover again, with the mouth replaced by upturned melons on both sides, and the corresponding article was &quot;Cholesterol, Now It&#39;s Good News.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;There is increasing evidence to the contrary&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Incredibly, there is a lack of direct scientific evidence that eating more cholesterol-rich eggs increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations by the American Heart Association and others to limit egg consumption are based primarily on three imperfect pieces of evidence. The first is evidence from animal models that excessive cholesterol intake increases serum cholesterol levels and the development of atherosclerosis in animals. , the second evidence is epidemiological surveys showing that a high-cholesterol diet is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, and the third evidence is clinical observations showing that high cholesterol intake leads to an increase in serum cholesterol levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These three seemingly interlocking pieces of evidence have fatal flaws. Scientists generally use rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and other animals to conduct animal cholesterol feeding experiments. The amount of cholesterol added is much higher than the daily dietary cholesterol intake, and it often needs to reach the pharmacological level to cause changes in serum cholesterol levels. For example, researchers at the University of Arizona once fed a group of guinea pigs 0 (control), 0.08% (equivalent to 600 mg/day for humans), 0.17% (equivalent to 1275 mg/day for humans) or 0.33% (equivalent to 2475 mg/day for humans). mg/day) dietary cholesterol, and a positive relationship was found between dietary cholesterol intake and serum LDL cholesterol. However, in this study, there was no significant difference in serum cholesterol concentrations between guinea pigs fed 0 dietary cholesterol and feed containing 0.08% cholesterol. Serum cholesterol concentrations increased significantly only when higher doses of cholesterol were fed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Epidemiological survey results on the correlation between dietary cholesterol and the incidence of cardiovascular disease often &quot;fight&quot;, leaving the public confused and at a loss as to what to do. Most of the early epidemiological surveys relied on simple correlation analysis to draw conclusions. For example, they only recorded the consumption of eggs, but did not consider the impact of other dietary components, or even other factors that may cause cardiovascular disease, such as smoking and drinking. factors, so the conclusions of this type of research are unreliable. However, this type of research is often more eye-catching due to the large number of subjects involved and long follow-up time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 1990s, an increasing number of studies have shown that egg consumption, dietary cholesterol, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease have little association. In 1999, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health published a major study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers conducted a follow-up study of more than 117,000 people for 8-14 years. After excluding age, After controlling for smoking and other factors that influence cardiovascular disease, the results showed no significant difference in cardiovascular disease risk between those who ate one egg per week versus one egg per day. In 2015, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden conducted a 13-year follow-up study on more than 60,000 people and also concluded that daily egg intake was not related to the incidence of cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some studies even suggest that eating eggs appropriately will reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In 2018, researchers from Peking University, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Oxford University and other institutions conducted a cohort study involving 500,000 people and found that compared with basically no eggs, moderate levels of egg consumption (an average of 0.79 eggs/day) ), the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 18% and the risk of death from hemorrhagic stroke was reduced by 28%. This is similar to the results of a 2003 study by the Hiroshima Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Japan. After following more than 40,000 people for 16 years, Japanese researchers found that people who ate eggs every day had a 30% lower risk of stroke death than those who did not eat eggs. People who ate 1-4 eggs a week had a corresponding risk of death from stroke. reduce. In a study of more than 130,000 adult subjects aged 40-69 in South Korea, researchers from Seoul National University found that among female subjects, compared with consuming less than one egg per week, Consuming more than 7 eggs per week is associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, randomized controlled trials are the most effective and reliable method to verify the association between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. Most randomized controlled trials have proven that eating 1-3 eggs per day has little effect on serum cholesterol levels, even for some diabetics. In a one-year randomized controlled trial, researchers from Maastricht University in the Netherlands asked volunteers in the experimental group to drink a buttermilk drink containing 1.5 lutein-rich egg yolks every day, while the control group drank no A placebo containing egg yolk found that after one year there were essentially no differences between the two groups in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. On the contrary, there are some randomized controlled trials that show that eating eggs actually reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome. However, currently this type of randomized controlled trial has problems such as small samples and short observation time, and still needs further improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1995, the American Heart Association Guidelines, the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Nutrition Facts Table all set dietary cholesterol recommendations at less than 300 mg/ days, and it is recommended to reduce the intake of animal-source foods such as eggs with high cholesterol. However, due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence to prove that consuming normal levels of eggs or other dietary cholesterol is harmful to the human body, since the beginning of the new millennium, relevant agencies formulating dietary guidelines have successively canceled recommendations on limiting the intake of eggs and dietary cholesterol. In 2002, the American Heart Association removed the specific limit of 3-4 eggs per week while maintaining dietary cholesterol guidelines of less than 300 mg/day. In 2013, the American Heart Association officially announced that &quot;there is insufficient evidence to determine whether lowering dietary cholesterol will lower LDL cholesterol&quot; and canceled the dietary cholesterol recommendation of no more than 300 mg/day. Both the 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 editions of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have removed the recommendation that dietary cholesterol consumption be less than 300 mg/day. According to the &quot;Scientific Research Report on Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents (2021)&quot;, currently only a few countries in the world, such as India and Australia, individually recommend eggs, and most countries recommend egg consumption of about 3 eggs per week. The &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents 2022&quot; recommends 1 egg consumption per day, and also states that &quot;eggs are rich in nutrients, and the yolks should not be discarded when eating eggs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;It turns out that there is a feedback mechanism in the body&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although most current dietary guidelines have canceled the intake limit recommendations for eggs and dietary cholesterol, the public is still concerned about the There are still doubts about eggs containing cholesterol, and they are worried that long-term eating of eggs will lead to increased cholesterol levels in the body and an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Does high dietary cholesterol intake mean high serum cholesterol levels? Not entirely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research shows that only about 25% of the body’s cholesterol comes from dietary intake, and the rest mainly relies on its own biosynthesis. Since cholesterol plays an important role in the human body, almost all cells in the human body can synthesize cholesterol. The liver and intestines are responsible for synthesizing about 80% of the daily cholesterol required by the human body. The brain, adrenal glands and reproductive organs can also synthesize cholesterol efficiently. An adult weighing 70 kg synthesizes approximately 850 mg of cholesterol per day. Clinical feeding studies have shown that if dietary cholesterol changes by 100 mg per day, total plasma cholesterol levels will change by an average of 2.2-2.5 mg/dL, which is equivalent to eating an egg only causing a 2%-3% change in serum cholesterol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that scientists have discovered that the human body has a feedback compensatory mechanism for cholesterol. That is, when the human body consumes too much dietary cholesterol, the body&#39;s ability to absorb and synthesize cholesterol will be limited, and it will also accelerate. Excretion and removal of excess cholesterol, thereby maintaining the balance of serum cholesterol levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1991, the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; reported an extreme case of &quot;addiction&quot; to eating eggs. An 88-year-old male has been eating 20-30 eggs a day for at least 15 years, but the doctor found that his blood lipid levels were basically normal, and his serum total cholesterol was also maintained at normal levels, with an average of 5.18 milliliters. mol/L (normal range 3.12-5.72 mmol/L), and the patient did not suffer from atherosclerosis and other diseases related to excessive cholesterol intake. In order to further study this special case, the researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial. The experimental group added 5 eggs per person per day on the basis of the regular diet, and the group without eggs served as the control group. It was found that during the regular diet, the control group ate The absorption rate of ingested cholesterol reached 53%, while during the high-cholesterol diet, which included five eggs, the absorption rate of ingested cholesterol dropped to 46% in the control group, but the 88-year-old only absorbed 18% of ingested cholesterol. . At the same time, the patient&#39;s total bile acid synthesis rate was twice that of the control group, which shows that there is a very effective compensatory mechanism in the patient&#39;s body. In the case of a large intake of egg cholesterol, on the one hand, the intake of cholesterol will be reduced. Absorption, on the other hand, reduces the body&#39;s ability to synthesize cholesterol, thereby maintaining the balance of total cholesterol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, not everyone responds to dietary cholesterol in the same way. It generally varies depending on genetics, individual metabolic level, gender, age and other factors. Research shows that about 2/3 of people who consume too much cholesterol will not or only have a slight increase in serum total cholesterol. These people, like the above-mentioned 88-year-old man, have an effective cholesterol compensatory mechanism and can adjust the absorption, excretion and synthesis of cholesterol according to their dietary cholesterol intake. But other people may lack a similar compensatory mechanism, and consuming too much dietary cholesterol will cause a significant increase in serum cholesterol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is growing evidence that egg or dietary cholesterol intake is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while egg intake addresses many nutritional deficiencies and may provide overall benefits across the lifespan. It makes an important contribution to health, so most people can eat eggs with confidence. Even some patients with metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular disease can eat them normally, but they cannot eat too much for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[河南武陟一中学发生踩踏事故，已致1死5伤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260621]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 00:41:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At about 10 am on November 13, 2023, the first grade of Xinghua Middle School in Wuzhi County Two groups of boys fell and were injured due to crowding on the stairs while going to the toilet between mid-term exams.

The Buildings Department will take enforcement action to promptly ban signboards that pose a clear threat to life and property, and will also prioritize enforcement against illegal signboards that are under construction or newly erected. In response to the large number of existing illegal signboards, the Buildings Department will select certain busy street sections with a large number of illegal signboards every year to conduct &quot;large-scale targeted street operations&quot; to conduct comprehensive removal operations against illegal, dangerous and abandoned signboards. In addition, the Buildings Department will also launch large-scale operations against large-scale illegal signboards that pose greater risks to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering that most of the existing signboards are being used by merchants and helping to promote local commercial activities, the Buildings Department has implemented the &quot;Signboard Verification Scheme&quot; since September 2, 2013. The scheme allows smaller signboards with lower risks, which have been erected before the implementation date of the verification scheme and comply with the technical specifications of the relevant minor works projects, to be safely carried out by prescribed building professionals and/or prescribed registered contractors. After inspection, strengthening (if necessary) and certification with the Buildings Department, they can continue to be used. Thereafter, the safety inspection must be carried out again every five years or the signboards must be removed. The inspection scheme also applies to neon signs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Buildings Department also told Southern+ reporters that its staff had inspected No. 63 Temple Street, Kowloon, and found an existing wall attached to the exterior wall of the building facing the 1st floor to the 3rd floor of Public Square Street. The main wording of the illegal signboard is &quot;Meitu Restaurant&quot;. According to the current law enforcement policy, the relevant signboards are subject to ban. The Buildings Department then issued a clearance order to the signboard owner in accordance with Section 24 of the Buildings Ordinance on October 19 last year through the &quot;Large Scale Operation on Large Signboards&quot;. Order him to remove the relevant signboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, according to the notice of work commencement submitted by the registered minor works contractor appointed by the owner of the relevant signboard, the relevant demolition works have started in November this year.

The picture attracted attention on the Internet. After checking, the reporter found that two of the three accompanying pictures were post-processed pictures and were not real photos. According to information from the Buildings Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government, small signboards (including neon signs) can be retained and used as long as they meet relevant safety requirements.

APEC members include 21 economies in the Pacific Rim, which accounts for nearly 40% of the world&#39;s population and more than 60% of global trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This APEC Summit is the largest international conference held in San Francisco since dignitaries gathered to sign the United Nations Charter in 1945. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This week, leaders, ministers, business executives and journalists from 21 APEC economies will gather at the main venue, the Moscone Center, with nearly 30,000 people in attendance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Moscone Center is located in the center of San Francisco. It is composed of three buildings connected by overpasses and underground passages. Southern Weekend reporters learned from the San Francisco APEC organizer that in 2019, the San Francisco government spent US$551 million to expand the Moscone Center, increasing the space by 21%, and now the total area reaches more than 500,000 square feet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;San Francisco has a historic Chinatown, the largest Chinese gathering place outside Asia and the oldest Chinese gathering place in North America. According to the U.S. Census, San Francisco has 180,000 Chinese residents, second only to New York. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“The road to San Francisco will not&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; be smooth sailing”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As we enter October, China and the United States High-level visits between the two countries are frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From October 26th to 28th, Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a three-day visit to the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three-day trip was short and intense. In Washington, Wang Yi held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. President’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, met with Biden, and communicated with U.S. strategic figures and industrial and commercial representatives. Among them, during his first visit to Japan on October 26, Wang Yi held two rounds of talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, totaling 7 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In all three events, Foreign Minister Wang Yi mentioned the keyword &quot;San Francisco&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Return to Bali, leading to San Francisco&quot;, according to CCTV, this expression has been widely known recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&#39;Return to Bali&#39; refers to last year&#39;s G20 meeting. President Xi Jinping and President Biden had a very good meeting in Bali, Indonesia, and reached important consensus.&quot; Cui Tiankai, former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, explained at the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum on October 29. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the G20 Summit in Bali a year ago, President Biden reiterated the &quot;four no&#39;s and one unintentional&quot; many times. The &quot;four no&#39;s and one unintentional&quot; means that the United States does not seek to fight a &quot;new Cold War&quot;, does not seek to change China&#39;s system, does not seek to strengthen alliances against China, does not support &quot;Taiwan independence&quot;, and has no intention of conflict with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; &quot;The &#39;road to San Francisco&#39; will not be smooth sailing and cannot rely on &#39;autonomous driving.&#39;&quot; On October 28, Wang Yi said during a symposium with people from the U.S. strategic community in Washington that for this reason , both sides should earnestly &quot;return to Bali&quot;, truly implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, eliminate interference, overcome obstacles, enhance consensus, and accumulate results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This symposium was hosted by the highly official &quot;U.S. Aspen Strategy Group.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-US economic and trade relations are the &quot;ballast stone&quot; of the relationship between the two countries. As the world&#39;s top two economies, China and the United States have a total economic output of more than one-third of the world, a total population of nearly a quarter of the world, and bilateral trade volume of about one-fifth of the world. Data show that China-US trade volume will reach nearly 760 billion US dollars in 2022, a record high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From November 8 to 12, just before APEC, He Lifeng, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and leader of Sino-US economic and trade, visited the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his visit to the United States, Vice Premier He Lifeng and Treasury Secretary Yellen held multiple rounds of talks and had working dinners together. The total meeting time exceeded 10 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The purpose is to continue to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state on the basis of the talks between the two sides in Beijing in July, prepare economic results for the meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco, and push Sino-US economic and trade relations back to the track of healthy and stable development. .&quot; On November 10, Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min said at a briefing in San Francisco, USA, that consensus was reached such as promoting the establishment of a Sino-US economic and financial working group and holding meetings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Yellen and her delegation arrived in Beijing in July, a rainbow appeared in the sky. When Premier Li Qiang met with Yellen, he mentioned, “After Sino-US relations have gone through a storm, we will definitely see more rainbows.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There are a thousand reasons for China-U.S. relations&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;We have a thousand reasons to improve Sino-US relations, and there is no reason for Sino-US relations to deteriorate.&quot; On October 9, President Xi Jinping met with the United States Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the eve of &quot;Xi&#39;s visit&quot; in San Francisco, the United States sent a Senate delegation led by Chuck Schumer to visit China in early October; at the end of October, California Governor Gavin Newsom and his 23-member delegation visited China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, a congressional delegation of three Democrats and three Republicans, including Schumer of the United States Senate, flew to Shanghai. This is the first bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Senate to visit China in four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China-U.S. relations are complex, with both cooperation and competition. We must establish a crisis management and control mechanism and resume dialogue.&quot; Michael Swain, chief director of the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute of National Affairs, told Southern Weekend reporters , as the US election year approaches, many politicians will use anti-China issues to add political points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key members of the U.S. Congress have important influence on China-related issues. Before visiting China, Schumer had repeatedly urged the Biden administration to take a tough stance against China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The United States has no intention of decoupling from China, but hopes that American companies can receive fair treatment in China.&quot; On October 7, Schumer mentioned when meeting with Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary Chen Jining that the United States was not trying to provoke conflict, but was It is hoped that in the context of economic competition between the United States and China, we can obtain a level playing field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Wen believes that the United States should clearly abide by the &quot;One China Policy&quot;, express its willingness to let China participate in economic cooperation, and strive to improve the stability of the Asia-Pacific economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 U.S. Export to China Report&quot; released by the U.S.-China Business Council shows that more than 70,000 U.S. companies have invested and established business in China, and nearly 90% of their businesses in China have achieved profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“De-risking does not mean completely cutting off economic ties (with China), it just means there are restrictions.” Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard University in the United States, told Southern Weekend reporters that the US national strategy has changed to “small &quot;We should not let this small courtyard expand&quot; to describe the China strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past month, China and the United States have undergone significant changes in agricultural economics and trade. On November 7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent 17 exhibitors to participate in the 6th Shanghai International Import Expo, and at the same time brought back 600,000 tons of soybean orders for the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as October 25, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng came to Iowa, the &quot;Breadbasket of the United States,&quot; to participate in the China-US Sustainable Agricultural Products Trade Forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Feng mentioned that Rick from Kimberley Farm told him that a modern agriculture demonstration project with an investment of 50 million yuan was settled in Zhejiang, and representatives of Chinese companies participating in the procurement signing today will sign more than ten agricultural product orders. Worth billions of dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;California Waterways&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;California Governor Newsom’s visit to China has a more diverse itinerary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The California Governor’s Office stated in a statement that Newsom’s team’s seven-day itinerary includes Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing, Yancheng, and Shanghai, focusing on topics such as ecological environment, climate change response, and clean energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 24, Newsom led a delegation to Shenzhen. They went to the Antuoshan Smart Station of Shenzhen Bus Group to try out a BYD electric vehicle. &quot;This is a breakthrough technology! I want to buy two of them. We have to find a way to introduce them to the United States.&quot; After experiencing the in-situ U-turn function of the U8, Newsom praised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Newsom visited Guangzhou on the same day, he discussed with relevant departments in Guangdong the successful climate cooperation between the two provinces and states over the years. Relevant departments of the two provinces and states also signed a memorandum of understanding on deepening cooperation in green development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The California Governor’s Office stated that this new memorandum of understanding is a supplement to the relevant memorandum of understanding signed by the two provinces and states in 2013. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 25, President Xi Jinping met with Newsom at the Great Hall of the People. President Xi Jinping once again emphasized that &quot;the foundation of Sino-US relations lies in the people, hope lies in the people, the future lies in the youth, and the vitality lies in the localities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to climate issues, Newsom&#39;s China trip has two major purposes. One is to &quot;Promote economic development and tourism and strengthen cultural ties&quot;, and the second is &quot;combat anti-Asian hatred.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having been in politics in California for many years, Newsom is an experienced witness and promoter of local economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newsom visited China three times when he was mayor of San Francisco. In 2005, when Newsom and the late U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein visited China, it coincided with the 25th anniversary of Shanghai and San Francisco becoming sister cities. In 2008, Newsom specially set up a China office in San Francisco to serve Chinese companies in investing and cooperating there and local companies entering the Chinese market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, California connects the channels of exchange between China and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to U.S. Census data, more than 4% of Californians and more than 10% of people in the San Francisco Bay Area are of Chinese ancestry. The Port of Los Angeles is the largest port in the United States participating in Sino-US trade, and the Shanghai-Los Angeles route is one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The more successful China is, the more successful the world will be.&quot; Newsom said in an interview with CCTV that he did not agree with the so-called &quot;de-risking&quot; and &quot;decoupling&quot;. He said that he could &quot;diversify&quot; from the world and look at it from the perspective of head-on competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一处回水丨事关告别]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260546]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/13/pOFXgYDzOTEV7i3fl7ax1TpBauQnnpPMM4B9TPhc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/pOFXgYDzOTEV7i3fl7ax1TpBauQnnpPMM4B9TP hc. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258154&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinsha River. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yangtze River changed color overnight. When I passed the Jinsha River Bridge in Yibin yesterday evening, it still looked green. This morning in Lizhuang, I lay on the railing of the riverside wetland and saw that it was already a dark yellow. The duckweeds washed down from the upper reaches were floating and sinking. I His swimming plan was temporarily scrapped. I don’t know why, I really want to swim this summer, to swim in open waters with no ceilings. Most of the reason for coming to Yibin is to swim in the Yangtze River. I saw the photos sent by my friends before. The Minjiang River is light yellow and the Jinsha River is green. I can’t get along with each other in Yibin. A long dividing line was drawn out, and I wanted to take a look at the dividing line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lizhuang has long been renovated. Except for a few quiet courtyards (such as the former site of Tongji Medical College), it is not easy to evoke the imagination of historical scenes. Instead, it is the former site of the Institute of History and Linguistics of the &quot;Academia Sinica&quot; in Banliao a few kilometers away. , because the resettlement conditions have not been agreed upon with the villagers, it has maintained a certain degree of &quot;authenticity&quot;. Of course, you can also say it is dilapidated. The roof of the courtyard called &quot;Tian 𡎚 Shang&quot; collapsed on the left side, so a few geese circled around and, together with the dogs hiding in the dark, issued impatient warnings to strangers. Walking inside is a courtyard with a bluestone floor, piles of firewood, bamboo poles and sundries. Old wires are wrapped around the black tiled wooden wall. A guinea fowl stands on the high threshold. Several &quot;This&quot; pictures are posted on the wall. &quot;Danger, please stay away&quot; warning sign. The eldest brother who lives here told me that there are four or five households in the yard. They are asked to move, but the compensation standard is only 750 meters per square meter. At this price, they cannot afford to buy a house elsewhere, so as long as the old house does not collapse, they will Live forever. If it weren&#39;t for the introduction on the sign at the door, I would never have known that this was once the library of the Institute of History and Linguistics - or &quot;the best Chinese liberal arts library during the war.&quot; Ah, I remembered, the reason why the Institute of Liberal Arts of Peking University wanted to leave at that time In Kunming, I came to Lizhuang with the Institute of History and Language Studies because of their rich collection of ancient books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Outside the old house faces an acre of lotus pond, with overlapping lotus leaves and dotted lotus flowers. Together with the dense bamboos on the other side and the light blue sky, it is somewhat elegant. Did you ever &quot;talk and laugh&quot; here back then? Are there &quot;Hongru&quot;? But Hongru was probably like me, &quot;sweating like pulp&quot;. After the rain, the sun is fierce, everything on the surface is steaming, and the heat in southern Sichuan is revealed. In the summer of 1941, Mei Yiqi, Zheng Tianting, and Luo Changpei flew from Kunming to Chongqing to contact the Ministry of Education of the National Government about the affairs of Southwest Associated University. They then went up the river to Sichuan to visit academic institutions that had been moved to the rear area, and then walked to Lizhuang At that time, the diary kept complaining about the heat: &quot;The thermometer never dropped below 90 degrees (32.22 degrees Celsius) at night. It was so hot that I couldn&#39;t sleep all night long.&quot; &quot;The sweat shirt is soaked again&quot; (Luo Changpei), &quot;The sweat is all over the body, not just once&quot;, &quot;Taking off the coat and going naked does not make you cooler, but it is easier for the ears to sweat&quot; (Mei Yiqi). They did not leave any record of enjoying the Yangtze River, but their conversations with friends - listening to Liang Fangzhong talk about the inspection in northern Shaanxi, and listening to Ling Chunsheng talking about the story of demarcation of the Yunnan-Myanmar border - &quot;It was like taking Qingliang Powder, which eliminated a lot of... The heat of the summer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I took a bus back to Yibin and got off the bus in the old town. The so-called &quot;ancient streets&quot; were very boring. I turned to the Rongzhou Bridge to see the confluence of the Jinsha River and the Min River. The Jinsha River became even more muddy. The heat was unbearable and I was soaked to the skin. I chatted with the bridge watcher on the bridge (I forgot to ask him about his duties) about where to swim. He pointed me to a water bank under the bridge and reminded me to be careful when swimming—— He said a two-syllable word that I didn&#39;t understand. It was probably the watershed. After passing XX, the current would carry you far away from the shore, making it difficult to come back. I walked off the bridge and walked along the narrow stone stairs to the water. Two men and one woman who had just finished swimming had this place to themselves. They had brought lunch boxes for a picnic. I asked if the water was urgent. They seemed offended by this obvious question. , after a long while, he said in angry Sichuan terms: It’s not that it’s urgent, it’s that it’s very urgent! Further down is Hejiangmen, where the Min River merges into the Jinsha River, which is also the &quot;starting point of the Yangtze River.&quot; According to the introduction, the water depth at the confluence is 30 meters, what a guy. There is a square and the &quot;Pearl of the Yangtze River&quot; commemorative ball at the Hejiang River. At the bottom is a gentle backwater, dominated by the light yellow water of the Minjiang River. Occasionally, a few thin red water flows of the Jinsha River rush in, and some people swim underneath. It looks very safe, but it really doesn’t arouse my desire to go into the water. This place is more like a flooded overpass when the city is flooded. Who wants to swim under the overpass? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I decided to stay in Yibin for one more day and wait for the Jinsha River to clear up. During the day, I went to the museum to see an exhibition and saw the painter Lu Yanshao&#39;s &quot;Rock Perch Waiting to Visit&quot;. The meditator lived in seclusion in the mountains. His mountain house really looked like an air-raid bunker. Then I looked at the inscription. It was painted in Nanping, Chongqing in March 1941. , it was when the Japanese army concentrated their bombing. How does the creator feel and experience reality, and then complete the conception and imagination of the work? I curiously searched for Lu Yanshao&#39;s memoirs. In February 1938, he evacuated from Shanghai to Chongqing. &quot;I was afraid of bombings in the city, and I was afraid of bandits in the countryside, so I had no idea.&quot; He then worked at the arsenal farm and was responsible for keeping records of work. In his free time, he wrote, read and visited friends. He once went to Shapingba to visit Feng Zikai. The latter built several thatched houses on Pinggang, protected by low fences in the front and back, and also raised a few geese. &quot;Because no one introduced him, , I broke in on my own, but he didn’t take my presumptuous approach, and later wrote to me.” In 1941, when Lu Yan was 33 years old, his fourth child was born. He raised chickens, fed pigs, and grew vegetables to support the family, but due to the well, The water was unclean and it was difficult to drink. Fortunately, the arsenal later pumped water from the Yangtze River for the staff to drink, which made him understand what Du Fu wrote: &quot;What is the value of fighting for water?&quot; - When he entered Sichuan, he only brought one book in his luggage The book is Qian&#39;s poem about Du, &quot;I chant in my spare time, looking at the Bashan Shu River, the scenery before my eyes, once Du Gong points it out, I feel more friendly... Returning east without sun, with worries in my heart, is the same as Du Gong&#39;s feelings when he traveled to Shu, because Especially for Du&#39;s poems, he was too lazy to learn.&quot; After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in August 1945, people from all walks of life returned to the east one after another. Lu Yanshao was eager to miss his hometown, but he couldn&#39;t buy a boat ticket. He happened to have a friend who was in the timber business, so he took a raft out. Although the gorge is dangerous, it also provides the opportunity to observe the water potential at close range. &quot;You can carefully examine its potential and understand the nature of the water. However, traditional landscape landscapes are all prepared by various schools and sects. It is really beyond the ability of a ship to speed up.&quot; Walking in the Three Gorges for more than a month has gained me more than studying for ten years... Because of the life experience of seeing the water in the Three Gorges, I used the hook line method to create a unique style of the dangerous water of the Gorge, which is only used in the sea. , which he has nothing in his family. From this he came to the conclusion that painting landscapes must go to the mountains and rivers. From the time of Wen Shen and the Four Kings, humans have been living in piles of old papers, and the situation has deteriorated over time. But after seeing it with your eyes, you must use your mind to think about it. , whether it is a big thing, it depends on its spirit, or a small thing, it is a tree or a stone. How to express it, you have to think about it... You must bring some new methods back... Otherwise, the trip will be in vain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;5 p.m. The water in the Yangtze River has become muddier and faster. Near the Water Curtain Square, a long hydrophilic platform with red mud bathing on the shore is probably an excellent natural swimming lane when the water is clear. I took off my shoes and went down to feel the flow velocity. It was not knee deep, but the impact force was obvious. A cargo ship went upstream, and the waves spread to both sides. A few swimmers drifting down from the upstream with followers avoided it and laughed loudly. They were probably enjoying themselves. I walked upstream along the river and returned to the confluence of the two rivers. The Minjiang River rushed straight towards the other bank, creating another piece of backwater here. The two waters were not fully mixed, and there were many thread-like semi-clear water suspended in the mud. An elder brother was sitting on the pier. He also came to swim, but he thought the water was dirty. &quot;It became clear one night before, but it is still very muddy today. It may be due to the discharge of sand from the upstream reservoir.&quot; He also said that people drowned here a few days ago. There were three people, two of whom he couldn&#39;t escape and were photographed underwater by the big boat. &quot;They haven&#39;t been found yet.&quot; I asked him what it was like to swim at the junction of the two rivers. “It’s cool and warm for a while” – the Jinsha River is warm in winter and cool in summer, while the Minjiang River is the opposite, so locals like to swim in the Jinsha River, especially in winter, when the water is very warm, “ I don’t want to come up after soaking in it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the third day, the Yangtze River was still not clear. I decided not to wait any longer and went to see the rich water in the upper reaches. Shuifu belongs to Zhaotong, Yunnan, but is much closer to Yibin, Sichuan. The driver who took me there chatted with me and said that Shuifu and Yibin have similar accents and similar food, &quot;but they don&#39;t like eating and playing as much as we do.&quot; I asked her to go along the river as much as possible, so she chose an old road with bumps on the south bank. Didi Mini Program refused to accept this old road full of large trucks, shouting all the way, &quot;You have deviated, please turn around at the appropriate location.&quot; . It was a little annoying at first, but after listening to it for a long time, I suddenly became happy: Isn’t yaw one of the purposes of traveling? Without yaw, how could there be any surprise? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surprise will come soon. The car was near the river, and I saw irregular blue-green colors on the turbid river surface during the bumps. I thought I had seen it wrong. After all, the sun was glaring and it was constantly blocked by shrubs. But the driver said she saw it too. After a while, we both confirmed: there is indeed a thin blue line on the other side, that is, the north bank of the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it because there is a clear tributary flowing into the north bank? As the car drove forward, the blue line grew bigger and bigger, until it was evenly matched with the dark yellow line. I clicked on the map on my phone and finally realized that the Jinsha River had always been blue because there was a large tributary, the Hengjiang River, pouring in from the south bank in front of it, bringing with it billows of sediment that dyed the entire main stream yellow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When crossing the border between Sichuan and Yunnan, the driver became nervous. Someone in her WeChat group reminded her: There is a transportation management team ahead. Check online for a taxi. It is said that if you catch a car, you will be fined 3,000 to 10,000. Although she has only been running Didi for more than ten days, she already feels &quot;a lot of pressure&quot;. We went around and around and avoided it. When we reached the end, she breathed a sigh of relief and said, &quot;I&#39;ll be safe when you get there.&quot; Then she ran to the trunk and brought me two big pears, saying they were grown in her hometown. When I checked in at the hotel, I chose the room type facing the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Station, but I didn’t see the Gaoxia Pinghu Lake I imagined. The dam is 162 meters high. From the 10th floor where I was, it was impossible to even see the top of the dam. , if we take the surface of the reservoir lake as a benchmark, I am now more than a hundred meters underwater, which gives people a strange feeling of having a water basin above their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The river under the dam is so blue that it’s mesmerizing, and a dozen egrets are looking for food on the bank. After eating a pear, I went out to look for food. The taste here is indeed similar to that of Yibin. One or two plain noodles, one or two mushroom noodles, and a bowl of iced white fungus soup, a total of 16 yuan. Satisfied to see the river, the nearest one is Xiangjiaba Bridge. I was a little shocked when I got on the bridge. Today&#39;s high temperature is 35 degrees Celsius, there are not many trees and water, and the whole city is covered in white from the sun, but it cools down as soon as we reach the bridge. This should also be attributed to the water basin above the head: the temperature in the deep water area of ​​the reservoir is low all year round, and the water under the dam is cold, so the downstream valley naturally becomes a freezer. After standing for a long time, my legs even felt cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than one kilometer from the bridge, the red mud-colored Hengjiang River flows into the right bank, so the more than one kilometer of blue Jinsha River before it has become a big swimming pool for the water rich. I stepped on the big rocks that were hot in the sun and went down to the water. A kind brother saw that I was following me and repeatedly reminded me to pay attention to safety. The water here is deep and fast. It is the territory of the swimming association. All the experts are swimming in the middle. Adults will ask the children who come to play in the water: Where are your parents? I swam close to the shore for a while. The water was really fast and I was still in the same place after swimming for a long time, but I finally embraced this lovely river. Cool, but not as cool as expected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thanked my elder brother and continued to walk downstream. I passed a real backwater area. The water near the shore moved upstream at an extremely fast speed. I also passed a tidal flat, and the water was filled with tidal flats. Schools of small fish change into different shapes when frightened. Further down, there is a man-made cement platform, which is waist-deep in the river water and serves as a shoal. The water flow here is slow and there are the most swimmers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the bridge and at high places, you can easily see many white swirls in the middle of the river where the flow is the fastest, like rolling away, drawing circles from the inside out, large and small. But when you go down into the water and your eyes are level with the water, what you see more are lines, light or dark lines, disturbing ripples, and water light. The water light sprinkled with gold powder is so charming. When your whole body is soaked in this cool blue water, your consciousness seems to disappear, and you only feel great freedom and happiness. After a long time, a nonsensical sentence popped up in my mind:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am willing to drink a lot of water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I smelled the faint smell of freshwater grass that I was familiar with when I was swimming in the Xiangjiang River when I was a child. The sparkling waves in the sky when I looked at the water also seemed familiar. There was a whistling sound in the middle of the river, like a god sifting beans, and occasionally there was a rush of water. Come here and let your body feel refreshed. free. Freedom stretches endlessly from all around. The deeper you go, the more free you feel. It&#39;s a pity that I can&#39;t write poetry - I thought in the water - only poetry is worthy of the rhythm here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Let people swim!&quot; This is the title of a column for the New York Times by Berlin-based writer Paul Hockenos. This hot summer, he visited Munich and found that almost everyone in the city was swimming in the Isar River to cool off. This tributary of the Danube River was once seriously polluted. In 2000, when the climate crisis had not intensified and the summer in Europe was not too harsh, Munich presciently carried out a large-scale restoration of the Isar River. This project lasted 11 years and cost 38 million. The $100 million project includes cleaning up the river, expanding its floodplain, and transforming its banks to accommodate the surge of spring snowmelt flooding from the Alps. Today, the river serves as an important public space, providing a place for people to escape the heat. &quot;I don&#39;t have a balcony, I don&#39;t have a garden, but I have the Isar River.&quot; said a friend of Paul Hockenos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I realized later that the reason why I wanted to swim in a real river so much was to say goodbye to a feeling of fear, a feeling of scaring myself that had accumulated over the past few years. The pure freedom and joy I felt in the water was something I hadn’t seen in a long time. “Healing” is overused these days, but it’s still true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remembered that when I studied extensively at the Southwest Associated University a few years ago, I certainly had various perceptions of that period of history, but the one that impressed me the most was nothing more than three words: &quot;not afraid.&quot; I also remembered that many years ago when I was a reporter, I interviewed a scholar. He talked about &quot;listening to drinking&quot; and said, &quot;Listening to drinking is a slave. But now there are people who voluntarily listen to drinking. With a wave of their hands, everyone leaves, and that&#39;s it.&quot; I was too inexperienced at the time and could only literally understand the damage that &quot;listening and drinking&quot; can do to a person&#39;s integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was immersed in joy and happiness the whole day after swimming, and walked along the Jinsha River for half a day in the evening. It seems like people all over the city are walking along the river. Cities with big rivers are indeed blessed. On the way back to the hotel, I saw a row of lights on the dam from a distance, like a city wall. I finished watching the last day of the World Swimming Championships while eating a 4.99 yuan spicy chicken drumstick, and my mind kept replaying the blue that I saw, touched, and immersed myself in in the afternoon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[校领导被举报收实习回扣应调查，职校不能把学生当“猪仔”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260573]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, anti-counterfeiter Wang Hai publicly reported through the Internet that the leader of a vocational school in Jiangxi made huge profits from student internships. aroused great public concern. On November 13, Xinyu City, Jiangxi Province, where the vocational school involved is located, announced that a joint investigation team had been formed by the Municipal Education Bureau, Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, etc. to investigate and verify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Jimu News, Wang Hai posted on the Internet that Teacher Zhang from Jiangxi New Energy Technology Vocational College accidentally discovered that his ex-wife Yan Moumou, who was also responsible for student internships at the school, had a huge deposit of 6 million yuan. , and also discovered an account book involving tens of millions of yuan, recording the details and distribution ratios of funds transferred by multiple human resources agencies to multiple leaders of the school. One page shows that a four-month internship with 39 students received nearly 130,000 yuan in &quot;management fees&quot;. His ex-wife received more than 14,000 yuan, and another leader received more than 114,000 yuan. . The bank statements provided by the whistleblower also show that since 2017, multiple human resources companies have frequently transferred money to the account of a person related to Yan in the name of &quot;employing companies paying training fees&quot;, with amounts ranging from several thousand yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. No wait. The money finally went to Yan Moumou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The figure of more than 6 million is a bit shocking. From the article, it seems that this is only a small amount allocated to the assistant dean. Whether Wang Hai&#39;s report is true or not depends on the investigation results of relevant departments. However, it is no secret that in the name of organizing student internships, vocational schools actually engage in &quot;labor export&quot;, collect fees from internship companies, and even deduct students&#39; internship remuneration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, because some manufacturing companies had difficulty recruiting workers, vocational school students became the targets of some labor agency companies. Vocational schools then found a way to make money: they cooperated with labor agencies, organized students to work in companies in the name of internship, and collected management fees, training fees, etc. In a Jimu News report, a former vice president of Jiangxi New Energy Technology Vocational College admitted that when students go to companies for internships, the school does receive a management fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, companies will not spend this money in vain. In some places, in addition to schools collecting money, school leaders and intern teachers can also receive kickbacks. In this incident, a page of account books provided by the whistleblower showed that students from the school went to an internship in a company in Suzhou. For every hour they worked, the students were paid 15 yuan, the school could get 4 yuan, and the assistant to the dean could also receive it personally. 5 cents. Of course, the truth of the incident remains to be investigated. However, there have been precedents for similar incidents before. In 2021, it was revealed that Guizhou Aluminum Technician College arranged student internships through an intermediary company and collected fees ranging from 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan per student per month from the remuneration given to students by the internship unit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vocational school students go to companies for &quot;internships&quot;, and the pay is low, but the labor intensity is not low. In 2021, Hunan Linwu County Vocational High School organized students to intern at a company in the county, where they had to work 11 hours a day. In the same year, some students from Hanjiang Science and Technology School in Danjiangkou City, Hubei Province were arranged by the school to intern at a technology company, working more than ten hours a day. And these &quot;internship&quot; jobs often have nothing to do with the majors they studied. Students majoring in computer science were assigned to &quot;move boxes&quot;, while those majoring in nursing were assigned to beauty salons and hair salons. These so-called internships are actually pure physical labor and have no effect on improving professional skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long hours and heavy labor are unbearable even for adults, let alone vocational school students who have just become adults or even minors. Many people have been severely damaged physically and mentally, and some have even become disabled due to work-related injuries due to fatigue at work and other reasons. Xiaopeng, a student from Linwu County Vocational High School, was pinched by a machine during his internship, resulting in the amputation of two fingers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In people’s minds, ordinary college students will also do internships before graduation, but the school usually does not organize arrangements. At most, it provides relevant information and requires students to contact the internship unit themselves. But vocational schools are different. Vocational education regulations require that students &quot;should&quot; participate in internship training, and internship experience has become a necessary condition for graduation of vocational school students. Some vocational schools use the precious sword of graduation certificates to force students to participate in &quot;internships&quot; organized by the school. &quot;If you don&#39;t go to the internship, you will not be given a diploma.&quot; The internship time is too short and cannot bring enough &quot;value&quot; to the school. No.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most vocational schools are at the technical secondary level and recruit junior high school graduates. Because of the &quot;50-50 split&quot; in the high school entrance examination, about half of junior high school graduates go to vocational schools. Most of these students are only 15 or 16 years old. At the age of 10, they have just finished the education stage that focuses more on discipline, and their minds are not fully mature. Compared with these immature students, schools and teachers are undoubtedly in an absolute advantageous position. These powers have become transformed in the hands of some schools and teachers. The sickle that cuts students&#39; leeks. These schools are not thinking about how to improve the quality of teaching and teach students real professional skills, but they are thinking hard about how to squeeze more money out of students.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a profession Education, no wonder parents and students abandon it like worn-out shoes. To do a good job in vocational education, we must first break this abnormal power structure and let vocational schools return to their role as education service providers. Students can come and go freely without being restricted by their student status. If you feel that a certain school or a certain major is not good, you can leave at any time and go to other schools or majors. As long as you study enough courses and learn enough skills, you can graduate. This will encourage vocational schools to compete in the education market. Win the favor of students and parents based on indicators such as teaching and employment quality, rather than treating students as cash cows and lambs to be cut.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS ：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https ://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说 | 朱勇：历史研究联系现实要恰如其分，不能过于牵强]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260581]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zhu Yong was born in 1955 in Wuwei, Anhui.

He originally thought he would deal with fruit trees for the rest of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Three years later, the college entrance examination resumed, and 23-year-old Zhu Yong entered the Department of Political Education of Anhui University to study. Nowadays, this age may have graduated with a bachelor&#39;s degree, but at that time, the eldest classmate in Zhu Yong&#39;s class was already 31 years old, and there were fathers and sons enrolled in other departments at the same time. In his own words, &quot;it was delayed for four years, but not too long.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The prelude of reform and opening up has been played, and the spring tide is surging in the economic field.

This includes loosening soil and fertilizing fruit trees, weeding and pruning, spraying pesticides and drainage, picking and caring for fruit trees, etc. Fruit trees are highly seasonal and more tiring than farm work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Eating peaches feels good, but picking peaches in summer is particularly uncomfortable. If you wear too much clothes, you will feel hot; if you wear too little, the peach hairs will feel itchy if they stick to your body. In the peach orchard, the branches are low and the ground is full of ditches and bumps. I can only bend down and carry the baskets of peaches out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, hundreds of young people gather at the garden farm, and they can always find fun. When the fruit is ripe, it needs 24 hours of supervision. If you work the night shift, you won&#39;t be able to sleep for 8 hours at night. Someone came to steal the fruit, and everyone was very excited. They divided their troops to guard and try to catch the person.

There are some learning materials that I generally don’t like to read. At that time, those who &quot;criticized Lin Biao and Confucius&quot; called Confucius &quot;the second son of Confucius&quot; and extracted his remarks for criticism. Everyone thinks what Confucius said is quite reasonable, but after listening to expert analysis, they feel that what the experts said is also reasonable. Only then will I be interested in reading it. After reading it, I can show it off by chatting with others. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also a few readings that are circulated privately, and people are eager to get the books. For example, &quot;Three Heroes and Five Righteousness&quot; is about Bao Gong and a group of heroes who travel the world.

At that time, there were also university students from workers, peasants and soldiers, but the number of places was very small. This was almost impossible on our farm. My personality can be summed up in two words: casualness. I feel that since everyone can bear it, then work hard, and you will not be so tired when you enter management in the future, and there is still hope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I didn’t expect it to be that far back then.

Everyone thought it was incredible, how could this song be played? I have a vague feeling that the direction of society is changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was at that time that Xinhua Bookstore began to sell classic novels such as &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, &quot;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, but there was a queue to buy the books Very long queue.

The college entrance examination is to be resumed, but some people are already talking about it privately. If it is spread too much, everyone will believe it. In the orchard, the young man works the night shift. After getting off work at four or five in the morning, he takes a nap first and then reviews his books. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have been hesitating for a while, feeling that I have lost so much time studying and I don’t want to take the college entrance examination.

They just felt that others were reviewing and it would be inappropriate not to review themselves.

Later, many people asked for leave for various reasons. At first, the farm required that educated youths were not allowed to take leave and were not allowed to read during working hours. But the leaders at all levels of the farm are also relatively simple and kind-hearted. They also have children and understand our urgency for the college entrance examination, so they still have a certain degree of laxity in management. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Going to the Department of Philosophy for my undergraduate degree&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern China Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Mo Lifeng from the School of Liberal Arts of Nanjing University has a similar experience to yours.

I applied for liberal arts. I felt that Anhui University was the best school within my knowledge, so I applied. Later I learned that with my scores, I could only get into Anhui University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 1977 College Entrance Examination in Anhui Province was held from December 10th to 11th. Shortly after the Spring Festival, I received the admission notice from Anhui University. Although I will report to the university soon, after the Spring Festival holiday, I still went back to work in the second farm team, thinking that I should stand on the last shift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, our second brigade had a walking tractor that collected feces from public toilets every day and fertilized the fruit trees. The body behind the tractor was broken, and the brigade secretary asked me to send it to a repair shop for repairs. It was so cold that the remaining feces on the truck bed was frozen. Before repairing, it had to be thawed with hot water and then wiped clean. At this time, I thought, I will leave the farm next week anyway, report to the university, and let this matter go. After that, I started my academic career of reading and teaching. However, my failure to get the tractor body repaired has long been a problem of mine. Later, I went back to the farm to visit the old secretary of the brigade, and I apologized to him specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I am lucky.

At that time, the prelude to the country&#39;s reform and opening up had begun, and the economic field was booming. Most of the students hope to enter the Department of Economics, and I also want to adjust to the Department of Economics.

In other departments, there are fathers and children admitted at the same time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The lights in the dormitory are turned off at 11 o&#39;clock in the evening, and many students go to read under the street lamps.

At that time, the school distributed work uniformly, and they were all good units. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the early 1980s, the construction of the national legal system was initially launched. Everyone thinks that the legal system is an effective means of national governance, but no one can clearly explain the &quot;legal system&quot;. The more this happens, the more expectations they have for the legal system, and they believe that legal talents have great development prospects. My parents didn’t understand what legal history was, but they knew that I majored in law, so they fully supported my application for a master’s degree in Chinese legal history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was in my third year of master&#39;s degree, I learned that Professor Zhang Jinfan of China University of Political Science and Law was recruiting doctoral students in Chinese legal history, so I decided to sign up for the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Cooking noodles and talking about academics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern China Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In February 1985, you went to China University of Political Science and Law to study for a PhD in Chinese legal history. What was your first impression of this school? What is it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first impression is the legal awareness of Fa Da people. When I first came here, the Third Ring Road was being built near the north gate of the school. Once while taking a bus, I saw a law student having a dispute with the driver over the parking issue of the bus. The driver thinks it&#39;s almost enough, don&#39;t take it seriously. But students said the driver did not follow the rules. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After experiencing the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, people at that time generally had little sense of rules. The awareness of rules among law students is refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are Chinese political and legal Did the first batch of PhD students recruited by the university receive &quot;special preferential treatment&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The school gave me and my fellow seniors Zheng Qin and Huai Xiaofeng a scholarship. We bought a tape recorder and let us learn foreign languages. At that time, cassette recorders were very expensive, costing more than 400 yuan each. The second batch of doctoral students will not be issued. The management attaches great importance to us, but they use too much force. Maybe they don’t know what kind of learning conditions they should provide to doctoral students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The language I study is English. The school thinks that a doctorate is a higher level than a master&#39;s degree. It is not appropriate to take classes with master&#39;s students, and it is difficult to be alone. Give us foreign language classes. So I was asked to attend a training class in Changchun to learn foreign languages, and the expenses were reimbursed. Training courses are very expensive, with foreign teachers attending classes and students staying in hotels. When you return to school, you don’t need to take another exam. A training certificate will count as passing the foreign language class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The 1980s , the doctoral training system is still in the exploratory stage. You are Mr. Zhang Jinfan’s “open disciple”. How did he guide the doctor? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, China University of Political Science and Law’s curriculum, teaching methods, and class hours for doctoral students There are no clear regulations on requirements, staged assessments, etc. The entire training process is basically the responsibility of the instructor himself. It is somewhat similar to the master-apprenticeship system in traditional Chinese society where a master leads an apprentice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When we were studying, Mr. Zhang was the vice president and dean of the graduate school. His schedule was very full, but lunch time was fixed. We proposed that we let him come to our dormitory at noon on weekdays, use an electric cup to cook a cup of noodles for him, beat an egg, and teach him while eating. The four masters and apprentices closed the door, whispered, cooked noodles, and talked about academics, having fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although I majored in legal history for my master&#39;s degree, I did not receive systematic legal training during my undergraduate period, and the basic theories of law are relatively lacking. Mr. Zhang taught students in accordance with their aptitude and believed that I should pay attention to the construction of the legal knowledge system and allowed me to audit civil law, criminal law, procedural law and other courses for master students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, everyone from our tutors to the graduate school encouraged us to take full advantage of the concentration of academic talents in Beijing. We went to Peking University, Renmin University, Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other institutions to take courses, participate in discussions, and visit famous teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zhu Yong&#39;s doctorate certificate, number is &quot;Bo 87001&quot;.

At that time, basic research was relatively weak, many studies were not conducted, and the selected topics were not easy to repeat. In this case, it is not difficult to select the topic for my thesis. The key is to find first-hand information, and it will be easy to produce results. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While studying for a master&#39;s degree at Anhui University, the school gave the master&#39;s degree a thesis investigation fee of 300 yuan. It took me almost two months to travel to more than a dozen provinces. My main task was to check the family laws and regulations recorded in the genealogies of various places. At that time, in the southern provinces, genealogies were managed not primarily as books but as cultural relics. Therefore, genealogies are mostly stored in museums. Most of the genealogies from various places have been in existence for 100 to 300 years. The paper is yellowed and covered with insect holes. You have to read it carefully, and it will break easily if you are not careful. None of this raw material has been used before. In two months, I hand-copied thousands of cards about family laws and clan rules in museums in more than a dozen provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was studying for my Ph.D., I spent a lot of time consulting in the ancient book library of the Beijing Library located in the Imperial College and the First Historical Archives of China located in the Xihua Gate of the Forbidden City. material. At that time, various academic institutions were very friendly to students looking for information. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Talk about academics&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before 1980, three international seminars on the history of Chinese legal system were held in the world, but mainland China was not invited in any of them.

From the perspective of academic responsibility, Mr. Wang hopes that we will work hard to change the status quo and firmly place the center of Chinese legal history research in China&#39;s local academic community. We were deeply touched by the words of Mr. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There is a voice that believes that compared with departmental law, legal history has less say in reality. However, some scholars believe that true history must contribute to reality and history must participate in the social process. What are your thoughts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Concerning historical research, diversity in purposes and methods should be allowed. You can focus on connecting with reality, or you can focus on academics themselves. I have seen that some doctoral students always think about how to directly guide reality when deciding on a thesis topic. I encourage students’ innovation, but I also tell them that a scholar’s ​​task is to do academic work first and clarify academic issues. The formulation and implementation of ancient laws had specific background conditions in ancient society. The connection with reality must be appropriate and logical, and cannot be too far-fetched. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I have a similar experience myself. When a publication requests a manuscript, I send it in, and the editor sends back expert review comments. Experts suggested that I should base my article on the views I proposed and make some connections with contemporary social reality. I replied to the editor and said that my interest lies in talking about academics and history. The editor was very understanding and accepted my comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Scholars may be able to distinguish There are two types of people, one is doing pure learning in an ivory tower, and the other is caring about reality. Should you be the former? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the value of a scholar lies in the academic itself. My research is generally not directly related to connected with reality. We can sort out the development process of legal systems and legal theories in Chinese history in detail, and put forward our own opinions on their laws, characteristics, and functions. If we can reproduce their true state and show their true role in the process of national management and social governance, our academic goal will be accomplished. As for whether this research result can play a role in contemporary national governance and rule of law construction, I believe readers are smart enough to sort through it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Research in the humanities is often related to scholars’ real-life encounters and life experiences, and is very personal.

Even if they join the queue for 4 years, the material conditions are poor and the labor intensity is high. But during those 4 years, there were no unpleasant feelings. In current terms, I am basically satisfied with the status quo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From 1977 to 1987, I studied continuously for 10 years and experienced three options: undergraduate, master&#39;s and doctoral examinations. These three road choices were not too difficult. If it was too difficult, you might have backed down at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Self-evaluation, my academic research is not very critical and not creative enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;From &quot;master-apprentice system&quot; to &quot;teacher-student system&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How has the current graduate education changed compared to the era when you were studying? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Zhu Yong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When we were studying, it was a more typical &quot;master-apprentice system&quot;. It is similar to the way a master leads an apprentice in a traditional social handicraft workshop. It is characterized by personalized guidance and comprehensive training. Mr. Zhang can give us personalized guidance and comprehensive training according to his own positioning and expectations for young scholars. The content of guidance varies from person to person and students are taught in accordance with their aptitude. At the same time, we pay attention to comprehensive training. Mr. Xiang gives us detailed guidance in all aspects of academic research, including reading lists, thesis topic selection, data screening, condensation of ideas, thesis structure, and written expression. It also covers many aspects of social interaction and dealing with people outside of academia. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;master-apprentice&quot; training method is more conducive to teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, but it cannot solve the problem of large-scale education. After the expansion of postgraduate enrollment, the &quot;teacher-student system&quot; in which teachers lead students was gradually developed and improved. Its characteristic is that it pays more attention to standardized training and digital management in the education process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;With Mr. Zhang You have similar experiences. Since 2001, you have served as the vice president and dean of the graduate school of China University of Political Science and Law for nearly 14 years.

For example, whether they are doctoral students or master&#39;s students, during the six-semester training process, there are unified regulations in the training plan on which books students should read, which classes they should listen to, and which teaching links they must complete. How many credits should a doctoral student complete, how many courses should be taken, how many reading reports, term papers, and academic papers should be submitted, how many days of social practice should be carried out, how many academic papers should be formally published in journals of what level, and the number of dissertations should reach tens of thousands. Words, etc., all have clear numerical regulations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The advantage of standardized training and digital management is that the training results can be evaluated and the training process can be monitored, especially those that can effectively adapt to the large-scale education of graduate students.

More than one doctoral student. In the training process of doctoral students, some &quot;master-apprenticeship&quot; habits are retained to a certain extent. The students I recruit have undergraduate and master&#39;s degree education backgrounds in law, history, and Chinese. To train them, in addition to completing quantitative prescribed actions, it is necessary to make up for the missing knowledge structure. Some students have good reading and research abilities, but lack social interaction. For these students, their shortcomings also need to be addressed in a targeted manner. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Today’s students are very anxious, introverted, and worried about finding an ideal job.

Personal career development requires both good self-quality and suitable external opportunities. There is no need to say more about the cultivation and improvement of self-quality. How to face external opportunities, based on my own experience and understanding of life, I have given advice to my students: be proactive and be content with the situation. When planning your career blueprint, if you face multiple opportunities, you should be proactive, design the best plan, and strive for the best choice. When there are few opportunities to choose and it is very difficult to change the status quo, you should cherish the present and take things as they come. In different positions, if you do your job well, you can also show your talents and achieve success. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[预防糖尿病，摆脱“甜蜜负担”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260553]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Today is the annual &quot;World Diabetes Day&quot;.

There is a word &quot;bitter summer&quot; in Japanese that specifically describes the scorching summer heat. Even if you cannot fully understand its original meaning, the single Chinese word &quot;bitter&quot; can already convey the meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/WsZh4SZI60RS60TPLMVRINpXpRxZuFCDHCT7edrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258160&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the Tokyo Imperial Palace running route, there are facilities designed to cool down runners. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time I came to Japan was in 2019. If the epidemic has changed anything, I hate it the most. Runners have started running, and running on the streets of Tokyo is itself a mark of the epidemic. At the height of the epidemic, all sports venues in Beijing were closed. I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore, so I ordered my first pair of running shoes online and started running along the empty streets. From barely finishing 3 kilometers, to the joy of running 5 kilometers for the first time, to completing 10 kilometers and half marathon, although it may not be worth mentioning among the huge running community, it is a small achievement for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Running also gives me a new perspective on a place. Familiar places have new experiences because of running. In turn, this sense of strangeness also makes every small &quot;tribulation&quot; more enjoyable. Easier to get through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2ZPsf6DyySDGykcwiy80TWWk3Yxmn3x8xHSMee12.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2ZPsf6DyySDGykcwiy80TWWk3Yxmn3x8xHSMee12.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258158&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Scenery of the Imperial Palace Running Route&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been to Tokyo a lot times, but I did some homework before coming this time and knew that the running route around the Imperial Palace is the most famous; the writer Haruki Murakami prefers to practice around the Meiji Shrine Outer Garden. He wrote in &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot; &quot;Specially mentioned in the book; if you want to run at a higher pace, or complete interval running training Cross-intensity running exercises can help improve runners&#39; ability to resist lactic acid)&lt;/span>;, you can go to the Yoyogi Park track and field to try your skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing my homework, I also learned that Tokyo has complete supporting facilities for runners. Near the most popular route around the Imperial Palace, there are several hotels where runners can store bags, bathe, and change clothes. The service station only charges a fee equivalent to 30 to 40 yuan, and you can also rent sportswear, running shoes, running pockets and other equipment. You have decided to experience it before setting off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day after arriving in Tokyo, I woke up very early and took the subway to a runner service station I had found in advance. This service station is opened together with a restaurant. Since the charges are not high, runner service stations usually adopt a mixed operation method, allowing runners to stay for breakfast, or the service station is opened directly in the store of a famous sports brand. , increasing customer sources and boosting sales are all methods that service station operators have come up with after years of operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This service station has simple decoration, but it is clean and practical in Japanese style. The girl at the front desk is not good at English and does not have any English instructions at hand. It can be seen that the guests here are mainly Japanese locals and rarely receive tourists. After a few signs, it was not difficult to understand my purpose. I paid, received the keys and towels, and the rest was completely self-help. Later, the decoration of another service station I went to was obviously more upscale. The charges were similar, and both could apply for a monthly card. The price of the monthly card was basically the price of three single purchases, which was very cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second service station also cooperates with sports brands. There is a wall of Mizuno running shoes of different shoe sizes and a wall of Salomon racing road running shoes. Mizuno&#39;s running shoes are free to use, while Salomon&#39;s shoes are more expensive. The domestic price is 2,000 yuan, which only costs 100 yen. (About 5 yuan)&lt;/span>;You can try it out. Because of the good experience, I almost thought of buying a pair because of the 100 yen trial. It seems that this trial is indeed a clever sales method, and the sales scenario is very precise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/iGpztH37ua2aHx1xilIUbZz9bAhhYy153MCFgnXv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/iGpztH37ua2aHx1xilIUbZz9bAhhYy153MCFgnXv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258155&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Runner Service Station Locker Room&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Route around the Imperial Palace It is indeed very popular.

Because Japan drives on the left and sidewalks are not very wide, everyone follows the rule of running counterclockwise to leave space for walkers. At first I thought it was out of consciousness, but later I learned that after the Imperial Palace route became very popular in 2004, more and more people were running. In order to regulate order, the government required that runners run counterclockwise in 2007. Others leave a certain way. If you violate the rules, you will probably be stopped by the guards around the Imperial Palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only by experiencing this route yourself will you know why it is the number one running route in Tokyo. In fact, it is also a helpless move. As an international city with a dense population and a high price of land, running conditions in the core area of ​​Tokyo are really limited. The dense road network leads to many traffic lights. The streets are narrow and even the greening is quite restrained. It is difficult to see rows of big trees. Therefore, the moat and dense vegetation around the Imperial Palace, as well as the five-kilometer &quot;runway&quot; that goes around the city without interruption, have become the best choice for Tokyoites who love running. The Ring Imperial Palace Line also has the advantage of being relatively smooth and convenient for public transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/LoLsuTivS9Yr2bvvMsRNibl8gthFsXpuUN5nu5eZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/LoLsuTivS9Yr2bvvMsRNibl8gthFsXpuUN5nu5eZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258159&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Private running group on the route around the Imperial Palace&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And The second route I chose to run on the same day was the loop around the Meiji Shrine outer garden mentioned by Haruki Murakami. “I have been used to running on this track for many years, and even the details are engraved in my mind. There are pits and depressions everywhere.” I remember everything clearly.&quot; Meiji Jingu Shrine is not far from the Imperial Palace. The map at the runner service station indicates that you can connect the two routes for a run. The total length is almost 10 kilometers, which is the favorite distance for many advanced runners. The route of Meiji Jingu Outer Garden has tall trees, denser green shade and cleaner scenery. It was here that Haruki Murakami met famous marathon runners preparing for the Olympics, rising long-distance running stars who died in traffic accidents, and beautiful women who smiled and greeted each other every day but never talked to each other. He also complained that there were too many traffic lights on this route, but luckily he could touch them. It was a bit of a relief to see all kinds of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/8M8ZEgN3d5lrAn4OIXvgwW4UjVh9iglaWlJzM1nF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/8M8ZEgN3d5lrAn4OIXvgwW4UjVh9iglaWlJzM1nF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258157&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Writer Haruki Murakami’s favorite route to Meiji Jingu Gaien&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From historical opportunity to Hakone Ekiden&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I am running along the path of a writer, but there is no inspiration. The writer is also very honest, saying that most of his thoughts are wandering while running, and he even treats himself as a running machine without emotions. There are many well-known writers in the world, and there are even more tenacious runners, but Haruki Murakami seems to be the only one who has both and is familiar to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a reason why Japan has such a well-known writer who loves running. Long-distance running is a national sport in Japan. The promotion and development of long-distance running for hundreds of years has allowed Japanese runners to cover all age groups, with a large base and high level. It can be compared to table tennis in China or basketball in the United States. Among the six major marathons in the world, the Tokyo Marathon is known as an event with more &quot;private subsidies&quot; than &quot;official subsidies&quot;. People spontaneously provide free supplies to the participants along the way. The number is actually more than the supply stations prepared by the event organizer. The enthusiasm of Tokyoites is also related to the superior strength of local athletes. Several local athletes often break the 2 hours and 10 minutes mark. This result is on par with the world&#39;s top East African athletes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of marathon events in China has been in full swing in the past ten years. If you often browse the event registration app, you can find places to participate every month. Sometimes you just feel overwhelmed. If there is any gap between domestic marathon events and the world&#39;s &quot;Big Six&quot;, it is actually more at the cultural level, and there is no other way to form a culture but time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Thomas Havens, an American Japanese scholar, Japan sent two runners to participate in the marathon event at the Stockholm Olympic Games in 1912, which can be called the starting point of the marathon in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Japanese government at that time had limited financial resources and could only select two athletes to participate in the Olympics. The marathon is very similar to the long-distance running events that were held sporadically in the late Edo period. The purpose of these events was to &quot;improve the physical fitness of the people&quot; and to show that the Japanese could gain their own status in similar competitions in the West. This driving force, which combines national pride, proof of modernity, and an attitude of active participation in international competition, is the legacy of the Meiji Restoration of the same period. A famous example is a lively 12-hour running endurance race held in 1901 on the narrow track around Tokyo&#39;s Shinobazu Pond, which attracted more than a hundred competitors, 15 of whom completed 71 laps&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(103.6 kilometers)&lt;/span>;. Therefore, one of the last two Japanese athletes to participate in the 1912 Olympic Games was a marathon runner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the 1920s and 1930s, the Japanese were already among the fastest marathon runners in the world. After World War II, after decades of recuperation, from the 1960s to the 1980s, Japanese marathon runners returned to a dominant position in the world. In 1966, 15 of the top 17 results in the world rankings were created by Japanese male runners. By the 1990s, Japanese female marathon runners began to dominate the competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/eGqKlFUPUY3mB92p0O1ho9fWKjEsLzTttbo2qd38.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/eGqKlFUPUY3mB92p0O1ho9fWKjEsLzTttbo2qd38.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258156&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Promotional materials about various events and clubs in the runner service station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;For a hundred years, Japan has been able to continue to dominate the world marathon field because of its large reserve of high-level private athletes. These high-level Japanese athletes have a more important platform for private events than the Olympic Games - Hakone Ekiden. The full name of Hakone Ekiden is &quot;Tokyo-Hakone Round-trip University Ekiden Race&quot;, which is a round trip between Tokyo and Hakone in the form of a half-marathon relay, with a total length of 217 kilometers and a total of ten stages. The units are based on each university. From the perspective of ratings, it is not an exaggeration to say that Hakone Ekiden is equivalent to the Japanese Spring Festival Gala. Since Nippon Television broadcast the entire Hakone Ekiden live in 1987, the ratings have remained at around 25%. You have to know that the entire game lasts for 12 hours. The ratings of China CCTV Spring Festival Gala in recent years have been just over 20%. Hakone Ekiden is arranged a few days before the New Year and is a great show that Japanese people can enjoy during the New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the TV series of the same name as the novel &quot;Strong Wind&quot; was released in Japan. This TV series is set in Hakone Ekiden and tells a passionate sports story about an unknown university long-distance running team that went through devilish training and counterattacked in the competition. , making more people aware of this Japanese sports event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The founder of Hakone Ekiden is the aforementioned Kanakuri Shizo, one of the marathon runners Japan sent to participate in the Stockholm Olympics. Kanakuri Shisan&#39;s first marathon Olympic trip was a tragedy. At that time, Japan used the whole country to send him and another sprinter to the Olympic Games. The travel expenses for each of the two athletes were equivalent to the thirty-six years of the prestigious Waseda University. tuition fees. However, the expectations of the people across the country and the fatigue of the journey overwhelmed him. The heat on the day of the competition was extremely hot. One Portuguese athlete even fell to the ground and died. Kanali No. 3 also lost consciousness during the journey and was carried home by local farmers. When he woke up, he was After the game the next day. He later participated in two Olympic Games, with his best result being 16th. Looking back now, the return on the cost of tuition fees at prestigious universities in the past thirty-six years has been too generous, and Kanakuri Shisan has become a leader in the development of marathons in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1920, the first Hakone Ekiden was held between four universities including Waseda University and Meiji University. Except for the suspension during the two world wars, 99 sessions have been held so far. This competition will be the first in 2024 centenary event. Hakone Ekiden has provided a large number of world-class athletes for Japanese marathons. Among them, Osako Kei, the most familiar to Chinese running enthusiasts, has captured a large number of fans because of his handsome appearance and elegant running posture. He was once a student at Waseda University in Hakone Ekiden. An elite runner who still holds the domestic marathon record in Japan. Many of the current college runners are well-known celebrities. People take the train and rush to the viewing point in advance like chasing stars, waiting for several hours in the cold wind of the New Year. There will be tens of thousands of spectators waiting at the finish line, saying &quot;congratulations&quot; and &quot; &quot;Thank you for your hard work&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re already great&quot;. As the players passed the finish line one by one, such shouts came one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as you have a slight idea of ​​marathon results, browsing the Hakone Ekiden stage results every year is simply staggering, especially in 2023, when many long-standing records for stages were broken. Someone asked on &quot;Zhihu&quot; if the ten best amateur long-distance runners in China were selected to form a team, and it was not limited to college students, would they be able to enter the top ten of Hakone Ekiden? The answer is regrettable. After converting the same distance Afterwards, this team could only finish 15th in Hakone Ekiden that same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, to quote a data, from November 23 to 25, 2012, a total of six full marathons were held across Japan. A total of 77,772 runners completed the race. The completion rate in five of the six races exceeded 90 %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/SncyVY9nj9L27yumGNuBesGoiIbrQ7FFHFrVsbGy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/SncyVY9nj9L27yumGNuBesGoiIbrQ7FFHFrVsbGy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258161&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;People preparing for activities in front of the runner service station&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Chen Xi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;&lt;strong>;Government and Business&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Conspiracy”, Beginning with Yasuhiro Nakasone&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Long distance running is boring and grueling, 1990 The &quot;Ma Jiajun&quot;, which led the domestic middle and long-distance running events in the 1990s, recruited mostly team members from ordinary families in small and medium-sized cities. They relied on hard work, the ability to endure hardship, and won a place in society through sports performance. But marathon has been an elite sport in Japan since its beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hakone Ekiden first unfolded among four prestigious universities including Waseda University. As part of the rise of the nation and nationalism, these elite college students became the main force. This gene has been running through the development of Japanese marathon for nearly a hundred years. To this day, Japan&#39;s famous universities are still sending young people to the marathon. After graduation, these college students usually enter well-known Japanese companies and join professional runners sponsored by the companies. The team represents the company in various competitions at home and abroad to win glory for the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned Osako Jie joined the Nissin Industrial Running Group after graduating from Waseda University. However, joining a corporate running team means that corporate interests come first. Companies may even require athletes to sacrifice preparation time for international competitions such as the Olympics and give priority to domestic competitions in Japan. Therefore, many top athletes, including Osako Kei, ultimately chose to withdraw from corporate running groups in order to dominate their sports careers. After Kei Osako quit Nissin Industries and joined the Oregon Project sponsored by Nike, there were still many voices in Japanese society calling him a &quot;traitor&quot;. However, as he achieved excellent results in the international arena, these criticisms have become past tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the process of the Japanese marathon movement from state dominance to market dominance, one person cannot be avoided - former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Yasuhiro Nakasone is a highly controversial figure both for China and Japan. He once participated in the war of aggression against China as an officer. However, in the early days of China&#39;s reform and opening up, he strongly urged Japan to provide financial guarantees for China&#39;s export trade at that time. Without Japan guarantee, it would be even more difficult to obtain international loan financing given China&#39;s economic conditions at the time. He visited the Yasukuni Shrine and later apologized for Japan&#39;s war of aggression against China. But if you dig deeper into the core of his character, you will find that it all stems from his pragmatism. He once said: &quot;When asked what you did in post-war democracy, I can answer that I worked desperately to develop political methods in line with the era of mass democracy, and the patent for its secrets belongs to me.&quot; As a way to cater to public opinion He is a master of Japan. During his tenure as prime minister, he completed the &quot;division and nationalization of Japan&#39;s national railways&quot;. He dismantled Japan&#39;s national railways, which were once part of Japan&#39;s state monopoly, and operated them in a corporatized manner. Nowadays, you often see &quot;JR&quot; when traveling to Japan. &quot;East Japan&quot;, &quot;JR West&quot;, &quot;JR Hokkaido&quot;, etc. are all companies spun off from Japan National Railways. According to Nakasone Yasuhiro&#39;s pragmatism, these were all part of his efforts to cater to public opinion. As he said, Japan was already in an era of mass democracy at that time, and he pushed for this to happen faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave of privatization, the sports industry that was originally dominated by the Japanese state has gradually been handed over to the market. In the 1970s, the Japan Amateur Sports Association (JASA), which once believed that business would corrode the spirit of sports, began to allow Olympic athletes to appear in television advertisements, and the fees received were divided between the athletes&#39; companies and JASA. Advertising giant Dentsu organized a Japan Go campaign in 1979 to support the following year&#39;s Moscow Olympics. This kind of sponsorship of sports events by big companies became more popular in the 1980s, and athletes&#39; incomes also increased. After the Japanese real estate bubble burst in 1991, government finances were further tightened, and the marketization of sports was accelerated. To this end, the Japanese government also formulated a series of tax incentive policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Against this series of historical backgrounds, the marathon has been a sports event that Japan hopes to have an impact on the world since 1912. After a hundred years of development, it has gradually completed commercialization. This is also the trend and trend of world sports development: attracting the interest and social capital of the whole people through commercial methods, and selecting top talents on the basis of mass sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government defeated the business consortium with vested interests in the elite marathon event, and also calmed the Tokyo Police Department’s concerns that the marathon would greatly disrupt urban order. The first Tokyo Tokyo Olympics was funded by the government. Marathon. Now, the Tokyo Marathon is one of the six major international marathon events in the world. You must know that the Boston Marathon, one of the &quot;big six&quot;, started in 1897. The Tokyo Marathon has brought huge influence and commercial benefits to the city &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (more than 150 million U.S. dollars per year)&lt;/span>; and has become a competition for governments across Japan. The objects of imitation, Osaka Marathon, Kobe Marathon, Yokohama Marathon, and Hokkaido Marathon, have now become events with many domestic and foreign participants, and each time you need to draw lots to register. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;622&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/fiLBn71yrJJIKEVF2OVbgeeWHlXkdpxRdCc4gfza.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258162&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Have an aerobic jog in Tokyo&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course , a huge successful conspiracy between government and business must have provided some kind of social necessity. During the &quot;lost thirty years&quot; of Japan&#39;s economy, long-distance running became a way to inspire the national spirit and an antidote to spiritual dilemmas. This antidote not only acts on the body, producing pleasant dopamine and endorphins, building a healthy body that can cope with the high intensity of modern life, but it also acts on the mind, dealing with the emptiness that comes after the hardships of life with great material prosperity and lack. Just like Haruki Murakami&#39;s favorite saying: Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. He said, &quot;Really valuable things can often be obtained through very inefficient operations. Even if this is an illusory behavior, it is by no means a stupid behavior. I think so as a practical feeling as a rule of thumb.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In short, everyone who loves running can refer to the epitaph designed by Haruki Murakami for himself: &quot;He at least ran to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[FF三季度卖车3辆，收入55.1万美元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260579]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 14, Faraday Futere (FF) released its third quarter financial report for 2023. During the reporting period, FF achieved revenue generation for the first time in the company&#39;s history, with total revenue of approximately US$551,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial report stated that FF&#39;s vehicle sales revenue includes revenue related to new car delivery, as well as revenue from certain other functions and services, including home chargers, charger installation, all-weather roadside assistance, software updates (&quot;OTA&quot;) ), Internet connection and destination fees (offset by certain co-creation fees). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the third quarter, FF delivered a total of 3 vehicles. That translates to roughly $183,600 in revenue per vehicle. The FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance previously disclosed by FF is priced at approximately US$309,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for FF, starting to generate revenue is already a new milestone.

Of this amount, $10.4 million was depreciation on tools and equipment, and most of the remainder was manufacturing overhead, followed by labor and material costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;FF explained that the higher cost of sales is due to the natural inefficiencies of early vehicle production - that is, the higher cost of parts caused by initial manufacturing inefficiencies and low output. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, FF was still in the red in the third quarter, with a net loss of approximately US$78 million, which was narrower than the net loss of US$119 million in the same period last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of cash flow, in the first three quarters of this year, FF&#39;s operating activities generated net cash outflows of US$240 million, compared with US$355 million in the same period last year; capital expenditures were US$10.8 million, compared with US$112 million in the same period last year; financing activities The net cash inflow generated was US$237.6 million, while the net cash outflow from financing activities in the same period last year was US$40.9 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the third quarter, FF raised a total of US$61.8 million through convertible notes, equity line of credit (ELOC) and ATM financing. As of September 30, 2023, FF&#39;s cash balance was $8.567 million, including $1.853 million in restricted cash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the future, FF said that the company plans to start the third phase of delivery at the end of the first quarter of 2024, that is, to fully deliver vehicles to users. According to the current factory improvement and ramp-up plan, FF&#39;s goal next year is to achieve a production of approximately 1,000 vehicles, but FF also admitted that this is subject to obtaining the required capital, the capacity and stability of the supply chain, and obtaining the necessary licenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 17:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[丢下铁饭碗，出走围城丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260559]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-14 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;November 11, 2023, Kunming, as the national examination and postgraduate entrance examination are approaching, candidates have a weekend Come to Yunnan Provincial Library for review.

One works in a community in Beijing, with a monthly salary of more than 8,000 yuan, and has a Beijing household registration; the other stayed in Shandong and went to the CPPCC unit, which is also within the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a former student from Shandong, in the first twenty years of my life, there was a saying that was repeatedly emphasized in my family, &quot;Knowledge changes destiny.&quot; How to understand? I think if there are simulation games for raising children, then my parents’ goal must be for their children to enter a good university and then choose one of the two good jobs of teachers and civil servants. Unfortunately, reality is biased. When he learned that I was not admitted to a major such as administration in the college entrance examination, my dad clearly expressed his disappointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time, the pursuit of the system and the iron rice bowl has been one of the labels for us Shandong people. Until recent years, young people across the country have People also spontaneously fall in love with taking public exams and taking exams for editors. Stability is the most mentioned advantage of this job. The pseudonym in the report is Meng Cheng, a 35-year-old returnee man who joined the editor and then resigned to study for a PhD. This is how he was attracted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The starting point of the story is as usual. He was worried that the employment environment would require more and more academic qualifications. Between studying for a Ph.D. and finding a job, Meng Cheng chose the latter and went smoothly. Obtained a career establishment in a poor county in Guangxi. Unfortunately, this job that I started with great expectations was described as a &quot;siege&quot; when I left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department wrote in the post, it was called Tourism Development Center. I was quite happy and thought I could participate in tourism projects.&quot; On the day of joining the job, Meng Cheng learned that &quot;separation of staff and staff&quot; was implemented in talent introduction, and he was actually assigned to the general office. &quot;Because when you are recruited, you must be assigned an establishment, so the Organization Department collected some empty establishments from the units.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the general office, one of Meng Cheng’s most feared tasks is organizing documents. “For example, if the municipal level publishes a document on the tourism market rectification plan, we will If you want to produce a county-level document, you can copy part of the city-level document, but you can&#39;t copy it all. You have to read it carefully.&quot; From writing to finalizing, it is common to spend a day and a half digging for a few words. What troubles him even more is that for things like writing documents, there is no clear operational process. “A lot of times it’s just casual remarks from the leader.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is still a lot of suffering in the besieged city. During the interview, we met a girl who had been working in the system for five years through talent introduction. The idea of ​​resigning had been lingering in her mind for more than three years, although she did not appear in the manuscript in the end. But I think her summary of the reasons for her resignation should represent the voice of the vast majority of people who want to leave the system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Recent master&#39;s degree graduates should be graded as a fourth-level chief clerk, but my unit assigned me a first-grade chief clerk until now. Join me in introducing Most of the students who came here were appointed as fourth-level chief clerks, and this year they were promoted to third-level chief clerks, which made me feel very unbalanced. On the other hand, the work in the system is more service-oriented and coordination-oriented, and the professional basics There is no use, no sense of gain, and no creativity. Just listen to your superiors and just be an obedient person. Over time, you will no longer be able to think independently. In addition, there is a serious age gap among employees, and the phenomenon of seniority is serious, and hard work is difficult. In the past two years, senior comrades have been considered first for promotions, and most of the energy has been spent on how to push out the work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent times, I have seen my close friends around me I couldn’t find a job everywhere, and I did a lot of job-related topics. I have been thinking that since childhood, the education we have received has cultivated individuals to become intellectually rich through a simple stimulus-reward mechanism. , but rarely teaches us how to grow into a complete self, and what to do next when the school education a person can receive comes to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, at the point of graduating from undergraduate or graduate school, some people throw themselves into society hastily, doing jobs they don’t understand or even dislike. Not getting affirmation, they repeatedly question their personal value; others turn around and hide in school, delaying the time to make a decision. These are all detours taken by talents who are introduced to the county and then leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Meng Cheng&#39;s view, leaving the system means leaving the siege, but is there a siege outside the siege? When can the layers of walls be demolished? Losing money may be a more complex social issue than personal choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
