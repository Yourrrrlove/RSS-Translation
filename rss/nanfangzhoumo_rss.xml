Qi Xiangyu and Shang Xiaoyu won the first and fourth place respectively in the individual qualifying competition. Unfortunately, Shang Xiaoyu stopped in the top eight. Liu Qingyi and Zeng Yingying successfully advanced to the semi-finals. Zeng Yingying lost to Japanese player Ayumi Fukushima (2023 World Breakdancing Championship Champion) in the bronze medal match and finished fourth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this gold medal, Liu Qingyi qualified to participate in the break dance event of the Paris Olympics. At the post-match press conference, she said she was very happy, &quot;Thanks to my coaching team and my motherland for giving me this opportunity, and to myself for persevering.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the first batch of national teams such as Liu Qingyi and Qi Xiangyu For the team members, they have witnessed the transformation of break dancing from folk subculture to the highest sporting event. Their original intention of practicing break dancing may not be for honor, but their efforts will eventually be lived up to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/ppzyBbipfV265K5IZiwt4E3xCSbROxKcltM4nQSf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;649&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/ppzyBbipfV265K5IZiwt4E3xCSbROxKcltM4nQSf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, Chinese player Qi Xiangyu was in the bronze medal match. He defeated Japanese player Isshin Hisikawa 2-1 and won the third place &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From civilian to palace&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before being included in sporting events, breakdancing, a dance that originated in the New York neighborhoods of the 1970s, had always been popular among young people. It not only requires a certain degree of skill, but also integrates many action elements from Brazilian war dance, gymnastics and Chinese martial arts. It can also strongly express personal style and is highly musical and ornamental. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The International Olympic Organizing Committee has taken a fancy to the influence of break dancing. The ratings on the first day of the official events of the Rio Olympics in 2016 dropped by about 28% compared with the London Olympics. The continued sluggish ratings forced the International Olympic Organizing Committee to turn its attention to the broad group of young people and pay attention to their popular preferences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 7, 2020, the Executive Committee of the International Olympic Committee held a meeting and agreed to add four major events including breakdancing, skateboarding, surfing, and rock climbing to the 2024 Paris Olympics. The breakdancing event falls under the &quot; sport dancing&quot;. Nine days later, the Olympic Council of Asia announced that breakdancing would become an official competition event at the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movements of break dancing can be divided into 4 parts, rock steps, leg movements, air freezes and overall movement. Compared with other hip-hop forms, the advantage of break dancing as a sporting event is that a large number of moves can be measured and scored using standards. However, according to the rules customized by the World DanceSport Federation, judges will not only pay attention to the skill and diversity of the movements, but also the integrity, musicality and even personality of the performance as the judging criteria. Movements that only have difficulty and technique will not receive high scores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the four members of the Chinese team participating in the Asian Games, the only one with martial arts skills is 18-year-old Qi Xiangyu. He started practicing martial arts with his father when he was 5 and a half years old, and officially started hip-hop dancing at the age of 8 and a half. In terms of movements, Qi Xiangyu will repeatedly practice difficult movements, such as the Thomas Pivot - this movement requires supporting the ground with both hands, and using waist strength and inertia to drive the legs to swing. The 9-year-old Qi Xiangyu practices 200 times a day, which is a full exercise It takes half a year to become proficient. In terms of music, Qi Xiangyu will also understand it repeatedly. His father Qi Liying said, &quot;I can&#39;t teach him music. He will listen to a song until he understands the melody and emotion thoroughly.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Qi Xiangyu first came into contact with break dancing, Chinese street dance was still a folk subculture. In 2018, two variety shows &quot;This!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s Street Dance&quot; and &quot;Hot Blood Street Dance Company&quot; brought street dance into the public eye. When break dancing entered the Olympics and Asia, the project moved from the folk to the palace and was recognized by mainstream culture. Learners, practitioners and training institutions sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The &quot;China Hip-Hop Industry Research and Development Report&quot; released in 2023 shows that there are currently nearly 3 million hip-hop practitioners nationwide, there are over 10,000 hip-hop training institutions, and more than 10 million people across the country choose to learn hip-hop every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese National Breakdancing Team was born through a selection competition on January 8, 2023. There are 4 male and female players each. The 17-year-old girl Liu Qingyi was selected with her rich, diverse and explosive dance. During her teenage years, dance practice was lonely and full of controversy. There were few female hip-hop dancers in China, and she was the only girl in the club. She was once considered by her friends and relatives as not doing her job properly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qingyi&#39;s attitude is &quot;less talk, more action&quot; and &quot;prove everything with strength.&quot; The gold medal in breakdancing&#39;s Asian Games debut is the best response to all the praise and criticism in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/BzTpgRXjGw6zyQaHnXD2JJgseJvx5hTRoM5P4LuW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/BzTpgRXjGw6zyQaHnXD2JJgseJvx5hTRoM5P4LuW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253416&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, Chinese player Zeng Yingying competed in the bronze medal match of the women&#39;s break dance event. She lost to Japanese player Ayumi Fukushima 0-3 and finished fourth &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; &quot;The stage is my life&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have just finished competing in the World Championships and preparing for the Asian Games, which is a physical and psychological challenge for me.&quot; Recently, two major international competitions in break dancing Held in succession: From September 23 to 24, Liu Qingyi participated in the 2023 World Breakdancing Championships in Leuven, Belgium, and immediately started preparations for the Asian Games after returning to China. The intense preparation experience made her feel the limits of her body and mind, but she persevered. Liu Qingyi unfortunately stopped in the quarterfinals at the World Championships. Half a month later, she reached the top of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to break dancing, the young Liu Qingyi never thought of giving up, &quot;I am the kind of person who will &#39;die&#39; when encountering problems. Since it is my choice, You have to do it to the end and do it well, and don’t give up when you encounter some problems. This is a ‘slap in the face’.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, 10-year-old Liu Qingyi saw a street dance performance on the street, which was so cool Her movements gave her a visual shock and &quot;felt very handsome&quot;, so she joined the hip-hop club. Liu Qingyi showed athletic talent in her early days, and just two months later she won the runner-up in a hip-hop competition. At that time, not only were there few female dancers, but due to physical conditions, they were generally weaker in terms of strength and technical difficulty. Liu Qingyi prefers more energetic movements, such as Thomas pirouettes, 360-degree spins, etc., &quot;I want to be different from others, and I like to meet challenges.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wanting to be different&quot; also made Liu Qingyi decide From amateur to professional athlete. In 2019, in order to prepare for the break dance competition of the National Games two years later, Liu Qingyi was selected as an alternate member of the Henan hip-hop team. Should you join the provincial team and say goodbye to your ordinary school career, or should you give up break dancing and apply for college normally? Liu Qingyi made a choice: &quot;In the end, I still feel that taking a professional path in hip-hop dance is an opportunity for me. I think there are many paths to take in life, and not everyone is the same.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/XGTNiGD3bCG6uHZ9t7GFvPXMUYyF3ClJyW9CMoZ5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;697&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/XGTNiGD3bCG6uHZ9t7GFvPXMUYyF3ClJyW9CMoZ5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253417&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text -align: center;&quot;>;On October 6, 2023, Chinese player Shang Xiaoyu (right) and Kazakhstan&#39;s Dolet Analbekuly competed in the men&#39;s round-robin group match&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the Henan Provincial Team, Liu Qingyi received more professional training and grew rapidly through large-scale events. The first international competition she participated in was the 2021 World Championships in Paris. She failed to advance to the quarterfinals, but she refused to admit defeat. &quot;Go back and practice hard and come again.&quot; In 2022, she began to make a name for herself around the world: breaking into the World Games He reached the semi-finals, won the championship in Outbreak and World Battle, two top events, became the first Chinese player to win the international break dance competition championship, and won the runner-up in the World Championship that year. Liu Qingyi used her strength to show the world the level of Chinese break dancing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My stage is my life.” Liu Qingyi believes that the most attractive thing about break dancing is that when she dances, no one can restrain her, “I can do what I want. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Independence and individuality, perhaps this is the reason why emerging sports such as break dancing have become popular. They represent the pursuit of a new generation of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 08 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[回顾近13年国庆档票房成绩单，2023年仅为2019年六成丨有数]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258267]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-08 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 08 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“雅思组合”蝉联亚运金牌，剑指巴黎奥运欲补遗憾]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258242]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-08 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/08/VZnJEmGbnPVkkQZsVnhsghW5cspqXy32xlLgoLs1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/VZnJEmGbnPVkkQZsVnhsghW5cspqXy3 2xlLgoLs1. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253363&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, the champion Chinese combination Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong (right) Group photo at the award ceremony&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Which event is the most stable for the Chinese badminton team?

The Badminton World Federation ranking points have exceeded an unprecedented 110,000. They are Zheng Siwei/Huang Yaqiong, known as the &quot;IELTS combination&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2017, the Chinese badminton team made adjustments and split the top two mixed doubles players Zheng Siwei/Chen Qingchen and Lu Kai/Huang Yaqiong into a new combination of Zheng Siwei/Huang Yaqiong. The two formed a team to compete in November 2017. In the first half of 2018, they broke into the top ten in the world and reached the top of the world in August of the same year. In the 2018 season, he won 9 mixed doubles championships, broke 4 world records in 5 months, and ranked first in the world with a huge points advantage. In 67 games in 2019, they were 59-8. In the past two years, the &quot;IELTS combination&quot; has won the World Championships championship, successively won the All England Open, Asian Games championship, year-end finals and other championships. With an undefeated record, it helped the Chinese team win the International Badminton Team Championship Su Diman Cup, becoming the most dominant mixed doubles combination in the Tokyo Olympic cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/F6yZl3IJeDDwpo94ZHEu1ys8uyvjJt2DVCOE9x5C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/F6yZl3IJeDDwpo94ZHEu1ys8uyvjJt2DVCOE9x5C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253360&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, in the badminton mixed doubles final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese combination Zheng Siwei (top) and Huang Yaqiong (bottom) defeated the Japanese combination Watanabe 2-0 Yongda and Higashino Arisa won the championship &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2022, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong will be paired up After regrouping, they won 7 consecutive season championships within 5 months, including the third world championship. After that, they won three championships in the second half of the year, including the Badminton World Tour Finals, and were awarded the &quot;Best Group of 2022&quot; award by the Badminton World Federation. The two set a record of 38 consecutive unbeaten games, with a winning rate of 96%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from the 2023 season, the old rivals of the &quot;IELTS combination&quot;, the Korean combination Seo Chenjae/Cai Yujing, have made rapid progress. When the two sides meet, it usually takes three games to determine the winner. In the last two matches (the 2023 World Badminton Championship final on August 27 and the 8-4 match at the China Badminton Open on September 8), they defeated the &quot;IELTS combination&quot; consecutively and became the latter&#39;s current extremely important opponent. In the badminton mixed doubles semi-finals of the 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games, the two pairs met again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past month, the &quot;IELTS combination&quot; encountered some controversy due to two consecutive losses. In the comments on the game video, you can often see fans questioning the two&#39;s decline in form. For the third time in two months, the result was particularly important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/eWEd6kb9faaQQU0jefLEgF8vUaSf4TvVJUn37bK6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/eWEd6kb9faaQQU0jefLEgF8vUaSf4TvVJUn37bK6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253365&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, the badminton mixed doubles final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the champion Chinese combination Zheng Siwei (first from left) and Huang Yaqiong (second from right) and the runner-up Japanese combination Yuta Watanabe (Second from left) and Arisa Higashino (first from right) shake hands and greet each other after the game &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 2021 From 2022 to 2022, the IELTS combination has experienced a more severe &quot;dark moment&quot;. The period before and after the Tokyo Olympics is also considered by the &quot;IELTS combination&quot; to be the most difficult stage in their mixed doubles career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year, Zheng Siwei is 24 years old and Huang Yaqiong is 27 years old. For athletes, their bodies are at their peak. During the Tokyo Olympics cycle, they won the championship in almost all mixed doubles competitions except the Olympic Games. They were high-spirited and pointed at the championship podium in Musashino Forest. However, it backfired as they lost to teammates Huang Dongping/Wang Yilu in the Olympic final and won the silver medal. After returning to China, they lost to the opponent again in the National Games final. The two took a break in the next Sudirman Cup, but after getting ready, they ushered in the second round of the 2021 World Championships (a first-round bye) and lost to the little-known Hong Kong combination Zhang Dezheng/Ng Yongrong, and were upset. For a while, the fans were talking a lot, unable to accept such a gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yaqiong said that she felt two different pressures before and after the Tokyo Olympics: before the game, she was anxious about not being able to train normally due to injuries to her partner, but she wanted to get good results in the Olympics; after the game, It&#39;s the loss of the game that leads to a sluggish state, and the confusion of not knowing where to start. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After research, the national team coaching staff decided to split the &quot;IELTS&quot; first. Huang Yaqiong recalled that before the split, her coach had a long talk with her and asked her to think carefully, &quot;You will be 30 years old in the next Olympics. Do you have the courage to persist until then?&quot; She replied firmly: &quot;I think Fight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/F7DnixpOVw6WJSVIW2BjNTTIdlJPz5rWfZTojIrR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960 &quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/F7DnixpOVw6WJSVIW2BjNTTIdlJPz5rWfZTojIrR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253364&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 6, 2023, in the badminton mixed doubles semi-finals of the Hangzhou Asian Games, South Korean combination Seo Seung-jae and Chae Yoo-jung (right) competed&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two entered winter training with Zhang Shuxian and Ou Xuanyi respectively. Before the start of the new season, Zheng Siwei/Zhang Shuxian won the first place in the team&#39;s round-robin competition, but they were eliminated in the first round of the German Open. Huang Yaqiong and Ou Xuanyi, who performed averagely in the round-robin competition, entered the finals and finished second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the low ranking of the new combination and the ineligibility to register for high-level tours, the IELTS combination was briefly reorganized at the All England Open in March 2022. Facing the not-so-strong French player in the first round, the two fought hard for three games and won. After the game, Yaqiong said to Si Si: &quot;Why is the game a bit tight?&quot; Si Si answered frankly: &quot;I feel a little lack of confidence.&quot; After several efforts, they broke into the semi-finals and reunited with Wang Yilu/Huang Dongping, but Still failed to achieve a breakthrough, lost 1:2 and missed the finals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yaqiong believes that she can clearly feel that her old partner is always short of breath and has no confidence. &quot;It&#39;s rare to see his mind in this state on the court. He used to be positive and dominate the game on the court. In the first game, I noticed that he was not as determined as before, and he couldn&#39;t handle the ball easily. No. Like his usual style.&quot; Zheng Siwei felt the change in Huang Yaqiong: &quot;My confidence was very low at the time, but Yaqiong was very different from before. She took the initiative to encourage me and was able to completely stabilize the situation on the court.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;After the All England Championships, Zheng Siwei&#39;s injury relapsed and it was difficult to walk. &quot;My style of play is very taxing on the body and ability. Now that my legs are not good, how can I still play? If I want to continue playing, I must improve (condition), maintain (strength), and practice more. However, practicing more will conflict with injuries. , it felt like the sky was falling.&quot; He recalled the dilemma he faced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coach asked them for their opinions on registration for the Asian Championship pairing. Zheng Siwei said: &quot;I still choose Yaqiong. From that time, we have already confirmed the pairing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After that, it was the familiar 30-game winning streak script. Before the 2022 World Championships, the two were worried about whether they would waste all their good luck in the previous open competitions, fearing that they would be worse in the big competition. Because I had been on a &quot;round trip&quot; before, I felt a little bit confused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They had a bye in the first round of the World Championships. When they debuted, they encountered a fierce blockage from the young Thai combination Supac/Supisara and lost the second game 19-21. The decisive game was once trailing 13-17. Huang Yaqiong said in an interview after the game: &quot;When we were behind 13-17, we got a point and caught up to 14-17. It was my turn to serve and I felt that my heart had settled down. After the game, my thinking also told me, That&#39;s when he felt very stable and we had no problem.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, they made it all the way and won their third World Championship title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/q6ClwTmtLd2PPYA47BtYXXFOGeavF1GnEL6mJtwP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;596&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/q6ClwTmtLd2PPYA47BtYXXFOGeavF1GnEL6mJtwP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253362&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 6, 2023, in the badminton mixed doubles semifinals of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese combination Zheng Siwei (left) and Huang Yaqiong (right) defeated the South Korean combination Seo Seungjae 2-1 , Cai Youjing, advanced to the finals &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of coach Yang Ming, the reorganized &quot;IELTS&quot; has reached another level : &quot;It was a good thing for them to be separated for a while. The two of them joined forces again and both have grown more than before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yaqiong recalled that the two would argue endlessly when they had differences before, but in the end there was no result. Now Zheng Siwei will listen to her opinions and try together to see whose method is more effective. Zheng Siwei believes that Huang Yaqiong is &quot;better able to handle it.&quot; &quot;The main feature and score of our combination lies in me. In the past, she would be affected by my poor condition, make mistakes together, and have a series of negative reactions. But now, no matter what I do, Yaqiong can handle it. I&#39;m good, She is better; I am worse, she can stand up... Maybe it is because since we cooperated, we have always been better in good times than in bad times, and we have not had much deliberation on how to solve problems in adversity. If we had not separated in those three months, we would still have been together. Continuing to hold it together and work together may have negative effects. It seems that we can&#39;t solve this kind of thing together. Once we get over this emotion in a new environment and new partners, we may not need to solve it in particular when we come back.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With such a process from the bottom to the top, fans still have full confidence in them despite their anxiety about the two losing streak. Therefore, whether Seo Seung Jae/Chae Yoo Jung will win or lose in the semifinals of this Asian Games has become an important battle for whether the &quot;IELTS combination&quot; can overcome the psychological barrier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the game, the &quot;IELTS combination&quot; failed to find a rhythm and had no effective scoring methods, and lost the first game 13-21. In the second game, &quot;Yasi&quot; actively adjusted and entered the defense by taking the initiative to pick the ball, looking for counterattack opportunities in the multi-shot stalemate, and regained the game 21-15. In the deciding game, &quot;IELTS&quot; fell behind 2-6 at first, but took the lead before 11 points. After that, &quot;Yasi&quot; played more resolutely and put all the pressure on his opponent. The opponent became tighter and tighter, making consecutive mistakes such as serving the ball and hitting the ball out of bounds. 21-16, they finally got what they wanted. After scoring the winning point, Zheng Siwei couldn&#39;t help but roar.

Zheng Siwei said that the fight to the end was no longer a purely technical and tactical contest, but more of a psychological contest.

The Israeli intelligence system, which was once considered the most sophisticated, was completely unaware of the opponent&#39;s large-scale war preparations; the Israel Defense Forces, known for its elite, was completely unprepared and was caught off guard; and the once effective social &quot;militia&quot; The &quot;system&quot; (employing troops among the people) also failed to give full play to the rapid response effect in the previous &quot;Middle East wars&quot;, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Throughout the day, the two sides fought inextricably, and another powder keg started to smoke. Human society is really in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During dinner, I received a message from a friend in Canada: Due to this conflict, his Jewish community will raise more than 13.6 million Canadian dollars to aid Jewish compatriots, and his family will spread it to Nearly 550,000 Canadian dollars (approximately equivalent to 2.9 million yuan). very scary! Why do you want so much money? After some communication, I learned some little secrets of today’s Jewish community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This friend married a Jewish woman, gave birth to three children, was accepted as a Jew, and moved into a Jewish community in Canada consisting of 98 Jewish households. Jewish social rules are very special: they are based on matrilineal descent, and children born from the marriage of a foreign man to a Jewish woman are accepted as Jews. Children born from marriage between foreign women and Jewish men are not considered Jews, but only foreigners with Jewish genes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;New families entering the Jewish community, including foreign men who marry them, can enjoy the benefits of the community and must also assume the community&#39;s covenant obligations, including: infrastructure maintenance, cleaning, night shift duty, and security Services, school children&#39;s education, scholarships, religious services, psychological help, poverty relief, etc. A friend said: His children receive tens of thousands of Canadian dollars in scholarships and various benefits from the community every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the wool comes from the sheep. These benefits are not provided by the Canadian government, but are raised by their small Jewish community. Specifically: each family in the community has to pay a share of 165,000 Canadian dollars (approximately equivalent to 875,000 yuan) per year, and 1,600 per year. More than 10,000 Canadian dollars are the community&#39;s common fund to provide community survival operations, repairs and updates, security services, and mutual assistance. Equivalent to owner-operated properties, cleaning, security, social security, churches, teaching assistants and many other institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This community mutual fund is managed and paid by the rabbi. All accounts are open to all families and every member of the community. Decisions are made at community meetings, so there is no corruption or waste. This is a tradition and skill developed by the Jewish people who are good at financial management for thousands of years. Only by shrewdly watching their own money and not being misappropriated by power can each individual ensure that the wealth of the entire group and society is protected from theft and corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jewish Community Mutual Fund also has a high-value internal resource: teaching assistants. It is not a supplementary lesson, but a thinking course outside of school teaching. There are Jewish &quot;wise men&quot; who preside over the cultivation of children&#39;s values, ways of thinking, and methodology training... among which &quot;Tanach&quot; and &quot;Talmud&quot; are very important. The result is that Jewish children have great advantages in academics and business, Indians are good at being professional managers, and Jewish young people are better at cutting-edge high-tech, financial elites and startup company bosses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jewish households in this community all have high incomes and live in single-family houses with large yards and swimming pools. But even so, not every household can pay the full amount of 165,000 Canadian dollars every year. The community&#39;s approach is: those with money contribute money, those with power contribute, and those with talents contribute people, which is converted into a certain workload to undertake the above-mentioned community services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That friend’s father-in-law and brother-in-law are expanding a new Jewish community in Perth, Western Australia. In this emergency, there was no contribution or help, so friends contributed three contributions of about 550,000 Canadian dollars. From now on, how they settle their own accounts is their family matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to cultural genes and historical reasons, Jews advocate autonomy based on identification with Jewish religious and cultural traditions. Therefore, this small community with only 98 households and less than 500 people actually has its own self-defense force. Most young people in their teens to early twenties like to dance with guns and sticks. In Canada, where gun control is lax, they are equipped with real guns and live ammunition. In addition to the guns provided by each household, part of the community&#39;s common fund has a security fund every year that is used to purchase long guns and ammunition. In the photos my friend showed me, there is even a 12.7mm &quot;Barrett&quot; heavy weapon. spy. The community organizes military training for young people every year, but these powerful spears are usually locked in the arsenal to prevent accidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This small Jewish community has less than 500 people, but it has more than 400 guns, short guns, long guns, shotguns... nearly every person has one, and the number is increasing every year. They joked: Who can use it again? Dare to slaughter the Jews? Come and try? Having said that, my friend said that at community meetings, the most controversial topic is still the cost of security. Many families think that some self-defense capabilities are enough. After all, this is not a war period, and Canada is not a war zone. There is no need for every household to pay for it every year. It&#39;s a waste of money to allow dozens of stupid boys and crazy girls to fire tens of thousands of bullets every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, these spontaneous martial arts training among civilians are not completely useless. After the early morning raid on October 7, many young people from Jewish communities in the United States, Canada, Australia and other places took flights to Israel that night to prepare to join the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jews are a very small ethnic group, with only 25 million people including those of mixed race, accounting for only 3‰ of the global population today. Due to their cultural and traditional characteristics, they like the financial industry and academic industry. This ethnic group is too rich, and it is not that they are &quot;rich no more than three generations&quot;. Instead, the generations of children they have raised have been too successful in academics and business, occupying the There are too many high-level jobs, high salaries, and high profits, and such a small population cannot build a large empire or form a million-strong army to protect itself. Therefore, the survival wisdom and organizational order that the Jewish community today has explored, which is what Hayek calls &quot;spontaneous order&quot;, are the adaptive choices of groups and individuals in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 08 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[决赛直落三局，中国女排击败日本队第九次登上亚运冠军领奖台]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258263]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-08 18:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 7, 2023, the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team captain Yuan Xinyue hit the ball during the game.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/f23a79e4e4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/f23a79e4e4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253420&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, Yuan Xinyue, captain of the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team, hit the ball during the game. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, 2023, the Hangzhou Asian Games women&#39;s volleyball final was held at the gymnasium of the Cangqian Campus of Hangzhou Normal University.

The glorious moment when the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team returns to its peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she often feels that she is not good enough. “Because of Zhu Ting, Zhang Changning, and (Li) Yingying, they can support several points of offense and defense, help me share and involve the opponent in blocking. People&#39;s energy. When I don&#39;t have them, how should I play by myself? I think this ability should be improved a bit.&quot; Yuan Xinyue has been the main secondary attacker in the team, and blocking is one of the primary responsibilities of the secondary attacker. For a while, she was criticized for her poor blocking ability. &quot;I think blocking is quite difficult, because it is not only a passive way to be beaten, but also an event that requires you to actively find rhythm and timing.&quot; She realized that blocking was her shortcoming. Later, Yuan Xinyue made up her mind to improve her blocking skills through hard training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2019 Women&#39;s Volleyball World Cup, when the Chinese Women&#39;s Volleyball Team faced off against the Brazilian Women&#39;s Volleyball Team, deputy attacker Yuan Xinyue scored 26 points and scored 7 points in personal blocking. Together with Zhu Ting, she became the leading scorer in the match. She set the record for the highest points scored by a Chinese women&#39;s volleyball attacker in a single game in a World Series in the more than 20 years since the implementation of the per-goal scoring system in volleyball matches in January 1999. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/CeQQzOmeOjYPatJMASWqi3dK8K47549kdSWwI0Gn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;705&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/CeQQzOmeOjYPatJMASWqi3dK8K47549kdSWwI0Gn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253375&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 7, 2023, in the women&#39;s volleyball final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team 3-0.

Although the women&#39;s volleyball girls later missed the Tokyo Olympics, the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball team&#39;s several ups and downs in the past 40 years perfectly interpreted the spirit of the women&#39;s volleyball team. As Lang Ping said: &quot;The spirit of the women&#39;s volleyball team is not to win the championship, but to try your best sometimes when you know you can&#39;t win. Even if you stagger along the way, stand up and shake off the dust on your body, and your eyes will still be firm. As long as you can&#39;t be beaten to death Me, I will fight with you to the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Win the Championship&quot; released in 2020 records the bumpy journey of Lang Ping re-coaching the national team and the women&#39;s volleyball team returning to the top of the Olympics after 12 years. The film completely restored the scene of the women&#39;s volleyball girls winning the championship in Rio. Yuan Xinyue also participated in the production of the film.

According to Thai official statistics, the total number of Chinese tourists in Thailand in the first eight months of 2023 was 2.1 million, less than one-fifth of the total number of Chinese tourists to Thailand in 2019.

Like many tourists, Kark was attracted by the convenience brought by Thailand&#39;s new visa-free policy and chose it as a destination for the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kark originally planned to fly from Hong Kong to Bangkok on October 3, stay in a hotel less than two kilometers away from the crime scene, and go shopping at Paragon in the afternoon. Kark escaped a disaster only by postponing his trip for a day because he had an impromptu dinner party with friends in Hong Kong. &quot;I was planning to buy bags at Paragon on the afternoon of the 3rd. Later I read media reports and found that the murderer fired the first shot in the toilet next to that store. This is a sign from God, telling me not to go to this country.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When he saw the news, Kark, who was staying in Hong Kong, fell into anxiety and fear: the danger might be just a coincidence away from him. When he applied for a refund from the travel platform, he was rejected by the airline on the grounds of &quot;non-force majeure&quot;. In order not to waste more than 3,000 yuan in round-trip air tickets, Kark adopted a compromise plan: after landing in Bangkok on the 4th, he immediately transferred to Phuket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kark admitted that traveling has become unnerving. Before the shooting, Kark could still remain calm: public opinion had exaggerated the probability of fraud and crime in Thailand, and his parents&#39; strong opposition could not stop him from visiting Thailand. Now, at the sparsely populated Suvarnabhumi International Airport, he feels danger looming around him. The body is in Thailand, but the soul longs to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar troubles also appeared for Li Ping. After his application for cancellation of air tickets was blocked, he canceled his plan to stay in Bangkok for two days and went straight to Pattaya after arriving at Bangkok Airport on the 5th. In this resort, which is famous for its lively night market, Li Ping has been staying at the hotel since 6 p.m. &quot;I want to go out but I am worried about my personal safety and dare not go.&quot; When he went out during the day and heard many people speaking Chinese around him, He felt at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/KXTm6Ii5XcR5YJlHn8S7HbnjGqU0PgDsABqQf3My.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/KXTm6Ii5XcR5YJlHn8S7HbnjGqU0PgDsABqQf3My.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253370&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 5, 2023, in Bangkok, Thailand, the police raided a house and a forensic examiner was looking at the gun parts on display&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Out-of-control gun&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The safety issue of outbound travel has become an important consideration for many tourists to Thailand that goes beyond cost-effectiveness.

A real gun with bullets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police found that the suspect contacted a merchant who illegally sold guns and ammunition through the Internet, and spent 17,000 baht (approximately RMB 3,259) to directly purchase blank guns and 9mm real ammunition from the other party. Although blank guns and BB guns can be transformed into lethal weapons by replacing the barrel, because they are considered &quot;imitation guns&quot;, according to Thai law, the possession of such guns does not require registration like the possession of real guns. Due to the lack of regulation, imitation guns are more convenient to circulate than real guns and can be easily purchased online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/kM2XN3crvGbSAomd8X24a49CuuXiQcBSGDbkpmQT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;598&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/kM2XN3crvGbSAomd8X24a49CuuXiQcBSGDbkpmQT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253368&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, the police arrested a shooting suspect in Bangkok, Thailand.

In 2019, the number of gun-related deaths in Thailand was 2,804, and the gun homicide rate was 3.91 per 100,000. This data also ranked second among ASEAN countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, Fireworks and Imitation Guns Law&quot; promulgated by Thailand sets relatively severe penalties for illegal gun possession: up to 10 years in prison, 20,000 baht (approximately RMB 3,930) Yuan) fine. However, the implementation of the law is limited. Of all the guns in Thailand, 40% are still illegally held and unregistered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the New York Times, Quaglia, CEO of the Bangkok-based risk assessment company PQA, said that gun control in Thailand &quot;doesn&#39;t exist&quot; and &quot;there is no need to register a gun at all.&quot; No effort required.

Among them, short-term plans include: prohibiting the approval of new import licenses for imitation guns, adding registration requirements for the possession of imitation guns, and stopping the issuance of new gun business licenses. Long-term plans include: mandating gun applicants to provide health certificates of mental status, excluding blank guns and BB guns from the imitation gun category, and requiring gun owners to register bullet information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/QDHytCZBdmWPy9xG360HZwJ3qRPzYKTylg88R6Do.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/08/QDHytCZBdmWPy9xG360HZwJ3qRPzYKTylg88R6Do.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, the police found a pistol at the crime scene at Siam Paragon, a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua Social/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Tourism Impact&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the shooting incident, Thai Prime Minister Seetha apologized to the Chinese Ambassador to Thailand and visited the Chinese injured.

Establish and improve the regular evaluation and exit mechanism for special transfer payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the local tax system must be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In conjunction with the implementation of the reform of central and local revenue division, we will study and adjust the collection links of some consumption tax items and the attribution of revenue, and actively and steadily promote the reform of the local tax system. Adjust the tax system structure, cultivate local tax sources, strengthen local tax powers, and manage Following the relationship between taxes and fees, we will gradually establish a stable and sustainable local tax system.&quot; Liu Kun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the financial relationship between the central and local governments has lasted throughout Liu Kun’s five years as Secretary of the Party Leadership Group and Minister of the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, the State Council issued the &quot;Reform and Promotion Plan for Adjusting the Division of Central and Local Revenue after Implementing Larger-scale Tax and Fee Reductions&quot;, aiming to further rationalize the fiscal relationship between the central and local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan proposes to mobilize the enthusiasm of both the central and local governments, stabilize the overall pattern of revenue division between the central and local governments formed since the reform of the tax-sharing system, and consolidate the results of revenue division reforms such as the &quot;five-to-five sharing&quot; of value-added tax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adjust and improve the VAT excess credit refund sharing mechanism, establish a long-term mechanism for VAT excess credit refund, determine the tax refund scale based on the fiscal revenue situation, and keep the &quot;Fifth Five-Year Plan&quot; sharing ratio between the central and local governments unchanged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, some current consumption tax items levied in the production (import) link will gradually be moved to the wholesale or retail link to expand local revenue sources and guide local governments to improve the consumption environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, Liu Kun also gave a lecture entitled &quot;my country&#39;s Central and Local Financial Relations&quot; to the Standing Committee of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress, detailing the current status and future reforms of my country&#39;s central and local fiscal relations. direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Kun said that to further rationalize the fiscal relationship between the central and local governments, we must improve the local tax and direct tax systems, improve the revenue division model with shared taxes as the main body, and improve the common fiscal authority system, strengthen the central fiscal authority and Expenditure responsibility and other directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, Liu Kun wrote in an article published in &quot;Qiushi&quot; magazine that fiscal and taxation reforms are advancing in depth, further reforming the budget management system, and further promoting the division of financial powers and expenditure responsibilities between the central and local governments.

The contradiction between payment and financing has intensified, and debt risks are increasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2019, Liu Kun and the two vice ministers of the Ministry of Finance answered questions from domestic and foreign reporters around the theme of &quot;fiscal and taxation reform and fiscal work&quot;, during which they talked about the issue of local debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Of course I don&#39;t shy away from it. Some local governments use financing platform companies to illegally and illegally borrow debts in disguised forms beyond the legal limits. This is the so-called hidden debt of the government.&quot; Liu Kun emphasized, &quot;We Take strict measures to not allow the occurrence of new hidden debts, and require a steady settlement of existing debts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about how to resolve existing debts, Liu Kun said that he will insist that the central government will not bail out, and whoever raises the debt will be responsible. , to achieve &quot;Whose family&#39;s children will be held&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 2018, the Ministry of Finance began to establish a local implicit debt monitoring system to dynamically monitor the debt scale of each region. Beginning in 2019, a local government debt risk rating mechanism was established to classify local debt risks into four levels: red, orange, yellow, and green. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We must balance the relationship between promoting development and preventing risks, rationally arrange deficit, debt and expenditure policies, and do a solid job in resolving hidden debt risks of local governments.” At the beginning of 2021, Liu Kun was interviewed by Xinhua News Agency At the time, it was mentioned that the current local government debt risks in my country are generally controllable, but some areas are still adding hidden debts, and the debt repayment risks in individual areas have increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Kun said that putting a &quot;tightening ring&quot; on local government debt will create an additional &quot;safety valve&quot; for economic and social development. Next, the financial department will actively take measures such as &quot;opening the front door&quot; and &quot;blocking the back door&quot;, ensuring and regulating simultaneously, to further improve management, strengthen supervision, promote the &quot;sunshine&quot; of local government debt, and effectively cage debt risks. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, the third session of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress held its first plenary meeting in the Great Hall of the People.

The defendant Tang Hui was convicted of picking quarrels and provoking trouble and was sentenced to four years in prison.

Putting aside the elements of gossip, this matter is also worthy of analysis from a social and legal perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man who posted the complaint PPT claimed to work at an accounting firm in Shanghai, and the girl who was accused was a senior student at Xi&#39;an International Studies University. They began to fall in love at the end of 2022, but within nearly a year , this girl had an affair with two ex-boyfriends. The man believed that his girlfriend&#39;s &quot;cheating&quot; had seriously hurt his feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident spread widely on the Internet and caused many disputes among netizens. Some people think that it is a serious mistake for a girl to cheat on her boyfriend and cuckold her boyfriend; others say that the relationship between the two is just boyfriend and girlfriend, not husband and wife. What the girl does is not illegal, but making a PPT and distributing it on the Internet is an infringement of personal rights. Privacy Violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social networks, sexual incidents such as &quot;cheating&quot; and &quot;cheating&quot; naturally tend to attract great attention. But different situations do have different legal properties. Legally speaking, the Civil Code only stipulates that husband and wife have an obligation to be loyal to each other (this includes exclusiveness in relationships, sex, etc.), but there is no statutory obligation of loyalty between lovers. Therefore, if one party of a couple who has received a marriage certificate cheats on the couple, it is a clear violation of the law. There is no statutory obligation of loyalty between lovers, let alone the consequences of disloyalty. Love and feelings do not fall into the category of &quot;civil legal acts&quot; regulated by the civil law, and are not subject to the principle of &quot;good faith&quot; in the civil law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to statutory laws, there are also customary laws that regulate public social behavior, including public order and good customs, moral evaluation, etc. For couples who have established a romantic relationship, customary law also requires mutual fidelity. If either party commits betrayal, they should be subject to moral criticism and must return gifts, etc. The betrayed party also has the right to punish the betrayed party by disclosing the facts and using moral force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past, this kind of moral criticism was generally limited to acquaintances or relatively small circles such as communities, villages, and work units. Nowadays, with the development of social networks, such incidents may quickly spread throughout the entire network. The person being criticized will not only lose his reputation in a small circle, but may also be &quot;socially dead&quot; on the entire network. Moreover, moral criticism on the Internet may be more violent and direct than in a circle of acquaintances, and may even trigger a storm of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, if you post the other person&#39;s information on the Internet after being &quot;cheated&quot;, is it suspected of leaking personal information and infringing on privacy? There is no precedent for similar situations. In 2021, the incident of &quot;Female internet celebrity was accused by her CEO boyfriend in a 65-page PPT&quot; also became a hot topic on the Internet. In the end, the man was found by the police to have violated the Public Security Management Punishment Law by &quot;spreading other people&#39;s privacy&quot; and was administratively detained for 6 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the latest complaint PPT, the girl involved was not only named by name and identity, but also the girl’s student ID card, photos of her and her “cheating partner”, and the girl’s relationship with them Screenshot of chat history. This information may be considered personal privacy. Many legal practitioners have warned that this kind of &quot;exposing private information&quot; accusations may violate the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, there is another detail. The man who accused his college student girlfriend of cheating later issued a statement saying that he only sent the PPT he made to his girlfriend’s roommates and colleagues, hoping that they could persuade and educate him. . He did not post the documents on the public Internet and did not want the incident to spread further. If this is the case, all parties involved can call the police and ask the police to investigate clearly who posted the document on the public Internet, causing huge publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also worth noting that there is more than one similar case of online accusations of cheating. Some boyfriends accuse their girlfriends of cheating, and some girlfriends accuse their boyfriends of cheating. The discussion and evaluation of such issues cannot be treated differently because of the gender of the perpetrators. Women&#39;s privacy is privacy, and men&#39;s privacy is privacy. When a man posts a PPT to accuse his girlfriend of cheating, it is an invasion of privacy and should be punished. When a woman publicly accuses her boyfriend of cheating, it is also an invasion of privacy and should also be punished. For similar incidents, relevant departments should treat them equally and either punish them all or not at all. They cannot selectively enforce the law because of gender differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 08 Oct 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
